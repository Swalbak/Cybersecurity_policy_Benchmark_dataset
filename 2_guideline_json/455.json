It defines trust services for supporting  electronic signatures, electronic seals, electronic time stamps, electronic registered delivery services and  website authentication.  The eIDAS Regulation represented a big step forward in building a digital single market as it provides one  common legal framework for all parties relying or providing on those kind of services. Indeed, various  sectors of the economy (e.g. finance, banking, transport, insurance, health, sharing economy, trading, etc.)  where obligations exist for security, reliable identification, strong authentication, legal certainty of  evidences, will clearly be positively affected by the eIDAS Regulation. This latter will indeed allow citizens,  businesses and public administrations to meet such obligations for any (cross-border) electronic  transaction as they will now be able to use the recognised eID means and (qualified) trust services. In  particular, a qualified electronic time stamp shall enjoy, all over the EU, the presumption of the accuracy of  the date and the time it indicates and the integrity of the data to which the date and time are bound.  This document addresses qualified electronic time stamps and is one out of a series of five documents  which target to assist parties aiming to use qualified electronic signatures, seals, time stamps, eDelivery or  website authentication certificates to understand the subject correctly as-well-as the potential benefits,  amongst others, by giving examples of possible application. This series of documents also targets to give  those parties some advice on how to correctly use the related qualified trust services.  After explaining what a qualified electronic time stamp is and what properties/function it does and does  not provide, concrete examples of use are given for inspiration to the readers. Next to them, and as even  the most secure / trusted service becomes insecure and unreliable if not being integrated or used  correctly, some key recommendations are given for correct integration and use, pertaining:   Relying parties should look for the EU trust mark for qualified (time stamping) trust services when  selecting providers and should read the applicable terms and conditions, the policies and practices  used by the QTSP providing qualified time stamps.   Relying parties Look out for the accuracy of the qualified time stamp which must be of 1 second or  even better.   All scenarios where a QTSP providing qualified time stamps stores hashes of files or the files  themselves require strong guarantees with regards to the long term permanency and solvency of  the QTSP.   Applicable terms and conditions, the policies and practices used by the QTSP to provide its  qualified time stamps should be available from the “TSP information URI”.   For obtaining a proof of sending/receipt, use qualified electronic delivery services that includes  qualified time stamps embedded in such a proof.   For obtaining a proof of origin on the time stamped data, use qualified electronic signature as a  natural person (or qualified electronic seal as a legal person) as such signature (seal) may be  combined with the use of qualified time stamp.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  07  1. Introduction  General context/the eIDAS Regulation on eID and trust services  Regulation (EU) No 910/20141 (hereafter the eIDAS2 Regulation), on electronic identification and trust  services for electronic transactions in the internal market, provides a predictable regulatory environment  for electronic identification and a set of electronic trust services, namely electronic signatures, seals, time  stamps, registered delivery services and certificates for website authentication3.  It is possible to use these trust services as well as electronic documents as evidence in legal proceedings in  all EU Member States contributing to their general cross-border use. Courts (or other bodies in charge of  legal proceedings) cannot discard them as evidence only  because they are electronic but have to assess these  electronic tools in the same way they would do for their  paper equivalent.  Whether you a large company, a SME or a citizen willing  to complete an electronic transaction in another EU  country, e.g. submit a call for tender or register as a  student in another EU Member State (MS), besides  reducing time and costs, the eIDAS Regulation will ensure  cross-border recognition of national eID and electronic  trust services supporting your electronic transaction. Hence it will boost trust, security and convenience.  Since 1 July 2016, most provisions of the eIDAS Regulation are directly applicable in the 28 EU Member  States’ legal framework overcoming problems of fragmented national regimes. It provides legal certainty  and fosters the usage of eID means and electronic trust services for online access and online transactions  at EU level.  The eIDAS Regulation will ensure that people and businesses can use their national eIDs to access public  services in other EU countries where eIDs are required for such an access at national level. It also creates  an EU wide internal market for electronic trust services by ensuring their recognition and workability  across borders and are considered equivalent to traditional paper based processes.  Opportunities brought by eIDAS Regulation  The opportunities reside in leveraging eID and electronic trust services as key enablers for making cross- border electronic transactions more secure, more convenient, trustworthy and benefiting from legal  certainty.  The broader adoption of EU-wide recognised eID means and of electronic trust services will facilitate and  boost the digital transformation of organisations, be it public administrations or businesses, enhance  1 Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic  identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC.  OJ L 257, 28.8.2014, p. 73–114.  2 See Glossary.  3 See Glossary or Art.3.16 of the eIDAS Regulation for the definition of trust services.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/ES/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  08  customer experience, improve the security of electronic transactions and stimulate the provisioning of  new and innovative services.  To this end, a large number of sectors (e.g. finance, banking, transport, insurance, health, sharing  economy, trading, etc.) where obligations exist for security, reliable identification, strong authentication,  legal certainty of evidences, will be  positively affected. The eIDAS  Regulation will indeed allow citizens,  businesses and public administrations  to conveniently meet such obligations  for any cross-border electronic  transaction using the eID means and  (qualified) trust services of their  choice. Without undergoing identity  verification based on physical  presence, but by using MS notified eID  means of a level “high”, one should  for example be able to use public  services in another country or banks  may accept such eID to open a bank  account4.  By relying on a qualified  electronic registered delivery service,  one will benefit, all over the EU, from  the presumption of the integrity of  the registered data, the sending of  that data by the identified sender, its receipt by the identified addressee and the accuracy of the date and  time of sending and receipt indicated by that qualified trust service.  Specific role of the qualified trust services  To further enhance in particular the trust of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and consumers in  the internal market and to promote the use of trust services and products, the eIDAS Regulation  introduces the notions of qualified trust service and qualified trust service provider with a view to  indicating requirements and obligations that ensure high-level security of whatever qualified trust service  or product is used or provided and, as a consequence, are granted a higher presumption of their legal  effect.  Therefore, when looking for trust services, selecting qualified ones ensures benefiting from a high level of  security and legal certainty of trust services. E.g., qualified electronic time stamp shall enjoy, all over the  EU, the presumption of the accuracy of the date and the time it indicates and the integrity of the data to  which the date and time are bound.  Initiation and supervision of qualified trust services  In order to ensure high-level security of qualified trust services, the eIDAS Regulation foresees an active  supervision scheme of qualified trust service providers (QTSP) and qualified trust services (QTS) they  4 National legislations on prevention of money laundering may currently may force identity verification to be based  on physical presence. Furthermore, the use by the private sector of electronic identification means under a notified  scheme is on a voluntarily basis only (see Recital 17 of the eIDAS Regulation).  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  09  provide (hereafter referred to as a QTSP/QTS) by the national competent supervisory body (SB) that  supervises, ex ante and ex post, fulfilment of the QTSP/QTS requirements and obligations5. All those  requirements must be met by the QTSP/QTS before providing the very first qualified trust service output,  e.g. before issuing the very first qualified time stamp in the case of QTSP providing qualified time stamping  services.  Before a TSP/TS is granted a qualified status (QTSP/QTS), it will be subject to a pre-authorisation process –  the so-called initiation process. QTSPs may only begin to provide the qualified trust service after the  qualified status has been granted by the competent supervisory body and indicated in the national trusted  list6. From there, the supervision scheme covers the full life cycle of each QTS and each QTSP, from its  genesis until its termination.  In practice, where TSPs, without qualified status, intend to start providing qualified trust services, they  shall submit to the supervisory body a notification of their intention together with a conformity  assessment report issued by an “eIDAS” accredited conformity assessment body. Before notifying the  competent supervisory body of their intention to start providing qualified trust services, the future  QTSP/QTS must hence successfully pass an external assessment (audit) to confirm it fulfils the eIDAS  requirements. That audit must be conducted by a conformity assessment body specifically accredited to  carry out assessments of QTSP/QTS. The audit results in a formal conformity statement confirming - if such  is the case - that the QTSP/QTS meets all the applicable requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. Based on  the notified information including the report of such an audit, the competent SB will formally verify that  the candidate QTSP/QTS meets the applicable eIDAS requirements and, in case of positive verification, it  will undertake the publication of the grant of the qualified status for that QTSP/QTS in the national trusted  list.  It is only when its qualified status is published in the corresponding national trusted list that the QTSP/QTS  is authorised to provide the corresponding QTS.  Note: A TSP cannot be qualified without providing at least one qualified trust service (cfr Art.3.20 of  the eIDAS Regulation). A TSP is granted a qualified status separately for each type of qualified trust  service covered by the eIDAS Regulation. E.g. a QTSP qualified for the provisioning of qualified  certificates for electronic signatures is not per se granted a qualified status for the issuance of  qualified time stamps; it must first complete the full pre-authorisation process and have its granted  qualified status for the provision of qualified time stamp published explicitly in the national trusted  list before issuing qualified time stamps in addition to the provision of qualified certificates for  electronic signatures. There are nine different types of QTSs defined by the eIDAS Regulation for  which a qualified status is granted separately: provision of qualified certificates for electronic  signatures, provision of qualified certificates for electronic seals, provision of qualified certificates for  website authentication, qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures, qualified  preservation service for qualified electronic seals, qualified validation service for qualified electronic  signatures, qualified validation service for qualified electronic seals, qualified electronic time stamps  services, and qualified electronic registered delivery services.7  5 See glossary  6 See glossary.  7 See Annex A.7 for further details.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  10  For marketing purposes, once qualified, a QTSP/QTS may use the EU Trust Mark for qualified trust services  when promoting its QTS. That trust mark shown in Figure 1 can only be used by a QTSP to “label” its QTS. It  can be used on any support provided it meets requirements from Art.23 of the eIDAS Regulation (e.g. a link  to the corresponding national trusted list where consumers may verify the granted qualified status must  be displayed on the QTSP’s website) and rules of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/806.8  Basically, this secondary legislation sets the form, colour and size of the EU trust mark, sets the obligation  to clearly indicate the qualified services that the EU trust mark pertains to, and allows association with  other graphical or textual elements provided that certain conditions are met.9  Figure 1: EU trust mark for qualified trust services  The use of the EU trust mark, which is voluntary, aims to foster transparency of the market and help  consumers distinguishing between qualified trust services and non-qualified ones.  Once granted a qualified status, QTSPs and their QTSs have the obligation to pass, and submit the  competent supervisory body with a two-yearly conformity assessment report (CAR) issued by an  accredited CAB confirming that the QTSP and the QTSs it provides fulfil the requirements laid down in the  Regulation. Competent supervisory bodies are also allowed, at their own discretion and at any time, to  audit themselves any QTSP/QTS for which they are competent or to request an accredited CAB to perform  an ad hoc audit.  QTSPs and their QTSs are supervised for their entire lifecycle, from their genesis to their termination. In  particular, in order to ensure sustainability and durability of QTSs, as well as to ensure proper termination  and user’s confidence in their provision, QTSPs must maintain, at all times, an up-to-date termination plan.  That plan is to be agreed by the SB upon initiation and regularly checked for compliance during the life of  the QTSP/QTS.  A focus on qualified electronic time stamps  An internationally recognized time-scale is a necessity in today’s society. The Coordinated Universal Time  (UTC) currently fulfils this function and is legally recognised in many countries. Electronic time stamps are  valuable tool sin the context of electronic transactions where the date plays a significant role in the  verification and authentication process of various  events, data, documents, agreements or  certificates. It is a kind of time attestation in  electronic form which binds whatever kind of  electronic data to a particular time establishing  evidence that the latter data existed at that time.  8 Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/806 of 22 May 2015 laying down specifications relating to the form  of the EU trust mark for qualified trust services (Text with EEA relevance).

Qualified electronic time stamps shall enjoy, all  over the EU, the presumption of the accuracy of the date and the time it indicates and the integrity of the  data to which the date and time are bound.  Scope of the present document and relationship with other recommendations  This document proposes security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps. It  aims to support relying parties and end users of qualified electronic time stamping services to securely use  these services.  The target audience of the document are end users and relying parties of qualified electronic time  stamping services. This could comprise individuals, businesses and public administrations. For example, it  could be a public administration that wishes to use a (qualified) electronic seal and a qualified electronic  time stamp for its electronic interactions with citizens, and which would like to ensure it is utilizing these  services:   In compliance with the eIDAS Regulation.   In a proper and secure manner that guarantees that the security properties of the service are  being maintained.  The present document is organised to provide information and guidance with regards to the following  aspects of qualified electronic time stamp:   What is it?   What key properties it provides?   What properties it cannot provide?   What are the potential use cases?   What are the usage best practices?   Example of tools & practical usage aspects.  Four other linked documents propose security guidelines on the appropriate use respectively of qualified  electronic signatures, qualified electronic seals, qualified electronic registered delivery and qualified  website authentication certificates.10  Although each of these qualified trust services share some technical backgrounds or tools and thus provide  some common functionalities, such as illustrated below, each of them has its own objectives and core  functionalities as summarised in the following table:  10 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services/qualified-trust-services.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services/qualified-trust-services  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  12  Trust Service Data Integrity Confidentiality  Authenticates  Origin  (Natural Person)  Authenticates  Origin  (Legal Person)  Authenticates  Time  QTS        QES        QESeal        QWAC        QeDel     *     *not a core functionality but is usually provided as part of a greater solution  Table 1: Comparative table of functionalities offered by the various types of qualified trust services  .

Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  13  2. Qualified electronic time stamp – what is it?  Official time  Since the end of the 19th century, an internationally recognised time-scale as a basis of time measurement,  has become a true necessity in civil society. The Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), the time-scale provided  by the BIPM (Bureau International des Poids et Mesures - International Bureau for Weights and Measures),  currently fulfils this function and is widely used as the basis of legal time around the world.  Note: Standard time divides the world into 24 “time zones”, each one covering, in theory at least, 15  degrees. All clocks within one of those time zones should be set to the same time. Greenwich Mean  Time (GMT), a time measurement based on Earth rotation, was initially used to determine the  standard time for each zone. For most practical purposes UTC, the modern successor of GMT, is  equivalent to mean solar time at the prime meridian (0°). More specifically, UTC is a compromise  between the highly stable atomic time (TAI - Temps Atomique International) and solar time derived  from the irregular Earth rotation (related to the Greenwich mean sidereal time (GMST) by a  conventional relationship) UTC forms the basis of a coordinated dissemination of standard  frequencies and time signals. It corresponds exactly in rate with TAI but differs from it by an integer  number of seconds. The full definition of UTC is contained in Recommendation ITU-R TF.460-6 [1].  Electronic time stamp  An electronic time stamp is a piece of data in electronic form which binds other electronic data to a  particular time establishing evidence that these data existed at that time.  Figure 3: Examples of “paper-based” time stamps  An electronic time stamp aims to achieve the same goal as a “paper based” time stamp, i.e. establishing  that a document, sending, or act has been established before or at a specific date and time.  Obtaining a time stamp on an electronic document usually consists in sending a hash value11 of a file to a  time stamp service (e.g. server) from time stamp service provider, for example via Internet. The time  11 See glossary.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  14  stamp service adds the current date & time, signs it or seals it and sends back the signed/sealed time  stamp to the requester.  Figure 2: High level overview of the time stamp process flow  The time stamp, i.e. the signed/sealed combination of the hash of the document and date & time, proves  that the hashed document and its content existed at that date & time. The time stamp service provider  ensures that the clock used for time stamping is correctly synchronised with UTC.  Variants include sending the file (document) directly to the time stamp service provider, not just the hash  of it. The service provider does not only time stamp the file but also archives the file and sends the  requester an acknowledgement of receipt.  Note: As a standard best practice, a time stamp includes a reference to a time stamping policy, i.e. a  document disclosing information on the rules and practices followed by the time stamp service  provider when creating such a time stamp. This is particularly relevant to the requester and/or the  verifier of a time stamp, when referring to the general terms & conditions and policies/practices  documents of the provider to determine the level of quality, security an accuracy of the service and of  the time stamp (e.g. an accuracy of 1 second, or worse or better).  Qualified electronic time stamp  The service consisting in the creation and provision of time stamps is a trust service, i.e. electronic service  that enhances trust and confidence in electronic transactions.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  15  The eIDAS Regulation introduces the notions of qualified trust services and qualified trust service provider  with a view to indicating requirements and obligations that ensure high-level security of whatever  qualified trust services and products are used or provided.  When looking for trust services, selecting qualified ones ensures benefiting from a high level of security  and legal certainty of trust services. Qualified electronic time stamp enjoy, all over the EU, the  presumption of the accuracy of the date and the time it indicates and the integrity of the data to which the  date and time are bound.  A qualified time stamp, as specified by the eIDAS Regulation, must be based on an accurate time source  linked to Coordinated Universal Time (i.e. the clock used for time stamping is correctly synchronised with  UTC) and bind the date and time to the time stamped data in such a manner as to reasonably preclude the  possibility of the data being changed undetectably (i.e. data integrity is maintained). It must also be signed  using an advanced electronic signature or sealed with an advanced electronic seal12 of the qualified trust  service provider, or by some equivalent method. That advanced electronic signature or seal, when based  on PKI-based cryptography will actually ensure proof of integrity of the time stamped data in situation  illustrated in Figure 2.  Note: A trust service provider (TSP) providing time-stamping services to the public, is called a time  stamping authority (TSA). The TSA has overall responsibility for the provision of its time stamping  services, covering the operation of one or more time stamping units (TSUs) which are the technical  server that create and sign the time stamps on behalf of the TSA. Each and every time stamp should  identify the responsible TSA through its signature.  12 See Glossary.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  16  3. Qualified electronic time stamp – what key properties does it  provide?  Legal properties  Legal presumption of the accuracy of the date and time of the stamped data & integrity of that data  From a legal point of view, the accuracy of the date and time in a qualified time stamp and the integrity of  the corresponding time stamped data are legally presumed and recognised as such all over the EU.  Security properties  Accuracy of the date and time  The accuracy of the date and the time indicated in a qualified time stamp is ensured.  Data integrity  The integrity of the data to which the date and time are bound in a qualified time stamp is ensured via the  hash value and the signature/seal on the time stamp. In other words, it is guaranteed that any alteration  to the time stamped data can be detected.  The integrity of the qualified time stamp itself is ensured via the electronic signature or seal of the  qualified time stamp provider.  Functional properties  Date and time attestation  From a functional point of view, a qualified electronic time stamp is a kind of time attestation in electronic  form which binds whatever kind of electronic data to a particular time establishing evidence that the latter  data existed at that time.  Identification of the qualified time stamp provider  Furthermore, as a qualified time stamp needs to be signed using an advanced electronic signature or  sealed with an advanced electronic seal of the qualified trust service provider, or by some equivalent  method, the qualified time stamp itself:  - Allows the identification of the qualified trust service provider to which it is uniquely linked, and  - Is also protected for integrity as the time stamp is signed/sealed in such a way that any subsequent  change in the time stamp itself is detectable.  The identification of the qualified trust service provider having issued the qualified time stamp is provided  by the certificate supporting the validation of the advanced electronic signature or seal of the qualified  time stamp provider. The QTSP name, its postal and electronic address can in fine be found in the national  trusted list when validating the qualified status of the time stamp and of its provider.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  17  4.  Qualified electronic time stamp – what properties can it not  provide?  No prevention of document alteration  While a qualified time stamp guarantees that any alteration to the time stamped data can be detected, it  provides no guarantee that such alteration will not happen. In other words, it does not prevent any  alteration on the content of the time stamped document, but it allows detecting any alteration once it is  time stamped.  Confidentiality  A qualified time stamp provides no guarantee that the time stamped data will remain confidential when  sent over to recipients.  There is however no need to disclose the data to be time stamped towards the time stamp provider as the  time stamp request is only including a hash value of that data.  No proof of sending/receipt  The qualified time stamp provides no guarantee that the time stamped document has been effectively  sent to a certain recipient or has been received by a certain recipient. Those guarantees must be explicitly  provided in addition to the security and legal properties provided by the qualified time stamp.  Note: For obtaining a proof of sending/receipt, a user should subscribe to qualified electronic delivery  services that includes qualified time stamps embedded in such a proof.  No proof of origin on the time stamped data  The qualified time stamp provides no guarantee that the time stamped document origins from a certain  party (no p roof of origin of the document).  Note: For obtaining a proof of origin on the time stamped data, a user should create a qualified  electronic signature as a natural person (or qualified electronic seal as a legal person) as such signature  (seal) may be combined with the use of qualified time stamp.

Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  19  5. Qualified electronic time stamp – what are the potential use cases?  Overview and context of the given examples  In general and to put (qualified) electronic time stamps in context, they are most often seen coming in  addition to electronic signatures.  Indeed, when advanced/qualified electronic signatures are  implemented, the sole creation of the signature by the signer of a file, document or data does not make it  possible to tell when the signature was created.  Moreover, and often forgotten, without such a time indication, it is not possible to verify that the signer’s  public key certificate was valid (not revoked & not suspended) at the time of signing and that the signature  had an advanced quality at the time of signing.  Worse, longer term validation of an electronic signature  might be impossible (for which reason and as explained elsewhere in these series of documents, standards  have been issued on how to establish electronic signatures which provide for longer term validation  assurance).  In this context (and although the properties of qualified electronic time stamps have been described  above), we’d like to highlight the properties which are key for the use case examples mentioned below:   Qualified time stamps can enjoy the presumption of the accuracy of the date and the time it indicates  and the integrity of the data to which the date and time are bound.   This exact moment in time can be validated beyond reasonable doubt by all parties having access to  the data and the related timestamp.   If correctly set up this assurance of the exact moment in time associated to the time stamped  document or data can cover a very long period of time13.  Those properties allow several “types of use cases” which can be applied in many areas of application as  show in the present section. The table below highlight the identified types of use cases. The mapping on  areas of applications in no way tries to be exhaustive but only tries to indicate the huge potential of  qualified time stamps.

All those elements form a so-called validation data set that needs to be preserved/archived in  its entirety.

Indeed an electronic signature  will only provide authenticity, integrity and non-repudiation. Without a trustworthy time stamp the  signer(s) can declare  whatever time they chose to  put on the document  (before signing). In  processes where this is to be  avoided it is highly  recommended to include a  qualified electronic time  stamp (in the sense as  described in this document)  as to establish at what time  exactly this document was  signed.  Examples of concrete application are:   C2C/C2B: a person giving a relative or an accountant a mandate for a month (whereby the mandate  must be signed “recently”).   B2G: submitting declarations to government (which needs to be signed by mandated person at that  moment in time).  Establishing the time of issuance of official documents/attestations  Certain government documents have to be signed by an official instead of by an administration (the latter  would be an electronic seal for which we refer to the respective other document in this series). In that case  and as official documents / attestation (e.g. VAT-certificate, confirmation of place of residency) need to  bear a clear date of issuance, qualified time stamps can provide for the necessary certainty.  Examples of concrete application are:   G2C / G2B: government generating attestations for individuals or companies.  Figure 3: Example of establishing the time of signing  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  21   G2G / A2A: government (administrations) exchanging official information with each other whereby  there should be no doubt about the date of issuance (e.g. police report to Ministry of Justice).  Establishing the time of conclusion of a contract  In some jurisdictions, the establishment of a fixed date and time (e.g. by official registration) is necessary in  order to ensure the validity of a contract. Contracting parties are free to set the contract terms and  conditions including the applicable date & time, being actual date and time or a different one. However,  the moment of signing might be of great importance (e.g. because of applicable terms & conditions at the  date of signing, because of damage claims in case of late delivery, or because of promotional conditions).  Qualified time stamps allow to establish the exact moment of signing without the need for a contract  registration.  Figure 4: Example of establishing a fixed date and time  Examples of concrete application are:   C2B: a person signing a rental or buying agreement.   B2B: a company subscribing to an insurance contract.   B2G: signing off for a government project-start.  Enforcing legal/procedural/contractual time limits  The application of time limits is particularly relevant in administrative and judicial procedures. E.g. public  procurement rules require in substance that the devices for the electronic receipt of tenders or procedural  requests must guarantee their exact time and date. E.g. in court procedures time limits play also a crucial  role, in particular in those cases requiring strict  formal rules where a specific time limit is  determined, e.g. for filling a request, for submitting  an opposition or an appeal. Magistrates, court clerks,  bailiffs, lawyers, public notaries and civil servants  could become heavy users of qualified time stamps  in the near future.  Examples of concrete application are:   B2G: provisioning of time-stamped receipts upon submission of a proposal.   A2G: time stamping submitted documents when submitted to courts of justice.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  22  Long term validity of electronic records  In some case the validity of signatures on certain documents needs to be verifiable over a long period of  time because their legal effect will stay into force for a very long period of time (e.g. bank documents  which need to be preserved for x years after expiry of the contract). Electronic timestamps can come there  to the rescue as formats have been standardized which include the use of electronic timestamps to ensure  the ability for longer term validation of the signature. In Figure 5 below the Document Security Store (DSS)  extension is included in the document. The life-time of the protection can be further extended beyond the  life-time of the last document time-stamp applied by adding further DSS information to validate the  previous last document time-stamp along with a new document time-stamp.  Figure 5: Example of long term validity of a document  Examples of concrete application are:   C2B: signature on contracts between citizens and banks.   C2G: signatures on digital building permits.  Long term preservation of electronic records  In extension to the above use case, there are many official/contractual documents which have to be  preserved for a very long time.  Also here qualified electronic time stamps can be used to timestamp  documents on the moment of submission or be used to resign periodically as to establish the fact that the  entity preserving the documents can attest that these were the original signed files. Note however that  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  23  qualified time stamps cannot be the only tool to satisfy a correct preservation of electronic records; for  that, an appropriate strategy encompassing all aspects of their preservation must be implemented,  monitored and maintained.  Figure 6: Example of long term preservation of records  Examples of concrete application are:   C2B:  Archiving consents/mandates given to a bank.   C2G:  Signatures on digital building permits.  Notarizing the exact chronology of events  In some circumstances, the exact chronological order will be essential in order to grant specific rights. For  example, accountancy laws also attach a great importance to the unchangeable nature of bookings, hence  in the exactness of the established chronological order. European eInvoicing rules also require electronic  invoices to be dated and to be numbered in a chronological order, each invoice being part of an audit trail.  Figure 7: Example of notarizing chronology of events  Examples of concrete application are:   C2A: many acts laid down at notaries need to be notarized with a clear date/time/sequence of events.

Qualified electronic time stamp – what are the usage best practices?  Security guidelines & levels  In this section, we propose recommendations according to three levels which represent the  “strength/rigorousness” with which qualified time stamping services should be applied in a specific  context. This “strength/rigorousness” of course depends on the use case or type of application /  environment in which qualified time stamping services are being applied. Dimensions that could have an  impact on the “strength/rigorousness” of applying the recommendations, are the criticality of the  processes and/or data being involved in the business process which is being supported by the respective  qualified trust service.  This, every organization has to determine for itself based on a risk assessment.  For  inspiration possible mapping of basic/recommended/enhanced vs business criticality and/or data  protection is being given in Annex B.  In short the three levels of recommendations are in increasing order (whereby the higher level suppose  that the lower level is also taken into account):  BASIC for recommendations to be followed by entities or in processes dealing with normal  levels of criticality of data and therefor can live with a lower maturity in implementing  trust services (technology).  RECOMMENDED for recommendations to be followed by entities or in processes dealing with  important business data and therefor need to be able to rely on a medium to higher  maturity of implementation of trust services (technology).  ENHANCED for recommendations to be followed by entities or in processes dealing with data of  sensitive/high level of criticality and therefor need to be able to rely on a (very) high  maturity of implementation of trust services (technology).  BASIC  When looking for trust services, selecting qualified electronic time stamps provides legal reward compared  to non-qualified ones as they enjoy the presumption of the accuracy of the date and the time it indicates  and the integrity of the data to which the date and time are bound.  As a basic recommendation, relying parties should look for the EU trust mark for qualified (time  stamping) trust services when selecting providers. In addition, the relying party should read the  applicable terms and conditions, the policies and practices used by the QTSP providing qualified time  stamps.  As those documents may become long and heavy to read, best practice for a QTSP is to issue a Policy  Disclosure Statement summarising the most important provisions related to the provision of its services.  Relying parties should look out for the accuracy of the qualified time stamp which must be of 1 second  or even better.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  26  All scenarios where a QTSP providing qualified time stamps stores hashes of files or the files themselves  require strong guarantees with regards to the long term permanency and solvency of the QTSP.  RECOMMENDED  Relying parties should validate the use of the EU trust mark for qualified (time stamping) trust services  when selecting providers by browsing the corresponding national trusted list.  The provider making use of the EU trust mark must be listed in that TL. As TL are organised per TSP,  searches should be based on the name, trade name, VAT or official register number, when applicable.  Once the TSP found as listed in the relevant TL, it must have been granted a qualified status for the  provisioning of qualified time stamps: search for a qualified trust service type corresponding to the  creation of qualified time stamps  (i.e. for the URI http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/Svctype/TSA/QTST) for which  the current status is to be “granted” (http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/TrustedList/Svcstatus/granted).  When validating a claimed qualified time stamp:   Validate the signature/seal of the time stamp,   Identify the time stamp provider and its country of establishment from the signature/seal  certificate,   Identify, when applicable, the time stamping policy from the time stamp (e.g. a policy identifier  that is specific to the provider and must be compared to its declaration of time stamp policies  and/or practices, or a standard policy like ETSI best-practices-ts-policy 0.4.0.2023.1.1)   Look out the national trusted list from the country of establishment of the time stamp provider to  check its qualified status and qualified status of the time stamp (see B+ and qualified status must  be “granted” at time stamp date & time).  Applicable terms and conditions, the policies and practices used by the QTSP to provide its qualified  time stamps should be available from the “TSP information URI”  TSP information URI is the URI associated to the TSP information in the trusted list from where the TSP has  the obligation to provide access to its terms and conditions, policies and practices (to be found as part of  the TSP information as listed in the relevant EU MS trusted list).  For obtaining a proof of sending/receipt, use qualified electronic delivery services that includes qualified  time stamps embedded in such a proof.  For obtaining a proof of origin on the time stamped data, use qualified electronic signature as a natural  person (or qualified electronic seal as a legal person) as such signature (seal) may be combined with the  use of qualified time stamp.  Alternatively, a qualified electronic delivery services that includes qualified time stamps embedded in such  a proof may be used to obtain proof of origin on the time stamped data.  http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/Svctype/TSA/QTST http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/TrustedList/Svcstatus/granted  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  27  For obtaining a proof of commitment on time stamped data, qualified time stamps may be combined  with qualified electronic signatures.  ENHANCED  When validated time stamp reveals to be non-qualified, evaluate the applicable terms and conditions,  the policies and practices used by the TSP to provide its time stamp.  In particular look up for claimed compliance to relevant standards (see clause above) and the effective  audit program confirming such compliance.

Qualified electronic time stamp – example of tools & practical usage  aspects  Implementing time stamping in off-the-shelf applications (user perspective)  When making use of an off-the-shelf application allowing to create certificate-based digital signatures, one  can usually configure it to include the date and time the document has been signed as part of the  certificate-based signature. As seen in the present document, time stamp helps to establish when the  document has been signed and reduces the chances of an invalid signature.  Time stamps are easier to verify when they are associated with a trusted time stamp authority certificate.  One can obtain a qualified time stamp from a qualified trust service provider or time stamp authority.  Sometimes, the (qualified) certificate authority that issued digital IDs may also provide (qualified) time  stamps.  Usually, time stamps appear in the signature field and in the signature properties dialog box of the end- user application. If a time stamp server/service is configured, the time stamp appears in the filed related to  the date & time of the signature properties dialog box. If no time stamp server/service is configured, the  signatures field displays the local time of the computer at the moment of signing.  If a (qualified) time stamp was not embedded when signing the document, it can later be added to the  signature. A (qualified) time stamp applied after signing a document uses the time provided by the  (qualified) time stamp server/service.  In order to configure a time stamp server/service in an off-the-shelf application, one needs the server  name and the URL, which can be obtained from an administrator or from a security settings file  downloaded from a trusted source, including (qualified) time stamp trust service providers. Before  installing a security settings file, a check with the competent system administration or IT department is  advised. Checking the application configuration manual for properly configuring the (qualified) time stamp  server name, the URL and other optional settings if any is also a good start.  Implementing time stamping from APIs and other tool kits (expert perspective)  As a pre-requisite to the implementation of (qualified) time stamps in business electronic processes should  start with a proper, complete and as detailed as possible analysis of the business processes (description  and modelling of complex business electronic processes) within which one or more time stamps need to be  implemented. This aims to ensure that all the details related to crucial aspects of the business electronic  process are actually well captured and that the implementation of time stamps does not miss any of them.  It also includes a risk assessment, as a way of getting the needed information from which policy and  security requirements are identified, so that once they are satisfied, stakeholders are sure that the  implementation is done in such a way that it actually counters the identified risks.  This is particularly true when (qualified) time stamps are to be implemented within or in conjunction with  (qualified) electronic signatures. To this extent the ETSI technical report TR 119 10014 provides a business  14 ETSI TR 119 100: “Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI); Guidance on the use of standards for signature  creation and validation”. Starting from a business analysis and risk analysis of the business' electronic processes,  stakeholders are guided for making the best choice among the wide offer of standards in order to ensure the best  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  29  driven guided process for implementing generation and validation of digital signatures in business'  electronic processes.  A wide range of market available products offer the ability to enterprise/business process architects,  application architects, and application developers to benefit from APIs and toolkits for integrating time  stamps in their applications or services.  CEF eSignature building block  With regards to off-the-shelf toolkits allowing integrated solutions, the EC funded the development of the  DSS toolkits, as part of the CEF eSignature building block, available from Join-up where a cookbook is also  made available for use and integration of such toolkits for the creation and validation of qualified  electronic signatures, allowing use and integration of time stamping services provided by any time stamp  service provider through standard interfaces.15  Time stamp service APIs and tool kits from time stamp service providers  Most often, implementers may obtain time stamp server/service APIs and tool kits from their (qualified)  time stamp trust service providers.  Relevant standards regarding the creation and validation of time stamps  - ETSI EN 319 421: “Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI); Policy and Security Requirements for  Trust Service Providers issuing Time-Stamps”.  This document specifies policy and security requirements relating to the operation and management  practices of TSPs issuing time stamps and references ETSI EN 319 401 for generic requirements. Those  policy requirements are applicable to TSPs issuing time stamps. Such time stamps can be used in  support of digital signatures or for any application requiring to prove that a data existed before a  particular time. The document can be used by independent bodies as the basis for confirming that a  TSP can be trusted for issuing time stamps. An informative annex provides check lists that can be used  by the TSP to prepare an assessment of its practices against the document and/or by the assessor  when conducting the assessment for confirming that a TSP meets those requirements  - ETSI EN 319 422: “Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI); Time-stamping protocol and time- stamp token profiles”.  This document defines a profile for the time stamping protocol and the time stamp token defined in  IETF RFC 3161 including optional ESSCertIDv2 update in IETF RFC 5816. It defines what a time stamping  client supports and what a time-stamping server supports. Time stamp validation is out of scope and is  defined in ETSI EN 319 102.  - ETSI TS 119 142-3: “Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI); PAdES Document Time-stamp  digital signatures (PAdES-DTS)”.  implementation of digital signatures within the addressed application/business electronic processes.

It describes the format of a request sent to a Time Stamping Authority (TSA) and of the response that  is returned.  It also establishes several security-relevant requirements for TSA operation, with regards  to processing requests to generate responses.  - IETF RFC 5816: “ESSCertIDv2 Update for RFC 3161”.  This document updates RFC 3161.  It allows the use of ESSCertIDv2, as defined in RFC 5035, to specify  the hash of a signer certificate when the hash is calculated with a function other than the Secure Hash  Algorithm (SHA-1).  - ANSI ASC X9.95: “Trusted Time Stamp Management and Security”.  This standard specifies the minimum security requirements for the effective use of time stamps in a  financial services environment. It augments the RFC 3161 standard with data-level security  requirements to ensure data integrity against a reliable time source that is provable to any third party  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  31  Annex A: Glossary  A.1 eIDAS – What is it?  eIDAS is the acronym used to refer to Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 on electronic identification (eID) and  trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market. The eIDAS Regulation is about trust,  seamless user experience and convenience in online cross-border transactions.  A.2 Electronic seal  An electronic seal is a piece of data in electronic form, created by a legal person, which is attached to or  logically associated with an electronic document (or data) to ensure its origin and integrity.  It is similar in the paper world to the dry seal of a company on a piece of paper to indicate that the  document originates from the company and make it authentic and official.  A.3 Hash value (of a file)  A hash value is a standardised and unique summary of a message, which is obtained by applying a specific  cryptographic tool called a cryptographic hash function.  A hash function is any function that can be used to map digital data of arbitrary size to digital data of fixed  size, with slight differences in input data producing very big differences in output data.  A cryptographic hash function is a hash function which has specific security properties:   It is considered practically impossible to recreate the input message from its hash value;   It is considered practically impossible to compute from a specific message a second message that  has the same hash value (i.e. different messages lead to different has values);   It is considered practically impossible to find two different messages that would lead to the same  hash value (no collisions)  With such properties, when applied to the same message repetitively the hash value is always the same,  while if the message is slightly modified (even by one single bit) the hash value will always be different.  That allows to verify the integrity of a message compared to the message on which the hash was  previously computed; when the hash values are identical, then the messages are identical.  As cryptographic hash values represent large amounts of data as much smaller numeric values, they are  often used with digital signatures. Signing a hash value is more efficient than signing the larger value.  A.4 Intellectual property  Intellectual property is the collective term for rights to intellectual creations such as books, music,  trademarks, designs, inventions, software, texts and photographs. A single creation may be protected by  multiple rights at the same time. The best-known intellectual property rights are trademark rights,  copyrights and patent rights.  A.5 Trusted list  A trusted list is a list including information related to the qualified trust service providers which are  established in and supervised by an EU Member State, together with information related to the qualified  trust services provided by them, in accordance with the relevant provisions laid down in Regulation (EU)  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  32  No 910/2014. These lists have constitutive value and are primary source of information to validate that a  qualified status is or has been granted to a QTSP and to the QTS it provides.  Trusted lists are essential elements in building trust among electronic market operators by allowing users  to determine the qualified status and the status history of trust service providers and their services.  Member States may include in the trusted lists information on non-qualified trust service providers,  together with information related to the non-qualified trust services provided by them. It shall be clearly  indicated that they are not qualified according to Regulation (EU) No 910/2014.  Member States may include in the trusted lists information on nationally defined trust services of other  types than those defined under Article 3(16) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014. It shall be clearly indicated  that they are not qualified according to Regulation (EU) No 910/2014.  A.6 QTSP/QTS requirements and obligations  The eIDAS Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 foresees a set of requirements and obligations for qualified trust  service providers (QTSP) and qualified trust services (QTS) they provide in order to ensure high-level  security of the qualified trust services. Those obligations include in a nutshell:  - Processing of personal data shall be carried out in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC.  - Trust service provider (TSP) is liable for damage caused intentionally or negligently to any natural or  legal person due to a failure to comply with the obligations under this Regulation, while the intention  or negligence of a QTSP shall be presumed, unless proven otherwise by QTS. When TSP informed  customer in advance on limitations on the use of their services, and when such limitations are  recognisable to third parties, TSP is not liable when limitations have been exceeded.  - Where feasible, services must be accessible for person with disabilities.  - Implementing appropriate technical and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the  security of the trust services they provide. Having regard to the latest technological developments,  those measures shall ensure that the level of security is commensurate to the degree of risk. Measures  shall be taken to prevent and minimize the impact of security incidents and inform stakeholders of the  adverse effects of any such incidents.  - Very strict rules regarding the obligation of notifying security & personal data breaches.  - Additional requirements on QTSP operations and practices:  - Inform SB of any change in QTS provisioning and of intention to cease;  - Up-to-date termination plan, agreed with the competent supervisory body (SB), to ensure  continuity of service;  - Requirements on employed staff and subcontractors, when used;  - Sufficient financial resources and/or liability insurance, in accordance with national law;  - Consumer information on terms and conditions, incl. on limitations on use;  - Use of trustworthy systems and products ensuring the technical security and reliability of the  supported processes;  - Use of trustworthy systems to store (personal) data in a verifiable form;  - Take appropriate measures against forgery and theft of data; and  - Record and keep accessible activities related data, issued and received, even after cessation of  activities.  - Specific requirements from the provisions laid down in the eIDAS Regulation with regards to the  provision of a specific type of qualified trust service.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  33  All those requirements must be met by the QTSP/QTS before issuing the very first qualified trust service  output, i.e. before issuing the very first qualified time stamp in the case of QTSP providing qualified time  stamping services.  Once granted a qualified status, the eIDAS Regulation also foresees an active supervision scheme of  qualified trust service providers (QTSP) and qualified trust services (QTS) they provide by the national  competent supervisory body (SB) to monitor fulfilment of the QTSP/QTS requirements and obligations  throughout their lifetime.  A.7 CEF eSignature building block  The Connecting Europe Facility16 (CEF) supports trans- European networks and infrastructures in the  sectors of transport, telecommunications and energy. It provides public administrations and businesses of  reusable building blocks. Building blocks supported so far include: eIdentification; eSignature; eInvoicing;  eDelivery; and Automated Translation.  The eSignature building block helps public administrations and businesses to accelerate the creation and  verification of electronic signatures. The deployment of this building block in a Member State facilitates  the mutual recognition and cross-border interoperability of eSignatures, so that the legal value of  electronic documents can be recognized in other countries than the country of origin of the signer. This  means that public administrations and businesses can trust and use eSignatures that are valid and  structured in EU interoperable formats17,18.  The CEF eSignature solution19 consists of open source advisory services (Libraries, including source code,  artefacts, bundle for demonstration and cookbook) managed by the European Commission allowing the  creation and verification of electronic signatures, including the use of time stamps.  For more information about these services, please refer to the Digital Signature Service available from  https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/sd-dss/home.  Trust services defined by the eIDAS Regulation  In its Art.3.16, the eIDAS Regulation defines a ‘trust service’ as an electronic service normally provided for  remuneration which consists of:  (a) the creation, verification, and validation of electronic signatures, electronic seals or electronic time  stamps, electronic registered delivery services and certificates related to those services, or  (b) the creation, verification and validation of certificates for website authentication; or  (c) the preservation of electronic signatures, seals or certificates related to those services.  16 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/connecting-europe-facility.  17 CID (EU) 2011/130 establishing minimum requirements for the cross-border processing of documents signed  electronically by competent authorities under Directive 2006/123/EC on services in the internal market.  18 CID (EU) 2015/1506 laying down specifications relating to formats of advanced electronic signatures and advanced  seals to be recognised by public sector bodies pursuant to Articles 27(5) and 37(5) of the eIDAS Regulation.  19 https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/cef/og_page/catalogue-building-blocks#eSignature.  https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/sd-dss/home https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/connecting-europe-facility https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/cef/og_page/catalogue-building-blocks#eSignature  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  34  Qualified trust services defined by the eIDAS Regulation  Only those trust services listed in Art.3.16 of the eIDAS Regulation for which there are applicable  requirements in the Regulation can benefit from the qualified status. eIDAS regulates the following nine  qualified trust services:  1. The provision of qualified certificates for electronic signatures  Certificates for electronic signature are electronic attestations which link electronic signature  validation data to a natural person and confirm at least the name or the pseudonym of that  person. Since 1 July 2016, an electronic signature can only be used by a natural person to sign, i.e.  mainly to express consent on the signed data/document. This represents a significant difference  from the eSignature Directive 1999/93/EC regime where an electronic signature, which could be  used by legal persons, was defined as a means of authentication. Under the eIDAS Regulation, the  entity who creates an electronic signature (the so called signatory) will be a natural person.  Therefore, certificates for electronic signature cannot be issued to legal persons anymore. Instead  legal persons can use certificates for electronic seals (see below).  A qualified electronic certificate for electronic signatures is an essential element for a signatory to  create qualified electronic signatures that shall have the equivalent legal effect of a handwritten  signature all over the EU.  2. The provision of qualified certificates for electronic seals  As explained above, since 1 July 2016, legal persons cannot create legally valid (qualified)  electronic signatures anymore and cannot be issued (qualified) certificates for electronic  signatures. Instead legal persons can use certificates for electronic seals, which are electronic  attestations that link electronic seal validation data to a legal person and confirm the name of that  person. The aim of an electronic seal is not to sign but to serve as an evidence that an electronic  data/document was issued by a legal person, ensuring certainty of the data/document’s origin and  integrity.  A qualified electronic certificate for electronic seals is an essential element for a legal person to  create qualified electronic seals that shall enjoy, all over the EU, the presumption of integrity of  the data and of correctness of the origin of that data to which the qualified electronic seal is  linked.  3. The provision of qualified certificates for website authentication  Certificates for website authentication are issued to ensure the users (in particular citizens and  SMEs) that behind the website there is a legal or natural person identifiable by trustworthy  information.  The Regulation sets clear requirements for qualified website authentication certificates to be  considered trustworthy together with obligations for qualified trust service providers of such  qualified certificates with regard to the security of their operations, their liability and their  supervision regime. As a consequence, the Regulation ensures transparency regarding the quality  of the service offered to users, accountability of providers with regard to security of their services,  trustworthiness of the data associated to qualified authenticated websites and technological  neutrality of services and solutions.  4. Qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures  Such a qualified trust service aims to ensure the long-term preservation of information, in order to  ensure the legal validity and trustworthiness of qualified electronic signatures over extended  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  35  periods of time and guarantee that they can be validated irrespective of future technological  changes.  5. Qualified preservation service for qualified electronic seals  Such a qualified trust service aims to ensure the long-term preservation of information, in order to  ensure the legal validity and trustworthiness of qualified electronic seals over extended periods of  time and guarantee that they can be validated irrespective of future technological changes.  6. Qualified validation service for qualified electronic signatures  Validation of electronic signature is an ancillary service to electronic signatures whose process  aims to confirm the validity of an electronic signature.  Qualified validation services for qualified electronic signatures entail the verification by a qualified  trust service provider that the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation are met by a qualified  electronic signature in order to confirm its validity.  7. Qualified validation service for qualified electronic seals  Validation of electronic seal is an ancillary service to electronic seals whose process aims to  confirm the validity of an electronic seal.  Qualified validation services for qualified electronic seals entail the verification by a qualified trust  service provider that the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation are met by a qualified electronic  seal in order to confirm its validity.  8. Qualified electronic time stamps services  Electronic time stamps are issued to ensure the correctness of the time linked to data/documents.  Qualified electronic time stamp shall enjoy, all over the EU, the presumption of the accuracy of the  date and the time it indicates and the integrity of the data to which the date and time are bound.  9. Qualified electronic registered delivery services  By relying on a qualified electronic registered delivery service, one will benefit, all over the EU,  from the presumption of the integrity of the registered data, the sending of that data by the  identified sender, its receipt by the identified addressee and the accuracy of the date and time of  sending and receipt indicated by that qualified trust service.  The Regulation sets clear requirements for all such qualified trust services to be considered trustworthy  together with obligations for their qualified trust service providers with regard to the security of their  operations, their liability and their supervision regime.

However and depending on  the concrete environment the use case is applied in, the “strength/rigorousness” with which the  recommendations should be applied might be less or more severe.  Dimensions that could have an impact  on the “strength/rigorousness” of applying the recommendations, are the criticality of the processes  and/or data being involved in the business process which is being supported by the respective qualified  trust service. So, without intending to be complete as a risk assessment depends of the concrete  environment/context in which the organization is operating, some dimensions which might be considered  to determine the risk-profile of the process and/or data being protected (and therefor the minimum  “strength/rigorousness” to apply) are:   Business critical data & processes:  organizations store or process information that can have a less  or more significant impact on their own organization and/or their partners and/or their clients.  Examples of potential risks are e.g. loss of integrity of a database, compromise of business- confidential data, incorrect contracting-data, etc.   Data & processes with potential financial impact:  organization (especially but not only financial  industry related organizations) have several processes which might have direct financial impact for  themselves, for their partners and/or their clients ranging from amounts e.g. below a thousand  euros to amounts going into millions of euros. Examples of potential risks are e.g.: faulty validation  of signatures on mandates or payment instructions, rogue / criminal impersonation of third party  providers, hacking of personnel or corporate accounts, false invoices, etc.   Personal data (processing):  Personal data is clearly a very complex and high risk matter. The  scope of personal data is very broad, ranging from less delicate personal data, to directly  identifiable information to sensitive personal data. The more sensitive the data the stronger and  more rigorous one should apply the recommendations. Examples of potential risks are:  fines of up  to 4% of the global annual revenues of a company, embarrassment due to faulty access personal  information, unauthorized access/manipulation to e.g. biometric data, responding to a request- for-info based on an incorrect signed request, health data getting exposed / delivered incorrectly,  authenticity/integrity of critical health records being non-verifiable, etc.  Note:  We stress that the above are just examples of possible areas to consider to assess the risk-profile of  the process and/or data being protected. Depending on the reader’s environment other dimensions might  apply depending on regulation, corporate policies, contractual obligations, etc.  B.2 Determining applicable criticality-levels and derive resulting minimum applicable  recommendations  Following the above, it is proposed that organizations do their own analyses and following map their  processes / data-to-be-processed onto the following “criticality-levels”:   “Standard” would entail any usage of a trust service under normal circumstance like but not  limited to use cases e.g. involving financial exchange of a rather limited amount, personal records  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  39  with limited potential impact, or access to data/services of a limited classification level (e.g.  internal/restraint).   “Advanced” would entail any usage of a trust service in a context where more precautions /  prudence is to be advised like cases which involve financial exchange of a rather important  magnitude, personal records with rather important impact if going wrong, or access to  data/services of a higher classification level like company-confidential.   “Sensitive” would entail any usage of a trust service in a context where sensitive data is being  involved, e.g. involving financial exchanges of a significant amount, personal record access of  personal sensitive information, or access to data/services of a high classification level  like company-/commercial-secret.  Based on the above “criticality-levels”, one can easily see how the levels (Basic, Recommended, Enhanced)  can match to these levels:   Basic would entail the recommendations to-be-considered at the moment one is involved in a  (trans)action that involves data/services of a “standard” level of criticality.   Recommended would entail the recommendations to-be-considered at the moment one is  involved in a (trans)action that involves data/services of an “advanced” level of criticality.   Enhanced would be the recommendations to-be-considered at the moment one is involved in a  (trans)action that involves data/services of a “sensitive” level of criticality.

The complied a Q&A document is available from https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single- market/en/news/questions-answers-trust-services-under-eidas.  The Commission launched the eIDAS Observatory - an online collaborative platform for exchanging views  and positions, sharing ideas and good practices. It is a virtual community of stakeholders whose aim is to  build a common understanding of the issues relating to the implementation and uptake of the eIDAS  Regulation and to facilitate the use of cross-border electronic identification and trust services. You can join  the eIDAS Observatory and take part in the discussions.  D.2 How can I find a qualified trust service provider issuing qualified time stamps?  You can find a qualified trust service provider providing qualified time stamps by looking:  - For the use of the EU trust mark for qualified trust services associated to the provision of qualified  time stamps in the marketing material of envisaged providers;  - For EU MS national trusted list as they are available from the EC list of pointers to the EU MS  trusted lists (https://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/esignature/trusted-list/tl-mp.xml)  or by browsing the EU MS trusted lists from, e.g. http://tlbrowser.tsl.website. Trusted lists are  organised per TSP, and then per trust service. Look up for a service type identifying the issuance of  qualified time stamps (http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/Svctype/TSA/QTST) for which the current status  is “granted” (http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/TrustedList/Svcstatus/granted).  - For applicable terms and conditions, the policies and practices used by the QTSP to provide its  qualified time stamps should be available from the “TSP information URI” as part of the TSP  information as listed in the relevant EU MS trusted list.  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/questions-answers-trust-services-under-eidas https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/questions-answers-trust-services-under-eidas http://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/eidas-observatory https://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/esignature/trusted-list/tl-mp.xml http://tlbrowser.tsl.website/ http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/Svctype/TSA/QTST http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/TrustedList/Svcstatus/granted  ENISA  European Union Agency for Network  and Information Security  Science and Technology Park of Crete (ITE)  Vassilika Vouton, 700 13, Heraklion, Greece  Athens Office  1 Vasilissis Sofias  Marousi 151 24, Athens, Greece  TP-06-16-355-EN-N  PO Box 1309, 710 01 Heraklion, Greece  Tel: +30 28 14 40 9710  info@enisa.europa.eu  www.enisa.europa.eu  ISBN: 978-92-9204-215-8  DOI: 10.2824/4115",

It defines trust services for supporting  electronic signatures, electronic seals, electronic time stamps, electronic registered delivery services and  website authentication.  The eIDAS Regulation represented a big step forward in building a digital single market as it provides one  common legal framework for all parties relying or providing on those kind of services. Indeed, various  sectors of the economy (e.g. finance, banking, transport, insurance, health, sharing economy, trading, etc.)  where obligations exist for security, reliable identification, strong authentication, legal certainty of  evidences, will clearly be positively affected by the eIDAS Regulation. This latter will indeed allow citizens,  businesses and public administrations to meet such obligations for any (cross-border) electronic  transaction as they will now be able to use the recognised eID means and (qualified) trust services. In  particular, a qualified electronic time stamp shall enjoy, all over the EU, the presumption of the accuracy of  the date and the time it indicates and the integrity of the data to which the date and time are bound.  This document addresses qualified electronic time stamps and is one out of a series of five documents  which target to assist parties aiming to use qualified electronic signatures, seals, time stamps, eDelivery or  website authentication certificates to understand the subject correctly as-well-as the potential benefits,  amongst others, by giving examples of possible application. This series of documents also targets to give  those parties some advice on how to correctly use the related qualified trust services.  After explaining what a qualified electronic time stamp is and what properties/function it does and does  not provide, concrete examples of use are given for inspiration to the readers. Next to them, and as even  the most secure / trusted service becomes insecure and unreliable if not being integrated or used  correctly, some key recommendations are given for correct integration and use, pertaining:   Relying parties should look for the EU trust mark for qualified (time stamping) trust services when  selecting providers and should read the applicable terms and conditions, the policies and practices  used by the QTSP providing qualified time stamps.   Relying parties Look out for the accuracy of the qualified time stamp which must be of 1 second or  even better.   All scenarios where a QTSP providing qualified time stamps stores hashes of files or the files  themselves require strong guarantees with regards to the long term permanency and solvency of  the QTSP.   Applicable terms and conditions, the policies and practices used by the QTSP to provide its  qualified time stamps should be available from the “TSP information URI”.   For obtaining a proof of sending/receipt, use qualified electronic delivery services that includes  qualified time stamps embedded in such a proof.   For obtaining a proof of origin on the time stamped data, use qualified electronic signature as a  natural person (or qualified electronic seal as a legal person) as such signature (seal) may be  combined with the use of qualified time stamp.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  07  1. Introduction  General context/the eIDAS Regulation on eID and trust services  Regulation (EU) No 910/20141 (hereafter the eIDAS2 Regulation), on electronic identification and trust  services for electronic transactions in the internal market, provides a predictable regulatory environment  for electronic identification and a set of electronic trust services, namely electronic signatures, seals, time  stamps, registered delivery services and certificates for website authentication3.  It is possible to use these trust services as well as electronic documents as evidence in legal proceedings in  all EU Member States contributing to their general cross-border use. Courts (or other bodies in charge of  legal proceedings) cannot discard them as evidence only  because they are electronic but have to assess these  electronic tools in the same way they would do for their  paper equivalent.  Whether you a large company, a SME or a citizen willing  to complete an electronic transaction in another EU  country, e.g. submit a call for tender or register as a  student in another EU Member State (MS), besides  reducing time and costs, the eIDAS Regulation will ensure  cross-border recognition of national eID and electronic  trust services supporting your electronic transaction. Hence it will boost trust, security and convenience.  Since 1 July 2016, most provisions of the eIDAS Regulation are directly applicable in the 28 EU Member  States’ legal framework overcoming problems of fragmented national regimes. It provides legal certainty  and fosters the usage of eID means and electronic trust services for online access and online transactions  at EU level.  The eIDAS Regulation will ensure that people and businesses can use their national eIDs to access public  services in other EU countries where eIDs are required for such an access at national level. It also creates  an EU wide internal market for electronic trust services by ensuring their recognition and workability  across borders and are considered equivalent to traditional paper based processes.  Opportunities brought by eIDAS Regulation  The opportunities reside in leveraging eID and electronic trust services as key enablers for making cross- border electronic transactions more secure, more convenient, trustworthy and benefiting from legal  certainty.  The broader adoption of EU-wide recognised eID means and of electronic trust services will facilitate and  boost the digital transformation of organisations, be it public administrations or businesses, enhance  1 Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic  identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC.

To this end, a large number of sectors (e.g. finance, banking, transport, insurance, health, sharing  economy, trading, etc.) where obligations exist for security, reliable identification, strong authentication,  legal certainty of evidences, will be  positively affected. The eIDAS  Regulation will indeed allow citizens,  businesses and public administrations  to conveniently meet such obligations  for any cross-border electronic  transaction using the eID means and  (qualified) trust services of their  choice. Without undergoing identity  verification based on physical  presence, but by using MS notified eID  means of a level “high”, one should  for example be able to use public  services in another country or banks  may accept such eID to open a bank  account4.  By relying on a qualified  electronic registered delivery service,  one will benefit, all over the EU, from  the presumption of the integrity of  the registered data, the sending of  that data by the identified sender, its receipt by the identified addressee and the accuracy of the date and  time of sending and receipt indicated by that qualified trust service.  Specific role of the qualified trust services  To further enhance in particular the trust of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and consumers in  the internal market and to promote the use of trust services and products, the eIDAS Regulation  introduces the notions of qualified trust service and qualified trust service provider with a view to  indicating requirements and obligations that ensure high-level security of whatever qualified trust service  or product is used or provided and, as a consequence, are granted a higher presumption of their legal  effect.  Therefore, when looking for trust services, selecting qualified ones ensures benefiting from a high level of  security and legal certainty of trust services. E.g., qualified electronic time stamp shall enjoy, all over the  EU, the presumption of the accuracy of the date and the time it indicates and the integrity of the data to  which the date and time are bound.  Initiation and supervision of qualified trust services  In order to ensure high-level security of qualified trust services, the eIDAS Regulation foresees an active  supervision scheme of qualified trust service providers (QTSP) and qualified trust services (QTS) they  4 National legislations on prevention of money laundering may currently may force identity verification to be based  on physical presence. Furthermore, the use by the private sector of electronic identification means under a notified  scheme is on a voluntarily basis only (see Recital 17 of the eIDAS Regulation).  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  09  provide (hereafter referred to as a QTSP/QTS) by the national competent supervisory body (SB) that  supervises, ex ante and ex post, fulfilment of the QTSP/QTS requirements and obligations5. All those  requirements must be met by the QTSP/QTS before providing the very first qualified trust service output,  e.g. before issuing the very first qualified time stamp in the case of QTSP providing qualified time stamping  services.  Before a TSP/TS is granted a qualified status (QTSP/QTS), it will be subject to a pre-authorisation process –  the so-called initiation process. QTSPs may only begin to provide the qualified trust service after the  qualified status has been granted by the competent supervisory body and indicated in the national trusted  list6. From there, the supervision scheme covers the full life cycle of each QTS and each QTSP, from its  genesis until its termination.  In practice, where TSPs, without qualified status, intend to start providing qualified trust services, they  shall submit to the supervisory body a notification of their intention together with a conformity  assessment report issued by an “eIDAS” accredited conformity assessment body. Before notifying the  competent supervisory body of their intention to start providing qualified trust services, the future  QTSP/QTS must hence successfully pass an external assessment (audit) to confirm it fulfils the eIDAS  requirements. That audit must be conducted by a conformity assessment body specifically accredited to  carry out assessments of QTSP/QTS. The audit results in a formal conformity statement confirming - if such  is the case - that the QTSP/QTS meets all the applicable requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. Based on  the notified information including the report of such an audit, the competent SB will formally verify that  the candidate QTSP/QTS meets the applicable eIDAS requirements and, in case of positive verification, it  will undertake the publication of the grant of the qualified status for that QTSP/QTS in the national trusted  list.  It is only when its qualified status is published in the corresponding national trusted list that the QTSP/QTS  is authorised to provide the corresponding QTS.  Note: A TSP cannot be qualified without providing at least one qualified trust service (cfr Art.3.20 of  the eIDAS Regulation). A TSP is granted a qualified status separately for each type of qualified trust  service covered by the eIDAS Regulation. E.g. a QTSP qualified for the provisioning of qualified  certificates for electronic signatures is not per se granted a qualified status for the issuance of  qualified time stamps; it must first complete the full pre-authorisation process and have its granted  qualified status for the provision of qualified time stamp published explicitly in the national trusted  list before issuing qualified time stamps in addition to the provision of qualified certificates for  electronic signatures. There are nine different types of QTSs defined by the eIDAS Regulation for  which a qualified status is granted separately: provision of qualified certificates for electronic  signatures, provision of qualified certificates for electronic seals, provision of qualified certificates for  website authentication, qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures, qualified  preservation service for qualified electronic seals, qualified validation service for qualified electronic  signatures, qualified validation service for qualified electronic seals, qualified electronic time stamps  services, and qualified electronic registered delivery services.7  5 See glossary  6 See glossary.  7 See Annex A.7 for further details.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  10  For marketing purposes, once qualified, a QTSP/QTS may use the EU Trust Mark for qualified trust services  when promoting its QTS. That trust mark shown in Figure 1 can only be used by a QTSP to “label” its QTS. It  can be used on any support provided it meets requirements from Art.23 of the eIDAS Regulation (e.g. a link  to the corresponding national trusted list where consumers may verify the granted qualified status must  be displayed on the QTSP’s website) and rules of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/806.8  Basically, this secondary legislation sets the form, colour and size of the EU trust mark, sets the obligation  to clearly indicate the qualified services that the EU trust mark pertains to, and allows association with  other graphical or textual elements provided that certain conditions are met.9  Figure 1: EU trust mark for qualified trust services  The use of the EU trust mark, which is voluntary, aims to foster transparency of the market and help  consumers distinguishing between qualified trust services and non-qualified ones.  Once granted a qualified status, QTSPs and their QTSs have the obligation to pass, and submit the  competent supervisory body with a two-yearly conformity assessment report (CAR) issued by an  accredited CAB confirming that the QTSP and the QTSs it provides fulfil the requirements laid down in the  Regulation. Competent supervisory bodies are also allowed, at their own discretion and at any time, to  audit themselves any QTSP/QTS for which they are competent or to request an accredited CAB to perform  an ad hoc audit.  QTSPs and their QTSs are supervised for their entire lifecycle, from their genesis to their termination. In  particular, in order to ensure sustainability and durability of QTSs, as well as to ensure proper termination  and user’s confidence in their provision, QTSPs must maintain, at all times, an up-to-date termination plan.  That plan is to be agreed by the SB upon initiation and regularly checked for compliance during the life of  the QTSP/QTS.  A focus on qualified electronic time stamps  An internationally recognized time-scale is a necessity in today’s society. The Coordinated Universal Time  (UTC) currently fulfils this function and is legally recognised in many countries. Electronic time stamps are  valuable tool sin the context of electronic transactions where the date plays a significant role in the  verification and authentication process of various  events, data, documents, agreements or  certificates. It is a kind of time attestation in  electronic form which binds whatever kind of  electronic data to a particular time establishing  evidence that the latter data existed at that time.  8 Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/806 of 22 May 2015 laying down specifications relating to the form  of the EU trust mark for qualified trust services (Text with EEA relevance).

Qualified electronic time stamps shall enjoy, all  over the EU, the presumption of the accuracy of the date and the time it indicates and the integrity of the  data to which the date and time are bound.  Scope of the present document and relationship with other recommendations  This document proposes security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps. It  aims to support relying parties and end users of qualified electronic time stamping services to securely use  these services.  The target audience of the document are end users and relying parties of qualified electronic time  stamping services. This could comprise individuals, businesses and public administrations. For example, it  could be a public administration that wishes to use a (qualified) electronic seal and a qualified electronic  time stamp for its electronic interactions with citizens, and which would like to ensure it is utilizing these  services:   In compliance with the eIDAS Regulation.   In a proper and secure manner that guarantees that the security properties of the service are  being maintained.  The present document is organised to provide information and guidance with regards to the following  aspects of qualified electronic time stamp:   What is it?   What key properties it provides?   What properties it cannot provide?   What are the potential use cases?   What are the usage best practices?   Example of tools & practical usage aspects.  Four other linked documents propose security guidelines on the appropriate use respectively of qualified  electronic signatures, qualified electronic seals, qualified electronic registered delivery and qualified  website authentication certificates.10  Although each of these qualified trust services share some technical backgrounds or tools and thus provide  some common functionalities, such as illustrated below, each of them has its own objectives and core  functionalities as summarised in the following table:  10 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services/qualified-trust-services.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services/qualified-trust-services  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  12  Trust Service Data Integrity Confidentiality  Authenticates  Origin  (Natural Person)  Authenticates  Origin  (Legal Person)  Authenticates  Time  QTS        QES        QESeal        QWAC        QeDel     *     *not a core functionality but is usually provided as part of a greater solution  Table 1: Comparative table of functionalities offered by the various types of qualified trust services  .

Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  13  2. Qualified electronic time stamp – what is it?  Official time  Since the end of the 19th century, an internationally recognised time-scale as a basis of time measurement,  has become a true necessity in civil society. The Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), the time-scale provided  by the BIPM (Bureau International des Poids et Mesures - International Bureau for Weights and Measures),  currently fulfils this function and is widely used as the basis of legal time around the world.  Note: Standard time divides the world into 24 “time zones”, each one covering, in theory at least, 15  degrees. All clocks within one of those time zones should be set to the same time. Greenwich Mean  Time (GMT), a time measurement based on Earth rotation, was initially used to determine the  standard time for each zone. For most practical purposes UTC, the modern successor of GMT, is  equivalent to mean solar time at the prime meridian (0°). More specifically, UTC is a compromise  between the highly stable atomic time (TAI - Temps Atomique International) and solar time derived  from the irregular Earth rotation (related to the Greenwich mean sidereal time (GMST) by a  conventional relationship) UTC forms the basis of a coordinated dissemination of standard  frequencies and time signals. It corresponds exactly in rate with TAI but differs from it by an integer  number of seconds. The full definition of UTC is contained in Recommendation ITU-R TF.460-6 [1].  Electronic time stamp  An electronic time stamp is a piece of data in electronic form which binds other electronic data to a  particular time establishing evidence that these data existed at that time.  Figure 3: Examples of “paper-based” time stamps  An electronic time stamp aims to achieve the same goal as a “paper based” time stamp, i.e. establishing  that a document, sending, or act has been established before or at a specific date and time.  Obtaining a time stamp on an electronic document usually consists in sending a hash value11 of a file to a  time stamp service (e.g. server) from time stamp service provider, for example via Internet. The time  11 See glossary.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  14  stamp service adds the current date & time, signs it or seals it and sends back the signed/sealed time  stamp to the requester.  Figure 2: High level overview of the time stamp process flow  The time stamp, i.e. the signed/sealed combination of the hash of the document and date & time, proves  that the hashed document and its content existed at that date & time. The time stamp service provider  ensures that the clock used for time stamping is correctly synchronised with UTC.  Variants include sending the file (document) directly to the time stamp service provider, not just the hash  of it. The service provider does not only time stamp the file but also archives the file and sends the  requester an acknowledgement of receipt.  Note: As a standard best practice, a time stamp includes a reference to a time stamping policy, i.e. a  document disclosing information on the rules and practices followed by the time stamp service  provider when creating such a time stamp. This is particularly relevant to the requester and/or the  verifier of a time stamp, when referring to the general terms & conditions and policies/practices  documents of the provider to determine the level of quality, security an accuracy of the service and of  the time stamp (e.g. an accuracy of 1 second, or worse or better).  Qualified electronic time stamp  The service consisting in the creation and provision of time stamps is a trust service, i.e. electronic service  that enhances trust and confidence in electronic transactions.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  15  The eIDAS Regulation introduces the notions of qualified trust services and qualified trust service provider  with a view to indicating requirements and obligations that ensure high-level security of whatever  qualified trust services and products are used or provided.  When looking for trust services, selecting qualified ones ensures benefiting from a high level of security  and legal certainty of trust services. Qualified electronic time stamp enjoy, all over the EU, the  presumption of the accuracy of the date and the time it indicates and the integrity of the data to which the  date and time are bound.  A qualified time stamp, as specified by the eIDAS Regulation, must be based on an accurate time source  linked to Coordinated Universal Time (i.e. the clock used for time stamping is correctly synchronised with  UTC) and bind the date and time to the time stamped data in such a manner as to reasonably preclude the  possibility of the data being changed undetectably (i.e. data integrity is maintained). It must also be signed  using an advanced electronic signature or sealed with an advanced electronic seal12 of the qualified trust  service provider, or by some equivalent method. That advanced electronic signature or seal, when based  on PKI-based cryptography will actually ensure proof of integrity of the time stamped data in situation  illustrated in Figure 2.  Note: A trust service provider (TSP) providing time-stamping services to the public, is called a time  stamping authority (TSA). The TSA has overall responsibility for the provision of its time stamping  services, covering the operation of one or more time stamping units (TSUs) which are the technical  server that create and sign the time stamps on behalf of the TSA. Each and every time stamp should  identify the responsible TSA through its signature.  12 See Glossary.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  16  3. Qualified electronic time stamp – what key properties does it  provide?  Legal properties  Legal presumption of the accuracy of the date and time of the stamped data & integrity of that data  From a legal point of view, the accuracy of the date and time in a qualified time stamp and the integrity of  the corresponding time stamped data are legally presumed and recognised as such all over the EU.  Security properties  Accuracy of the date and time  The accuracy of the date and the time indicated in a qualified time stamp is ensured.  Data integrity  The integrity of the data to which the date and time are bound in a qualified time stamp is ensured via the  hash value and the signature/seal on the time stamp. In other words, it is guaranteed that any alteration  to the time stamped data can be detected.  The integrity of the qualified time stamp itself is ensured via the electronic signature or seal of the  qualified time stamp provider.  Functional properties  Date and time attestation  From a functional point of view, a qualified electronic time stamp is a kind of time attestation in electronic  form which binds whatever kind of electronic data to a particular time establishing evidence that the latter  data existed at that time.  Identification of the qualified time stamp provider  Furthermore, as a qualified time stamp needs to be signed using an advanced electronic signature or  sealed with an advanced electronic seal of the qualified trust service provider, or by some equivalent  method, the qualified time stamp itself:  - Allows the identification of the qualified trust service provider to which it is uniquely linked, and  - Is also protected for integrity as the time stamp is signed/sealed in such a way that any subsequent  change in the time stamp itself is detectable.  The identification of the qualified trust service provider having issued the qualified time stamp is provided  by the certificate supporting the validation of the advanced electronic signature or seal of the qualified  time stamp provider. The QTSP name, its postal and electronic address can in fine be found in the national  trusted list when validating the qualified status of the time stamp and of its provider.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  17  4.  Qualified electronic time stamp – what properties can it not  provide?  No prevention of document alteration  While a qualified time stamp guarantees that any alteration to the time stamped data can be detected, it  provides no guarantee that such alteration will not happen. In other words, it does not prevent any  alteration on the content of the time stamped document, but it allows detecting any alteration once it is  time stamped.  Confidentiality  A qualified time stamp provides no guarantee that the time stamped data will remain confidential when  sent over to recipients.  There is however no need to disclose the data to be time stamped towards the time stamp provider as the  time stamp request is only including a hash value of that data.  No proof of sending/receipt  The qualified time stamp provides no guarantee that the time stamped document has been effectively  sent to a certain recipient or has been received by a certain recipient. Those guarantees must be explicitly  provided in addition to the security and legal properties provided by the qualified time stamp.  Note: For obtaining a proof of sending/receipt, a user should subscribe to qualified electronic delivery  services that includes qualified time stamps embedded in such a proof.  No proof of origin on the time stamped data  The qualified time stamp provides no guarantee that the time stamped document origins from a certain  party (no p roof of origin of the document).  Note: For obtaining a proof of origin on the time stamped data, a user should create a qualified  electronic signature as a natural person (or qualified electronic seal as a legal person) as such signature  (seal) may be combined with the use of qualified time stamp. Alternatively, a qualified electronic  delivery services that includes qualified time stamps embedded in such a proof may be used to obtain  proof of origin on the time stamped data.  No signing or content commitment on time stamped data  The qualified time stamp provides no guarantee that the document owner or time stamp requester is  clearly identified.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  18  The time stamp is not a signature from the document owner and does not bear itself any commitment on  the content of the time stamped document (no electronic signature of the document).  Note: For obtaining a proof of commitment on time stamped data, qualified time stamps may be  combined with qualified electronic signatures not only to time stamp the data but to sign it as well.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  19  5. Qualified electronic time stamp – what are the potential use cases?  Overview and context of the given examples  In general and to put (qualified) electronic time stamps in context, they are most often seen coming in  addition to electronic signatures.  Indeed, when advanced/qualified electronic signatures are  implemented, the sole creation of the signature by the signer of a file, document or data does not make it  possible to tell when the signature was created.  Moreover, and often forgotten, without such a time indication, it is not possible to verify that the signer’s  public key certificate was valid (not revoked & not suspended) at the time of signing and that the signature  had an advanced quality at the time of signing.  Worse, longer term validation of an electronic signature  might be impossible (for which reason and as explained elsewhere in these series of documents, standards  have been issued on how to establish electronic signatures which provide for longer term validation  assurance).  In this context (and although the properties of qualified electronic time stamps have been described  above), we’d like to highlight the properties which are key for the use case examples mentioned below:   Qualified time stamps can enjoy the presumption of the accuracy of the date and the time it indicates  and the integrity of the data to which the date and time are bound.   This exact moment in time can be validated beyond reasonable doubt by all parties having access to  the data and the related timestamp.   If correctly set up this assurance of the exact moment in time associated to the time stamped  document or data can cover a very long period of time13.  Those properties allow several “types of use cases” which can be applied in many areas of application as  show in the present section. The table below highlight the identified types of use cases. The mapping on  areas of applications in no way tries to be exhaustive but only tries to indicate the huge potential of  qualified time stamps.

All those elements form a so-called validation data set that needs to be preserved/archived in  its entirety.

Indeed an electronic signature  will only provide authenticity, integrity and non-repudiation. Without a trustworthy time stamp the  signer(s) can declare  whatever time they chose to  put on the document  (before signing). In  processes where this is to be  avoided it is highly  recommended to include a  qualified electronic time  stamp (in the sense as  described in this document)  as to establish at what time  exactly this document was  signed.  Examples of concrete application are:   C2C/C2B: a person giving a relative or an accountant a mandate for a month (whereby the mandate  must be signed “recently”).   B2G: submitting declarations to government (which needs to be signed by mandated person at that  moment in time).  Establishing the time of issuance of official documents/attestations  Certain government documents have to be signed by an official instead of by an administration (the latter  would be an electronic seal for which we refer to the respective other document in this series). In that case  and as official documents / attestation (e.g. VAT-certificate, confirmation of place of residency) need to  bear a clear date of issuance, qualified time stamps can provide for the necessary certainty.  Examples of concrete application are:   G2C / G2B: government generating attestations for individuals or companies.  Figure 3: Example of establishing the time of signing  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  21   G2G / A2A: government (administrations) exchanging official information with each other whereby  there should be no doubt about the date of issuance (e.g. police report to Ministry of Justice).  Establishing the time of conclusion of a contract  In some jurisdictions, the establishment of a fixed date and time (e.g. by official registration) is necessary in  order to ensure the validity of a contract. Contracting parties are free to set the contract terms and  conditions including the applicable date & time, being actual date and time or a different one. However,  the moment of signing might be of great importance (e.g. because of applicable terms & conditions at the  date of signing, because of damage claims in case of late delivery, or because of promotional conditions).  Qualified time stamps allow to establish the exact moment of signing without the need for a contract  registration.  Figure 4: Example of establishing a fixed date and time  Examples of concrete application are:   C2B: a person signing a rental or buying agreement.   B2B: a company subscribing to an insurance contract.   B2G: signing off for a government project-start.  Enforcing legal/procedural/contractual time limits  The application of time limits is particularly relevant in administrative and judicial procedures. E.g. public  procurement rules require in substance that the devices for the electronic receipt of tenders or procedural  requests must guarantee their exact time and date. E.g. in court procedures time limits play also a crucial  role, in particular in those cases requiring strict  formal rules where a specific time limit is  determined, e.g. for filling a request, for submitting  an opposition or an appeal. Magistrates, court clerks,  bailiffs, lawyers, public notaries and civil servants  could become heavy users of qualified time stamps  in the near future.  Examples of concrete application are:   B2G: provisioning of time-stamped receipts upon submission of a proposal.   A2G: time stamping submitted documents when submitted to courts of justice.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  22  Long term validity of electronic records  In some case the validity of signatures on certain documents needs to be verifiable over a long period of  time because their legal effect will stay into force for a very long period of time (e.g. bank documents  which need to be preserved for x years after expiry of the contract). Electronic timestamps can come there  to the rescue as formats have been standardized which include the use of electronic timestamps to ensure  the ability for longer term validation of the signature. In Figure 5 below the Document Security Store (DSS)  extension is included in the document. The life-time of the protection can be further extended beyond the  life-time of the last document time-stamp applied by adding further DSS information to validate the  previous last document time-stamp along with a new document time-stamp.  Figure 5: Example of long term validity of a document  Examples of concrete application are:   C2B: signature on contracts between citizens and banks.   C2G: signatures on digital building permits.  Long term preservation of electronic records  In extension to the above use case, there are many official/contractual documents which have to be  preserved for a very long time.  Also here qualified electronic time stamps can be used to timestamp  documents on the moment of submission or be used to resign periodically as to establish the fact that the  entity preserving the documents can attest that these were the original signed files. Note however that  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  23  qualified time stamps cannot be the only tool to satisfy a correct preservation of electronic records; for  that, an appropriate strategy encompassing all aspects of their preservation must be implemented,  monitored and maintained.  Figure 6: Example of long term preservation of records  Examples of concrete application are:   C2B:  Archiving consents/mandates given to a bank.   C2G:  Signatures on digital building permits.  Notarizing the exact chronology of events  In some circumstances, the exact chronological order will be essential in order to grant specific rights. For  example, accountancy laws also attach a great importance to the unchangeable nature of bookings, hence  in the exactness of the established chronological order. European eInvoicing rules also require electronic  invoices to be dated and to be numbered in a chronological order, each invoice being part of an audit trail.  Figure 7: Example of notarizing chronology of events  Examples of concrete application are:   C2A: many acts laid down at notaries need to be notarized with a clear date/time/sequence of events.

Qualified electronic time stamp – what are the usage best practices?  Security guidelines & levels  In this section, we propose recommendations according to three levels which represent the  “strength/rigorousness” with which qualified time stamping services should be applied in a specific  context. This “strength/rigorousness” of course depends on the use case or type of application /  environment in which qualified time stamping services are being applied. Dimensions that could have an  impact on the “strength/rigorousness” of applying the recommendations, are the criticality of the  processes and/or data being involved in the business process which is being supported by the respective  qualified trust service.  This, every organization has to determine for itself based on a risk assessment.  For  inspiration possible mapping of basic/recommended/enhanced vs business criticality and/or data  protection is being given in Annex B.  In short the three levels of recommendations are in increasing order (whereby the higher level suppose  that the lower level is also taken into account):  BASIC for recommendations to be followed by entities or in processes dealing with normal  levels of criticality of data and therefor can live with a lower maturity in implementing  trust services (technology).  RECOMMENDED for recommendations to be followed by entities or in processes dealing with  important business data and therefor need to be able to rely on a medium to higher  maturity of implementation of trust services (technology).  ENHANCED for recommendations to be followed by entities or in processes dealing with data of  sensitive/high level of criticality and therefor need to be able to rely on a (very) high  maturity of implementation of trust services (technology).  BASIC  When looking for trust services, selecting qualified electronic time stamps provides legal reward compared  to non-qualified ones as they enjoy the presumption of the accuracy of the date and the time it indicates  and the integrity of the data to which the date and time are bound.  As a basic recommendation, relying parties should look for the EU trust mark for qualified (time  stamping) trust services when selecting providers. In addition, the relying party should read the  applicable terms and conditions, the policies and practices used by the QTSP providing qualified time  stamps.  As those documents may become long and heavy to read, best practice for a QTSP is to issue a Policy  Disclosure Statement summarising the most important provisions related to the provision of its services.  Relying parties should look out for the accuracy of the qualified time stamp which must be of 1 second  or even better.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  26  All scenarios where a QTSP providing qualified time stamps stores hashes of files or the files themselves  require strong guarantees with regards to the long term permanency and solvency of the QTSP.  RECOMMENDED  Relying parties should validate the use of the EU trust mark for qualified (time stamping) trust services  when selecting providers by browsing the corresponding national trusted list.  The provider making use of the EU trust mark must be listed in that TL. As TL are organised per TSP,  searches should be based on the name, trade name, VAT or official register number, when applicable.  Once the TSP found as listed in the relevant TL, it must have been granted a qualified status for the  provisioning of qualified time stamps: search for a qualified trust service type corresponding to the  creation of qualified time stamps  (i.e. for the URI http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/Svctype/TSA/QTST) for which  the current status is to be “granted” (http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/TrustedList/Svcstatus/granted).  When validating a claimed qualified time stamp:   Validate the signature/seal of the time stamp,   Identify the time stamp provider and its country of establishment from the signature/seal  certificate,   Identify, when applicable, the time stamping policy from the time stamp (e.g. a policy identifier  that is specific to the provider and must be compared to its declaration of time stamp policies  and/or practices, or a standard policy like ETSI best-practices-ts-policy 0.4.0.2023.1.1)   Look out the national trusted list from the country of establishment of the time stamp provider to  check its qualified status and qualified status of the time stamp (see B+ and qualified status must  be “granted” at time stamp date & time).  Applicable terms and conditions, the policies and practices used by the QTSP to provide its qualified  time stamps should be available from the “TSP information URI”  TSP information URI is the URI associated to the TSP information in the trusted list from where the TSP has  the obligation to provide access to its terms and conditions, policies and practices (to be found as part of  the TSP information as listed in the relevant EU MS trusted list).  For obtaining a proof of sending/receipt, use qualified electronic delivery services that includes qualified  time stamps embedded in such a proof.  For obtaining a proof of origin on the time stamped data, use qualified electronic signature as a natural  person (or qualified electronic seal as a legal person) as such signature (seal) may be combined with the  use of qualified time stamp.  Alternatively, a qualified electronic delivery services that includes qualified time stamps embedded in such  a proof may be used to obtain proof of origin on the time stamped data.  http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/Svctype/TSA/QTST http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/TrustedList/Svcstatus/granted  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  27  For obtaining a proof of commitment on time stamped data, qualified time stamps may be combined  with qualified electronic signatures.  ENHANCED  When validated time stamp reveals to be non-qualified, evaluate the applicable terms and conditions,  the policies and practices used by the TSP to provide its time stamp.  In particular look up for claimed compliance to relevant standards (see clause above) and the effective  audit program confirming such compliance.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  28  7. Qualified electronic time stamp – example of tools & practical usage  aspects  Implementing time stamping in off-the-shelf applications (user perspective)  When making use of an off-the-shelf application allowing to create certificate-based digital signatures, one  can usually configure it to include the date and time the document has been signed as part of the  certificate-based signature. As seen in the present document, time stamp helps to establish when the  document has been signed and reduces the chances of an invalid signature.  Time stamps are easier to verify when they are associated with a trusted time stamp authority certificate.  One can obtain a qualified time stamp from a qualified trust service provider or time stamp authority.  Sometimes, the (qualified) certificate authority that issued digital IDs may also provide (qualified) time  stamps.  Usually, time stamps appear in the signature field and in the signature properties dialog box of the end- user application. If a time stamp server/service is configured, the time stamp appears in the filed related to  the date & time of the signature properties dialog box. If no time stamp server/service is configured, the  signatures field displays the local time of the computer at the moment of signing.  If a (qualified) time stamp was not embedded when signing the document, it can later be added to the  signature. A (qualified) time stamp applied after signing a document uses the time provided by the  (qualified) time stamp server/service.  In order to configure a time stamp server/service in an off-the-shelf application, one needs the server  name and the URL, which can be obtained from an administrator or from a security settings file  downloaded from a trusted source, including (qualified) time stamp trust service providers. Before  installing a security settings file, a check with the competent system administration or IT department is  advised. Checking the application configuration manual for properly configuring the (qualified) time stamp  server name, the URL and other optional settings if any is also a good start.  Implementing time stamping from APIs and other tool kits (expert perspective)  As a pre-requisite to the implementation of (qualified) time stamps in business electronic processes should  start with a proper, complete and as detailed as possible analysis of the business processes (description  and modelling of complex business electronic processes) within which one or more time stamps need to be  implemented. This aims to ensure that all the details related to crucial aspects of the business electronic  process are actually well captured and that the implementation of time stamps does not miss any of them.  It also includes a risk assessment, as a way of getting the needed information from which policy and  security requirements are identified, so that once they are satisfied, stakeholders are sure that the  implementation is done in such a way that it actually counters the identified risks.  This is particularly true when (qualified) time stamps are to be implemented within or in conjunction with  (qualified) electronic signatures. To this extent the ETSI technical report TR 119 10014 provides a business  14 ETSI TR 119 100: “Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI); Guidance on the use of standards for signature  creation and validation”. Starting from a business analysis and risk analysis of the business' electronic processes,  stakeholders are guided for making the best choice among the wide offer of standards in order to ensure the best  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  29  driven guided process for implementing generation and validation of digital signatures in business'  electronic processes.  A wide range of market available products offer the ability to enterprise/business process architects,  application architects, and application developers to benefit from APIs and toolkits for integrating time  stamps in their applications or services.  CEF eSignature building block  With regards to off-the-shelf toolkits allowing integrated solutions, the EC funded the development of the  DSS toolkits, as part of the CEF eSignature building block, available from Join-up where a cookbook is also  made available for use and integration of such toolkits for the creation and validation of qualified  electronic signatures, allowing use and integration of time stamping services provided by any time stamp  service provider through standard interfaces.15  Time stamp service APIs and tool kits from time stamp service providers  Most often, implementers may obtain time stamp server/service APIs and tool kits from their (qualified)  time stamp trust service providers.  Relevant standards regarding the creation and validation of time stamps  - ETSI EN 319 421: “Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI); Policy and Security Requirements for  Trust Service Providers issuing Time-Stamps”.  This document specifies policy and security requirements relating to the operation and management  practices of TSPs issuing time stamps and references ETSI EN 319 401 for generic requirements. Those  policy requirements are applicable to TSPs issuing time stamps. Such time stamps can be used in  support of digital signatures or for any application requiring to prove that a data existed before a  particular time. The document can be used by independent bodies as the basis for confirming that a  TSP can be trusted for issuing time stamps. An informative annex provides check lists that can be used  by the TSP to prepare an assessment of its practices against the document and/or by the assessor  when conducting the assessment for confirming that a TSP meets those requirements  - ETSI EN 319 422: “Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI); Time-stamping protocol and time- stamp token profiles”.  This document defines a profile for the time stamping protocol and the time stamp token defined in  IETF RFC 3161 including optional ESSCertIDv2 update in IETF RFC 5816. It defines what a time stamping  client supports and what a time-stamping server supports. Time stamp validation is out of scope and is  defined in ETSI EN 319 102.  - ETSI TS 119 142-3: “Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI); PAdES Document Time-stamp  digital signatures (PAdES-DTS)”.  implementation of digital signatures within the addressed application/business electronic processes.

All future releases and issue management will be available through the CEF Digital portal.  https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/sd-dss/asset_release/all https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=23003381 https://esig-dss.atlassian.net/projects/DSS/issues  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  30  This document specifies a format for PAdES digital signatures using a Document Time-Stamp as a  digital signature intended to specifically prove the integrity and existence of a PDF document as  defined in ISO 32000-1, rather than proving any form of authentication or proof of origin.  - IETF RFC 3161: “Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP)”.  It describes the format of a request sent to a Time Stamping Authority (TSA) and of the response that  is returned.  It also establishes several security-relevant requirements for TSA operation, with regards  to processing requests to generate responses.  - IETF RFC 5816: “ESSCertIDv2 Update for RFC 3161”.  This document updates RFC 3161.  It allows the use of ESSCertIDv2, as defined in RFC 5035, to specify  the hash of a signer certificate when the hash is calculated with a function other than the Secure Hash  Algorithm (SHA-1).  - ANSI ASC X9.95: “Trusted Time Stamp Management and Security”.  This standard specifies the minimum security requirements for the effective use of time stamps in a  financial services environment. It augments the RFC 3161 standard with data-level security  requirements to ensure data integrity against a reliable time source that is provable to any third party  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  31  Annex A: Glossary  A.1 eIDAS – What is it?  eIDAS is the acronym used to refer to Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 on electronic identification (eID) and  trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market. The eIDAS Regulation is about trust,  seamless user experience and convenience in online cross-border transactions.  A.2 Electronic seal  An electronic seal is a piece of data in electronic form, created by a legal person, which is attached to or  logically associated with an electronic document (or data) to ensure its origin and integrity.  It is similar in the paper world to the dry seal of a company on a piece of paper to indicate that the  document originates from the company and make it authentic and official.  A.3 Hash value (of a file)  A hash value is a standardised and unique summary of a message, which is obtained by applying a specific  cryptographic tool called a cryptographic hash function.  A hash function is any function that can be used to map digital data of arbitrary size to digital data of fixed  size, with slight differences in input data producing very big differences in output data.  A cryptographic hash function is a hash function which has specific security properties:   It is considered practically impossible to recreate the input message from its hash value;   It is considered practically impossible to compute from a specific message a second message that  has the same hash value (i.e. different messages lead to different has values);   It is considered practically impossible to find two different messages that would lead to the same  hash value (no collisions)  With such properties, when applied to the same message repetitively the hash value is always the same,  while if the message is slightly modified (even by one single bit) the hash value will always be different.  That allows to verify the integrity of a message compared to the message on which the hash was  previously computed; when the hash values are identical, then the messages are identical.  As cryptographic hash values represent large amounts of data as much smaller numeric values, they are  often used with digital signatures. Signing a hash value is more efficient than signing the larger value.  A.4 Intellectual property  Intellectual property is the collective term for rights to intellectual creations such as books, music,  trademarks, designs, inventions, software, texts and photographs. A single creation may be protected by  multiple rights at the same time. The best-known intellectual property rights are trademark rights,  copyrights and patent rights.  A.5 Trusted list  A trusted list is a list including information related to the qualified trust service providers which are  established in and supervised by an EU Member State, together with information related to the qualified  trust services provided by them, in accordance with the relevant provisions laid down in Regulation (EU)  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  32  No 910/2014. These lists have constitutive value and are primary source of information to validate that a  qualified status is or has been granted to a QTSP and to the QTS it provides.  Trusted lists are essential elements in building trust among electronic market operators by allowing users  to determine the qualified status and the status history of trust service providers and their services.  Member States may include in the trusted lists information on non-qualified trust service providers,  together with information related to the non-qualified trust services provided by them. It shall be clearly  indicated that they are not qualified according to Regulation (EU) No 910/2014.  Member States may include in the trusted lists information on nationally defined trust services of other  types than those defined under Article 3(16) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014. It shall be clearly indicated  that they are not qualified according to Regulation (EU) No 910/2014.  A.6 QTSP/QTS requirements and obligations  The eIDAS Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 foresees a set of requirements and obligations for qualified trust  service providers (QTSP) and qualified trust services (QTS) they provide in order to ensure high-level  security of the qualified trust services. Those obligations include in a nutshell:  - Processing of personal data shall be carried out in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC.  - Trust service provider (TSP) is liable for damage caused intentionally or negligently to any natural or  legal person due to a failure to comply with the obligations under this Regulation, while the intention  or negligence of a QTSP shall be presumed, unless proven otherwise by QTS. When TSP informed  customer in advance on limitations on the use of their services, and when such limitations are  recognisable to third parties, TSP is not liable when limitations have been exceeded.  - Where feasible, services must be accessible for person with disabilities.  - Implementing appropriate technical and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the  security of the trust services they provide. Having regard to the latest technological developments,  those measures shall ensure that the level of security is commensurate to the degree of risk. Measures  shall be taken to prevent and minimize the impact of security incidents and inform stakeholders of the  adverse effects of any such incidents.  - Very strict rules regarding the obligation of notifying security & personal data breaches.  - Additional requirements on QTSP operations and practices:  - Inform SB of any change in QTS provisioning and of intention to cease;  - Up-to-date termination plan, agreed with the competent supervisory body (SB), to ensure  continuity of service;  - Requirements on employed staff and subcontractors, when used;  - Sufficient financial resources and/or liability insurance, in accordance with national law;  - Consumer information on terms and conditions, incl. on limitations on use;  - Use of trustworthy systems and products ensuring the technical security and reliability of the  supported processes;  - Use of trustworthy systems to store (personal) data in a verifiable form;  - Take appropriate measures against forgery and theft of data; and  - Record and keep accessible activities related data, issued and received, even after cessation of  activities.  - Specific requirements from the provisions laid down in the eIDAS Regulation with regards to the  provision of a specific type of qualified trust service.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  33  All those requirements must be met by the QTSP/QTS before issuing the very first qualified trust service  output, i.e. before issuing the very first qualified time stamp in the case of QTSP providing qualified time  stamping services.  Once granted a qualified status, the eIDAS Regulation also foresees an active supervision scheme of  qualified trust service providers (QTSP) and qualified trust services (QTS) they provide by the national  competent supervisory body (SB) to monitor fulfilment of the QTSP/QTS requirements and obligations  throughout their lifetime.  A.7 CEF eSignature building block  The Connecting Europe Facility16 (CEF) supports trans- European networks and infrastructures in the  sectors of transport, telecommunications and energy. It provides public administrations and businesses of  reusable building blocks. Building blocks supported so far include: eIdentification; eSignature; eInvoicing;  eDelivery; and Automated Translation.  The eSignature building block helps public administrations and businesses to accelerate the creation and  verification of electronic signatures. The deployment of this building block in a Member State facilitates  the mutual recognition and cross-border interoperability of eSignatures, so that the legal value of  electronic documents can be recognized in other countries than the country of origin of the signer. This  means that public administrations and businesses can trust and use eSignatures that are valid and  structured in EU interoperable formats17,18.  The CEF eSignature solution19 consists of open source advisory services (Libraries, including source code,  artefacts, bundle for demonstration and cookbook) managed by the European Commission allowing the  creation and verification of electronic signatures, including the use of time stamps.  For more information about these services, please refer to the Digital Signature Service available from  https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/sd-dss/home.  Trust services defined by the eIDAS Regulation  In its Art.3.16, the eIDAS Regulation defines a ‘trust service’ as an electronic service normally provided for  remuneration which consists of:  (a) the creation, verification, and validation of electronic signatures, electronic seals or electronic time  stamps, electronic registered delivery services and certificates related to those services, or  (b) the creation, verification and validation of certificates for website authentication; or  (c) the preservation of electronic signatures, seals or certificates related to those services.  16 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/connecting-europe-facility.  17 CID (EU) 2011/130 establishing minimum requirements for the cross-border processing of documents signed  electronically by competent authorities under Directive 2006/123/EC on services in the internal market.  18 CID (EU) 2015/1506 laying down specifications relating to formats of advanced electronic signatures and advanced  seals to be recognised by public sector bodies pursuant to Articles 27(5) and 37(5) of the eIDAS Regulation.  19 https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/cef/og_page/catalogue-building-blocks#eSignature.  https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/sd-dss/home https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/connecting-europe-facility https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/cef/og_page/catalogue-building-blocks#eSignature  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  34  Qualified trust services defined by the eIDAS Regulation  Only those trust services listed in Art.3.16 of the eIDAS Regulation for which there are applicable  requirements in the Regulation can benefit from the qualified status. eIDAS regulates the following nine  qualified trust services:  1. The provision of qualified certificates for electronic signatures  Certificates for electronic signature are electronic attestations which link electronic signature  validation data to a natural person and confirm at least the name or the pseudonym of that  person. Since 1 July 2016, an electronic signature can only be used by a natural person to sign, i.e.  mainly to express consent on the signed data/document. This represents a significant difference  from the eSignature Directive 1999/93/EC regime where an electronic signature, which could be  used by legal persons, was defined as a means of authentication. Under the eIDAS Regulation, the  entity who creates an electronic signature (the so called signatory) will be a natural person.  Therefore, certificates for electronic signature cannot be issued to legal persons anymore. Instead  legal persons can use certificates for electronic seals (see below).  A qualified electronic certificate for electronic signatures is an essential element for a signatory to  create qualified electronic signatures that shall have the equivalent legal effect of a handwritten  signature all over the EU.  2. The provision of qualified certificates for electronic seals  As explained above, since 1 July 2016, legal persons cannot create legally valid (qualified)  electronic signatures anymore and cannot be issued (qualified) certificates for electronic  signatures. Instead legal persons can use certificates for electronic seals, which are electronic  attestations that link electronic seal validation data to a legal person and confirm the name of that  person. The aim of an electronic seal is not to sign but to serve as an evidence that an electronic  data/document was issued by a legal person, ensuring certainty of the data/document’s origin and  integrity.  A qualified electronic certificate for electronic seals is an essential element for a legal person to  create qualified electronic seals that shall enjoy, all over the EU, the presumption of integrity of  the data and of correctness of the origin of that data to which the qualified electronic seal is  linked.  3. The provision of qualified certificates for website authentication  Certificates for website authentication are issued to ensure the users (in particular citizens and  SMEs) that behind the website there is a legal or natural person identifiable by trustworthy  information.  The Regulation sets clear requirements for qualified website authentication certificates to be  considered trustworthy together with obligations for qualified trust service providers of such  qualified certificates with regard to the security of their operations, their liability and their  supervision regime. As a consequence, the Regulation ensures transparency regarding the quality  of the service offered to users, accountability of providers with regard to security of their services,  trustworthiness of the data associated to qualified authenticated websites and technological  neutrality of services and solutions.  4. Qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures  Such a qualified trust service aims to ensure the long-term preservation of information, in order to  ensure the legal validity and trustworthiness of qualified electronic signatures over extended  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  35  periods of time and guarantee that they can be validated irrespective of future technological  changes.  5. Qualified preservation service for qualified electronic seals  Such a qualified trust service aims to ensure the long-term preservation of information, in order to  ensure the legal validity and trustworthiness of qualified electronic seals over extended periods of  time and guarantee that they can be validated irrespective of future technological changes.  6. Qualified validation service for qualified electronic signatures  Validation of electronic signature is an ancillary service to electronic signatures whose process  aims to confirm the validity of an electronic signature.  Qualified validation services for qualified electronic signatures entail the verification by a qualified  trust service provider that the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation are met by a qualified  electronic signature in order to confirm its validity.  7. Qualified validation service for qualified electronic seals  Validation of electronic seal is an ancillary service to electronic seals whose process aims to  confirm the validity of an electronic seal.  Qualified validation services for qualified electronic seals entail the verification by a qualified trust  service provider that the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation are met by a qualified electronic  seal in order to confirm its validity.  8. Qualified electronic time stamps services  Electronic time stamps are issued to ensure the correctness of the time linked to data/documents.  Qualified electronic time stamp shall enjoy, all over the EU, the presumption of the accuracy of the  date and the time it indicates and the integrity of the data to which the date and time are bound.  9. Qualified electronic registered delivery services  By relying on a qualified electronic registered delivery service, one will benefit, all over the EU,  from the presumption of the integrity of the registered data, the sending of that data by the  identified sender, its receipt by the identified addressee and the accuracy of the date and time of  sending and receipt indicated by that qualified trust service.  The Regulation sets clear requirements for all such qualified trust services to be considered trustworthy  together with obligations for their qualified trust service providers with regard to the security of their  operations, their liability and their supervision regime.

However and depending on  the concrete environment the use case is applied in, the “strength/rigorousness” with which the  recommendations should be applied might be less or more severe.  Dimensions that could have an impact  on the “strength/rigorousness” of applying the recommendations, are the criticality of the processes  and/or data being involved in the business process which is being supported by the respective qualified  trust service. So, without intending to be complete as a risk assessment depends of the concrete  environment/context in which the organization is operating, some dimensions which might be considered  to determine the risk-profile of the process and/or data being protected (and therefor the minimum  “strength/rigorousness” to apply) are:   Business critical data & processes:  organizations store or process information that can have a less  or more significant impact on their own organization and/or their partners and/or their clients.  Examples of potential risks are e.g. loss of integrity of a database, compromise of business- confidential data, incorrect contracting-data, etc.   Data & processes with potential financial impact:  organization (especially but not only financial  industry related organizations) have several processes which might have direct financial impact for  themselves, for their partners and/or their clients ranging from amounts e.g. below a thousand  euros to amounts going into millions of euros. Examples of potential risks are e.g.: faulty validation  of signatures on mandates or payment instructions, rogue / criminal impersonation of third party  providers, hacking of personnel or corporate accounts, false invoices, etc.   Personal data (processing):  Personal data is clearly a very complex and high risk matter. The  scope of personal data is very broad, ranging from less delicate personal data, to directly  identifiable information to sensitive personal data. The more sensitive the data the stronger and  more rigorous one should apply the recommendations. Examples of potential risks are:  fines of up  to 4% of the global annual revenues of a company, embarrassment due to faulty access personal  information, unauthorized access/manipulation to e.g. biometric data, responding to a request- for-info based on an incorrect signed request, health data getting exposed / delivered incorrectly,  authenticity/integrity of critical health records being non-verifiable, etc.  Note:  We stress that the above are just examples of possible areas to consider to assess the risk-profile of  the process and/or data being protected. Depending on the reader’s environment other dimensions might  apply depending on regulation, corporate policies, contractual obligations, etc.  B.2 Determining applicable criticality-levels and derive resulting minimum applicable  recommendations  Following the above, it is proposed that organizations do their own analyses and following map their  processes / data-to-be-processed onto the following “criticality-levels”:   “Standard” would entail any usage of a trust service under normal circumstance like but not  limited to use cases e.g. involving financial exchange of a rather limited amount, personal records  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  39  with limited potential impact, or access to data/services of a limited classification level (e.g.  internal/restraint).   “Advanced” would entail any usage of a trust service in a context where more precautions /  prudence is to be advised like cases which involve financial exchange of a rather important  magnitude, personal records with rather important impact if going wrong, or access to  data/services of a higher classification level like company-confidential.   “Sensitive” would entail any usage of a trust service in a context where sensitive data is being  involved, e.g. involving financial exchanges of a significant amount, personal record access of  personal sensitive information, or access to data/services of a high classification level  like company-/commercial-secret.  Based on the above “criticality-levels”, one can easily see how the levels (Basic, Recommended, Enhanced)  can match to these levels:   Basic would entail the recommendations to-be-considered at the moment one is involved in a  (trans)action that involves data/services of a “standard” level of criticality.   Recommended would entail the recommendations to-be-considered at the moment one is  involved in a (trans)action that involves data/services of an “advanced” level of criticality.   Enhanced would be the recommendations to-be-considered at the moment one is involved in a  (trans)action that involves data/services of a “sensitive” level of criticality.

Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic time stamps  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  41  Annex D: Frequently asked questions  D.1 eIDAS Regulation – Questions and answers on rules applicable to trust services as  of 1 July 2016  The European Commission complied a Q&A document to help fully understanding the new legal  framework in order to implement it or reap the benefits of electronic transactions.  The complied a Q&A document is available from https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single- market/en/news/questions-answers-trust-services-under-eidas.  The Commission launched the eIDAS Observatory - an online collaborative platform for exchanging views  and positions, sharing ideas and good practices. It is a virtual community of stakeholders whose aim is to  build a common understanding of the issues relating to the implementation and uptake of the eIDAS  Regulation and to facilitate the use of cross-border electronic identification and trust services. You can join  the eIDAS Observatory and take part in the discussions.  D.2 How can I find a qualified trust service provider issuing qualified time stamps?  You can find a qualified trust service provider providing qualified time stamps by looking:  - For the use of the EU trust mark for qualified trust services associated to the provision of qualified  time stamps in the marketing material of envisaged providers;  - For EU MS national trusted list as they are available from the EC list of pointers to the EU MS  trusted lists (https://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/esignature/trusted-list/tl-mp.xml)  or by browsing the EU MS trusted lists from, e.g. http://tlbrowser.tsl.website. Trusted lists are  organised per TSP, and then per trust service. Look up for a service type identifying the issuance of  qualified time stamps (http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/Svctype/TSA/QTST) for which the current status  is “granted” (http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/TrustedList/Svcstatus/granted).  - For applicable terms and conditions, the policies and practices used by the QTSP to provide its  qualified time stamps should be available from the “TSP information URI” as part of the TSP  information as listed in the relevant EU MS trusted list.  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/questions-answers-trust-services-under-eidas https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/questions-answers-trust-services-under-eidas http://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/eidas-observatory https://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/esignature/trusted-list/tl-mp.xml http://tlbrowser.tsl.website/ http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/Svctype/TSA/QTST http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/TrustedList/Svcstatus/granted  ENISA  European Union Agency for Network  and Information Security  Science and Technology Park of Crete (ITE)  Vassilika Vouton, 700 13, Heraklion, Greece  Athens Office  1 Vasilissis Sofias  Marousi 151 24, Athens, Greece  TP-06-16-355-EN-N  PO Box 1309, 710 01 Heraklion, Greece  Tel: +30 28 14 40 9710  info@enisa.europa.eu  www.enisa.europa.eu  ISBN: 978-92-9204-215-8  DOI: 10.2824/4115",

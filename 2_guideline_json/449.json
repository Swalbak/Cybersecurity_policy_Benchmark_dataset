For  ENISA, IoT is an emerging concept comprising a wide ecosystem of interconnected services and devices, such  as sensors, consumer products and everyday smart home objects, cars, and industrial and health  components. These technologies collect, exchange and process data in order to dynamically adapt to a  specific context, transforming the business world and the way we live as a whole. IoT is tightly bound to  cyber-physical systems and, in this respect, safety implications are pertinent.  Nevertheless, IoT poses very important safety and security challenges that need to be addressed for IoT to  reach its full potential. Many security considerations regarding IoT are not necessarily new; they are  inherited from the use of networking technologies. However, the characteristics of some IoT  implementations present new security challenges, threats and risks that are manifold and evolve rapidly.  The protection of IoT deployments depends on the protection of all systems involved (the devices  themselves, cloud backend and services, applications, maintenance and diagnostic tools, etc.).  Addressing these challenges and ensuring security in IoT products and services is a fundamental priority.  One of the main concerns is the impact that the different threats may have since attacks on IoT deployments  could dramatically jeopardise people’s security, privacy and safety, while additionally IoT in itself can be used  as an attack vector against other critical infrastructures.  Also, since IoT can drastically change the ways  personal data is collected, analysed, used, and protected, privacy concerns have been raised. These need to  be addressed to ensure user trust and confidence in the Internet, connected devices, and related services.  However, beyond technical security measures, the adoption of IoT has raised many new legal, policy and  regulatory challenges, broad and complex in scope, that remain unanswered, amplifying at the same time  some existing issues. The rapid rate of change in IoT technology has outpaced the ability of the associated  policy, legal, and regulatory structures to adapt, leaving no clear security framework to follow. This has led  most companies and manufacturers to take their own approach when designing IoT devices, causing  interoperability issues between devices from different manufacturers, and between IoT devices and legacy  systems.  For these reasons, ENISA is defining a set of Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT. The aim of this work  as reported here is to provide insight into the security requirements of IoT, mapping critical assets and  relevant threats, assessing possible attacks and identifying potential good practices and security measures  to apply in order to protect IoT systems.  As a result of this work, after taking into consideration all the background research carried out, the views  expressed by the experts interviewed, and the good practices and security measures identified, a series of  recommendations has been developed, namely:   Promote harmonization of IoT security initiatives and regulations  Intended for IoT industry, providers, manufacturers, associations   Raise awareness for the need for IoT cybersecurity  Intended for IoT industry, providers, manufacturers, associations, academia, consumer groups,  regulators   Define secure software/hardware development lifecycle guidelines for IoT  Intended for IoT developers, platform operators, industry, manufacturers  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  08   Achieve consensus for interoperability across the IoT ecosystem  Intended for IoT industry, providers, manufacturers, associations, regulators   Foster economic and administrative incentives for IoT security  Intended for IoT industry, associations, academia, consumer groups, regulators   Establishment of secure IoT product/service lifecycle management  Intended for IoT developers, platform operators, industry, manufacturers   Clarify liability among IoT stakeholders  Intended for IoT industry, regulators  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  09  Index of tables  Table 1  Indicative listing of communication protocols for IoT 22  Table 2  Asset taxonomy 28  Table 3  Threat taxonomy 35  Table 4  IoT attack scenarios 36  Table 5  Attack 1 – IoT administration system compromise 41  Table 6  Attack 2 – Value manipulation in IoT devices 43  Table 7  Attack 3 – Botnet / Commands injection 45  Table 8  IoT Security Recommendations 57  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  10  Index of figures  Figure 1: Methodology followed in the study 16  Figure 2: IoT pervasive ecosystem 18  Figure 3: Structure of an IoT embedded system 21  Figure 4: IoT High-level reference model 25  Figure 5: Asset taxonomy 26  Figure 6: Asset criticality 28  Figure 7: Indicative timeline of IoT security incidents 30  Figure 8: IoT Threat taxonomy 32  Figure 9: IoT threats impact 33  Figure 10: Threat impact weighted average 33  Figure 11: Attack scenario criticality 39  Figure 12: Attack 1 – IoT administration system compromised 40  Figure 13: Attack 2 – Value manipulation in IoT devices 42  Figure 14: Attack 3 – Botnet / Commands injection 44  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  11  1. Introduction  The Internet of Things (IoT) is concept paradigm that has emerged over the last years. Kevin Ashton  introduced the concept of IoT back in 19991. It describes a wide ecosystem where interconnected devices  and services collect, exchange and process data in order to adapt dynamically to a context. The Internet of  Things is tightly bound to cyber-physical systems and in this respect is an enabler of Smart Infrastructures  by enhancing their quality of service provisioning.  The IoT is the natural evolution of computing and it brings its own challenges – an immature ecosystem  bearing a fragmentation of standards and security concerns in a non-homogeneous IoT market, as at the  moment each industry and application is different. Another IoT challenge worth highlighting is its ability to  scale globally2; according to Gartner, IoT will involve 8.4 billion connected ‘things’ in use in 2017, up 31%  from 2016, and by 2020 the number of connected devices is envisioned to reach 20 billion41. Currently there  are different solutions available in the market through various manufacturers such as Google, Microsoft,  Amazon, Apple or Samsung, among others, many of which use their proprietary cloud service, protocols and  operating system3.  The threats and risks related to the Internet of Things devices, systems and services are manifold, and evolve  rapidly. With a great impact on citizens’ safety, security and privacy, the threat landscape concerning the  Internet of Things is extremely wide. Hence, it is important to understand what needs to be secured and to  develop specific security measures to protect the Internet of Things from cyber threats.  Involving billions of intelligent systems and millions of applications, IoT will drive new consumer and business  behaviours, which will demand increasingly intelligent solutions. This, in turn, is expected to drive by 2020  almost 3 trillion dollars (circa 2.85 trillion euros) in new business opportunities for the different vendors and  companies that capitalise on the IoT41. Examples of these opportunities include4:   New business models: New value streams for customers, with a faster response.   Diversification of revenue streams: Monetising added services on top of traditional lines of business.   Real-time information: Capturing data about products and processes more swiftly, improving market  agility and allowing prompt decision making.   Global visibility: Making tracking easier from one end of a supply chain to the other.  Objectives  The goal of this report is to elaborate baseline cybersecurity recommendations for IoT with a focus on Critical  Information Infrastructures, which encompass facilities, networks, services and physical and information  technology equipment. These infrastructures are considered critical because their destruction or disruption  could bring about major consequences for the health, safety and economic wellbeing of citizens, for the  efficient functioning of State institutions and Public Administrations5,6, and for the asset owners who make  use of IoT to provide their services.  1 See http://www.rfidjournal.com/articles/view?4986  2 See https://www.emc.com/leadership/digital-universe/2014iview/internet-of-things.htm  3 See https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/06/building-the-web-of-things/  4 See https://www.emc.com/leadership/digital-universe/2014iview/internet-of-things.htm  5 See https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/crisis-and-terrorism/critical-infrastructure_en  6 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services  http://www.rfidjournal.com/articles/view?4986 https://www.emc.com/leadership/digital-universe/2014iview/internet-of-things.htm https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/06/building-the-web-of-things/ https://www.emc.com/leadership/digital-universe/2014iview/internet-of-things.htm https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/crisis-and-terrorism/critical-infrastructure_en https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  12  In this respect, the baseline security measures for IoT put forward in this report can serve as a springboard  for further related efforts towards a harmonised EU approach, paving the way for a tacit adoption of the  measures, and as criteria for other initiatives such as labelling or certification.  A major challenge in defining baseline security measures for IoT is the entailed complexity that is brought  by the diversity of application areas for IoT. Striking a balance between the particularities of each domain is  essential and accordingly it is important to consider the differences in apportioning risk to distinct  environments. Accordingly, this report builds on the expertise and insight gained by previous work by ENISA,  covering a series of vertical application areas of IoT namely:   Smart Homes7   Smart Cities and Intelligent Public Transport8   Smart Grids9   Smart Cars10   Smart Airports11   eHealth and Smart Hospitals12  This report aims to cover the threat model of the Internet of Things in the context of Critical Information  Infrastructures (CII), as well as to detail available security measures to counter the identified threats. This  report also provides a series of recommendations to shape future efforts and initiatives in the direction of  a holistic approach to secure the Internet of Things.  Scope  ENISA defines the Internet of Things (IoT) as a cyber-physical ecosystem of interconnected sensors and  actuators, which enable decision making. Information lies at the heart of IoT, feeding into a continuous cycle  of sensing, decision making, and actions. IoT is tightly bound to cyber-physical systems and in this respect is  an enabler of Smart Infrastructures, e.g. Industry 4.0, smart grid, smart transport, by enabling services of  higher quality and facilitating the provision of advanced functionalities.  ENISA identified and analysed existing IoT security practices, security guidelines, relevant industry standards  and research initiatives in the area of IoT security for Critical Information Infrastructures (e.g. Industry 4.0,  Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications, IoT updatability). Having reviewed and thoroughly analysed  existing work and ongoing activities, ENISA compared these practices and standards and developed baseline  security measures to be adopted by relevant stakeholders.  ENISA focused, among other topics, on IoT resilience and communication, on the interoperability with  proprietary systems, and on the reliability of IoT. Special emphasis was given to the privacy issues of such  smart infrastructure and services. In this endeavour, ENISA additionally took into account existing European  Union (EU) policies and regulatory initiatives such as the Directive on security of network and information  systems (NIS Directive)13, The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)14, the Internet of Things - An  7 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/smart-homes  8 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/smart-cities  9 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services/smart-grids  10 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-security-and-resilience-of-smart-cars  11 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/securing-smart-airports  12 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services/health  13 See http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN  14 See http://www.eugdpr.org/  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/smart-homes https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/smart-cities https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services/smart-grids https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-security-and-resilience-of-smart-cars https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/securing-smart-airports https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services/health http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN http://www.eugdpr.org/  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  13  action plan for Europe15, as well as the work of the Alliance for the Internet of Things (AIOTI)16 and the Staff  Working Document on ICT Standardization17, among others.  In 2017, ENISA launched the IoT Security Experts Group (IoTSEC)18. The ENISA IoTSEC group is an information  exchange platform that brings together experts to ensure the security and resilience of the entire Internet  of Things ecosystem. Experts of the IoTSEC group have background expertise in one or several of the  following:   Internet of Things with a focus on cyber security;   Suppliers and developers of Internet of Things hardware and/or software with a focus on cyber security;   Associations and non-profit organisations involved in Internet of Things security;   Regulation bodies, academia, standardisation bodies and policy makers.  The first step of the process followed by ENISA in order to validate the results of the report was to carry out  a series of interviews with the different members of the IoTSEC Experts Group, where we gathered their  input, obtaining new information and validating information found during the desktop research. A total of  26 experts were interviewed, covering industry, policy, academia and research organisations from 9 EU  member states and from the United States of America. After synthesising all findings into this report, a  release candidate version was sent to the experts that compose the IoTSEC Group for a first round of  comments. Finally, during the first workshop meeting of the ENISA IoT Security Experts Group that took  place in The Hague, Netherlands, on 20th of October 2017, the findings of the report were discussed and  the experts shaped the final recommendations in order to reflect the needs of the IoT security community  in Europe.  EU and International Policy context  In the last years, the European Commission has been working to facilitate the embracement of the IoT in  Europe, and to unleash its full potential, by adopting a set of supporting policy actions and launching a series  of relevant initiatives19.  In March 2015, the European Commission launched the Alliance for Internet of Things Innovation (AIOTI)20,  with the intention of creating an innovative and industry-driven European IoT ecosystem. The AIOTI has  come to be the largest European IoT Association to date, emphasising the European Commission’s ambition  to work closely with all IoT stakeholders on the establishment of a competitive IoT market and new business  models for the benefit of the European citizens and businesses.  The Digital Single Market (DSM) Strategy21, adopted two months later in May 2015, underlines the need to  avoid fragmentation and to foster interoperability for IoT to reach its potential, leading Europe a step further  in terms of IoT development. In order to meet the DSM needs and to inform about its upcoming policy, in  April 2016 the European Commission specified the EU’s IoT vision in the document ‘Advancing the Internet  of Things in Europe’22, as part of the ‘Digitising European Industry’ (DEI) initiative23.  15 See http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0278:FIN:EN:PDF  16 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/alliance-internet-things-innovation-aioti-defines-its-long-term-strategy  17 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/communication-ict-standardisation-priorities-digital-single-market  18 See https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/iot-security-experts-group-1  19 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/internet-of-things  20 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/alliance-internet-things-innovation-aioti  21 See https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/digital-single-market/  22 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/staff-working-document-advancing-internet-things-europe  23 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/policies/digitising-european-industry  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0278:FIN:EN:PDF https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/alliance-internet-things-innovation-aioti-defines-its-long-term-strategy https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/communication-ict-standardisation-priorities-digital-single-market https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/iot-security-experts-group-1 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/internet-of-things https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/alliance-internet-things-innovation-aioti https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/digital-single-market/ https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/staff-working-document-advancing-internet-things-europe https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/policies/digitising-european-industry  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  14  This vision is based on three different pillars:   A thriving IoT ecosystem,   A human centred IoT approach,   A single market for IoT.  The achievement of a single market for the IoT will potentially face issues linked to the capacity to handle a  vast number and diversity of connected devices and the ability to identify them unequivocally and  universally, so it is important to foster an open system for object identification and authentication, as well  as an interoperable IoT numbering space that transcends geographical limits. Some aspects of numbering  were already addressed in the 2016 review of the EU telecom rules24.  The Commission, in their ICT Standardisation roadmap for the Digital Single Market25, identified five priority  areas that aim to guarantee a fresh approach to standards, and IoT is identified as one of these five priorities.  These areas should increase competitiveness and help European innovations better access the global  market. The other priorities are 5G communication, cybersecurity, cloud and Big Data.  In the context of promoting a European single market for IoT, in January 2017 the ‘European data economy’  initiative was presented26. It proposes policy and legal solutions concerning the free flow of data across  national borders in the EU, and liability issues decisive to enhance legal certainty around IoT products and  services. In addition to all these initiatives, the EU has arranged specific IoT objectives in the Horizon 2020  research and innovation programme27. The midterm review of the Digital Single Market makes numerous  references to the Internet of Things, with liability and cyber security being the main areas of focus28.  Moreover, Article 29 Data Protection Working Party Committee’s “Opinion 8/2014 on the on Recent  Developments on the Internet of Things” identifies the main data protection risks that lie within the  ecosystem of the IoT before providing guidance on how the EU legal framework should be applied in this  context29.  The most recent action taken by the EU was on September 2017, when the new “Proposal for a Regulation  Of The European Parliament And Of The Council on ENISA, the “EU Cybersecurity Agency”, and repealing  Regulation (EU) 526/2013, and on Information and Communication Technology cybersecurity certification  (“Cybersecurity Act”)” was published30,31.  On the same date, the European Commission published the “Joint Communication To The European  Parliament And The Council Resilience, Deterrence and Defence: Building strong cybersecurity for the EU”32,  which describes the overall cybersecurity strategy of the EU. The goal is to build greater EU resilience to  cyber-attacks, improving detection mechanisms and strengthening international cooperation, and to do so,  the document provides a series of measures, with some of them specifically oriented to IoT, such as the  encouragement of “security by design” through the whole lifecycle of the devices that make up the Internet  of Things.

Moving from the EU to the US, it is worth highlighting the “Internet of Things Cybersecurity Improvement  Act of 2017”33, introduced on the 1st of August of 2017 by four U.S. senators, which was developed in  response to a series of IoT-related cyber-attacks that took place in 201634. This improvement act establishes  minimum cybersecurity requirements for connected devices purchased by the U.S. Government, including35:   Requiring vendors to ensure their devices are patchable, rely on industry standard protocols, do not use  hard-coded passwords, and do not contain any known security vulnerabilities;   Requiring vendors selling IoT devices are “to provide written certification that the device does not  contain, at the time of submitting the proposal, any hardware, software, or firmware component with  any known security vulnerabilities or defects”36. If a vendor identifies vulnerabilities, it must disclose  them and patch them in a timely manner37;   Requiring each executive agency to inventory all Internet-connected devices in use by the agency;   Along with NIST, specifying particular measures, e.g. network segmentation, for agencies to employ  them;   Directing the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) National Protection and Programs Directorate  (NPPD) to develop coordinated disclosure guidelines, allowing researchers to uncover vulnerabilities in  and share them with the vendors; and   Requiring an effectiveness report, with recommendations for updates, to be submitted to Congress after  5 years.  Target audience  This report provides a set of specific baseline security measures and recommendations that can be applied  to protect IoT systems and environments. The primary target audience of the report are organisations that  want to adopt IoT or are already adopting IoT solutions as well as the manufacturers and operators that  provide IoT products, solutions and services.

Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  18  2. The IoT paradigm  ENISA defines IoT as “a cyber-physical ecosystem of interconnected sensors and actuators, which enable  intelligent decision making”. Stemming from the definition is the fact that information lies at the heart of  IoT, feeding into a continuous cycle of sensing, decision making, and actions.  Figure 2: IoT pervasive ecosystem  Figure 2  illustrates the pervasive nature of IoT in that it is at the core of a plethora of both critical and non- critical infrastructures. IoT is pertinent to almost all aspects of daily life, affecting commercial applications,  the industrialisation, or the private sphere, to name a few. Inherently, IoT builds on embedding “intelligence”  in everyday objects, thus increasing the usefulness of what used to be common “things”, and therefore  facilitating all aspects of daily life by providing a greater automation and control in sectors such as industry,  energy, transport, health, retail, etc. The majority of the sectors associated with IoT are critical, and any  incident affecting them can thus severely affect society as a whole.  Industry 4.0 and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) are frequently and rightfully associated with IoT focusing  on digitising industries23. Industry 4.0 is the term coined to refer to the world’s fourth industrial revolution38.  It is defined as the brisk transformation in the design, manufacture, operation and service of manufacturing  systems and products, where digital technology and the Internet merge together with the conventional  industry, achieving digitally connected manufacturing operations with a highly integrated value chain38. In  this study, we focus on the more generic concept of IoT.  This chapter will provide a brief insight into the IoT elements and architecture, including the different  security considerations to be taken into account.  38 See EPRS, Ron Davies, «Industry 4.0», http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2015/568337/EPRS_BRI(2015)568337_EN.pdf  http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2015/568337/EPRS_BRI(2015)568337_EN.pdf  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  19  Elements of IoT  The following sections provide an overview of the different elements that shape the IoT ecosystem, namely  the Things in the IoT, intelligent decision making, sensors and actuators, communications and embedded  systems. A detailed IoT asset taxonomy can be found later in chapter 2.5.  2.1.1 Things in the Internet of Things  In IoT environments, a thing is a physical or virtual object capable of being identified and integrated into  communication networks. It is imperative for things to have the capability of communication – exchanging  data over a network between them and/or with the cloud backend services. Additionally, things may have  other optional features, such as sensing and capturing data, actuating, storing and processing data,  executing native or cloud-based applications, machine learning, etc39. The set of ‘things’ that compose an  IoT ecosystem can be managed by intelligent systems, which are able to autonomously connect to things for  monitoring and controlling them. Moreover, these intelligent systems can retrieve data from a thing or a set  of things and process that data, obtaining useful information in order to make an intelligent decision40.  2.1.2 Intelligent decision making  The number of devices connected to ‘intelligent systems’ that can store, process, analyse and share data is  sharply increasing. This will result in billions of ‘things’ and machines connected to networks and producing  even more data41. Hence, there is a need to deploy data analytics and smart data management techniques  in order to draw meaningful insight from the colossal volume of data being generated40. Moreover, IoT  encompasses the notion of actuating, for which decision making is necessary.  Intelligent decision-making depends first and foremost on the information available to make the decisions.  These decisions can be as simple as a threshold-crossing mechanism, or as advanced as machine learning or  deep learning systems42. The output of these decisions will eventually lead to actions and may feed new  information into the ecosystem. The information used to make intelligent decisions can be either analysed  locally, since some ‘things’ can process the data they gather themselves, or delegated to another element  of the IoT ecosystem, such as the cloud backend service, the aggregator/gateway, another ‘thing’, etc.  This whole process supports several aspects, such as context awareness and adaptation, autonomy, and  self-optimisation/configuration/healing/protection, to name a few.  2.1.3 Sensors and actuators  Sensors are one of the key building blocks of IoT, since they are an integral element that allows to monitor  the environment and the context on which IoT systems operate. They can be as small as millimetres in size,  making them easy to embed in physical objects – from roadways to pacemakers43.  On the physical level, sensors can measure defined physical, chemical or biological indicators, and on the  digital level, they collect information about the network and applications. They then generate associated  quantitative data, which can be processed in real-time, or stored for later retrieval, and that can be received  39 ITU-T Y.2060, «Overview of the Internet of things».

Some examples of sensors are accelerometers, temperature sensors,  pressure sensors, light sensors and acoustic sensors, among others.  Even if they are left unattended in some cases (e.g. roadways), sensors have become essential in a large  number of industries, gathering data for the network and applications to dynamically adapt to optimal  processes at any moment44.  An actuator can be considered as the entity responsible for moving or controlling a system or mechanism.  In simple terms, an actuator operates in the reverse direction of a sensor. It takes an electrical input and  turns it into physical action. Taking the example of smart lamps and smart thermostats, their actuators can  make use of the signal coming from a light sensor to regulate brightness, and of the signal coming from a  temperature sensor to regulate temperature, respectively. Actuators are also commonly used in  manufacturing and assembly processes, where  motors and solenoids are the primary examples of actuators  – for example, valves are a type of actuator, used to control a hydraulic system45.  To summarise, the functions of input devices are performed by sensors that gather information about their  environment and its context, which will be subsequently processed. In contrast, actuators serve as output  units – they act based on the processed information, executing decisions. It should be noted that, in most  IoT deployments, sensors and actuators are not only found standalone, but also integrated into embedded  systems.  2.1.4 Embedded systems  Sensors and actuators are the fundamental elements of IoT. They may be connected to the cloud backend  through gateways to have the data coming from the sensors processed, in order to make a decision. Instead  of only having sensor and/or actuator networks, IoT devices can also be found as embedded systems, which  include embedded sensors and/or actuators, as well as network capabilities to connect directly to a LAN or  to the cloud, a memory footprint and the ability to run software. Additionally, IoT embedded systems are  based on a processing unit that enables them to process data on their own. Some examples of devices that  contain embedded systems comprise medical implants, wearables such as smart watches, connected lights,  smart thermostats, etc. Figure 3 illustrates the structure of an embedded IoT system.  44 IEEE, «Towards a definition of the Internet of Things (IoT)».

The selection of protocols to be used in a particular deployment of IoT  ecosystems depends on the requirements of its use-case. The combination of different protocols within IoT  ecosystems is a common practice, using gateways to ensure interoperability.  IoT communication systems rely on the ability to both transmit and receive information units in a structured  manner, with services located either nearby or in a distant location, using different but interoperable kinds  of network types. These networks have different set of properties such as QoS, resilience, security and  management47.  The communication protocols within IoT ecosystems can be either wireless or wireline-based. There exists  a plethora of wireless communication protocols, including short-range radio protocols such as ZigBee48,  Bluetooth/Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)49, Wi-Fi/Wi-Fi HaLow50, Near Field Communication (NFC)51 or Radio  Frequency Identification (RFID)52; mobile networks and longer-range radio protocols such as LoRaWAN53,  SigFox54 NarrowBand-IoT (NB-IoT)55, or LTE-M56. Each of them is defined in its own standard, for example  ZigBee and ZigBee 3.0 are based on IEEE 802.15.4. Wired communication protocols and links, such as  Ethernet, USB, SPI, MIPI and I2C, among others, also provide access to the devices. Moreover, it is worth  highlighting that IoT communications also support non-IP based protocols, such as SMS, LiDar, Radar, etc.  46 Tara Salman, «Networking Protocols and Standards for Internet of Things».

In ENISA’s Smart Homes study7, the different kinds of networks were also  listed. Nevertheless, given the context of this study, a more generic/horizontal approach has been followed,  thus remaining consistent with the Smart Homes study.  Table 1 depicts an indicative listing of different protocols grouped by communication layer. The datalink  layer handles the connection between IoT devices across a physical link, either wired or wireless, for example  between sensors or between a sensor and the gateway that connects a set of sensors to the Internet. The  network layer is divided into the routing layer, which handles the packet transfer from the source to the  destination, and into the encapsulation layer, which builds the packets. The session layer defines the  protocols enabling messaging capabilities among the elements of the IoT communication subsystem46.  SESSION AMQP, CoAP, DDS, MQTT, XMPP  NETWORK  ENCAPSULATION 6LowPAN, Thread  ROUTING CARP, RPL  DATALINK Bluetooth / BLE, Wi-Fi / Wi-Fi HaLow, LoRaWAN, Neul, SigFox, Z-Wave, ZigBee, USB  Table 1: Indicative listing of communication protocols for IoT46  As stated before, IoT ‘things’ need to both transmit and receive data, yet they do not necessarily need an  Internet connection to do so, only the ability to pass the data they collect/receive on to other ‘things’ capable  of processing that information and/or sending it over an Internet connection. Therefore, it is possible for an  IoT ecosystem made up of multiple ‘things’ to operate without any of them being capable of connecting to  the Internet57. The use of the word ‘Internet’ in the term ‘Internet of Things’ should simply be seen as a  generalisation, implying the notion of connectivity. It should not be interpreted in a stricter, technical sense,  whereby an Internet connection or the IP protocol stack would be a requirement of the IoT ecosystem.  Security considerations  As we become increasingly reliant on intelligent, interconnected devices in every aspect of our lives, the  billions of “things” can be the target of intrusions and interferences that could dramatically jeopardise  personal privacy and threaten public safety58. Therefore, security is one of the main concerns regarding IoT,  which needs to be addressed along with the paramount need for safety, since both matters are tightly  intertwined with the physical world. Another important aspect involves administration of IoT devices,  namely who is going to be responsible for this especially considering the inherent complexity and  heterogeneity of the IoT ecosystem, as well as taking into account scalability concerns.  The following are generic issues identified by this study that hinder the consolidation of secure IoT  ecosystems:   Very large attack surface: The threats and risks related to IoT are manifold and evolve rapidly. Considering  their impact on citizens’ health, safety and privacy (data collection and processing may be unclear to the  users, since IoT is heavily based on the gathering, exchange and processing of large amounts of data from  a variety of sources, sometimes including sensitive data), the threat landscape concerning IoT is  extremely wide.  57 See https://qz.com/228750/the-internet-of-things-may-not-need-an-internet-connection/  58 See https://www.windriver.com/whitepapers/security-in-the-internet-of-things/wr_security-in-the-internet-of-things.pdf  https://qz.com/228750/the-internet-of-things-may-not-need-an-internet-connection/ https://www.windriver.com/whitepapers/security-in-the-internet-of-things/wr_security-in-the-internet-of-things.pdf  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  23   Limited device resources: Applying conventional security practices in IoT could require a substantial  reengineering due to technical constraints. The majority of IoT devices have limited capabilities, e.g.  processing, memory and power, and therefore advanced security controls cannot be effectively applied.   Complex ecosystem: Security concerns are exacerbated since IoT should not be seen as a collection of  independent devices, but rather as a rich, diverse and wide ecosystem involving aspects such as devices,  communications, interfaces, and people.   Fragmentation of standards and regulations: The fragmented and slow adoption of standards and  regulations to guide the adoption of IoT security measures and good practices, as well as the continuous  emergence of novel technologies, further complicate relevant concerns.   Widespread deployment: Apart from commercial applications of IoT, recent trends have seen Critical  Infrastructures (CIs) migrating toward Smart ones by employing IoT on top of legacy infrastructures.   Security integration: This is a very challenging task, due to the presence of possibly contradicting  viewpoints and requirements from all involved stakeholders. For example, different IoT devices and  systems may be based on different authentication solutions, which must be integrated and made  interoperable.   Safety aspects: They are very relevant in the IoT context because of the presence of actuators, which act  on the physical world. Security threats can become safety threats as, for instance, the recent  cybersecurity attacks on connected vehicles have demonstrated10.   Low cost: The wide penetration of IoT and the advanced functionalities it offers in several critical sectors  denotes the potential for significant cost savings by exploiting features such as data flows, advanced  monitoring, and integration to name a few. Conversely, it is often the case that the low cost that is usually  associated with IoT devices and systems will have implications in terms of security. Manufacturers might  be inclined to limit security features to ensure a low cost and thus product security might not be able to  protect against certain types of IoT attacks.   Lack of expertise: This is a rather novel domain and therefore there is a lack of people with the suitable  skillset and expertise in IoT cybersecurity.   Security updates: Applying security updates to IoT is extremely challenging, since the particularity of the  user interfaces available to users does not allow traditional update mechanisms. Securing of those  mechanisms is in itself a daunting task, especially considering Over-The-Air updates.   Insecure programming: Since the “time to market” pressure for IoT products is higher than in other  domains, this imposes constraints on the available efforts to develop security and privacy by design. For  this reason, and sometimes also due to budget issues, companies developing IoT products generally place  more emphasis on functionality and usability than on security.   Unclear liabilities: The lack of a clear assignment of liabilities might lead to ambiguities and conflicts in  case of a security incident, especially considering the large and complex supply chain involved in IoT.  Moreover, the question of how to manage security if one single component were shared by several  parties remains unanswered. Enforcing liability is another major issue.  Challenge of defining horizontal baseline security measures  ENISA together with the vast majority of the experts interviewed agree on the complexity of studying IoT  security in a horizontal way, due to the security measures and the impact of the threats being determined  by the criticality of the different assets, which differs depending on the use case, the application use and the  use scenario.  For each IoT environment it is necessary to carry out a risk assessment to go through the threats that can  affect the different assets, define the plausible attack scenarios, and put them in the context of the IoT  service defined, working out which hazards are critical or not and which ones can be mitigated. These  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  24  reasons highlight the intricacy involved in approaching the IoT in a horizontal way, rather than tackling a  specific IoT vertical59 such as Smart Cars10, Smart Airports11, Smart Hospitals12, Smart Homes7, Intelligent  Public Transport60, ICS/SCADA61, etc.  Nonetheless, this report considers the horizontal aspects of IoT as seen across vertical sectors and thus aims  to satisfy the paramount need to define baseline security measures for IoT across Critical Information  Infrastructures. In this respect, this report complements the aforementioned previous efforts of ENISA in  the vertical sectors and thus promotes a holistic approach towards IoT security.  Architecture  Since IoT solutions are developed with specific technologies and focus on specific applications, they lack  standardisation, which results in fragmented and heterogeneous architectures. ENISA studied and reviewed  several existing IoT architectures and based on them, put forward an architecture that encompasses key  elements of those architectures, promoting a significant degree of interoperability across different assets,  platforms environments, etc., with the ambition of laying down a common architectural basis for IoT in a  horizontal. The main IoT architectures studied are:   AIOTI High Level Architecture functional model62   FP7-ICT – IoT-A Architectural reference model63   NIST Network of Things (NoT)64   ITU-T IoT reference model39   ISO/IEC CD 30141 Internet of Things Reference Architecture (IoT RA)65   ISACA Conceptual IoT Architecture66   oneM2M Architecture Model67   IEEE P2413 - Standard for an Architectural Framework68  Having analysed the aforementioned architectures, we abstracted and extrapolated the fundamental  elements into a consolidated high-level IoT reference model, which encompasses the key elements of these  architectures. The objective was to utilise this high-level reference model (Figure 4) in order to define the  assets for IoT security and to assist us in consistently applying our methodology in identifying threats and  attacks. The following diagram depicts this high-level reference model.  59 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures  60 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practices-recommendations  61 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ics-scada-dependencies  62 See https://aioti-space.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AIOTI-WG3-IoT-High-Level-Architecture-Release_2_1.pdf  63 See http://www.meet-iot.eu/deliverables-IOTA/D1_5.pdf  64 See http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-183.pdf  65 See https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/wiki/images/9/9a/10N0536_CD_text_of_ISO_IEC_30141.pdf  66 See https://www.isaca.org/Journal/archives/2017/Volume-3/Pages/default.aspx  67 See http://www.onem2m.org/images/files/deliverables/Release2/TS-0001-%20Functional_Architecture-V2_10_0.pdf  68 See https://standards.ieee.org/develop/project/2413.html  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practices-recommendations https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ics-scada-dependencies https://aioti-space.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AIOTI-WG3-IoT-High-Level-Architecture-Release_2_1.pdf http://www.meet-iot.eu/deliverables-IOTA/D1_5.pdf http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-183.pdf https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/wiki/images/9/9a/10N0536_CD_text_of_ISO_IEC_30141.pdf https://www.isaca.org/Journal/archives/2017/Volume-3/Pages/default.aspx http://www.onem2m.org/images/files/deliverables/Release2/TS-0001-%20Functional_Architecture-V2_10_0.pdf https://standards.ieee.org/develop/project/2413.html  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  25  Figure 4: IoT High-level reference model  The different elements that compose the IoT high-level reference model are illustrated in Figure 4. It should  be noted that we do not aspire to set forth a novel IoT architecture or reference model. Conversely, by  analysing existing such efforts we aim at abstracting their fundamental elements in order to coherently and  systematically identify the assets to be protected. Moreover, the horizontal nature of security should be  underlined in the context of the IoT ecosystem. It applies to all the different elements of the reference model  – not only the devices that need to be secured logically and physically, but also the communications, the  network elements, the stored information, the cloud platform, etc. With no intention of being exhaustive,  there are several security considerations to take into account, such as for example authentication,  availability, resilience and authorisation mechanisms, or the use of encryption to protect the confidentiality  of data, both at rest and in transit. Figure 4 indicatively lists some of the security mechanisms that can be  considered, whereas it should also be noted that privacy has an equally important place and should be also  considered across the IoT ecosystem.  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  26  Asset taxonomy  Tackling cyber security starts from asset identification and decomposition. This section provides an overview  of the key asset groups and assets to be protected in an IoT ecosystem. Since we are approaching IoT in a  horizontal way, the level of protection for a given asset will vary depending on the use case, the application  used and the use scenario of said IoT ecosystem.  The different IoT assets have been divided into the key asset groups defined. This asset taxonomy is depicted  in Figure 5, and Table 2 details and elaborates on the different assets. It should be noted that the lowest  level of the taxonomy is indicative and not exhaustive. For instance, not all sensor types are listed, just some  representative ones. This also applies to the networks, the protocols, etc.  Figure 5: Asset taxonomy  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  27  ASSET GROUP ASSETS DESCRIPTION  IoT Devices  Hardware  The different physical components (except sensors and actuators) from which the IoT  devices can be built. These include microcontrollers, microprocessors, the physical ports  of the device, the motherboard, etc.  Software  Software comprises the IoT device’s OS, its firmware and the programs and applications  installed/running.  Sensors  These are the subsystems whose purpose is to detect and/or measure events in its  environment and send the information to other electronics in order to be processed.  There are sensors for a lot of purposes, such as to measure temperature, motion, etc.  Actuators  These are IoT device’s output units, which execute decisions based on previously  processed information.  Other IoT  Ecosystem  Devices  Devices to interface  with Things  These are devices whose purpose is to serve as an interface or as an aggregator between  other IoT devices of a given IoT ecosystem. Moreover, devices used by users to interface  and interact with IoT devices.  Devices to manage  Things  These are devices specially designed to manage other IoT devices, networks etc.  Embedded systems  They are based on a processing unit that enables them to process data on their own.  They include embedded sensors and/or actuators, network capabilities to connect  directly to the cloud, a memory footprint and the ability to run software.  Communications  Networks  They allow the different nodes of an IoT ecosystem to exchange data and information  with each other, via a data link. There are different kinds of networks according to their  spatial coverage, which include (W)LANs, (W)PANs, PANs and (W)WANs, among others.  Protocols  They define the set of rules on how communication between two or more IoT devices  must be performed through a given channel. There are many communication protocols,  which can be either wireless or wireline-based. Examples of IoT communication  protocols are ZigBee, MQTT, CoAP, BLE, etc.  Infrastructure  Routers  They are the networking components that forward data packets between the different  networks of the IoT ecosystem.  Gateways  These are the network nodes used for interfacing with another network from the IoT  environment that uses different protocols. Gateways may provide protocol translators,  fault isolators, etc., to provide system interoperability.  Power supply  It supplies electric power to an IoT device and to its internal components. The power  source can be external and wired or a battery integrated in the device itself.  Security assets  This group comprises the assets specifically focused on the security of the IoT devices,  networks and information. Most prominently, these include firewalls, Web Application  Firewalls (WAF), CASBs for protecting the cloud, IDSs, IPSs and  authentication/authorisation systems.  Platform &  Backend  Web-based services  These are services within the World Wide Web, which provide a web-based interface to  web users or to web-connected applications. This means web technologies can be used  in IoT for Human-to-Machine (H2M) communications and for M2M communications.  Cloud infrastructure  and services  In IoT, the cloud backend can be used to aggregate and process data from dispersed  devices, and it also provides computing capabilities, storage, applications, services, etc.  Decision making  Data mining  This refers to algorithms and services to process collected data and transform it into a  defined structure for further use, using big data technologies for discovering patterns  in very large data sets.  Data processing and  computing  Services facilitating the processing of gathered data in order to obtain useful  information, which can be used to apply rules and logic, to make decisions and to  automate processes. Machine learning can be employed to learn from the use of  information available over time.  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  28  Applications &  Services  Data analytics and  visualisation  Once the data has been collected and processed, the resulting information can be  analysed and visualised in order to identify new patterns, improve operational  efficiency, etc.  Device and network  management  The management of the IoT ecosystem devices and networks includes the software  updates of the OS, firmware and applications. It also encompasses the tracking and  monitoring of the devices and networks, collecting and storing logs that can later be  used for diagnostics.  Device usage  The contextualisation of the IoT ecosystem devices and networks, so as to understand  the current status, usage patterns, performance, etc.  Information  At rest Information stored in a database in the cloud backend or in the devices themselves.  In transit  Information sent or exchanged through the network between two or more IoT  elements.  In use Information used by an application, service or IoT element in general.  Table 2: Asset taxonomy  Figure 6 provides a view of the criticality of the main assets described in the asset taxonomy, based on the  responses received by the subject matter experts in the interviews. These interviews involved a structured  questionnaire where one of the questions the experts were asked was to evaluate the main IoT assets  according to their criticality. The experts could classify the assets as not important, of low importance, of  medium importance, of high importance and of crucial importance.  It is worth putting again special emphasis on the complexity of defining the criticality of a given asset in a  horizontal way rather than considering a specific vertical use case. Abstracting from this fact is very  challenging, but that is the goal of this report.  Figure 6: Asset criticality  22%  28%  33%  39%  39%  44%  50%  50%  56%  56%  61%  61%  61%  67%  67%  67%  72%  78%  0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80%  VPN  WAN  Firewalls, IDS/IPS  LAN  Sensitive information  Software  Smartphones/Tablets  Cloud infrastructure/services  Devices to interface and manage things  Decision systems  Routers  Database servers  Actuators  Applications & Services  Gateways  Communication protocols  Device & network management  Sensors  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  29  The main findings here are that the most critical assets are the sensors, then the device and network  management controls and thirdly the communication protocols, the gateways and the applications and  services, all of them marked as critical by at least two thirds or more of the experts interviewed. Therefore,  when addressing security in IoT, those assets should be prioritised. Once again, these results are based on a  horizontal approach; hence, they could vary depending on the different deployments and use cases.  Anyhow, conducting an asset and risk assessment is key to determine the criticality of the assets and threats  that affect a specific IoT environment.  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  30  3. Threats and risk analysis  The main objective of this chapter is to determine and list the main security threats, vulnerabilities, risk  factors and attack scenarios that affect IoT devices and networks, taking the different levels of importance  and criticality the interviewed experts provided for each threat, risk and attack scenario into consideration.  Furthermore, the three most critical attack scenarios are developed in detail in order to underline their  intricacies and propose specific security measures to counter their impact and adverse effects.  Security incidents  The number of security threats targeting IoT devices has increased over the last years. Figure 7 illustrates  some of the main IoT security incidents that have been discovered and/or have taken place since 2009, so  as to highlight how the number attacks on IoT have greatly increased. It should be noted that this list is not  exhaustive, it includes only the main examples. Given the ever wider penetration of IoT across the entire  spectrum of daily activities and critical infrastructures, the occurrence of cybersecurity incidents is bound to  have an increasing rate. A more detailed description of each security incident can be found in Annex D.  Figure 7: Indicative timeline of IoT security incidents  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  31  Threat taxonomy  As observed in the previous section, the number of attacks directly related to IoT has grown over the last  few years reaching the point where it became mainstream news article in 2016 with the Mirai botnet  attacks. These attacks, in their great majority, are related to devices that have been violated or to systems  that have been compromised, increasing at the same time the number of hazards to be faced in IoT.  Being consistent with the ENISA Threat Taxonomy69, we depict in Figure 8 the threat taxonomy focused  on IoT with some examples of attacks listed (non exhaustive listing).  69 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/enisa-threat-landscape/etl2015/enisa-threat-taxonomy-a- tool-for-structuring-threat-information  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/enisa-threat-landscape/etl2015/enisa-threat-taxonomy-a-tool-for-structuring-threat-information https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/enisa-threat-landscape/etl2015/enisa-threat-taxonomy-a-tool-for-structuring-threat-information  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  32  Figure 8: IoT Threat taxonomy  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  33  Nevertheless, the different threats have different potential impacts, since they vary according to the use  case scenarios. In the interviews, the IoT experts provided insight into the varying impact of the threats. The  most relevant ones are shown in Figure 9.  Figure 9: IoT threats impact  The impact of each threat was determined by calculating a weighted average of the responses from the  interviewees, which were based on a five-step scale that ranged from no importance to crucial importance.  While Figure 9 provides a visual representation of each threat’s impact, Figure 10 depicts the exact result of  the calculation, where values between 3 and 3.5 out of 5 represent medium-importance threats, values  between 3.5 and 4 out of 5 represent high-importance threats, and values over 4 out of 5 represent crucial- importance threats. Values below 3 out of 5 represent low-importance and no-importance threat, but it  should be noted that no threat got that rating. Moreover, it can be seen that the average impact is rated as  high, since the value of the average impact is 3.7 out of 5.

The different attack scenarios and the level of  importance of each attack have been gathered from the desktop research as well as the information  provided by the experts who have contributed to the report.  It is worth noting that the attacks may take place throughout the whole process, and the impact that attacks  may have on each specific part of the process has also been analysed. The importance level provided for  each sample attack scenario ranges from low and medium through high and crucial, representing the  negative impact level these attacks could have in a real-life incident, according to the input of the experts  interviewed. This information is synthesised in Table 4.  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  36  ATTACK SCENARIOS IMPORTANCE LEVEL  1. Against the network link between controller(s) and actuators High – Crucial  2. Against sensors, modifying the values read by them or their threshold values and settings High – Crucial  3. Against actuators, modifying or sabotaging their normal settings High – Crucial  4. Against the administration systems of IoT High – Crucial  5. Exploiting protocol vulnerabilities High  6.

Power source manipulation and exploitation of vulnerabilities in data readings Medium – High  10. Ransomware Medium – Crucial70  Table 4: IoT attack scenarios  For these scenarios, additional relevant feedback in the context of this report was received. Each section  includes a brief description, the potential impact, and threats:  1. Against the network link between controller(s) and actuators  Eavesdropping is a threat that allows an attacker to extract sensitive and operational information that can  be used for multiple malicious activities, including later attacks against IoT systems. In Advanced Persistent  Threat (APT) attacks, eavesdropping and information gathering comprise one of the first stages carried out  in order to identify weak spots and potential entry/attack points.   Impact: the main effect is the leakage of data. Depending on the environment, the severity can be  lower or greater, but it may also be signalling a larger attack in progress.   Threats related: eavesdropping and leakage of sensitive data.  2. Against sensors, modifying the values read by them or their threshold values and settings  The attacker manipulates the configuration of the sensors, changing the threshold values established on the  sensors, to allow out-of-range read values to be accepted when they should not, posing a severe threat to  the systems and installations. As larger installations usually have multiple and redundant sensors, the  attacker would have to compromise multiple sensors for the attack to be efficient; if only one were  compromised, the readings could be compensated with the input from the rest of the sensors.   Impact: allowing sensors to report and accept incorrect values puts the IoT environment at risk; a  malfunctioning sensor may allow a power spike to go through, physically damaging the systems.  70 Depending on the target, the impact of the attack could range from medium through crucial. For instance, the impact of the ransomware attack  against the digital key system of a hotel, example found in Figure 7 and in Annex D:, was not critical. Nevertheless, a ransomware the size of WannaCry  (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/info-notes/wannacry-ransomware-outburst) aimed against IoT infrastructures could have an extreme  impact and affect systems at an international scale.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/info-notes/wannacry-ransomware-outburst  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  37   Threats related: attacks on privacy and leakages of sensitive data/modification of information.  3. Against actuators, modifying or sabotaging their normal settings Manipulation of the actuators’ configuration/parameters making them use wrong configurations, thresholds or data, and therefore affecting their normal behaviour by sabotaging their normal operation settings.   Impact: it varies depending on the actuators affected. It can affect production processes.   Threats related: network outage and counterfeit by malicious devices.  4. Against the administration systems of IoT An attacker tries to gain full control over the administration system of an IoT system or device, potentially compromising the whole environment. It can be quite successful if weak or default passwords are used. This type of attack comprises different stages/phases and it is usually launched in a covert manner. It should be noted that this type of attack should be taken into account for the entire lifecycle of the device.   Impact: the compromise, manipulation or interruption of certain IoT systems could affect many people, cause environmental issues and even extend to other systems, affecting their communications or even disabling them.   Threats related: weak passwords, exploit kits, attacks on privacy, malware and DDoS.  5. Exploit Protocol vulnerabilities This type of exploitation is usually the gateway to launch other types of attacks; it is a means to an end. Exploits are used to gain privileged unauthorised access to a system, which can lead to the installation of other malicious content or backdoors. It is used as part of an attack, regardless of whether the target is a single system/device or a whole network. It is difficult to detect these exploits, and it is much easier to detect the actions carried out after the exploit has been successful.   Impact: if successful, the exploit creates an entry point to a system, in some cases with elevated privileges; if not, the system is likely to crash or become unstable. This attack is always used as part of a larger attack, which could be a simple data theft or a complex APT.   Threats related: exploit kits, malware and APTs.  6. Against devices by injecting commands into the system console This type of attack takes place when an attacker injects and executes commands with privileges in a compromised system through its console.   Impact: if the attacker is able to inject commands into a device, he or she could manage to breach another machine in the environment. This would produce a cascade effect on the system, and the attacker would be able to use all these devices for malicious purposes.   Threats related: Exploit kits, DDoS and network outage.  7. Stepping stone attacks This type of attack is a common way to launch anonymous attacks. They are often used by network intruders to hide their identities, since they launch attacks not from their own computer but from intermediary hosts that they previously compromised.   Impact: if an attacker launches a stepping stone attack, he or she could compromise a collection of hosts, using them as stepping stones to relay attack commands.   Threats related: APTs, DDoS, counterfeit by malicious devices.  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  38  8. DDoS using an IoT botnet This type of attack does not target IoT devices themselves, but instead it uses them to attack other devices, not necessarily IoT ones. Firstly, a malware automatically finds vulnerable Internet of Things devices, infecting and conscripting them into a botnet, which then can be used to mount DDoS attacks, flooding the target's servers with malicious traffic.   Impact: the target device or service will be flooded with malicious traffic, taking it down.   Threats related: exploit kits, DDoS and counterfeit by malicious devices.  9. Power source manipulation and exploitation of vulnerabilities in data readings These attacks focus on manipulating power sources and exploiting vulnerabilities to modify the power data read. An attacker can tamper with the device’s battery or power input cabling either physically, by manipulating the power source itself, or with malware, by manipulating the way a device reads the information coming from the power source in order to, for example, make the device believe the battery level is higher or lower than the actual level. Some types of smart devices may be dependent on batteries for their normal operation. This feature may seem like an advantage over the less usual cables but, far from this, it requires taking into account certain aspects of security.   Impact: physical tampering a battery can damage it, potentially causing the device not being able to operate at all. The manipulation of the way a device reads the charge level coming from the battery can lead to the device believing the battery level is higher than the real one, causing the device to run out of battery and shut down, or lower than the real one, causing the device to enter a power- saving mode of operation, affecting the performance of the device.   Threats related: malware, physical attacks.  10. Ransomware These attacks are carried out by a malware that perpetually blocks access to the victim's data unless a ransom is paid. Since these attacks are malware-based, they can be evaded by updating/patching vulnerable devices. This can be also done outside the IoT ecosystem, such as with the WannaCry attack that took place on May 201770, where the patch for the vulnerability that WannaCry exploited was released months before the attack. The problem regarding IoT is the difficulty to update/patch the different devices - some of them do not even have the ability to be updated or patched.   Impact: there are many possible targets for ransomware within IoT – an attacker could take control of a smart thermostat in the middle of winter and demand payment before the heat can be turned on, he could hold power grids or hospitals systems for ransom, etc., putting people safety at risk.   Threats related: exploit kits, DDoS, malware, weak passwords.  Critical attack scenarios  During the interviews with experts and relevant stakeholders, the aforementioned attack scenarios  regarding IoT environments were described and detailed. The experts were asked to rank the 10 example  attack scenarios in terms of criticality and the following three were also the most worrisome ones for  interviewees. Figure 11 depicts the average criticality of a given attack scenario based on the input gathered  from the expert interviews. Again, the challenge lies in defining the criticality level of an attack on an IoT  environment when doing so in a horizontal manner.  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  39  Figure 11: Attack scenario criticality  The three attack scenarios that stand out are:   Attack Scenario 1: IoT administration system compromise   Attack Scenario 2: Value manipulation in IoT devices   Attack Scenario 3: Botnet / Commands Injection  The following sections detail each of these scenarios, including their impact, the stakeholders involved, the  cascade effect risk, the gaps, the countermeasures that can be applied to protect against them, and more  technical details. The detailed description of each one of those countermeasures can be found in Annex A:  and in Annex B:.  3.4.1 Attack scenario 1: IoT administration system compromise  This attack covers an infection designed to take control over one or multiple IoT devices within an IoT  environment, in order to manipulate or crash them and to be able to modify values, change their  functioning/behaviour or deny access to them. This attack scenario is based on an Enterprise gateway  attack71,72.  As depicted in Figure 12, the first step is to gather information in the network about the different IoT devices  used in the enterprise. Once an IoT device is identified and selected, the attacker gathers specific information  about its vulnerabilities. The next step is to exploit the different vulnerabilities found in that device, and to  compromise the network. After that, the attacker ensures the persistence of the access to the system by  configuring a backdoor. At this point, the attacker only needs to update the system (e.g. with a modified  firmware) for the device to be permanently compromised.

When compromised, the attacker is capable of performing  administrative tasks within those assets, such as extracting confidential information from them, making them malfunction  and directly affecting the behaviour of the IoT environment, etc. Since a compromised administration system leads to several  assets being compromised over a long period of time and without being detected, the impact of this attack can be critical.  EASE OF DETECTION CASCADE EFFECT RISK  Medium: the changes to an IoT administration system can be  detected through a correct monitoring and a proper logging  system.  High: the risk entailed is that, once an IoT device belonging  to a specific IoT network is compromised, it becomes very  easy to compromise the rest.

A backdoor is installed in order to maintain access to that system 7. The attacker ensures the IoT systems are updated with modified firmware either by downloading and updating the  firmware instantly, or by modifying the repository of update files. This is done to grant the attacker exclusive access and  restrict other remote accesses  8. Finally the attacker takes control over the IoT environment  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  41  Table 5: Attack 1 – IoT administration system compromise  3.4.2 Attack scenario 2: Value manipulation in IoT devices  The manipulation of calibration parameters established for the sensors allows undesired values to be  accepted when they should not, which poses a severe threat to critical systems. This attack targets the  sensor processing and knowledge model levels of the control system of an industrial robot in an Industry 4.0  environment73.  Figure 13 describes this attack, which starts with the calibration of a robot sensing equipment after a  configuration change or when connected to a controller. The calibration data initially stored in the sensing  equipment is transmitted to the controller during the system boot. Since the robot uses its local copy of that  data, an attacker can manipulate the calibration parameters, causing the robot to move erratically or  unexpectedly (in decision making, wrong input values lead to wrong decisions).  73 See https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/wp/wp-industrial-robot-security.pdf  RECOVERY TIME / EFFORT GAPS AND CHALLENGES  Medium: it depends on the perimeter of the assets  compromised and on the number of assets infected.

EASE OF DETECTION CASCADE EFFECT RISK  Easy – Medium: its detection is between easy and medium  since an operator can see whether the outcome and the  robot’s behaviour are correct or not.

A  botnet is a network of automatic devices that interact to accomplish some distributed task. Due to the  characteristic interconnection of IoT devices and their poor configuration, carrying out such an attack is  simple. This attack scenario is based on the Mirai botnet74, which has conducted several of the most forceful  DDoS attacks in recent history, and has proven capable of attacking varied kinds of targets, from  KrebsOnSecurity website to a whole country’s telecommunication infrastructure75. Therefore, with potential  targets such as a hazardous energy infrastructure, the impact of a Mirai’s attack can reach extremely critical  levels.  The steps to follow in order to carry out this type of attack are illustrated in Figure 14. The first one is  scanning open ports in IoT devices that are accessible over the Internet, which are usually poorly protected  by default usernames and passwords that, users never change. Once the attacker gains access to the device,  he or she will inject commands into the device’s console in order to obtain administrator privileges. If the  attacker succeeds in obtaining these permissions, he or she will then make the device connect to a Command  and Control (C&C) under his or her control, to download and execute a malicious script. The script will then  be executed, deleting itself afterward and running in-memory. Then, it will begin to spread, attacking the  same way other vulnerable devices, in order to gather an IoT device army, conscripting them into a botnet,  which the attacker will be able to control from a C&C centre, in order to launch distributed attacks conducted  by the botnet.  74 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/info-notes/major-ddos-attacks-involving-iot-devices  75 See http://www.energycollection.us/Companies/ICIT/Rise-Machines.pdf  GP-PS-10: Establish and maintain asset management procedures and configuration controls for key network and information systems  GP-PS-11: Identify significant risks using a defence-in-depth approach  GP-TM-15: Design with system and operational disruption in mind, preventing the system from causing unacceptable  risk of injury or physical damage  GP-TM-31: Measures for tamper protection and detection.

EASE OF DETECTION CASCADE EFFECT RISK  Hard: due to the ignorance about the characteristics and  configuration of these devices, these attacks tend to be hard  to detect and identify the source, which allows them to pass  undetected for long periods of time, and they are also  complex to investigate and recover from.  Critical: this type of attack has a tremendous cascade effect.  Once a device is infected, the goal is to identify other  vulnerable devices to extend the network.

Security measures and good practices  This chapter provides a detailed list of security measures and good practices, which aim to mitigate the  threats, vulnerabilities and risks identified in the study that affect IoT devices and environments. These  security measures and good practices have been defined with the aim to apply to the different IoT  environments and deployments in a horizontal manner, instead of providing IoT vertical-specific security.  Therefore, the security measures defined cover a wide range of security considerations, such as security by  design, data protection, risk analysis, etc.  The set of security measures / good practices of this report has been determined based on a very extensive  and thorough desktop research, which took into account different security guidelines, standards, etc. The  list of these resources can be found in Annex C:.  The different security measures and good practices identified fall into several security domains defined for  the report. This domain division’s purpose is to cover every IoT environment horizontally, so as to classify  and define which security measures apply to which different IoT ecosystem areas. The proposed security  domains are organised as follows:   Information System Security Governance & Risk Management: Includes security measures regarding  information system security risk analysis, policy, accreditation, indicators and audit, and human resource  security.   Ecosystem Management: Includes security measures regarding ecosystem mapping and ecosystem  relations.   IT Security Architecture: Includes security measures regarding systems configuration, asset management,  system segregation, traffic filtering and cryptography.   IT Security Administration: Includes security measures regarding administration accounts and  administration information systems.   Identity and access management: Includes security measures regarding authentication, identification and  access rights.   IT security maintenance: Includes security measures regarding IT security maintenance procedures and  remote access.   Physical and environmental security   Detection: Includes security measures regarding detection, logging, and log correlation and analysis.   Computer security incident management: Includes security measures regarding information system  security incident analysis and response, and incident report.   Continuity of Operations: Includes security measures regarding business continuity management and  disaster recovery management.   Crisis Management: Includes security measures regarding crisis management organization and process.  These security domains have been considered when developing the different security measures/good  practices for IoT, which can be found below in points 4.1 through 4.3. The detailed description of each  security measure/good practice and its security domain, along with the documents and references that have  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  47  been analysed in order to extract it, can be found in Annex A: together with all the relevant examples.  Additionally, in Annex B:, each security measure can be found mapped to the threats related to it.  As mentioned earlier, these security domains classify the security measures based on which area of an IoT  ecosystem they apply to. Apart from their area of application, each security measure can be arranged  according to its nature – they can be policies that must be taken into account when developing the devices,  organisational measures focused on the business and employees that need to be adopted by the  organisation itself, and finally, technical measures aimed at reducing the potential risks that the IoT devices  and other elements of the IoT ecosystem may be subject to. Accordingly, the identified IoT baseline security  measures (denoted henceforth as GP-Good Practices) are presented here and arranged according to three  main categories:   Policies (PS)   Organisational, People and Process measures (OP)   Technical Measures (TM)  Policies  The first set of security measures refers to policies that generally target information security and aim at  making it more concrete and robust. These should be adequate for the organisation’s activity and must  contain well documented information. In this context, the following security good practices have been  defined.  It is worth mentioning that when referring to security and privacy by design, the security measures should  reflect the particularities and the context in which the IoT device or system will be deployed (for example,  security by design will refer to different specifications when an IoT device at a home environment is  considered, compared to the case of an IoT device in a critical infrastructure). As discussed, when it comes  to IoT the cyber risk is context-dependent (i.e. based on the application scenario) and in this respect the  security measures should be applied with this consideration in mind.  4.1.1 Security by design   GP-PS-01: Consider the security of the whole IoT system from a consistent and holistic approach during  its whole lifecycle across all levels of device/application design and development, integrating security throughout the development, manufacture, and deployment.   GP-PS-02: Ensure the ability to integrate different security policies and techniques.   GP-PS-03: Security must consider the risk posed to human safety.   GP-PS-04: Designing for power conservation should not compromise security.   GP-PS-05: Design architecture by compartments to encapsulate elements in case of attacks.   GP-PS-06: For IoT hardware manufacturers and IoT software developers it is necessary to implement test plans to verify whether the product performs as it is expected. Penetration tests help to identify malformed input handling, authentication bypass attempts and overall security posture.   GP-PS-07: For IoT software developers it is important to conduct code review during implementation as it helps to reduce bugs in a final version of a product.  4.1.2 Privacy by design   GP-PS-08: Make privacy an integral part of the system.   GP-PS-09: Perform privacy impact assessments before any new applications are launched.  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  48  4.1.3 Asset Management   GP-PS-10: Establish and maintain asset management procedures and configuration controls for key  network and information systems.  4.1.4 Risk and Threat Identification and Assessment   GP-PS-11: Identify significant risks using a defence-in-depth approach.   GP-PS-12: Identify the intended use and environment of a given IoT device.  Organisational, People and Process measures  All businesses must have organisational criteria for information security. Their personnel practices need to  promote good security, ensure the management of processes and safely operate the information in the  organisation practices. Organisations should ensure that contractors and suppliers are responsible and  accountable for the functions considered. In the event of an incident in the safety of the organisation, the  organisation must be prepared (responsibilities, evaluation and response).  4.2.1 End-of-life support   GP-OP-01: Develop an end-of-life strategy for IoT products.   GP-OP-02: Disclose the duration and end-of-life security and patch support (beyond product warranty).   GP-OP-03: Monitor the performance and patch known vulnerabilities up until the “end-of-support|”  period of a product’s lifecycle.  4.2.2 Proven solutions   GP-OP-04: Use proven solutions, i.e. well known communications protocols and cryptographic  algorithms, recognized by the scientific community, etc. Certain proprietary solutions, such as custom  cryptographic algorithms, should be avoided.  4.2.3 Management of security vulnerabilities and/or incidents   GP-OP-05: Establish procedures for analysing and handling security incidents.   GP-OP-06: Coordinated disclosure of vulnerabilities.   GP-OP-07: Participate in information-sharing platforms to report vulnerabilities and receive timely and  critical information about current cyber threats and vulnerabilities from public and private partners.   GP-OP-08: Create a publicly disclosed mechanism for vulnerability reports, e.g. Bug Bounty programs.  4.2.4 Human Resources Security Training and Awareness   GP-OP-09: Ensure the personnel practices promote privacy and security – train employees in good privacy  and security practices.   GP-OP-10: Document and monitor the privacy and security training activities.   GP-OP-11: Ensure that cybersecurity roles and responsibilities for all workforce are established and  introduce personnel assignments in accordance with the specifics of the projects and security engineering  needs.  4.2.5 Third-Party relationships   GP-OP-12: Data processed by a third-party must be protected by a data processing agreement.   GP-OP-13: Only share consumers’ personal data with third parties with express consent of the  consumers, unless otherwise required and limited for the use of product features or service operations.   GP-OP-14: For IoT hardware manufacturers and IoT software developers it is necessary to adopt cyber  supply chain risk management policies and to communicate cyber security requirements to its suppliers  and partners.  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  49  Technical Measures  Evidently, the security measures and good practices need to consider and cover the technical elements, in  order to diminish the vulnerabilities of IoT. Below we provide an overview of the necessary technical  measures to preserve and protect the security of information in IoT. Since these are horizontal measures  across vertical sectors/CIIs, given the particularities of each vertical, more concrete measures can be  introduced for each vertical/CII.  Applying these technical measures should take into account the particularities of the IoT ecosystem such as  scalability, namely given the huge number of involved devices certain measures might need to be carried  out at the level of specialised architectural components, e.g. gateways.  4.3.1 Hardware security   GP-TM-01: Employ a hardware-based immutable root of trust.   GP-TM-02: Use hardware that incorporates security features to strengthen the protection and integrity  of the device – for example, specialised security chips / coprocessors that integrate security at the  transistor level, embedded in the processor, providing, among other things, a trusted storage of device  identity and authentication means, protection of keys at rest and in use, and preventing unprivileged  from accessing to security sensitive code. Protection against local and physical attacks can be covered via  functional security.  4.3.2 Trust and Integrity Management   GP-TM-03: Trust must be established in the boot environment before any trust in any other software or  executable program can be claimed.   GP-TM-04: Sign code cryptographically to ensure it has not been tampered with after signing it as safe  for the device, and implement run-time protection and secure execution monitoring to make sure  malicious attacks do not overwrite code after it is loaded.   GP-TM-05: Control the installation of software in operating systems, to prevent unauthenticated  software and files from being loaded onto it.   GP-TM-06: Enable a system to return to a state that was known to be secure, after a security breach has  occured or if an upgrade has not been successful.   GP-TM-07: Use protocols and mechanisms able to represent and manage trust and trust relationships.  4.3.3 Strong default security and privacy   GP-TM-08: Any applicable security features should be enabled by default, and any unused or insecure  functionalities should be disabled by default.   GP-TM-09: Establish hard to crack, device-individual default passwords.  4.3.4 Data protection and compliance   GP-TM-10: Personal data must be collected and processed fairly and lawfully, it should never be collected  and processed without the data subject’s consent.   GP-TM-11: Make sure that personal data is used for the specified purposes for which they were collected,  and that any further processing of personal data is compatible and that the data subjects are well  informed.   GP-TM-12: Minimise the data collected and retained.   GP-TM-13: IoT stakeholders must be compliant with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).   GP-TM-14: Users of IoT products and services must be able to exercise their rights to information, access,  erasure, rectification, data portability, restriction of processing, objection to processing, and their right  not to be evaluated on the basis of automated processing.  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  50  4.3.5 System safety and reliability   GP-TM-15: Design with system and operational disruption in mind, preventing the system from causing  an unacceptable risk of injury or physical damage.   GP-TM-16: Mechanisms for self-diagnosis and self-repair/healing to recover from failure, malfunction or  a compromised state.   GP-TM-17: Ensure standalone operation - essential features should continue to work with a loss of  communications and chronicle negative impacts from compromised devices or cloud-based systems.  4.3.6 Secure Software / Firmware updates   GP-TM-18: Ensure that the device software/firmware, its configuration and its applications have the  ability to update Over-The-Air (OTA), that the update server is secure, that the update file is transmitted  via a secure connection, that it does not contain sensitive data (e.g. hardcoded credentials), that it is  signed by an authorised trust entity and encrypted using accepted encryption methods, and that the  update package has its digital signature, signing certificate and signing certificate chain, verified by the  device before the update process begins.   GP-TM-19: Offer an automatic firmware update mechanism.   GP-TM-20: Backward compatibility of firmware updates. Automatic firmware updates should not modify  user-configured preferences, security, and/or privacy settings without user notification.  4.3.7 Authentication   GP-TM-21: Design the authentication and authorisation schemes (unique per device) based on the  system-level threat models.   GP-TM-22: Ensure that default passwords and even default usernames are changed during the initial  setup, and that weak, null or blank passwords are not allowed.   GP-TM-23: Authentication mechanisms must use strong passwords or personal identification numbers  (PINs), and should consider using two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication (MFA)  like Smartphones, Biometrics, etc., on top of certificates.   GP-TM-24: Authentication credentials shall be salted, hashed and/or encrypted.   GP-TM-25: Protect against ‘brute force’ and/or other abusive login attempts. This protection should also  consider keys stored in devices.   GP-TM-26: Ensure password recovery or reset mechanism is robust and does not supply an attacker with  information indicating a valid account. The same applies to key update and recovery mechanisms.  4.3.8 Authorisation   GP-TM-27: Limit the actions allowed for a given system by Implementing fine-grained authorisation  mechanisms and using the Principle of least privilege (POLP): applications must operate at the lowest  privilege level possible.   GP-TM-28: Device firmware should be designed to isolate privileged code, processes and data from  portions of the firmware that do not need access to them. Device hardware should provide isolation  concepts to prevent unprivileged from accessing security sensitive code.  4.3.9 Access Control - Physical and Environmental security   GP-TM-29: Data integrity and confidentiality must be enforced by access controls. When the subject  requesting access has been authorised to access particular processes, it is necessary to enforce the  defined security policy.   GP-TM-30: Ensure a context-based security and privacy that reflects different levels of importance.   GP-TM-31: Measures for tamper protection and detection. Detection and reaction to hardware  tampering should not rely on network connectivity.  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  51   GP-TM-32: Ensure that the device cannot be easily disassembled and that the data storage medium is  encrypted at rest and cannot be easily removed.   GP-TM-33: Ensure that devices only feature the essential physical external ports (such as USB) necessary  for them to function and that the test/debug modes are secure, so they cannot be used to maliciously  access the devices. In general, lock down physical ports to only trusted connections.  4.3.10 Cryptography   GP-TM-34: Ensure a proper and effective use of cryptography to protect the confidentiality, authenticity  and/or integrity of data and information (including control messages), in transit and in rest. Ensure the  proper selection of standard and strong encryption algorithms and strong keys, and disable insecure  protocols. Verify the robustness of the implementation.   GP-TM-35: Cryptographic keys must be securely managed.   GP-TM-36: Build devices to be compatible with lightweight encryption and security techniques.   GP-TM-37: Support scalable key management schemes.  4.3.11 Secure and trusted communications   GP-TM-38: Guarantee the different security aspects -confidentiality (privacy), integrity, availability and  authenticity- of the information in transit on the networks or stored in the IoT application or in the Cloud.   GP-TM-39: Ensure that communication security is provided using state-of-the-art, standardised security  protocols, such as TLS for encryption.   GP-TM-40: Ensure credentials are not exposed in internal or external network traffic.   GP-TM-41: Guarantee data authenticity to enable reliable exchanges from data emission to data  reception. Data should always be signed whenever and wherever it is captured and stored.   GP-TM-42: Do not trust data received and always verify any interconnections. Discover, identify and  verify/authenticate the devices connected to the network before trust can be established, and preserve  their integrity for reliable solutions and services.   GP-TM-43: IoT devices should be restrictive rather than permissive in communicating.   GP-TM-44: Make intentional connections. Prevent unauthorised connections to it or other devices the  product is connected to, at all levels of the protocols.   GP-TM-45: Disable specific ports and/or network connections for selective connectivity.   GP-TM-46: Rate limiting. Controlling the traffic sent or received by a network to reduce the risk of  automated attacks.  4.3.12 Secure Interfaces and network services   GP-TM-47: Risk Segmentation.

Gaps analysis  This section provides an analysis of the main gaps in relation to cyber security in IoT. A critical part to address  cyber security in IoT is the identification and definition of gaps -the space between the present state and the  desired state- so as to determine what steps need to be taken in order to close those gaps, namely, to move  from the current immature state to the future and more mature state. In the interviews conducted with IoT  experts there was a common denominator – in terms of maturity, the security in IoT is in an initial stage of  development. The following gaps were identified as being the most prominent ones by the experts who took  part in the study and by conducting a comparative analysis of existing IoT security resources as listed in  Annex C.  We examine the gaps by taking into account two aspects, namely beginning with the analysis of the barriers  and ending with the changes that need to be considered to improve and guarantee security in IoT. We also  outline the relevant challenges that act as hindering factors towards a more mature IoT security landscape.  The ultimate goal of addressing the IoT security and safety gaps is to ensure the priotection of all assets, to  preserve the required level of privacy, as well as attain and sustain a high level of resiliency against cyber  attacks thus ensures physical safety alongside cyber security.  Gap 1: Fragmentation in existing security approaches and regulations  Currently, there is no common EU-wide approach to cyber security in IoT, or a common multi-stakeholder  model on cyber security. In the interviews carried out throughout the study, the majority of experts  considered the lack of mature security frameworks, and the breadth of security considerations to take into  account, big barriers for the improvement of security. Therefore, most companies and manufacturers are  taking their own approach when implementing security into IoT, resulting in a lack or slow embracement of  standards to guide the adoption of IoT security measures and good practices.  Whereas stringent measures and legislation introduced by regulators could become restrictive for security  research, development and innovation, it could be more effective if initiatives were put in place to stimulate  the development of security in private companies. Nevertheless, the key to rapid progress in this area is to  get the public and private sectors to work together and understand that security does not only concern a  single manufacturer, customer or  IT professional76, but rather everyone involved in the process.  Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility.  The fragmentation of the regulations also poses a barrier when Critical Information Infrastructures are seen  hand in hand with the IoT world, since there is no regulation that forces security measures and protocols in  the different levels of an IoT ecosystem, including the devices, the network, etc. This could potentially allow  for a more complete integration of safety and security in the development lifecycles. Conversely, the  application of one-size fits all standards across the IoT ecosystem might be seen as a hindering factor for  innovation and research in the area. As discussed throughout the report, one needs to also consider the fact  that different application areas have diverse security requirements.  Another significant problem to tackle is that of unclear liabilities – there is a barrier of non-responsibility,  both moral and legal, which can be mitigated or solved by enforcing responsibilities. There has been no  chance to enforce a perfect isolation between the different elements of an IoT ecosystem, which will  76 See https://www.govtechworks.com/iot-security-risks-begin-with-supply-chains/  https://www.govtechworks.com/iot-security-risks-begin-with-supply-chains/  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  54  unavoidably be developed by different manufacturers and/or operated by different parties. In this context,  there is a need to clarify the liability of each actor in case of a security event.  Gap 2: Lack of awareness and knowledge  There is a gap in relation to the increasing move towards connected and interdependent systems and devices  as far as knowledge is concerned. In the interviews with IoT experts, differences in fundamental terminology  were encountered, such as the difference between the concepts of safety and security. Security experts are  more commonly familiar with “business IT” security, but not with IoT security.  There is an overall lack of awareness regarding the need of security in IoT devices. Even more worrisome is  the lack of knowledge regarding the threats they are exposed to – most IoT consumers do not have a basic  understanding of their IoT devices and the impact on their environment. This may result in the devices not  being updated, with a subsequent breach of security.  Moreover, companies should train their employees in good security practices, recognising that technological  expertise does not necessarily equate with security expertise. In general, there is a need to properly educate  a new generation of consumers, developers, manufacturers, etc. about the use and the security risks posed  by IoT, and how to be prepared. It is also necessary to train them in both safety and cyber security to increase  awareness.  Many security incidents could be avoided if developers and manufacturers were aware of the risks they face  on a daily basis, considering not only those affecting IoT devices but also those affecting the whole IoT  environment. This is becoming a common need in order to raise awareness about current threats and risks  and to provide knowledge on how to prevent, protect and act in case of a security incident.  Gap 3: Insecure design and/or development  There have been several studies on design and development concerns related to IoT security77,78,79,80 . During  the interviews engaged within the context of this report we validated the findings of these studies and in  this respect the following issues seem particularly significant in the context of IoT design and development:   No defence-in-depth strategy during the design of the system, such as a secure boot process, isolation of  a Trusted Computing Base, limitation of the number of open ports, self-protection, etc.   No security-by-design or privacy-by-design. In some cases, information is exchanged with a third-party,  and it should be ensured that not more information than strictly needed is exported outside of the IoT  environment.   Lack of communication protection, on internal as well as external interfaces.   Lack of strong authentication and authorisation:   No validation or signing of firmware updates,   Software updates without server authentication and file trust verification,   No secure boot mechanisms.   Lack of hardening:   No data execution prevention or attack mitigation technologies used on the firmware,  77 See http://otalliance.actonsoftware.com/acton/attachment/6361/f-008e/1/-/-/-/-/IoT Framework Resource Guide.pdf  78 See http://www.gsma.com/connectedliving/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CLP.12-v1.1.pdf  79 See https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/download/new-security-guidance-for-early-adopters-of-the-iot/  80 See https://www.symantec.com/security-center/threat-report  http://otalliance.actonsoftware.com/acton/attachment/6361/f-008e/1/-/-/-/-/IoT%20Framework%20Resource%20Guide.pdf http://www.gsma.com/connectedliving/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CLP.12-v1.1.pdf https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/download/new-security-guidance-for-early-adopters-of-the-iot/ https://www.symantec.com/security-center/threat-report  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  55   Public vulnerabilities (DNS proxy, HTTP service…) left unfixed,   Some services are exposed through different entry points, with unnecessary communication ports left open – services such as Telnet or ssh are sometimes bound to all network interfaces,   Weak passwords policies or default passwords left unchanged,   Configuration flaws.   Lack of diagnosis / response capabilities.  Gap 4: Lack of interoperability across different IoT devices, platforms and  frameworks  The great majority of IoT ecosystems include IoT devices connected with legacy systems, especially in the  case of Critical Information Infrastructures. Moreover, as previously mentioned, due to the lack of a common  regulation, most companies and manufacturers are taking their own approach when designing IoT devices,  causing interoperability issues between devices from different manufacturers as well as the emergence of  different security models, incompatible concepts and taxonomies, etc. Therefore, it is very important to  develop measures that ensure a correct and secure interconnection and interoperability between the IoT  environment and legacy systems, and the other IoT devices manufactured by third-parties.  Most IoT devices use proprietary protocols designed by their manufacturers in order to interconnect devices.  While this is not an issue for devices from the same manufacturer, it becomes a problem when  interconnecting devices from different manufacturers. This requires the development and use of standard  protocols that need to be supported by all manufacturers to ensure a good level of interoperability with the  least efficiency and security loss. A good practice in this regard is to avoid the use of close-source and  proprietary protocols, as their security cannot be verified, and many incidents have already proven that  security through obscurity does not necessarily equate proper security coverage.  In the same spirit, apart from protocols, the use of common frameworks can also help to improve the  efficiency and security of the devices when interconnecting several ones from different manufacturers.  Gap 5: Lack of economic incentives  The main IoT manufacturers and vendors usually consider functionality and usability much more important  than implementing secure design and programming. Their economic interests are not aligned with spending  much money on security, and in some cases they do not consider security at all. The main reason for these  companies no to dedicate much of their budget to security is the general perception that there is no direct  return-on-investment for security, which can be attributed to the economic cost and the difficulty to assess  the financial impact of hypothetical security weaknesses.  This is worsened by the lack of economic incentives that would help to improve security, such as economic  benefits (e.g. more grants to integrate better security in the devices), resources, perceived reputation, etc.  Apart from this, the economic support is only accessible through very competitive programs such as H2020  in the case of research and development.  In general, the IoT experts interviewed agree that the different risks, threats and hazards are usually  underestimated and left out because of budgetary issues – there is a tendency to handle security concerns  a posteriori of incidents.  Gap 6: Lack of proper product lifecycle management  In general, safety measures are found lacking from the design phase to its later development. This  demonstrates the need for a proper product lifecycle management of the different assets that compose a  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  56  given IoT environment, since the devices and networks are interconnected and, in most cases, exposed to  the Internet, where they can be targeted by many and diverse threats.  IoT comprises such a variety of products that, if left unattended, it makes the entire surface of the traditional  supply chain vulnerable. IoT expands the global attack surface and it is everyone's responsibility to manage  the risks. The different devices and products will have to evolve in a secure way to consistently provide,  through their whole lifecycle, the solution for which they were created.  In this process, it is necessary to involve the vendors and, since they are in charge of designing and  developing the devices, they are in an ideal position to implement the changes needed – they are able to  proficiently and cost-efficiently include new security features or characteristics. This, however, is not only  dependent on manufacturers adding these new features, but also on organisations accepting the related  costs; therefore, a balance between security and cost must be maintained.  Through their lifecycle, IoT devices must be able to be patched and updated rapidly to ensure their correct  operation and to amend all the vulnerabilities that are continuously being discovered. As mentioned before,  in consumer environments most IoT users do not have a basic understanding of their IoT devices and their  impact on their environment, which may result in the devices not being updated and a subsequent breach  of security.  In addition, one important phase of the device lifecycle management is the deployment phase. Best practices  for IoT deployment could be defined. They may include recommendations for specific configurations of  devices and networks or the need to implement cybersecurity monitoring systems to detect anomalies in  the deployed infrastructure.  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  57  6. High-level recommendations to improve IoT cybersecurity  This chapter includes a list of high-level recommendations for developers, operators and security experts  that will help them to improve the security level of IoT devices and communications among them. The  recommendations discussed here concern stakeholders that span the entire IoT spectrum and aim to  address the gaps defined in Chapter 5.  Recommendations  The recommendations proposed are listed in the following table, and they have been further developed in  section 6.2:  ID DESCRIPTION  1 Promote harmonization of IoT security initiatives and regulations  2 Raise awareness for the need for IoT cybersecurity  3 Define secure software/hardware development lifecycle guidelines for IoT  4 Achieve consensus for interoperability across the IoT ecosystem  5 Foster economic and administrative incentives for IoT security  6 Establishment of secure IoT product/service lifecycle management  7 Clarify liability among IoT stakeholders  Table 8: IoT Security Recommendations  Detailed recommendations  6.2.1 Promote harmonization of IoT security initiatives and regulations  Recommendation intended for: IoT industry, providers, manufacturers, associations  The current fragmentation of IoT security guidelines, initiatives, standards and other schemes needs to be  addressed. A first and solid step in the direction is to define a list of best practices and guidelines for IoT  security and privacy, which  can be used as a baseline for the development and deployment of IoT systems  in the market (for example consult reports from AIOTI and ECSO). The current ENISA report provides such a  list and goes one step further by categorizing all security measures according to a well-defined and  structured set of security domains.  In terms of harmonization of standards, it is interesting to note that the notion of standard is appreciated  and supported by the industry but groups of stakeholders have different R&D chains and this inherently  drives fragmentation. The recommendation to counter this fragmentation refers to establishing a set of  practices, guidelines and security requirements in IoT, which are common over Europe. The Commission  should be facilitator of this process and this ENISA report can serve as the springboard for related efforts.  Subsequently, each sector can focus on defining the specific sets of practices, guidelines, requirements for  its own needs based on the particular context and risk factors inherent in each sector. European Commission  and member states government could drive the coordination and collaboration of stakeholders (industry,  users) and ENISA can be an important facilitator in this process.  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  58  The procurement process is another means to impose harmonization of baseline standards and  requirements for IoT systems. The harmonization should consider that there are many different sectors (e.g.  energy, transportation) , so harmonization should be first achieved within each sector.  6.2.2 Raise awareness for the need for IoT cybersecurity  Recommendation intended for: IoT industry, providers, manufacturers, associations, academia,  consumer groups, regulators  Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility among all involved stakeholders. It is thus essential for thse  stakeholders to have a thorough understanding of related risks and threats, as well as ways to secure and  protect against them. Raising awareness is therefore of paramount importance and initiatives to do so are  highly recommended.  As evidenced by the growing threat landscape and the numerous security incidents concerning IoT, there is  lack of knowledge present within IoT developers, industries as wll as end users and consumers. To  overcome such deficiency it is important to define targeted recommendations for all three stakeholder  categories, namely:   Security education and training needs to be established in industries, including knowledge of state- of-the-art, best practices, reference architectures and availability of building blocks,  methodologies and tools for secure IoT systems.   End users and consumers have to be educated to be able to make informed decisions when buying  IoT devices and systems. Campaigns raising awareness for IoT security are thus highly important,  also in order to be able to maintain a basic level of cyber hygiene for the security of the “Things”  that they have purchased or are operating. The role and initiatives of consumer rights associations  should be highlighted in this respect.   Among the developer community, awareness needs to be raised to adopt fundamental security  principles that are cross vertical rather than being tied to any silo industry. Corporate trainings  focused on IoT security are also beneficial and should be pursued.  Similarly, initiatives like café scientific and cyber security clinics can prove to be effective.Lastly, trainings  and courses at schools and universities (considering localisation to reach a wider audience) will further  promote a better understanding of IoT security among the younger generation and thus in the long-term  contributed to raising awareness.  6.2.3 Define secure software/hardware development lifecycle guidelines for IoT  Recommendation intended for: IoT developers, platform operators, industry, manufacturers  Developers, manufacturers and providers of IOT products and solutions should integrate and adopt a  secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC) for their IoT offerings and incorporate relevant processes in  their operations. Security must be implemented as a whole, at the application level, and in each of the  phases of the SDLC. It is therefore important to encourage more companies to offer secure components  that are at the same time usable for developers and end users/consumers.  The notions of security and privacy by default and security and privacy by design naturally emerge as  being foundation cornerstones of IoT security. Evidently, it is challenging to apply these concepts in several  different environments that will have particular characteristics. In IoT the cyber risk is context-dependent  (i.e. based on the application scenario) and in this respect the principles of security and privacy by design  should be applied with this consideration in mind. Following relevant initiatives from other, more mature  IT sectors can prove to be beneficial in adopting such principles for the IoT ecosystem.  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  59  As far as developers are concerned, secure by design hackathons and use of best practice cookbooks for  IoT security can greatly enhance their perception of using principle of security and privacy by default and  by design. The lessons learned from such exercises would assist developers in applying corresponding  techniques within their projects and products. When focussing on companies, the use of proper security  processes and well-defined and widely accepted tools (e.g. standards, checklists) for IoT security would  strongly promote the cause for IoT security by default and by design.  6.2.4 Achieve consensus for interoperability across the IoT ecosystem  Recommendation intended for: IoT industry, providers, manufacturers, associations, regulators  The issue of interoperability is very pertinent to the IoT ecosystem due to the very large scale and  penetration of the IoT ecosystem, the long and complex supply chains and the numerous involved  stakeholders. Ensuring and fostering interoperability of IoT devices, platforms and frameworks, as well as  security practices is therefore an essential element of IoT security and should thus be encouraged.  Recommendations that will undoubtedly assist in this direction include:   Encourage the use of open interoperability frameworks that incorporate security   Provide transparency on the security of interoperability frameworks   Promote open and accessible interoperability laboratories and testbeds for security  It should be noted that said recommendations are indicative and continuous efforts towards promoting  interoperability in the context of end-to-end and consistent cybersecurity should be pursued.  6.2.5 Foster economic and administrative incentives for IoT security  Recommendation intended for: IoT industry, associations, academia, consumer groups, regulators  It is clear that lack of security impacts business continuity and this is indeed the case also for IoT that is  driven by R&D activities and a rush to push products and services in the market. In this respect, business  continuity can serve as a driver for justifying costs in cyber security solutions.  Moreover, market demands on cybersecurity are somewhat low because of the lack of consumer  perception in the added value of cybersecurity. Consumer involvement is quite important  and it should be  supported more.  Communication campaigns should be implemented by the government (e.g., the  Commission, member states) in order to increase and sustain said perception and thus inherently  necessitate the adoption of further mechanisms to promote IoT cybersecurity.  In the case of IoT, competitive advantage is currently placed and focussed on the time to market rather  than secure to market.  This balance should be shifted so that a specific level of security and privacy before  market deployment is encouraged. Defining security frameworks supported by baseline security measures  can be a way forward in this direction. Use of other schemes such as certification and labelling can also  encourage better understanding and transparency in terms of IoT security and thus should be considered  (also benefitting end users and consumers in educating them and making them more aware of IoT  security), albeit in a context and risk specific manner per use case/application sector. Subject to such  approaches, subsequently regulative efforts and initiatiaves could then be put in place to follow the same  path.  6.2.6 Establishment of secure IoT product/service lifecycle management  Recommendation intended for: IoT developers, platform operators, industry, manufacturers  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  60  Security plays an important role within all the phases of an IoT product’s/service’s lifecycle. These phases  include design, development, testing, production, deployment, maintenance, end-of-support, and end-of- life (i.e. decommissioning). It is recommeneded that specific, focussed and targeted security processes be  defined for all these phases.  Furthermore, security processes have to be properly implemented. In order to satisfy this need,  fundamental security requirements and building blocks have to be specified to be available within each  phase.  A noteworthy aspect involves security updates that constitute a significant issue in the context of IoT. After  deployment, security updates need to be provided where practically possible whithout special knowledge  requirements or financial obligations on the end user/consumer within a defined term and conditions until  “end-of-support”. The latter must be clearly defined by the manufacturer/provider of the IoT product and  must be clearly communicated to the end user/consumer.  6.2.7 Clarify liability among IoT stakeholders  Recommendation intended for: IoT industry, regulators  As identified by the interviews with the experts a very important issue when IoT is considered is that of  liability. It is of particular importance in the IoT domain, since the cyber-physical nature of IoT relates and  tightly binds security to safety. The question of liability needs to be addressed. The question of where  liability may fall lies between the different and diverse stakeholders of the IoT ecosystem, such as  developers, manufacturers, providers, vendors, aftermarket support operators, third party providers and  the end users, to name a few.  The liability issues have to be addressed in the context of European and national legislation and case law.  Where gaps are identified in said legislation, these should be addressed.

For  example, a device measures its own integrity as part of boot, but  does not validate those measurements - when the device applies to  join a network, part of joining involves sending an integrity report for  remote validation. If validation fails, the end point is diverted to a  remediation network for action.

The attack required physical access to the smart meters, and  it is believed that former employees of the meter manufacturer were  altering the smart meters to reduce power bills81.  Foscam IP baby-cam  hijacked  August 10, 2013  On April 11, 2013, a vulnerability in Foscam wireless cameras was  disclosed by security researchers in a presentation titled “To watch or to  be watched: Turning your surveillance camera against you”. Later, on  August 10, an attacker gained control of one of those cameras in Houston,  Texas, which was being used as a baby-cam. The attacker was able to see,  hear and speak through the camera82.  Target data breach  November 15 -  December 15, 2013  The intrusion into Target’s systems was traced back to network  credentials stolen from a third-party IoT HVAC vendor.  It is believed that Target allowed that HVAC vendor remote access to its  network in order to report fluctuations in store temperature which might  have affected how long a customer stayed within a given store.  Nevertheless, it remains a mystery why the point of sale system was not  segmented from the rest of the Target network83. The intrusion took  place on November 15, 2013, and one month later, the data breach had  already resulted in the theft of 40 million credit and debit card accounts84.  BMW’s Connected Drive  vulnerable (demonstration)  January 2015  A security vulnerability in BMW’s Connected Drive system allowed  researchers to unlock the vehicles affected without the car keys. The  attack took advantage of a feature that allows drivers who have been  locked out of their vehicles to request the remote unlocking of their car  from a BMW assistance line. The researchers were able to impersonate  BMW servers and send, over the public cellular network, remote  unlocking instructions to vehicles85.  The software patch for the 2.2 million cars equipped with Connected  Drive adds HTTPS encryption to the connection from BMW to the car and  ensures that the car only accepts connections from a server with the  correct security certificate86.  Jeep car remotely hijacked  (demonstration)  July 21, 2015  Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek developed a zero-day exploit that targets  Jeep Cherokees, giving an attacker, who may be miles away, complete  control -via the Internet- of thousands of vulnerable vehicles. The attack  is performed by sending commands through the Jeep’s entertainment  system to its dashboard functions, steering, brakes, and transmission87.  81 See https://www.metering.com/puerto-rico-smart-meters-believed-to-have-been-hacked-and-such-hacks-likely-to-spread/  82 See https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/08/13/how-a-creep-hacked-a-baby-monitor-to-say-lewd-things-to-a-2-year-old/  83 See https://www.mocana.com/blog/2014/02/05/iot-hack-connected-target-breach  84 See http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/02/target-hackers-broke-in-via-hvac-company/  85 AJ Trainor, Amalia Safer, Lily Houghton, «BMW ConnectedDrive Vulnerability».

The attacker could then compromise the scope’s targeting system,  preventing the gun from firing or even causing it to miss the intended  target, hitting another one88.  VTech Toymaker data  breach  November 8, 2015  A cyber-attack on digital toymaker VTech Holdings exposed the data of  6.4 million children and 4.9 million adults. The personal information  stolen was not encrypted, and it included names, email addresses,  passwords, secret questions and answers for password retrieval, IP  addresses, postal addresses, download histories, chat logs, and children’s  names, photos, genders and birth dates89.  Mirai - DDoS on OVH  hosting provider  September 19, 2016  Mirai gathered a botnet made up of more than one million hacked IoT  devices, mostly DVRs and CCTV cameras, which were infected through  their Telnet port.  The French hosting company OVH is believed to be the first to have  suffered a DDoS attack coming from the Mirai botnet, which was  reported to have peaked at 1 Tbps, one of the largest recorded in history  in terms of volume90.  Mirai - DDoS on “Krebs on  Security” website  September 20, 2016  Just a day after the attack against OVH, the Mirai botnet conducts a DDoS  attack on “Krebs on Security” website that surpassed 620 Gbps of traffic,  making it also one of the largest recorded in history in terms of volume90.  Hajime October 15, 2016  Hajime is a “vigilante” spreading IoT worm that, like Mirai, takes  advantage of devices with default usernames and passwords to gain  control over them, via their Telnet ports. Its purpose is believed to be  fighting the Mirai botnet for control over IoT products – once a device is  infected, Hajime blocks access to ports 23 (Telnet), 7547, 5555, and 5358,  which are common entry points for the rival Mirai worm and other  threats91.  At the moment, the Hajime worm is not doing anything malign – it just  displays the following message: “Just a white hat, securing some  systems”92.  Mirai - DDoS on Dyn DNS  provider  October 21, 2016  Some of Mirai’s targets were cloud-related services, such as DNS provider  Dyn, which suffered a DDoS attack that affected several high-profile  websites, including Amazon, Netflix, PayPal and Spotify. Unconfirmed  reports say the peak of the attack reached around 1.2 Tbps93.  DDoS on building blocks’  central heating system  November 3, 2016  In Finland, a DDoS Attack took down the heating systems of at least two  housing blocks in the city of Lappeenranta, leaving their residents without  heating in sub-zero temperatures for more than a week94.  88 See https://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-can-disable-sniper-rifleor-change-target/  89 See http://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/02/vtech-hack-data-of-64m-kids-exposed.html  90 See https://www.symantec.com/content/dam/symantec/docs/reports/istr-22-2017-en.pdf  91 See https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/04/hajime-futureproof-botnet/  92 See https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/hajime-worm-battles-mirai-control-internet-things  93 See https://dyn.com/blog/dyn-analysis-summary-of-friday-october-21-attack/  94 See http://thehackernews.com/2016/11/heating-system-hacked.html  https://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-can-disable-sniper-rifleor-change-target/ http://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/02/vtech-hack-data-of-64m-kids-exposed.html https://www.symantec.com/content/dam/symantec/docs/reports/istr-22-2017-en.pdf https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/04/hajime-futureproof-botnet/ https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/hajime-worm-battles-mirai-control-internet-things https://dyn.com/blog/dyn-analysis-summary-of-friday-october-21-attack/ http://thehackernews.com/2016/11/heating-system-hacked.html  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  102  SECURITY INCIDENT DATE DESCRIPTION  Mirai - DDoS on Deutsche  Telekom network  November 27, 2016  Mirai botnet targets Deutsche Telekom routers, affecting more than  900,000 customers95.  Cloudpets’ DB held for  ransom  December 25, 2016 -  January 8, 2017  Cloudpets is a company that sells Internet-connected teddy bears,  allowing kids to communicate with their far-away parents. Cloudpets  customers’ data were left for two weeks in a publicly available database  without password or firewall protection. More than 820,000 customer  credentials were exposed, as well as two million message recordings. In  addition, the database was also held for ransom96.  Romantik Seehotel  Jägerwirt  January 25, 2017  The Romantik Seehotel Jägerwirt, a 4-star hotel in the Austrian Alps, had  its digital key system breached and held for ransom. The attackers  managed to take down the entire key system – the guests could no longer  get into their hotel rooms and new key cards could not be programmed.  The hotel has admitted they had to pay a ransom worth thousands of  Bitcoin to the cybercriminals, who restored the key system and the  computers as soon as they received the payment. The attackers left a  backdoor in the system to exploit it in the near future, but when they  tried again, the hotel had already bolstered its security97.  Cloudpets and “Meine  Freundin Cayla” - insecure  Bluetooth  February 17 - 27,  2017  Apart from Cloudpets’ customer database being completely insecure, it  turns out Cloudpets’ teddy bears were themselves insecure too.  CloudPets' toys did not use any standard Bluetooth security features,  such as pairing encryption with their owner's smartphone app, so anyone  within range (10 meters with a normal smartphone) could just connect to  it and send and receive commands and data – e.g. uploading a message  to the toy, or silently triggering the toy's recording functionality and later  downloading the audio the toy has recorded. In other words, the teddy  bears could be turned into remote surveillance devices, used to harass  toddlers like some insecure baby monitors have in the past, such as the  Foscam IP baby-cam case98.  Just one week before, the German government banned the Internet- connected “Meine Freundin Cayla” doll for the same reasons that  concern Cloudpets’ toys – it had vulnerabilities that could be exploited by  an attacker to remotely spy on children99.  BrickerBot March 20, 2017  BrickerBot is a bot that permanently incapacitates –Permanent DoS  (PDoS)– poorly secured IoT devices, leaving them in a “bricked” state  before they can be conscripted into Internet-crippling denial-of-service  armies. The latest version BrickerBot.3 appeared April 20, one month  after BrickerBot.1 first surfaced100,101.  95 See https://www.engadget.com/2016/11/29/mirai-botnet-targets-deutsche-telekom-routers-in-global-cyberatt/  96 See https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/internet-of-things-teddy-bear-leaked-2-million-parent-and-kids-message-recordings  97 See https://www.thelocal.at/20170128/hotel-ransomed-by-hackers-as-guests-locked-in-rooms  98 See https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/how-this-internet-of-things-teddy-bear-can-be-remotely-turned-into-a-spy-device  99 See https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilungen/DE/2017/14012017_cayla.html  100 See https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/04/brickerbot-the-permanent-denial-of-service-botnet-is-back-with-a-vengeance/  101 See https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/alerts/ICS-ALERT-17-102-01A  https://www.engadget.com/2016/11/29/mirai-botnet-targets-deutsche-telekom-routers-in-global-cyberatt/ https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/internet-of-things-teddy-bear-leaked-2-million-parent-and-kids-message-recordings https://www.thelocal.at/20170128/hotel-ransomed-by-hackers-as-guests-locked-in-rooms https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/how-this-internet-of-things-teddy-bear-can-be-remotely-turned-into-a-spy-device https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilungen/DE/2017/14012017_cayla.html https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/04/brickerbot-the-permanent-denial-of-service-botnet-is-back-with-a-vengeance/ https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/alerts/ICS-ALERT-17-102-01A  ENISA  European Union Agency for Network  and Information Security  Science and Technology Park of Crete (ITE)  Vassilika Vouton, 700 13, Heraklion, Greece  Athens Office  1 Vasilissis Sofias & Meg.

For  ENISA, IoT is an emerging concept comprising a wide ecosystem of interconnected services and devices, such  as sensors, consumer products and everyday smart home objects, cars, and industrial and health  components. These technologies collect, exchange and process data in order to dynamically adapt to a  specific context, transforming the business world and the way we live as a whole. IoT is tightly bound to  cyber-physical systems and, in this respect, safety implications are pertinent.  Nevertheless, IoT poses very important safety and security challenges that need to be addressed for IoT to  reach its full potential. Many security considerations regarding IoT are not necessarily new; they are  inherited from the use of networking technologies. However, the characteristics of some IoT  implementations present new security challenges, threats and risks that are manifold and evolve rapidly.  The protection of IoT deployments depends on the protection of all systems involved (the devices  themselves, cloud backend and services, applications, maintenance and diagnostic tools, etc.).  Addressing these challenges and ensuring security in IoT products and services is a fundamental priority.  One of the main concerns is the impact that the different threats may have since attacks on IoT deployments  could dramatically jeopardise people’s security, privacy and safety, while additionally IoT in itself can be used  as an attack vector against other critical infrastructures.  Also, since IoT can drastically change the ways  personal data is collected, analysed, used, and protected, privacy concerns have been raised. These need to  be addressed to ensure user trust and confidence in the Internet, connected devices, and related services.  However, beyond technical security measures, the adoption of IoT has raised many new legal, policy and  regulatory challenges, broad and complex in scope, that remain unanswered, amplifying at the same time  some existing issues. The rapid rate of change in IoT technology has outpaced the ability of the associated  policy, legal, and regulatory structures to adapt, leaving no clear security framework to follow. This has led  most companies and manufacturers to take their own approach when designing IoT devices, causing  interoperability issues between devices from different manufacturers, and between IoT devices and legacy  systems.  For these reasons, ENISA is defining a set of Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT. The aim of this work  as reported here is to provide insight into the security requirements of IoT, mapping critical assets and  relevant threats, assessing possible attacks and identifying potential good practices and security measures  to apply in order to protect IoT systems.  As a result of this work, after taking into consideration all the background research carried out, the views  expressed by the experts interviewed, and the good practices and security measures identified, a series of  recommendations has been developed, namely:   Promote harmonization of IoT security initiatives and regulations  Intended for IoT industry, providers, manufacturers, associations   Raise awareness for the need for IoT cybersecurity  Intended for IoT industry, providers, manufacturers, associations, academia, consumer groups,  regulators   Define secure software/hardware development lifecycle guidelines for IoT  Intended for IoT developers, platform operators, industry, manufacturers  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  08   Achieve consensus for interoperability across the IoT ecosystem  Intended for IoT industry, providers, manufacturers, associations, regulators   Foster economic and administrative incentives for IoT security  Intended for IoT industry, associations, academia, consumer groups, regulators   Establishment of secure IoT product/service lifecycle management  Intended for IoT developers, platform operators, industry, manufacturers   Clarify liability among IoT stakeholders  Intended for IoT industry, regulators  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  09  Index of tables  Table 1  Indicative listing of communication protocols for IoT 22  Table 2  Asset taxonomy 28  Table 3  Threat taxonomy 35  Table 4  IoT attack scenarios 36  Table 5  Attack 1 – IoT administration system compromise 41  Table 6  Attack 2 – Value manipulation in IoT devices 43  Table 7  Attack 3 – Botnet / Commands injection 45  Table 8  IoT Security Recommendations 57  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  10  Index of figures  Figure 1: Methodology followed in the study 16  Figure 2: IoT pervasive ecosystem 18  Figure 3: Structure of an IoT embedded system 21  Figure 4: IoT High-level reference model 25  Figure 5: Asset taxonomy 26  Figure 6: Asset criticality 28  Figure 7: Indicative timeline of IoT security incidents 30  Figure 8: IoT Threat taxonomy 32  Figure 9: IoT threats impact 33  Figure 10: Threat impact weighted average 33  Figure 11: Attack scenario criticality 39  Figure 12: Attack 1 – IoT administration system compromised 40  Figure 13: Attack 2 – Value manipulation in IoT devices 42  Figure 14: Attack 3 – Botnet / Commands injection 44  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  11  1. Introduction  The Internet of Things (IoT) is concept paradigm that has emerged over the last years. Kevin Ashton  introduced the concept of IoT back in 19991. It describes a wide ecosystem where interconnected devices  and services collect, exchange and process data in order to adapt dynamically to a context. The Internet of  Things is tightly bound to cyber-physical systems and in this respect is an enabler of Smart Infrastructures  by enhancing their quality of service provisioning.  The IoT is the natural evolution of computing and it brings its own challenges – an immature ecosystem  bearing a fragmentation of standards and security concerns in a non-homogeneous IoT market, as at the  moment each industry and application is different. Another IoT challenge worth highlighting is its ability to  scale globally2; according to Gartner, IoT will involve 8.4 billion connected ‘things’ in use in 2017, up 31%  from 2016, and by 2020 the number of connected devices is envisioned to reach 20 billion41. Currently there  are different solutions available in the market through various manufacturers such as Google, Microsoft,  Amazon, Apple or Samsung, among others, many of which use their proprietary cloud service, protocols and  operating system3.  The threats and risks related to the Internet of Things devices, systems and services are manifold, and evolve  rapidly. With a great impact on citizens’ safety, security and privacy, the threat landscape concerning the  Internet of Things is extremely wide. Hence, it is important to understand what needs to be secured and to  develop specific security measures to protect the Internet of Things from cyber threats.  Involving billions of intelligent systems and millions of applications, IoT will drive new consumer and business  behaviours, which will demand increasingly intelligent solutions. This, in turn, is expected to drive by 2020  almost 3 trillion dollars (circa 2.85 trillion euros) in new business opportunities for the different vendors and  companies that capitalise on the IoT41. Examples of these opportunities include4:   New business models: New value streams for customers, with a faster response.   Diversification of revenue streams: Monetising added services on top of traditional lines of business.   Real-time information: Capturing data about products and processes more swiftly, improving market  agility and allowing prompt decision making.   Global visibility: Making tracking easier from one end of a supply chain to the other.  Objectives  The goal of this report is to elaborate baseline cybersecurity recommendations for IoT with a focus on Critical  Information Infrastructures, which encompass facilities, networks, services and physical and information  technology equipment. These infrastructures are considered critical because their destruction or disruption  could bring about major consequences for the health, safety and economic wellbeing of citizens, for the  efficient functioning of State institutions and Public Administrations5,6, and for the asset owners who make  use of IoT to provide their services.  1 See http://www.rfidjournal.com/articles/view?4986  2 See https://www.emc.com/leadership/digital-universe/2014iview/internet-of-things.htm  3 See https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/06/building-the-web-of-things/  4 See https://www.emc.com/leadership/digital-universe/2014iview/internet-of-things.htm  5 See https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/crisis-and-terrorism/critical-infrastructure_en  6 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services  http://www.rfidjournal.com/articles/view?4986 https://www.emc.com/leadership/digital-universe/2014iview/internet-of-things.htm https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/06/building-the-web-of-things/ https://www.emc.com/leadership/digital-universe/2014iview/internet-of-things.htm https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/crisis-and-terrorism/critical-infrastructure_en https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  12  In this respect, the baseline security measures for IoT put forward in this report can serve as a springboard  for further related efforts towards a harmonised EU approach, paving the way for a tacit adoption of the  measures, and as criteria for other initiatives such as labelling or certification.  A major challenge in defining baseline security measures for IoT is the entailed complexity that is brought  by the diversity of application areas for IoT. Striking a balance between the particularities of each domain is  essential and accordingly it is important to consider the differences in apportioning risk to distinct  environments. Accordingly, this report builds on the expertise and insight gained by previous work by ENISA,  covering a series of vertical application areas of IoT namely:   Smart Homes7   Smart Cities and Intelligent Public Transport8   Smart Grids9   Smart Cars10   Smart Airports11   eHealth and Smart Hospitals12  This report aims to cover the threat model of the Internet of Things in the context of Critical Information  Infrastructures (CII), as well as to detail available security measures to counter the identified threats. This  report also provides a series of recommendations to shape future efforts and initiatives in the direction of  a holistic approach to secure the Internet of Things.  Scope  ENISA defines the Internet of Things (IoT) as a cyber-physical ecosystem of interconnected sensors and  actuators, which enable decision making. Information lies at the heart of IoT, feeding into a continuous cycle  of sensing, decision making, and actions. IoT is tightly bound to cyber-physical systems and in this respect is  an enabler of Smart Infrastructures, e.g. Industry 4.0, smart grid, smart transport, by enabling services of  higher quality and facilitating the provision of advanced functionalities.  ENISA identified and analysed existing IoT security practices, security guidelines, relevant industry standards  and research initiatives in the area of IoT security for Critical Information Infrastructures (e.g. Industry 4.0,  Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications, IoT updatability). Having reviewed and thoroughly analysed  existing work and ongoing activities, ENISA compared these practices and standards and developed baseline  security measures to be adopted by relevant stakeholders.  ENISA focused, among other topics, on IoT resilience and communication, on the interoperability with  proprietary systems, and on the reliability of IoT. Special emphasis was given to the privacy issues of such  smart infrastructure and services. In this endeavour, ENISA additionally took into account existing European  Union (EU) policies and regulatory initiatives such as the Directive on security of network and information  systems (NIS Directive)13, The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)14, the Internet of Things - An  7 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/smart-homes  8 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/smart-cities  9 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services/smart-grids  10 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-security-and-resilience-of-smart-cars  11 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/securing-smart-airports  12 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services/health  13 See http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN  14 See http://www.eugdpr.org/  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/smart-homes https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/smart-cities https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services/smart-grids https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-security-and-resilience-of-smart-cars https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/securing-smart-airports https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services/health http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN http://www.eugdpr.org/  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  13  action plan for Europe15, as well as the work of the Alliance for the Internet of Things (AIOTI)16 and the Staff  Working Document on ICT Standardization17, among others.  In 2017, ENISA launched the IoT Security Experts Group (IoTSEC)18. The ENISA IoTSEC group is an information  exchange platform that brings together experts to ensure the security and resilience of the entire Internet  of Things ecosystem. Experts of the IoTSEC group have background expertise in one or several of the  following:   Internet of Things with a focus on cyber security;   Suppliers and developers of Internet of Things hardware and/or software with a focus on cyber security;   Associations and non-profit organisations involved in Internet of Things security;   Regulation bodies, academia, standardisation bodies and policy makers.  The first step of the process followed by ENISA in order to validate the results of the report was to carry out  a series of interviews with the different members of the IoTSEC Experts Group, where we gathered their  input, obtaining new information and validating information found during the desktop research. A total of  26 experts were interviewed, covering industry, policy, academia and research organisations from 9 EU  member states and from the United States of America. After synthesising all findings into this report, a  release candidate version was sent to the experts that compose the IoTSEC Group for a first round of  comments. Finally, during the first workshop meeting of the ENISA IoT Security Experts Group that took  place in The Hague, Netherlands, on 20th of October 2017, the findings of the report were discussed and  the experts shaped the final recommendations in order to reflect the needs of the IoT security community  in Europe.  EU and International Policy context  In the last years, the European Commission has been working to facilitate the embracement of the IoT in  Europe, and to unleash its full potential, by adopting a set of supporting policy actions and launching a series  of relevant initiatives19.  In March 2015, the European Commission launched the Alliance for Internet of Things Innovation (AIOTI)20,  with the intention of creating an innovative and industry-driven European IoT ecosystem. The AIOTI has  come to be the largest European IoT Association to date, emphasising the European Commission’s ambition  to work closely with all IoT stakeholders on the establishment of a competitive IoT market and new business  models for the benefit of the European citizens and businesses.  The Digital Single Market (DSM) Strategy21, adopted two months later in May 2015, underlines the need to  avoid fragmentation and to foster interoperability for IoT to reach its potential, leading Europe a step further  in terms of IoT development. In order to meet the DSM needs and to inform about its upcoming policy, in  April 2016 the European Commission specified the EU’s IoT vision in the document ‘Advancing the Internet  of Things in Europe’22, as part of the ‘Digitising European Industry’ (DEI) initiative23.  15 See http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0278:FIN:EN:PDF  16 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/alliance-internet-things-innovation-aioti-defines-its-long-term-strategy  17 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/communication-ict-standardisation-priorities-digital-single-market  18 See https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/iot-security-experts-group-1  19 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/internet-of-things  20 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/alliance-internet-things-innovation-aioti  21 See https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/digital-single-market/  22 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/staff-working-document-advancing-internet-things-europe  23 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/policies/digitising-european-industry  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0278:FIN:EN:PDF https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/alliance-internet-things-innovation-aioti-defines-its-long-term-strategy https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/communication-ict-standardisation-priorities-digital-single-market https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/iot-security-experts-group-1 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/internet-of-things https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/alliance-internet-things-innovation-aioti https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/digital-single-market/ https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/staff-working-document-advancing-internet-things-europe https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/policies/digitising-european-industry  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  14  This vision is based on three different pillars:   A thriving IoT ecosystem,   A human centred IoT approach,   A single market for IoT.  The achievement of a single market for the IoT will potentially face issues linked to the capacity to handle a  vast number and diversity of connected devices and the ability to identify them unequivocally and  universally, so it is important to foster an open system for object identification and authentication, as well  as an interoperable IoT numbering space that transcends geographical limits. Some aspects of numbering  were already addressed in the 2016 review of the EU telecom rules24.  The Commission, in their ICT Standardisation roadmap for the Digital Single Market25, identified five priority  areas that aim to guarantee a fresh approach to standards, and IoT is identified as one of these five priorities.  These areas should increase competitiveness and help European innovations better access the global  market. The other priorities are 5G communication, cybersecurity, cloud and Big Data.  In the context of promoting a European single market for IoT, in January 2017 the ‘European data economy’  initiative was presented26. It proposes policy and legal solutions concerning the free flow of data across  national borders in the EU, and liability issues decisive to enhance legal certainty around IoT products and  services. In addition to all these initiatives, the EU has arranged specific IoT objectives in the Horizon 2020  research and innovation programme27. The midterm review of the Digital Single Market makes numerous  references to the Internet of Things, with liability and cyber security being the main areas of focus28.  Moreover, Article 29 Data Protection Working Party Committee’s “Opinion 8/2014 on the on Recent  Developments on the Internet of Things” identifies the main data protection risks that lie within the  ecosystem of the IoT before providing guidance on how the EU legal framework should be applied in this  context29.  The most recent action taken by the EU was on September 2017, when the new “Proposal for a Regulation  Of The European Parliament And Of The Council on ENISA, the “EU Cybersecurity Agency”, and repealing  Regulation (EU) 526/2013, and on Information and Communication Technology cybersecurity certification  (“Cybersecurity Act”)” was published30,31.  On the same date, the European Commission published the “Joint Communication To The European  Parliament And The Council Resilience, Deterrence and Defence: Building strong cybersecurity for the EU”32,  which describes the overall cybersecurity strategy of the EU. The goal is to build greater EU resilience to  cyber-attacks, improving detection mechanisms and strengthening international cooperation, and to do so,  the document provides a series of measures, with some of them specifically oriented to IoT, such as the  encouragement of “security by design” through the whole lifecycle of the devices that make up the Internet  of Things. With this measure, schemes under this framework would indicate that the products are built using  24 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/connectivity-european-gigabit-society  25 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/communication-ict-standardisation-priorities-digital-single-market  26 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/building-european-data-economy  27 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/research-innovation-iot  28 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/digital-single-market-commission-calls-swift-adoption-key-proposals-and-maps-out- challenges  29 See http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2014/wp223_en.pdf  30 See http://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:1985b4b4-985e-11e7-b92d-01aa75ed71a1.0001.02/DOC_1&format=PDF  31 See http://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:1985b4b4-985e-11e7-b92d-01aa75ed71a1.0001.02/DOC_2&format=PDF  32 See http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=JOIN:2017:450:FIN&from=EN  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/connectivity-european-gigabit-society https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/communication-ict-standardisation-priorities-digital-single-market https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/building-european-data-economy https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/research-innovation-iot https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/digital-single-market-commission-calls-swift-adoption-key-proposals-and-maps-out-challenges https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/digital-single-market-commission-calls-swift-adoption-key-proposals-and-maps-out-challenges http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2014/wp223_en.pdf http://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:1985b4b4-985e-11e7-b92d-01aa75ed71a1.0001.02/DOC_1&format=PDF http://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:1985b4b4-985e-11e7-b92d-01aa75ed71a1.0001.02/DOC_2&format=PDF http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=JOIN:2017:450:FIN&from=EN  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  15  state-of-the-art secure development methods, that they have undergone adequate security testing, and that  the vendors have committed to update their software in the event of newly discovered vulnerabilities or  threats.  Moving from the EU to the US, it is worth highlighting the “Internet of Things Cybersecurity Improvement  Act of 2017”33, introduced on the 1st of August of 2017 by four U.S. senators, which was developed in  response to a series of IoT-related cyber-attacks that took place in 201634. This improvement act establishes  minimum cybersecurity requirements for connected devices purchased by the U.S. Government, including35:   Requiring vendors to ensure their devices are patchable, rely on industry standard protocols, do not use  hard-coded passwords, and do not contain any known security vulnerabilities;   Requiring vendors selling IoT devices are “to provide written certification that the device does not  contain, at the time of submitting the proposal, any hardware, software, or firmware component with  any known security vulnerabilities or defects”36. If a vendor identifies vulnerabilities, it must disclose  them and patch them in a timely manner37;   Requiring each executive agency to inventory all Internet-connected devices in use by the agency;   Along with NIST, specifying particular measures, e.g. network segmentation, for agencies to employ  them;   Directing the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) National Protection and Programs Directorate  (NPPD) to develop coordinated disclosure guidelines, allowing researchers to uncover vulnerabilities in  and share them with the vendors; and   Requiring an effectiveness report, with recommendations for updates, to be submitted to Congress after  5 years.

Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  18  2. The IoT paradigm  ENISA defines IoT as “a cyber-physical ecosystem of interconnected sensors and actuators, which enable  intelligent decision making”. Stemming from the definition is the fact that information lies at the heart of  IoT, feeding into a continuous cycle of sensing, decision making, and actions.  Figure 2: IoT pervasive ecosystem  Figure 2  illustrates the pervasive nature of IoT in that it is at the core of a plethora of both critical and non- critical infrastructures. IoT is pertinent to almost all aspects of daily life, affecting commercial applications,  the industrialisation, or the private sphere, to name a few. Inherently, IoT builds on embedding “intelligence”  in everyday objects, thus increasing the usefulness of what used to be common “things”, and therefore  facilitating all aspects of daily life by providing a greater automation and control in sectors such as industry,  energy, transport, health, retail, etc. The majority of the sectors associated with IoT are critical, and any  incident affecting them can thus severely affect society as a whole.  Industry 4.0 and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) are frequently and rightfully associated with IoT focusing  on digitising industries23. Industry 4.0 is the term coined to refer to the world’s fourth industrial revolution38.  It is defined as the brisk transformation in the design, manufacture, operation and service of manufacturing  systems and products, where digital technology and the Internet merge together with the conventional  industry, achieving digitally connected manufacturing operations with a highly integrated value chain38. In  this study, we focus on the more generic concept of IoT.  This chapter will provide a brief insight into the IoT elements and architecture, including the different  security considerations to be taken into account.  38 See EPRS, Ron Davies, «Industry 4.0», http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2015/568337/EPRS_BRI(2015)568337_EN.pdf  http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2015/568337/EPRS_BRI(2015)568337_EN.pdf  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  19  Elements of IoT  The following sections provide an overview of the different elements that shape the IoT ecosystem, namely  the Things in the IoT, intelligent decision making, sensors and actuators, communications and embedded  systems. A detailed IoT asset taxonomy can be found later in chapter 2.5.  2.1.1 Things in the Internet of Things  In IoT environments, a thing is a physical or virtual object capable of being identified and integrated into  communication networks. It is imperative for things to have the capability of communication – exchanging  data over a network between them and/or with the cloud backend services. Additionally, things may have  other optional features, such as sensing and capturing data, actuating, storing and processing data,  executing native or cloud-based applications, machine learning, etc39. The set of ‘things’ that compose an  IoT ecosystem can be managed by intelligent systems, which are able to autonomously connect to things for  monitoring and controlling them. Moreover, these intelligent systems can retrieve data from a thing or a set  of things and process that data, obtaining useful information in order to make an intelligent decision40.  2.1.2 Intelligent decision making  The number of devices connected to ‘intelligent systems’ that can store, process, analyse and share data is  sharply increasing. This will result in billions of ‘things’ and machines connected to networks and producing  even more data41. Hence, there is a need to deploy data analytics and smart data management techniques  in order to draw meaningful insight from the colossal volume of data being generated40. Moreover, IoT  encompasses the notion of actuating, for which decision making is necessary.  Intelligent decision-making depends first and foremost on the information available to make the decisions.  These decisions can be as simple as a threshold-crossing mechanism, or as advanced as machine learning or  deep learning systems42. The output of these decisions will eventually lead to actions and may feed new  information into the ecosystem. The information used to make intelligent decisions can be either analysed  locally, since some ‘things’ can process the data they gather themselves, or delegated to another element  of the IoT ecosystem, such as the cloud backend service, the aggregator/gateway, another ‘thing’, etc.  This whole process supports several aspects, such as context awareness and adaptation, autonomy, and  self-optimisation/configuration/healing/protection, to name a few.  2.1.3 Sensors and actuators  Sensors are one of the key building blocks of IoT, since they are an integral element that allows to monitor  the environment and the context on which IoT systems operate. They can be as small as millimetres in size,  making them easy to embed in physical objects – from roadways to pacemakers43.  On the physical level, sensors can measure defined physical, chemical or biological indicators, and on the  digital level, they collect information about the network and applications. They then generate associated  quantitative data, which can be processed in real-time, or stored for later retrieval, and that can be received  39 ITU-T Y.2060, «Overview of the Internet of things».

Some examples of sensors are accelerometers, temperature sensors,  pressure sensors, light sensors and acoustic sensors, among others.  Even if they are left unattended in some cases (e.g. roadways), sensors have become essential in a large  number of industries, gathering data for the network and applications to dynamically adapt to optimal  processes at any moment44.  An actuator can be considered as the entity responsible for moving or controlling a system or mechanism.  In simple terms, an actuator operates in the reverse direction of a sensor. It takes an electrical input and  turns it into physical action. Taking the example of smart lamps and smart thermostats, their actuators can  make use of the signal coming from a light sensor to regulate brightness, and of the signal coming from a  temperature sensor to regulate temperature, respectively. Actuators are also commonly used in  manufacturing and assembly processes, where  motors and solenoids are the primary examples of actuators  – for example, valves are a type of actuator, used to control a hydraulic system45.  To summarise, the functions of input devices are performed by sensors that gather information about their  environment and its context, which will be subsequently processed. In contrast, actuators serve as output  units – they act based on the processed information, executing decisions. It should be noted that, in most  IoT deployments, sensors and actuators are not only found standalone, but also integrated into embedded  systems.  2.1.4 Embedded systems  Sensors and actuators are the fundamental elements of IoT. They may be connected to the cloud backend  through gateways to have the data coming from the sensors processed, in order to make a decision. Instead  of only having sensor and/or actuator networks, IoT devices can also be found as embedded systems, which  include embedded sensors and/or actuators, as well as network capabilities to connect directly to a LAN or  to the cloud, a memory footprint and the ability to run software. Additionally, IoT embedded systems are  based on a processing unit that enables them to process data on their own. Some examples of devices that  contain embedded systems comprise medical implants, wearables such as smart watches, connected lights,  smart thermostats, etc. Figure 3 illustrates the structure of an embedded IoT system.  44 IEEE, «Towards a definition of the Internet of Things (IoT)».

The selection of protocols to be used in a particular deployment of IoT  ecosystems depends on the requirements of its use-case. The combination of different protocols within IoT  ecosystems is a common practice, using gateways to ensure interoperability.  IoT communication systems rely on the ability to both transmit and receive information units in a structured  manner, with services located either nearby or in a distant location, using different but interoperable kinds  of network types. These networks have different set of properties such as QoS, resilience, security and  management47.  The communication protocols within IoT ecosystems can be either wireless or wireline-based. There exists  a plethora of wireless communication protocols, including short-range radio protocols such as ZigBee48,  Bluetooth/Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)49, Wi-Fi/Wi-Fi HaLow50, Near Field Communication (NFC)51 or Radio  Frequency Identification (RFID)52; mobile networks and longer-range radio protocols such as LoRaWAN53,  SigFox54 NarrowBand-IoT (NB-IoT)55, or LTE-M56. Each of them is defined in its own standard, for example  ZigBee and ZigBee 3.0 are based on IEEE 802.15.4. Wired communication protocols and links, such as  Ethernet, USB, SPI, MIPI and I2C, among others, also provide access to the devices. Moreover, it is worth  highlighting that IoT communications also support non-IP based protocols, such as SMS, LiDar, Radar, etc.  46 Tara Salman, «Networking Protocols and Standards for Internet of Things».

In ENISA’s Smart Homes study7, the different kinds of networks were also  listed. Nevertheless, given the context of this study, a more generic/horizontal approach has been followed,  thus remaining consistent with the Smart Homes study.  Table 1 depicts an indicative listing of different protocols grouped by communication layer. The datalink  layer handles the connection between IoT devices across a physical link, either wired or wireless, for example  between sensors or between a sensor and the gateway that connects a set of sensors to the Internet. The  network layer is divided into the routing layer, which handles the packet transfer from the source to the  destination, and into the encapsulation layer, which builds the packets. The session layer defines the  protocols enabling messaging capabilities among the elements of the IoT communication subsystem46.  SESSION AMQP, CoAP, DDS, MQTT, XMPP  NETWORK  ENCAPSULATION 6LowPAN, Thread  ROUTING CARP, RPL  DATALINK Bluetooth / BLE, Wi-Fi / Wi-Fi HaLow, LoRaWAN, Neul, SigFox, Z-Wave, ZigBee, USB  Table 1: Indicative listing of communication protocols for IoT46  As stated before, IoT ‘things’ need to both transmit and receive data, yet they do not necessarily need an  Internet connection to do so, only the ability to pass the data they collect/receive on to other ‘things’ capable  of processing that information and/or sending it over an Internet connection. Therefore, it is possible for an  IoT ecosystem made up of multiple ‘things’ to operate without any of them being capable of connecting to  the Internet57. The use of the word ‘Internet’ in the term ‘Internet of Things’ should simply be seen as a  generalisation, implying the notion of connectivity. It should not be interpreted in a stricter, technical sense,  whereby an Internet connection or the IP protocol stack would be a requirement of the IoT ecosystem.  Security considerations  As we become increasingly reliant on intelligent, interconnected devices in every aspect of our lives, the  billions of “things” can be the target of intrusions and interferences that could dramatically jeopardise  personal privacy and threaten public safety58. Therefore, security is one of the main concerns regarding IoT,  which needs to be addressed along with the paramount need for safety, since both matters are tightly  intertwined with the physical world. Another important aspect involves administration of IoT devices,  namely who is going to be responsible for this especially considering the inherent complexity and  heterogeneity of the IoT ecosystem, as well as taking into account scalability concerns.  The following are generic issues identified by this study that hinder the consolidation of secure IoT  ecosystems:   Very large attack surface: The threats and risks related to IoT are manifold and evolve rapidly. Considering  their impact on citizens’ health, safety and privacy (data collection and processing may be unclear to the  users, since IoT is heavily based on the gathering, exchange and processing of large amounts of data from  a variety of sources, sometimes including sensitive data), the threat landscape concerning IoT is  extremely wide.  57 See https://qz.com/228750/the-internet-of-things-may-not-need-an-internet-connection/  58 See https://www.windriver.com/whitepapers/security-in-the-internet-of-things/wr_security-in-the-internet-of-things.pdf  https://qz.com/228750/the-internet-of-things-may-not-need-an-internet-connection/ https://www.windriver.com/whitepapers/security-in-the-internet-of-things/wr_security-in-the-internet-of-things.pdf  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  23   Limited device resources: Applying conventional security practices in IoT could require a substantial  reengineering due to technical constraints. The majority of IoT devices have limited capabilities, e.g.  processing, memory and power, and therefore advanced security controls cannot be effectively applied.   Complex ecosystem: Security concerns are exacerbated since IoT should not be seen as a collection of  independent devices, but rather as a rich, diverse and wide ecosystem involving aspects such as devices,  communications, interfaces, and people.   Fragmentation of standards and regulations: The fragmented and slow adoption of standards and  regulations to guide the adoption of IoT security measures and good practices, as well as the continuous  emergence of novel technologies, further complicate relevant concerns.   Widespread deployment: Apart from commercial applications of IoT, recent trends have seen Critical  Infrastructures (CIs) migrating toward Smart ones by employing IoT on top of legacy infrastructures.   Security integration: This is a very challenging task, due to the presence of possibly contradicting  viewpoints and requirements from all involved stakeholders. For example, different IoT devices and  systems may be based on different authentication solutions, which must be integrated and made  interoperable.   Safety aspects: They are very relevant in the IoT context because of the presence of actuators, which act  on the physical world. Security threats can become safety threats as, for instance, the recent  cybersecurity attacks on connected vehicles have demonstrated10.   Low cost: The wide penetration of IoT and the advanced functionalities it offers in several critical sectors  denotes the potential for significant cost savings by exploiting features such as data flows, advanced  monitoring, and integration to name a few. Conversely, it is often the case that the low cost that is usually  associated with IoT devices and systems will have implications in terms of security. Manufacturers might  be inclined to limit security features to ensure a low cost and thus product security might not be able to  protect against certain types of IoT attacks.   Lack of expertise: This is a rather novel domain and therefore there is a lack of people with the suitable  skillset and expertise in IoT cybersecurity.   Security updates: Applying security updates to IoT is extremely challenging, since the particularity of the  user interfaces available to users does not allow traditional update mechanisms. Securing of those  mechanisms is in itself a daunting task, especially considering Over-The-Air updates.   Insecure programming: Since the “time to market” pressure for IoT products is higher than in other  domains, this imposes constraints on the available efforts to develop security and privacy by design. For  this reason, and sometimes also due to budget issues, companies developing IoT products generally place  more emphasis on functionality and usability than on security.   Unclear liabilities: The lack of a clear assignment of liabilities might lead to ambiguities and conflicts in  case of a security incident, especially considering the large and complex supply chain involved in IoT.  Moreover, the question of how to manage security if one single component were shared by several  parties remains unanswered. Enforcing liability is another major issue.  Challenge of defining horizontal baseline security measures  ENISA together with the vast majority of the experts interviewed agree on the complexity of studying IoT  security in a horizontal way, due to the security measures and the impact of the threats being determined  by the criticality of the different assets, which differs depending on the use case, the application use and the  use scenario.  For each IoT environment it is necessary to carry out a risk assessment to go through the threats that can  affect the different assets, define the plausible attack scenarios, and put them in the context of the IoT  service defined, working out which hazards are critical or not and which ones can be mitigated. These  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  24  reasons highlight the intricacy involved in approaching the IoT in a horizontal way, rather than tackling a  specific IoT vertical59 such as Smart Cars10, Smart Airports11, Smart Hospitals12, Smart Homes7, Intelligent  Public Transport60, ICS/SCADA61, etc.  Nonetheless, this report considers the horizontal aspects of IoT as seen across vertical sectors and thus aims  to satisfy the paramount need to define baseline security measures for IoT across Critical Information  Infrastructures. In this respect, this report complements the aforementioned previous efforts of ENISA in  the vertical sectors and thus promotes a holistic approach towards IoT security.  Architecture  Since IoT solutions are developed with specific technologies and focus on specific applications, they lack  standardisation, which results in fragmented and heterogeneous architectures. ENISA studied and reviewed  several existing IoT architectures and based on them, put forward an architecture that encompasses key  elements of those architectures, promoting a significant degree of interoperability across different assets,  platforms environments, etc., with the ambition of laying down a common architectural basis for IoT in a  horizontal. The main IoT architectures studied are:   AIOTI High Level Architecture functional model62   FP7-ICT – IoT-A Architectural reference model63   NIST Network of Things (NoT)64   ITU-T IoT reference model39   ISO/IEC CD 30141 Internet of Things Reference Architecture (IoT RA)65   ISACA Conceptual IoT Architecture66   oneM2M Architecture Model67   IEEE P2413 - Standard for an Architectural Framework68  Having analysed the aforementioned architectures, we abstracted and extrapolated the fundamental  elements into a consolidated high-level IoT reference model, which encompasses the key elements of these  architectures. The objective was to utilise this high-level reference model (Figure 4) in order to define the  assets for IoT security and to assist us in consistently applying our methodology in identifying threats and  attacks. The following diagram depicts this high-level reference model.  59 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures  60 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practices-recommendations  61 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ics-scada-dependencies  62 See https://aioti-space.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AIOTI-WG3-IoT-High-Level-Architecture-Release_2_1.pdf  63 See http://www.meet-iot.eu/deliverables-IOTA/D1_5.pdf  64 See http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-183.pdf  65 See https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/wiki/images/9/9a/10N0536_CD_text_of_ISO_IEC_30141.pdf  66 See https://www.isaca.org/Journal/archives/2017/Volume-3/Pages/default.aspx  67 See http://www.onem2m.org/images/files/deliverables/Release2/TS-0001-%20Functional_Architecture-V2_10_0.pdf  68 See https://standards.ieee.org/develop/project/2413.html  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practices-recommendations https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ics-scada-dependencies https://aioti-space.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AIOTI-WG3-IoT-High-Level-Architecture-Release_2_1.pdf http://www.meet-iot.eu/deliverables-IOTA/D1_5.pdf http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-183.pdf https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/wiki/images/9/9a/10N0536_CD_text_of_ISO_IEC_30141.pdf https://www.isaca.org/Journal/archives/2017/Volume-3/Pages/default.aspx http://www.onem2m.org/images/files/deliverables/Release2/TS-0001-%20Functional_Architecture-V2_10_0.pdf https://standards.ieee.org/develop/project/2413.html  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  25  Figure 4: IoT High-level reference model  The different elements that compose the IoT high-level reference model are illustrated in Figure 4. It should  be noted that we do not aspire to set forth a novel IoT architecture or reference model. Conversely, by  analysing existing such efforts we aim at abstracting their fundamental elements in order to coherently and  systematically identify the assets to be protected. Moreover, the horizontal nature of security should be  underlined in the context of the IoT ecosystem. It applies to all the different elements of the reference model  – not only the devices that need to be secured logically and physically, but also the communications, the  network elements, the stored information, the cloud platform, etc. With no intention of being exhaustive,  there are several security considerations to take into account, such as for example authentication,  availability, resilience and authorisation mechanisms, or the use of encryption to protect the confidentiality  of data, both at rest and in transit. Figure 4 indicatively lists some of the security mechanisms that can be  considered, whereas it should also be noted that privacy has an equally important place and should be also  considered across the IoT ecosystem.  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  26  Asset taxonomy  Tackling cyber security starts from asset identification and decomposition. This section provides an overview  of the key asset groups and assets to be protected in an IoT ecosystem. Since we are approaching IoT in a  horizontal way, the level of protection for a given asset will vary depending on the use case, the application  used and the use scenario of said IoT ecosystem.  The different IoT assets have been divided into the key asset groups defined. This asset taxonomy is depicted  in Figure 5, and Table 2 details and elaborates on the different assets. It should be noted that the lowest  level of the taxonomy is indicative and not exhaustive. For instance, not all sensor types are listed, just some  representative ones. This also applies to the networks, the protocols, etc.  Figure 5: Asset taxonomy  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  27  ASSET GROUP ASSETS DESCRIPTION  IoT Devices  Hardware  The different physical components (except sensors and actuators) from which the IoT  devices can be built.

Devices to manage  Things  These are devices specially designed to manage other IoT devices, networks etc.  Embedded systems  They are based on a processing unit that enables them to process data on their own.  They include embedded sensors and/or actuators, network capabilities to connect  directly to the cloud, a memory footprint and the ability to run software.  Communications  Networks  They allow the different nodes of an IoT ecosystem to exchange data and information  with each other, via a data link. There are different kinds of networks according to their  spatial coverage, which include (W)LANs, (W)PANs, PANs and (W)WANs, among others.  Protocols  They define the set of rules on how communication between two or more IoT devices  must be performed through a given channel. There are many communication protocols,  which can be either wireless or wireline-based. Examples of IoT communication  protocols are ZigBee, MQTT, CoAP, BLE, etc.  Infrastructure  Routers  They are the networking components that forward data packets between the different  networks of the IoT ecosystem.  Gateways  These are the network nodes used for interfacing with another network from the IoT  environment that uses different protocols. Gateways may provide protocol translators,  fault isolators, etc., to provide system interoperability.  Power supply  It supplies electric power to an IoT device and to its internal components. The power  source can be external and wired or a battery integrated in the device itself.  Security assets  This group comprises the assets specifically focused on the security of the IoT devices,  networks and information. Most prominently, these include firewalls, Web Application  Firewalls (WAF), CASBs for protecting the cloud, IDSs, IPSs and  authentication/authorisation systems.  Platform &  Backend  Web-based services  These are services within the World Wide Web, which provide a web-based interface to  web users or to web-connected applications. This means web technologies can be used  in IoT for Human-to-Machine (H2M) communications and for M2M communications.  Cloud infrastructure  and services  In IoT, the cloud backend can be used to aggregate and process data from dispersed  devices, and it also provides computing capabilities, storage, applications, services, etc.  Decision making  Data mining  This refers to algorithms and services to process collected data and transform it into a  defined structure for further use, using big data technologies for discovering patterns  in very large data sets.  Data processing and  computing  Services facilitating the processing of gathered data in order to obtain useful  information, which can be used to apply rules and logic, to make decisions and to  automate processes. Machine learning can be employed to learn from the use of  information available over time.  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  28  Applications &  Services  Data analytics and  visualisation  Once the data has been collected and processed, the resulting information can be  analysed and visualised in order to identify new patterns, improve operational  efficiency, etc.  Device and network  management  The management of the IoT ecosystem devices and networks includes the software  updates of the OS, firmware and applications. It also encompasses the tracking and  monitoring of the devices and networks, collecting and storing logs that can later be  used for diagnostics.  Device usage  The contextualisation of the IoT ecosystem devices and networks, so as to understand  the current status, usage patterns, performance, etc.  Information  At rest Information stored in a database in the cloud backend or in the devices themselves.  In transit  Information sent or exchanged through the network between two or more IoT  elements.  In use Information used by an application, service or IoT element in general.  Table 2: Asset taxonomy  Figure 6 provides a view of the criticality of the main assets described in the asset taxonomy, based on the  responses received by the subject matter experts in the interviews. These interviews involved a structured  questionnaire where one of the questions the experts were asked was to evaluate the main IoT assets  according to their criticality. The experts could classify the assets as not important, of low importance, of  medium importance, of high importance and of crucial importance.  It is worth putting again special emphasis on the complexity of defining the criticality of a given asset in a  horizontal way rather than considering a specific vertical use case. Abstracting from this fact is very  challenging, but that is the goal of this report.

Therefore,  when addressing security in IoT, those assets should be prioritised. Once again, these results are based on a  horizontal approach; hence, they could vary depending on the different deployments and use cases.  Anyhow, conducting an asset and risk assessment is key to determine the criticality of the assets and threats  that affect a specific IoT environment.  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  30  3. Threats and risk analysis  The main objective of this chapter is to determine and list the main security threats, vulnerabilities, risk  factors and attack scenarios that affect IoT devices and networks, taking the different levels of importance  and criticality the interviewed experts provided for each threat, risk and attack scenario into consideration.  Furthermore, the three most critical attack scenarios are developed in detail in order to underline their  intricacies and propose specific security measures to counter their impact and adverse effects.  Security incidents  The number of security threats targeting IoT devices has increased over the last years. Figure 7 illustrates  some of the main IoT security incidents that have been discovered and/or have taken place since 2009, so  as to highlight how the number attacks on IoT have greatly increased. It should be noted that this list is not  exhaustive, it includes only the main examples. Given the ever wider penetration of IoT across the entire  spectrum of daily activities and critical infrastructures, the occurrence of cybersecurity incidents is bound to  have an increasing rate. A more detailed description of each security incident can be found in Annex D.  Figure 7: Indicative timeline of IoT security incidents  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  31  Threat taxonomy  As observed in the previous section, the number of attacks directly related to IoT has grown over the last  few years reaching the point where it became mainstream news article in 2016 with the Mirai botnet  attacks. These attacks, in their great majority, are related to devices that have been violated or to systems  that have been compromised, increasing at the same time the number of hazards to be faced in IoT.  Being consistent with the ENISA Threat Taxonomy69, we depict in Figure 8 the threat taxonomy focused  on IoT with some examples of attacks listed (non exhaustive listing).  69 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/enisa-threat-landscape/etl2015/enisa-threat-taxonomy-a- tool-for-structuring-threat-information  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/enisa-threat-landscape/etl2015/enisa-threat-taxonomy-a-tool-for-structuring-threat-information https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/enisa-threat-landscape/etl2015/enisa-threat-taxonomy-a-tool-for-structuring-threat-information  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  32  Figure 8: IoT Threat taxonomy  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  33  Nevertheless, the different threats have different potential impacts, since they vary according to the use  case scenarios. In the interviews, the IoT experts provided insight into the varying impact of the threats. The  most relevant ones are shown in Figure 9.  Figure 9: IoT threats impact  The impact of each threat was determined by calculating a weighted average of the responses from the  interviewees, which were based on a five-step scale that ranged from no importance to crucial importance.  While Figure 9 provides a visual representation of each threat’s impact, Figure 10 depicts the exact result of  the calculation, where values between 3 and 3.5 out of 5 represent medium-importance threats, values  between 3.5 and 4 out of 5 represent high-importance threats, and values over 4 out of 5 represent crucial- importance threats. Values below 3 out of 5 represent low-importance and no-importance threat, but it  should be noted that no threat got that rating. Moreover, it can be seen that the average impact is rated as  high, since the value of the average impact is 3.7 out of 5.

The different attack scenarios and the level of  importance of each attack have been gathered from the desktop research as well as the information  provided by the experts who have contributed to the report.  It is worth noting that the attacks may take place throughout the whole process, and the impact that attacks  may have on each specific part of the process has also been analysed. The importance level provided for  each sample attack scenario ranges from low and medium through high and crucial, representing the  negative impact level these attacks could have in a real-life incident, according to the input of the experts  interviewed. This information is synthesised in Table 4.  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  36  ATTACK SCENARIOS IMPORTANCE LEVEL  1. Against the network link between controller(s) and actuators High – Crucial  2. Against sensors, modifying the values read by them or their threshold values and settings High – Crucial  3. Against actuators, modifying or sabotaging their normal settings High – Crucial  4. Against the administration systems of IoT High – Crucial  5. Exploiting protocol vulnerabilities High  6.

Power source manipulation and exploitation of vulnerabilities in data readings Medium – High  10. Ransomware Medium – Crucial70  Table 4: IoT attack scenarios  For these scenarios, additional relevant feedback in the context of this report was received. Each section  includes a brief description, the potential impact, and threats:  1. Against the network link between controller(s) and actuators  Eavesdropping is a threat that allows an attacker to extract sensitive and operational information that can  be used for multiple malicious activities, including later attacks against IoT systems. In Advanced Persistent  Threat (APT) attacks, eavesdropping and information gathering comprise one of the first stages carried out  in order to identify weak spots and potential entry/attack points.   Impact: the main effect is the leakage of data. Depending on the environment, the severity can be  lower or greater, but it may also be signalling a larger attack in progress.   Threats related: eavesdropping and leakage of sensitive data.  2. Against sensors, modifying the values read by them or their threshold values and settings  The attacker manipulates the configuration of the sensors, changing the threshold values established on the  sensors, to allow out-of-range read values to be accepted when they should not, posing a severe threat to  the systems and installations. As larger installations usually have multiple and redundant sensors, the  attacker would have to compromise multiple sensors for the attack to be efficient; if only one were  compromised, the readings could be compensated with the input from the rest of the sensors.   Impact: allowing sensors to report and accept incorrect values puts the IoT environment at risk; a  malfunctioning sensor may allow a power spike to go through, physically damaging the systems.  70 Depending on the target, the impact of the attack could range from medium through crucial. For instance, the impact of the ransomware attack  against the digital key system of a hotel, example found in Figure 7 and in Annex D:, was not critical. Nevertheless, a ransomware the size of WannaCry  (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/info-notes/wannacry-ransomware-outburst) aimed against IoT infrastructures could have an extreme  impact and affect systems at an international scale.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/info-notes/wannacry-ransomware-outburst  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  37   Threats related: attacks on privacy and leakages of sensitive data/modification of information.  3. Against actuators, modifying or sabotaging their normal settings Manipulation of the actuators’ configuration/parameters making them use wrong configurations, thresholds or data, and therefore affecting their normal behaviour by sabotaging their normal operation settings.   Impact: it varies depending on the actuators affected. It can affect production processes.   Threats related: network outage and counterfeit by malicious devices.  4. Against the administration systems of IoT An attacker tries to gain full control over the administration system of an IoT system or device, potentially compromising the whole environment. It can be quite successful if weak or default passwords are used. This type of attack comprises different stages/phases and it is usually launched in a covert manner. It should be noted that this type of attack should be taken into account for the entire lifecycle of the device.   Impact: the compromise, manipulation or interruption of certain IoT systems could affect many people, cause environmental issues and even extend to other systems, affecting their communications or even disabling them.   Threats related: weak passwords, exploit kits, attacks on privacy, malware and DDoS.  5. Exploit Protocol vulnerabilities This type of exploitation is usually the gateway to launch other types of attacks; it is a means to an end. Exploits are used to gain privileged unauthorised access to a system, which can lead to the installation of other malicious content or backdoors. It is used as part of an attack, regardless of whether the target is a single system/device or a whole network. It is difficult to detect these exploits, and it is much easier to detect the actions carried out after the exploit has been successful.   Impact: if successful, the exploit creates an entry point to a system, in some cases with elevated privileges; if not, the system is likely to crash or become unstable. This attack is always used as part of a larger attack, which could be a simple data theft or a complex APT.   Threats related: exploit kits, malware and APTs.  6. Against devices by injecting commands into the system console This type of attack takes place when an attacker injects and executes commands with privileges in a compromised system through its console.   Impact: if the attacker is able to inject commands into a device, he or she could manage to breach another machine in the environment. This would produce a cascade effect on the system, and the attacker would be able to use all these devices for malicious purposes.   Threats related: Exploit kits, DDoS and network outage.  7. Stepping stone attacks This type of attack is a common way to launch anonymous attacks. They are often used by network intruders to hide their identities, since they launch attacks not from their own computer but from intermediary hosts that they previously compromised.   Impact: if an attacker launches a stepping stone attack, he or she could compromise a collection of hosts, using them as stepping stones to relay attack commands.   Threats related: APTs, DDoS, counterfeit by malicious devices.  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  38  8. DDoS using an IoT botnet This type of attack does not target IoT devices themselves, but instead it uses them to attack other devices, not necessarily IoT ones. Firstly, a malware automatically finds vulnerable Internet of Things devices, infecting and conscripting them into a botnet, which then can be used to mount DDoS attacks, flooding the target's servers with malicious traffic.   Impact: the target device or service will be flooded with malicious traffic, taking it down.   Threats related: exploit kits, DDoS and counterfeit by malicious devices.  9. Power source manipulation and exploitation of vulnerabilities in data readings These attacks focus on manipulating power sources and exploiting vulnerabilities to modify the power data read. An attacker can tamper with the device’s battery or power input cabling either physically, by manipulating the power source itself, or with malware, by manipulating the way a device reads the information coming from the power source in order to, for example, make the device believe the battery level is higher or lower than the actual level. Some types of smart devices may be dependent on batteries for their normal operation. This feature may seem like an advantage over the less usual cables but, far from this, it requires taking into account certain aspects of security.   Impact: physical tampering a battery can damage it, potentially causing the device not being able to operate at all. The manipulation of the way a device reads the charge level coming from the battery can lead to the device believing the battery level is higher than the real one, causing the device to run out of battery and shut down, or lower than the real one, causing the device to enter a power- saving mode of operation, affecting the performance of the device.   Threats related: malware, physical attacks.  10. Ransomware These attacks are carried out by a malware that perpetually blocks access to the victim's data unless a ransom is paid. Since these attacks are malware-based, they can be evaded by updating/patching vulnerable devices. This can be also done outside the IoT ecosystem, such as with the WannaCry attack that took place on May 201770, where the patch for the vulnerability that WannaCry exploited was released months before the attack. The problem regarding IoT is the difficulty to update/patch the different devices - some of them do not even have the ability to be updated or patched.   Impact: there are many possible targets for ransomware within IoT – an attacker could take control of a smart thermostat in the middle of winter and demand payment before the heat can be turned on, he could hold power grids or hospitals systems for ransom, etc., putting people safety at risk.   Threats related: exploit kits, DDoS, malware, weak passwords.  Critical attack scenarios  During the interviews with experts and relevant stakeholders, the aforementioned attack scenarios  regarding IoT environments were described and detailed. The experts were asked to rank the 10 example  attack scenarios in terms of criticality and the following three were also the most worrisome ones for  interviewees. Figure 11 depicts the average criticality of a given attack scenario based on the input gathered  from the expert interviews. Again, the challenge lies in defining the criticality level of an attack on an IoT  environment when doing so in a horizontal manner.  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  39  Figure 11: Attack scenario criticality  The three attack scenarios that stand out are:   Attack Scenario 1: IoT administration system compromise   Attack Scenario 2: Value manipulation in IoT devices   Attack Scenario 3: Botnet / Commands Injection  The following sections detail each of these scenarios, including their impact, the stakeholders involved, the  cascade effect risk, the gaps, the countermeasures that can be applied to protect against them, and more  technical details. The detailed description of each one of those countermeasures can be found in Annex A:  and in Annex B:.  3.4.1 Attack scenario 1: IoT administration system compromise  This attack covers an infection designed to take control over one or multiple IoT devices within an IoT  environment, in order to manipulate or crash them and to be able to modify values, change their  functioning/behaviour or deny access to them. This attack scenario is based on an Enterprise gateway  attack71,72.  As depicted in Figure 12, the first step is to gather information in the network about the different IoT devices  used in the enterprise. Once an IoT device is identified and selected, the attacker gathers specific information  about its vulnerabilities. The next step is to exploit the different vulnerabilities found in that device, and to  compromise the network. After that, the attacker ensures the persistence of the access to the system by  configuring a backdoor. At this point, the attacker only needs to update the system (e.g. with a modified  firmware) for the device to be permanently compromised. This way, the attacker gains full control over the  71 See http://www.csoonline.com/article/3148806/internet-of-things/the-iot-gateway-for-enterprise-hackers.html  72 See https://securelist.lat/iot-el-da-que-ataqu-mi-propia-casa/72452/  58,33%  58,33%  62,50%  69,44%  73,61%  73,61%  81,94%  84,72%  88,89%  Power source manipulation  Stepping stones attacks  Exploiting protocol vulnerabilities  Against actuators, modifying or sabotaging their normal settings  Against the information transiting the network  Against the network link between controller(s) and actuators  Against devices, injecting commands  Against sensors, modifying the values read by them or their threshold values and settings  Against the administration systems of IoT  0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%  http://www.csoonline.com/article/3148806/internet-of-things/the-iot-gateway-for-enterprise-hackers.html https://securelist.lat/iot-el-da-que-ataqu-mi-propia-casa/72452/  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  40  device – he/she gains the ability to see all the data and information the device has gathered and has remote  access to use whenever he/she wants, etc.  Figure 12: Attack 1 – IoT administration system compromised  IO T  SY ST  EM  C  O M  P R  O M  IS E  IMPACT  Crucial: the compromise of an IoT administration system grants the attacker access to all the assets (devices, networks, etc.)  which fall under the control of that administration system. When compromised, the attacker is capable of performing  administrative tasks within those assets, such as extracting confidential information from them, making them malfunction  and directly affecting the behaviour of the IoT environment, etc. Since a compromised administration system leads to several  assets being compromised over a long period of time and without being detected, the impact of this attack can be critical.  EASE OF DETECTION CASCADE EFFECT RISK  Medium: the changes to an IoT administration system can be  detected through a correct monitoring and a proper logging  system.  High: the risk entailed is that, once an IoT device belonging  to a specific IoT network is compromised, it becomes very  easy to compromise the rest.  ASSETS AFFECTED STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED  Devices to interface with things  Devices to manage things  Smartphones / Tablets  Gateways  Software  Sensitive information  IoT experts, software developers and manufacturers  Information security experts  IT/Security solutions architects  Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs)  ATTACK STEPS (SAMPLE BASED ON A REAL-CASE ATTACK SCENARIO)  1. Gathering of information about the infrastructure 2. Identification of system components 3. The attacker gathers further information to identify the vulnerable system  4. The vulnerable system is identified 5. Exploitation of vulnerabilities to compromise first the system and then through the system the network  6. A backdoor is installed in order to maintain access to that system 7. The attacker ensures the IoT systems are updated with modified firmware either by downloading and updating the  firmware instantly, or by modifying the repository of update files. This is done to grant the attacker exclusive access and  restrict other remote accesses  8. Finally the attacker takes control over the IoT environment  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  41  Table 5: Attack 1 – IoT administration system compromise  3.4.2 Attack scenario 2: Value manipulation in IoT devices  The manipulation of calibration parameters established for the sensors allows undesired values to be  accepted when they should not, which poses a severe threat to critical systems. This attack targets the  sensor processing and knowledge model levels of the control system of an industrial robot in an Industry 4.0  environment73.  Figure 13 describes this attack, which starts with the calibration of a robot sensing equipment after a  configuration change or when connected to a controller. The calibration data initially stored in the sensing  equipment is transmitted to the controller during the system boot. Since the robot uses its local copy of that  data, an attacker can manipulate the calibration parameters, causing the robot to move erratically or  unexpectedly (in decision making, wrong input values lead to wrong decisions).  73 See https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/wp/wp-industrial-robot-security.pdf  RECOVERY TIME / EFFORT GAPS AND CHALLENGES  Medium: it depends on the perimeter of the assets  compromised and on the number of assets infected.

A  botnet is a network of automatic devices that interact to accomplish some distributed task. Due to the  characteristic interconnection of IoT devices and their poor configuration, carrying out such an attack is  simple. This attack scenario is based on the Mirai botnet74, which has conducted several of the most forceful  DDoS attacks in recent history, and has proven capable of attacking varied kinds of targets, from  KrebsOnSecurity website to a whole country’s telecommunication infrastructure75. Therefore, with potential  targets such as a hazardous energy infrastructure, the impact of a Mirai’s attack can reach extremely critical  levels.  The steps to follow in order to carry out this type of attack are illustrated in Figure 14. The first one is  scanning open ports in IoT devices that are accessible over the Internet, which are usually poorly protected  by default usernames and passwords that, users never change. Once the attacker gains access to the device,  he or she will inject commands into the device’s console in order to obtain administrator privileges. If the  attacker succeeds in obtaining these permissions, he or she will then make the device connect to a Command  and Control (C&C) under his or her control, to download and execute a malicious script. The script will then  be executed, deleting itself afterward and running in-memory. Then, it will begin to spread, attacking the  same way other vulnerable devices, in order to gather an IoT device army, conscripting them into a botnet,  which the attacker will be able to control from a C&C centre, in order to launch distributed attacks conducted  by the botnet.  74 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/info-notes/major-ddos-attacks-involving-iot-devices  75 See http://www.energycollection.us/Companies/ICIT/Rise-Machines.pdf  GP-PS-10: Establish and maintain asset management procedures and configuration controls for key network and information systems  GP-PS-11: Identify significant risks using a defence-in-depth approach  GP-TM-15: Design with system and operational disruption in mind, preventing the system from causing unacceptable  risk of injury or physical damage  GP-TM-31: Measures for tamper protection and detection.

Security measures and good practices  This chapter provides a detailed list of security measures and good practices, which aim to mitigate the  threats, vulnerabilities and risks identified in the study that affect IoT devices and environments. These  security measures and good practices have been defined with the aim to apply to the different IoT  environments and deployments in a horizontal manner, instead of providing IoT vertical-specific security.  Therefore, the security measures defined cover a wide range of security considerations, such as security by  design, data protection, risk analysis, etc.  The set of security measures / good practices of this report has been determined based on a very extensive  and thorough desktop research, which took into account different security guidelines, standards, etc. The  list of these resources can be found in Annex C:.  The different security measures and good practices identified fall into several security domains defined for  the report. This domain division’s purpose is to cover every IoT environment horizontally, so as to classify  and define which security measures apply to which different IoT ecosystem areas. The proposed security  domains are organised as follows:   Information System Security Governance & Risk Management: Includes security measures regarding  information system security risk analysis, policy, accreditation, indicators and audit, and human resource  security.   Ecosystem Management: Includes security measures regarding ecosystem mapping and ecosystem  relations.   IT Security Architecture: Includes security measures regarding systems configuration, asset management,  system segregation, traffic filtering and cryptography.   IT Security Administration: Includes security measures regarding administration accounts and  administration information systems.   Identity and access management: Includes security measures regarding authentication, identification and  access rights.   IT security maintenance: Includes security measures regarding IT security maintenance procedures and  remote access.   Physical and environmental security   Detection: Includes security measures regarding detection, logging, and log correlation and analysis.   Computer security incident management: Includes security measures regarding information system  security incident analysis and response, and incident report.   Continuity of Operations: Includes security measures regarding business continuity management and  disaster recovery management.   Crisis Management: Includes security measures regarding crisis management organization and process.  These security domains have been considered when developing the different security measures/good  practices for IoT, which can be found below in points 4.1 through 4.3. The detailed description of each  security measure/good practice and its security domain, along with the documents and references that have  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  47  been analysed in order to extract it, can be found in Annex A: together with all the relevant examples.  Additionally, in Annex B:, each security measure can be found mapped to the threats related to it.  As mentioned earlier, these security domains classify the security measures based on which area of an IoT  ecosystem they apply to. Apart from their area of application, each security measure can be arranged  according to its nature – they can be policies that must be taken into account when developing the devices,  organisational measures focused on the business and employees that need to be adopted by the  organisation itself, and finally, technical measures aimed at reducing the potential risks that the IoT devices  and other elements of the IoT ecosystem may be subject to. Accordingly, the identified IoT baseline security  measures (denoted henceforth as GP-Good Practices) are presented here and arranged according to three  main categories:   Policies (PS)   Organisational, People and Process measures (OP)   Technical Measures (TM)  Policies  The first set of security measures refers to policies that generally target information security and aim at  making it more concrete and robust. These should be adequate for the organisation’s activity and must  contain well documented information. In this context, the following security good practices have been  defined.  It is worth mentioning that when referring to security and privacy by design, the security measures should  reflect the particularities and the context in which the IoT device or system will be deployed (for example,  security by design will refer to different specifications when an IoT device at a home environment is  considered, compared to the case of an IoT device in a critical infrastructure). As discussed, when it comes  to IoT the cyber risk is context-dependent (i.e. based on the application scenario) and in this respect the  security measures should be applied with this consideration in mind.  4.1.1 Security by design   GP-PS-01: Consider the security of the whole IoT system from a consistent and holistic approach during  its whole lifecycle across all levels of device/application design and development, integrating security throughout the development, manufacture, and deployment.   GP-PS-02: Ensure the ability to integrate different security policies and techniques.   GP-PS-03: Security must consider the risk posed to human safety.   GP-PS-04: Designing for power conservation should not compromise security.   GP-PS-05: Design architecture by compartments to encapsulate elements in case of attacks.   GP-PS-06: For IoT hardware manufacturers and IoT software developers it is necessary to implement test plans to verify whether the product performs as it is expected. Penetration tests help to identify malformed input handling, authentication bypass attempts and overall security posture.   GP-PS-07: For IoT software developers it is important to conduct code review during implementation as it helps to reduce bugs in a final version of a product.  4.1.2 Privacy by design   GP-PS-08: Make privacy an integral part of the system.   GP-PS-09: Perform privacy impact assessments before any new applications are launched.  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  48  4.1.3 Asset Management   GP-PS-10: Establish and maintain asset management procedures and configuration controls for key  network and information systems.  4.1.4 Risk and Threat Identification and Assessment   GP-PS-11: Identify significant risks using a defence-in-depth approach.   GP-PS-12: Identify the intended use and environment of a given IoT device.  Organisational, People and Process measures  All businesses must have organisational criteria for information security. Their personnel practices need to  promote good security, ensure the management of processes and safely operate the information in the  organisation practices. Organisations should ensure that contractors and suppliers are responsible and  accountable for the functions considered. In the event of an incident in the safety of the organisation, the  organisation must be prepared (responsibilities, evaluation and response).  4.2.1 End-of-life support   GP-OP-01: Develop an end-of-life strategy for IoT products.   GP-OP-02: Disclose the duration and end-of-life security and patch support (beyond product warranty).   GP-OP-03: Monitor the performance and patch known vulnerabilities up until the “end-of-support|”  period of a product’s lifecycle.  4.2.2 Proven solutions   GP-OP-04: Use proven solutions, i.e. well known communications protocols and cryptographic  algorithms, recognized by the scientific community, etc. Certain proprietary solutions, such as custom  cryptographic algorithms, should be avoided.  4.2.3 Management of security vulnerabilities and/or incidents   GP-OP-05: Establish procedures for analysing and handling security incidents.   GP-OP-06: Coordinated disclosure of vulnerabilities.   GP-OP-07: Participate in information-sharing platforms to report vulnerabilities and receive timely and  critical information about current cyber threats and vulnerabilities from public and private partners.   GP-OP-08: Create a publicly disclosed mechanism for vulnerability reports, e.g. Bug Bounty programs.  4.2.4 Human Resources Security Training and Awareness   GP-OP-09: Ensure the personnel practices promote privacy and security – train employees in good privacy  and security practices.   GP-OP-10: Document and monitor the privacy and security training activities.   GP-OP-11: Ensure that cybersecurity roles and responsibilities for all workforce are established and  introduce personnel assignments in accordance with the specifics of the projects and security engineering  needs.  4.2.5 Third-Party relationships   GP-OP-12: Data processed by a third-party must be protected by a data processing agreement.   GP-OP-13: Only share consumers’ personal data with third parties with express consent of the  consumers, unless otherwise required and limited for the use of product features or service operations.   GP-OP-14: For IoT hardware manufacturers and IoT software developers it is necessary to adopt cyber  supply chain risk management policies and to communicate cyber security requirements to its suppliers  and partners.  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  49  Technical Measures  Evidently, the security measures and good practices need to consider and cover the technical elements, in  order to diminish the vulnerabilities of IoT. Below we provide an overview of the necessary technical  measures to preserve and protect the security of information in IoT. Since these are horizontal measures  across vertical sectors/CIIs, given the particularities of each vertical, more concrete measures can be  introduced for each vertical/CII.  Applying these technical measures should take into account the particularities of the IoT ecosystem such as  scalability, namely given the huge number of involved devices certain measures might need to be carried  out at the level of specialised architectural components, e.g. gateways.  4.3.1 Hardware security   GP-TM-01: Employ a hardware-based immutable root of trust.   GP-TM-02: Use hardware that incorporates security features to strengthen the protection and integrity  of the device – for example, specialised security chips / coprocessors that integrate security at the  transistor level, embedded in the processor, providing, among other things, a trusted storage of device  identity and authentication means, protection of keys at rest and in use, and preventing unprivileged  from accessing to security sensitive code. Protection against local and physical attacks can be covered via  functional security.  4.3.2 Trust and Integrity Management   GP-TM-03: Trust must be established in the boot environment before any trust in any other software or  executable program can be claimed.   GP-TM-04: Sign code cryptographically to ensure it has not been tampered with after signing it as safe  for the device, and implement run-time protection and secure execution monitoring to make sure  malicious attacks do not overwrite code after it is loaded.   GP-TM-05: Control the installation of software in operating systems, to prevent unauthenticated  software and files from being loaded onto it.   GP-TM-06: Enable a system to return to a state that was known to be secure, after a security breach has  occured or if an upgrade has not been successful.   GP-TM-07: Use protocols and mechanisms able to represent and manage trust and trust relationships.  4.3.3 Strong default security and privacy   GP-TM-08: Any applicable security features should be enabled by default, and any unused or insecure  functionalities should be disabled by default.   GP-TM-09: Establish hard to crack, device-individual default passwords.  4.3.4 Data protection and compliance   GP-TM-10: Personal data must be collected and processed fairly and lawfully, it should never be collected  and processed without the data subject’s consent.   GP-TM-11: Make sure that personal data is used for the specified purposes for which they were collected,  and that any further processing of personal data is compatible and that the data subjects are well  informed.   GP-TM-12: Minimise the data collected and retained.   GP-TM-13: IoT stakeholders must be compliant with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).   GP-TM-14: Users of IoT products and services must be able to exercise their rights to information, access,  erasure, rectification, data portability, restriction of processing, objection to processing, and their right  not to be evaluated on the basis of automated processing.  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  50  4.3.5 System safety and reliability   GP-TM-15: Design with system and operational disruption in mind, preventing the system from causing  an unacceptable risk of injury or physical damage.   GP-TM-16: Mechanisms for self-diagnosis and self-repair/healing to recover from failure, malfunction or  a compromised state.   GP-TM-17: Ensure standalone operation - essential features should continue to work with a loss of  communications and chronicle negative impacts from compromised devices or cloud-based systems.  4.3.6 Secure Software / Firmware updates   GP-TM-18: Ensure that the device software/firmware, its configuration and its applications have the  ability to update Over-The-Air (OTA), that the update server is secure, that the update file is transmitted  via a secure connection, that it does not contain sensitive data (e.g. hardcoded credentials), that it is  signed by an authorised trust entity and encrypted using accepted encryption methods, and that the  update package has its digital signature, signing certificate and signing certificate chain, verified by the  device before the update process begins.   GP-TM-19: Offer an automatic firmware update mechanism.   GP-TM-20: Backward compatibility of firmware updates. Automatic firmware updates should not modify  user-configured preferences, security, and/or privacy settings without user notification.  4.3.7 Authentication   GP-TM-21: Design the authentication and authorisation schemes (unique per device) based on the  system-level threat models.   GP-TM-22: Ensure that default passwords and even default usernames are changed during the initial  setup, and that weak, null or blank passwords are not allowed.   GP-TM-23: Authentication mechanisms must use strong passwords or personal identification numbers  (PINs), and should consider using two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication (MFA)  like Smartphones, Biometrics, etc., on top of certificates.   GP-TM-24: Authentication credentials shall be salted, hashed and/or encrypted.   GP-TM-25: Protect against ‘brute force’ and/or other abusive login attempts. This protection should also  consider keys stored in devices.   GP-TM-26: Ensure password recovery or reset mechanism is robust and does not supply an attacker with  information indicating a valid account. The same applies to key update and recovery mechanisms.  4.3.8 Authorisation   GP-TM-27: Limit the actions allowed for a given system by Implementing fine-grained authorisation  mechanisms and using the Principle of least privilege (POLP): applications must operate at the lowest  privilege level possible.   GP-TM-28: Device firmware should be designed to isolate privileged code, processes and data from  portions of the firmware that do not need access to them. Device hardware should provide isolation  concepts to prevent unprivileged from accessing security sensitive code.  4.3.9 Access Control - Physical and Environmental security   GP-TM-29: Data integrity and confidentiality must be enforced by access controls. When the subject  requesting access has been authorised to access particular processes, it is necessary to enforce the  defined security policy.   GP-TM-30: Ensure a context-based security and privacy that reflects different levels of importance.   GP-TM-31: Measures for tamper protection and detection. Detection and reaction to hardware  tampering should not rely on network connectivity.  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  51   GP-TM-32: Ensure that the device cannot be easily disassembled and that the data storage medium is  encrypted at rest and cannot be easily removed.   GP-TM-33: Ensure that devices only feature the essential physical external ports (such as USB) necessary  for them to function and that the test/debug modes are secure, so they cannot be used to maliciously  access the devices. In general, lock down physical ports to only trusted connections.  4.3.10 Cryptography   GP-TM-34: Ensure a proper and effective use of cryptography to protect the confidentiality, authenticity  and/or integrity of data and information (including control messages), in transit and in rest. Ensure the  proper selection of standard and strong encryption algorithms and strong keys, and disable insecure  protocols. Verify the robustness of the implementation.   GP-TM-35: Cryptographic keys must be securely managed.   GP-TM-36: Build devices to be compatible with lightweight encryption and security techniques.   GP-TM-37: Support scalable key management schemes.  4.3.11 Secure and trusted communications   GP-TM-38: Guarantee the different security aspects -confidentiality (privacy), integrity, availability and  authenticity- of the information in transit on the networks or stored in the IoT application or in the Cloud.   GP-TM-39: Ensure that communication security is provided using state-of-the-art, standardised security  protocols, such as TLS for encryption.   GP-TM-40: Ensure credentials are not exposed in internal or external network traffic.   GP-TM-41: Guarantee data authenticity to enable reliable exchanges from data emission to data  reception. Data should always be signed whenever and wherever it is captured and stored.   GP-TM-42: Do not trust data received and always verify any interconnections. Discover, identify and  verify/authenticate the devices connected to the network before trust can be established, and preserve  their integrity for reliable solutions and services.   GP-TM-43: IoT devices should be restrictive rather than permissive in communicating.   GP-TM-44: Make intentional connections. Prevent unauthorised connections to it or other devices the  product is connected to, at all levels of the protocols.   GP-TM-45: Disable specific ports and/or network connections for selective connectivity.   GP-TM-46: Rate limiting. Controlling the traffic sent or received by a network to reduce the risk of  automated attacks.  4.3.12 Secure Interfaces and network services   GP-TM-47: Risk Segmentation. Splitting network elements into separate components to help isolate  security breaches and minimise the overall risk.   GP-TM-48: Protocols should be designed to ensure that, if a single device is compromised, it does not  affect the whole set.   GP-TM-49: Avoid provisioning the same secret key in an entire product family, since compromising a  single device would be enough to expose the rest of the product family.   GP-TM-50: Ensure only necessary ports are exposed and available.   GP-TM-51: Implement a DDoS-resistant and Load-Balancing infrastructure.   GP-TM-52: Ensure web interfaces fully encrypt the user session, from the device to the backend services,  and that they are not susceptible to XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, etc.   GP-TM-53: Avoid security issues when designing error messages.  4.3.13 Secure input and output handling   GP-TM-54: Data input validation (ensuring that data is safe prior to use) and output filtering.  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  52  4.3.14 Logging   GP-TM-55: Implement a logging system that records events relating to user authentication, management  of accounts and access rights, modifications to security rules, and the functioning of the system.

Perform penetration tests at least biannually.  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  53  5. Gaps analysis  This section provides an analysis of the main gaps in relation to cyber security in IoT. A critical part to address  cyber security in IoT is the identification and definition of gaps -the space between the present state and the  desired state- so as to determine what steps need to be taken in order to close those gaps, namely, to move  from the current immature state to the future and more mature state. In the interviews conducted with IoT  experts there was a common denominator – in terms of maturity, the security in IoT is in an initial stage of  development. The following gaps were identified as being the most prominent ones by the experts who took  part in the study and by conducting a comparative analysis of existing IoT security resources as listed in  Annex C.  We examine the gaps by taking into account two aspects, namely beginning with the analysis of the barriers  and ending with the changes that need to be considered to improve and guarantee security in IoT. We also  outline the relevant challenges that act as hindering factors towards a more mature IoT security landscape.  The ultimate goal of addressing the IoT security and safety gaps is to ensure the priotection of all assets, to  preserve the required level of privacy, as well as attain and sustain a high level of resiliency against cyber  attacks thus ensures physical safety alongside cyber security.  Gap 1: Fragmentation in existing security approaches and regulations  Currently, there is no common EU-wide approach to cyber security in IoT, or a common multi-stakeholder  model on cyber security. In the interviews carried out throughout the study, the majority of experts  considered the lack of mature security frameworks, and the breadth of security considerations to take into  account, big barriers for the improvement of security. Therefore, most companies and manufacturers are  taking their own approach when implementing security into IoT, resulting in a lack or slow embracement of  standards to guide the adoption of IoT security measures and good practices.  Whereas stringent measures and legislation introduced by regulators could become restrictive for security  research, development and innovation, it could be more effective if initiatives were put in place to stimulate  the development of security in private companies. Nevertheless, the key to rapid progress in this area is to  get the public and private sectors to work together and understand that security does not only concern a  single manufacturer, customer or  IT professional76, but rather everyone involved in the process.  Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility.  The fragmentation of the regulations also poses a barrier when Critical Information Infrastructures are seen  hand in hand with the IoT world, since there is no regulation that forces security measures and protocols in  the different levels of an IoT ecosystem, including the devices, the network, etc. This could potentially allow  for a more complete integration of safety and security in the development lifecycles. Conversely, the  application of one-size fits all standards across the IoT ecosystem might be seen as a hindering factor for  innovation and research in the area. As discussed throughout the report, one needs to also consider the fact  that different application areas have diverse security requirements.  Another significant problem to tackle is that of unclear liabilities – there is a barrier of non-responsibility,  both moral and legal, which can be mitigated or solved by enforcing responsibilities. There has been no  chance to enforce a perfect isolation between the different elements of an IoT ecosystem, which will  76 See https://www.govtechworks.com/iot-security-risks-begin-with-supply-chains/  https://www.govtechworks.com/iot-security-risks-begin-with-supply-chains/  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  54  unavoidably be developed by different manufacturers and/or operated by different parties. In this context,  there is a need to clarify the liability of each actor in case of a security event.  Gap 2: Lack of awareness and knowledge  There is a gap in relation to the increasing move towards connected and interdependent systems and devices  as far as knowledge is concerned. In the interviews with IoT experts, differences in fundamental terminology  were encountered, such as the difference between the concepts of safety and security. Security experts are  more commonly familiar with “business IT” security, but not with IoT security.  There is an overall lack of awareness regarding the need of security in IoT devices. Even more worrisome is  the lack of knowledge regarding the threats they are exposed to – most IoT consumers do not have a basic  understanding of their IoT devices and the impact on their environment. This may result in the devices not  being updated, with a subsequent breach of security.  Moreover, companies should train their employees in good security practices, recognising that technological  expertise does not necessarily equate with security expertise. In general, there is a need to properly educate  a new generation of consumers, developers, manufacturers, etc. about the use and the security risks posed  by IoT, and how to be prepared. It is also necessary to train them in both safety and cyber security to increase  awareness.  Many security incidents could be avoided if developers and manufacturers were aware of the risks they face  on a daily basis, considering not only those affecting IoT devices but also those affecting the whole IoT  environment. This is becoming a common need in order to raise awareness about current threats and risks  and to provide knowledge on how to prevent, protect and act in case of a security incident.  Gap 3: Insecure design and/or development  There have been several studies on design and development concerns related to IoT security77,78,79,80 . During  the interviews engaged within the context of this report we validated the findings of these studies and in  this respect the following issues seem particularly significant in the context of IoT design and development:   No defence-in-depth strategy during the design of the system, such as a secure boot process, isolation of  a Trusted Computing Base, limitation of the number of open ports, self-protection, etc.   No security-by-design or privacy-by-design. In some cases, information is exchanged with a third-party,  and it should be ensured that not more information than strictly needed is exported outside of the IoT  environment.   Lack of communication protection, on internal as well as external interfaces.   Lack of strong authentication and authorisation:   No validation or signing of firmware updates,   Software updates without server authentication and file trust verification,   No secure boot mechanisms.   Lack of hardening:   No data execution prevention or attack mitigation technologies used on the firmware,  77 See http://otalliance.actonsoftware.com/acton/attachment/6361/f-008e/1/-/-/-/-/IoT Framework Resource Guide.pdf  78 See http://www.gsma.com/connectedliving/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CLP.12-v1.1.pdf  79 See https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/download/new-security-guidance-for-early-adopters-of-the-iot/  80 See https://www.symantec.com/security-center/threat-report  http://otalliance.actonsoftware.com/acton/attachment/6361/f-008e/1/-/-/-/-/IoT%20Framework%20Resource%20Guide.pdf http://www.gsma.com/connectedliving/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CLP.12-v1.1.pdf https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/download/new-security-guidance-for-early-adopters-of-the-iot/ https://www.symantec.com/security-center/threat-report  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  55   Public vulnerabilities (DNS proxy, HTTP service…) left unfixed,   Some services are exposed through different entry points, with unnecessary communication ports left open – services such as Telnet or ssh are sometimes bound to all network interfaces,   Weak passwords policies or default passwords left unchanged,   Configuration flaws.   Lack of diagnosis / response capabilities.  Gap 4: Lack of interoperability across different IoT devices, platforms and  frameworks  The great majority of IoT ecosystems include IoT devices connected with legacy systems, especially in the  case of Critical Information Infrastructures. Moreover, as previously mentioned, due to the lack of a common  regulation, most companies and manufacturers are taking their own approach when designing IoT devices,  causing interoperability issues between devices from different manufacturers as well as the emergence of  different security models, incompatible concepts and taxonomies, etc. Therefore, it is very important to  develop measures that ensure a correct and secure interconnection and interoperability between the IoT  environment and legacy systems, and the other IoT devices manufactured by third-parties.  Most IoT devices use proprietary protocols designed by their manufacturers in order to interconnect devices.  While this is not an issue for devices from the same manufacturer, it becomes a problem when  interconnecting devices from different manufacturers. This requires the development and use of standard  protocols that need to be supported by all manufacturers to ensure a good level of interoperability with the  least efficiency and security loss. A good practice in this regard is to avoid the use of close-source and  proprietary protocols, as their security cannot be verified, and many incidents have already proven that  security through obscurity does not necessarily equate proper security coverage.  In the same spirit, apart from protocols, the use of common frameworks can also help to improve the  efficiency and security of the devices when interconnecting several ones from different manufacturers.  Gap 5: Lack of economic incentives  The main IoT manufacturers and vendors usually consider functionality and usability much more important  than implementing secure design and programming. Their economic interests are not aligned with spending  much money on security, and in some cases they do not consider security at all. The main reason for these  companies no to dedicate much of their budget to security is the general perception that there is no direct  return-on-investment for security, which can be attributed to the economic cost and the difficulty to assess  the financial impact of hypothetical security weaknesses.  This is worsened by the lack of economic incentives that would help to improve security, such as economic  benefits (e.g. more grants to integrate better security in the devices), resources, perceived reputation, etc.  Apart from this, the economic support is only accessible through very competitive programs such as H2020  in the case of research and development.  In general, the IoT experts interviewed agree that the different risks, threats and hazards are usually  underestimated and left out because of budgetary issues – there is a tendency to handle security concerns  a posteriori of incidents.  Gap 6: Lack of proper product lifecycle management  In general, safety measures are found lacking from the design phase to its later development. This  demonstrates the need for a proper product lifecycle management of the different assets that compose a  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  56  given IoT environment, since the devices and networks are interconnected and, in most cases, exposed to  the Internet, where they can be targeted by many and diverse threats.  IoT comprises such a variety of products that, if left unattended, it makes the entire surface of the traditional  supply chain vulnerable. IoT expands the global attack surface and it is everyone's responsibility to manage  the risks. The different devices and products will have to evolve in a secure way to consistently provide,  through their whole lifecycle, the solution for which they were created.  In this process, it is necessary to involve the vendors and, since they are in charge of designing and  developing the devices, they are in an ideal position to implement the changes needed – they are able to  proficiently and cost-efficiently include new security features or characteristics. This, however, is not only  dependent on manufacturers adding these new features, but also on organisations accepting the related  costs; therefore, a balance between security and cost must be maintained.  Through their lifecycle, IoT devices must be able to be patched and updated rapidly to ensure their correct  operation and to amend all the vulnerabilities that are continuously being discovered. As mentioned before,  in consumer environments most IoT users do not have a basic understanding of their IoT devices and their  impact on their environment, which may result in the devices not being updated and a subsequent breach  of security.  In addition, one important phase of the device lifecycle management is the deployment phase. Best practices  for IoT deployment could be defined. They may include recommendations for specific configurations of  devices and networks or the need to implement cybersecurity monitoring systems to detect anomalies in  the deployed infrastructure.  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  57  6. High-level recommendations to improve IoT cybersecurity  This chapter includes a list of high-level recommendations for developers, operators and security experts  that will help them to improve the security level of IoT devices and communications among them. The  recommendations discussed here concern stakeholders that span the entire IoT spectrum and aim to  address the gaps defined in Chapter 5.  Recommendations  The recommendations proposed are listed in the following table, and they have been further developed in  section 6.2:  ID DESCRIPTION  1 Promote harmonization of IoT security initiatives and regulations  2 Raise awareness for the need for IoT cybersecurity  3 Define secure software/hardware development lifecycle guidelines for IoT  4 Achieve consensus for interoperability across the IoT ecosystem  5 Foster economic and administrative incentives for IoT security  6 Establishment of secure IoT product/service lifecycle management  7 Clarify liability among IoT stakeholders  Table 8: IoT Security Recommendations  Detailed recommendations  6.2.1 Promote harmonization of IoT security initiatives and regulations  Recommendation intended for: IoT industry, providers, manufacturers, associations  The current fragmentation of IoT security guidelines, initiatives, standards and other schemes needs to be  addressed. A first and solid step in the direction is to define a list of best practices and guidelines for IoT  security and privacy, which  can be used as a baseline for the development and deployment of IoT systems  in the market (for example consult reports from AIOTI and ECSO). The current ENISA report provides such a  list and goes one step further by categorizing all security measures according to a well-defined and  structured set of security domains.  In terms of harmonization of standards, it is interesting to note that the notion of standard is appreciated  and supported by the industry but groups of stakeholders have different R&D chains and this inherently  drives fragmentation. The recommendation to counter this fragmentation refers to establishing a set of  practices, guidelines and security requirements in IoT, which are common over Europe. The Commission  should be facilitator of this process and this ENISA report can serve as the springboard for related efforts.  Subsequently, each sector can focus on defining the specific sets of practices, guidelines, requirements for  its own needs based on the particular context and risk factors inherent in each sector. European Commission  and member states government could drive the coordination and collaboration of stakeholders (industry,  users) and ENISA can be an important facilitator in this process.  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  58  The procurement process is another means to impose harmonization of baseline standards and  requirements for IoT systems. The harmonization should consider that there are many different sectors (e.g.  energy, transportation) , so harmonization should be first achieved within each sector.  6.2.2 Raise awareness for the need for IoT cybersecurity  Recommendation intended for: IoT industry, providers, manufacturers, associations, academia,  consumer groups, regulators  Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility among all involved stakeholders. It is thus essential for thse  stakeholders to have a thorough understanding of related risks and threats, as well as ways to secure and  protect against them. Raising awareness is therefore of paramount importance and initiatives to do so are  highly recommended.  As evidenced by the growing threat landscape and the numerous security incidents concerning IoT, there is  lack of knowledge present within IoT developers, industries as wll as end users and consumers. To  overcome such deficiency it is important to define targeted recommendations for all three stakeholder  categories, namely:   Security education and training needs to be established in industries, including knowledge of state- of-the-art, best practices, reference architectures and availability of building blocks,  methodologies and tools for secure IoT systems.   End users and consumers have to be educated to be able to make informed decisions when buying  IoT devices and systems. Campaigns raising awareness for IoT security are thus highly important,  also in order to be able to maintain a basic level of cyber hygiene for the security of the “Things”  that they have purchased or are operating. The role and initiatives of consumer rights associations  should be highlighted in this respect.   Among the developer community, awareness needs to be raised to adopt fundamental security  principles that are cross vertical rather than being tied to any silo industry. Corporate trainings  focused on IoT security are also beneficial and should be pursued.  Similarly, initiatives like café scientific and cyber security clinics can prove to be effective.Lastly, trainings  and courses at schools and universities (considering localisation to reach a wider audience) will further  promote a better understanding of IoT security among the younger generation and thus in the long-term  contributed to raising awareness.  6.2.3 Define secure software/hardware development lifecycle guidelines for IoT  Recommendation intended for: IoT developers, platform operators, industry, manufacturers  Developers, manufacturers and providers of IOT products and solutions should integrate and adopt a  secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC) for their IoT offerings and incorporate relevant processes in  their operations. Security must be implemented as a whole, at the application level, and in each of the  phases of the SDLC. It is therefore important to encourage more companies to offer secure components  that are at the same time usable for developers and end users/consumers.  The notions of security and privacy by default and security and privacy by design naturally emerge as  being foundation cornerstones of IoT security. Evidently, it is challenging to apply these concepts in several  different environments that will have particular characteristics. In IoT the cyber risk is context-dependent  (i.e. based on the application scenario) and in this respect the principles of security and privacy by design  should be applied with this consideration in mind. Following relevant initiatives from other, more mature  IT sectors can prove to be beneficial in adopting such principles for the IoT ecosystem.  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  59  As far as developers are concerned, secure by design hackathons and use of best practice cookbooks for  IoT security can greatly enhance their perception of using principle of security and privacy by default and  by design. The lessons learned from such exercises would assist developers in applying corresponding  techniques within their projects and products. When focussing on companies, the use of proper security  processes and well-defined and widely accepted tools (e.g. standards, checklists) for IoT security would  strongly promote the cause for IoT security by default and by design.  6.2.4 Achieve consensus for interoperability across the IoT ecosystem  Recommendation intended for: IoT industry, providers, manufacturers, associations, regulators  The issue of interoperability is very pertinent to the IoT ecosystem due to the very large scale and  penetration of the IoT ecosystem, the long and complex supply chains and the numerous involved  stakeholders. Ensuring and fostering interoperability of IoT devices, platforms and frameworks, as well as  security practices is therefore an essential element of IoT security and should thus be encouraged.  Recommendations that will undoubtedly assist in this direction include:   Encourage the use of open interoperability frameworks that incorporate security   Provide transparency on the security of interoperability frameworks   Promote open and accessible interoperability laboratories and testbeds for security  It should be noted that said recommendations are indicative and continuous efforts towards promoting  interoperability in the context of end-to-end and consistent cybersecurity should be pursued.  6.2.5 Foster economic and administrative incentives for IoT security  Recommendation intended for: IoT industry, associations, academia, consumer groups, regulators  It is clear that lack of security impacts business continuity and this is indeed the case also for IoT that is  driven by R&D activities and a rush to push products and services in the market. In this respect, business  continuity can serve as a driver for justifying costs in cyber security solutions.  Moreover, market demands on cybersecurity are somewhat low because of the lack of consumer  perception in the added value of cybersecurity. Consumer involvement is quite important  and it should be  supported more.  Communication campaigns should be implemented by the government (e.g., the  Commission, member states) in order to increase and sustain said perception and thus inherently  necessitate the adoption of further mechanisms to promote IoT cybersecurity.  In the case of IoT, competitive advantage is currently placed and focussed on the time to market rather  than secure to market.  This balance should be shifted so that a specific level of security and privacy before  market deployment is encouraged. Defining security frameworks supported by baseline security measures  can be a way forward in this direction. Use of other schemes such as certification and labelling can also  encourage better understanding and transparency in terms of IoT security and thus should be considered  (also benefitting end users and consumers in educating them and making them more aware of IoT  security), albeit in a context and risk specific manner per use case/application sector. Subject to such  approaches, subsequently regulative efforts and initiatiaves could then be put in place to follow the same  path.  6.2.6 Establishment of secure IoT product/service lifecycle management  Recommendation intended for: IoT developers, platform operators, industry, manufacturers  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  60  Security plays an important role within all the phases of an IoT product’s/service’s lifecycle. These phases  include design, development, testing, production, deployment, maintenance, end-of-support, and end-of- life (i.e. decommissioning). It is recommeneded that specific, focussed and targeted security processes be  defined for all these phases.  Furthermore, security processes have to be properly implemented. In order to satisfy this need,  fundamental security requirements and building blocks have to be specified to be available within each  phase.  A noteworthy aspect involves security updates that constitute a significant issue in the context of IoT. After  deployment, security updates need to be provided where practically possible whithout special knowledge  requirements or financial obligations on the end user/consumer within a defined term and conditions until  “end-of-support”. The latter must be clearly defined by the manufacturer/provider of the IoT product and  must be clearly communicated to the end user/consumer.  6.2.7 Clarify liability among IoT stakeholders  Recommendation intended for: IoT industry, regulators  As identified by the interviews with the experts a very important issue when IoT is considered is that of  liability. It is of particular importance in the IoT domain, since the cyber-physical nature of IoT relates and  tightly binds security to safety. The question of liability needs to be addressed. The question of where  liability may fall lies between the different and diverse stakeholders of the IoT ecosystem, such as  developers, manufacturers, providers, vendors, aftermarket support operators, third party providers and  the end users, to name a few.  The liability issues have to be addressed in the context of European and national legislation and case law.  Where gaps are identified in said legislation, these should be addressed.

Information System  Security Governance &  Risk Management  GP-TM-31: Since some devices, gateways, etc. are required to be  managed remotely rather than operated manually in the field,  measures for tamper protection and detection are needed. Detection  and reaction to hardware tampering should not rely on network  connectivity.  Hardware tampering means that an attacker has physical control of  the device for some period of time. Broadly speaking, hardware  tampering might occur at any of the different periods in the life cycle  of a device.  Physical and  environmental security  GP-TM-32: Ensure that the device cannot be easily disassembled and  that the data storage medium is encrypted at rest and cannot be  easily removed. There should be mechanisms to control device  security settings, such as remotely locking or erasing contents of a  device if the device has been stolen.  Physical and  environmental security  GP-TM-33: Ensure that devices only feature the essential physical  external ports (such as USB) necessary for them to function and that  the test/debug modes are secure, so they cannot be used to  maliciously access the devices.

IT Security Architecture  GP-TM-40: Ensure credentials are not exposed in internal or external  network traffic  IT Security Architecture  Identity and access  management  GP-TM-41: Guarantee data authenticity to enable trustable  exchanges (from data emission to data reception - both ways). Data is  often stored, cached, and processed by several nodes; not just sent  from point A to point B. For these reasons, data should always be  signed whenever and wherever the data is captured and stored.  IT Security Architecture  GP-TM-42: Do not trust data received and always verify any  interconnections. Discover, identify and verify/authenticate the  devices connected to the network before trust can be established,  and preserve their integrity for trustable solutions and services. For  example, a device measures its own integrity as part of boot, but  does not validate those measurements - when the device applies to  join a network, part of joining involves sending an integrity report for  remote validation. If validation fails, the end point is diverted to a  remediation network for action.  IT Security Architecture  Ecosystem  Management  GP-TM-43: IoT devices should be restrictive rather than permissive in  communicating: When possible, devices should not be reachable via  inbound connections by default. IoT devices should not rely on the  network firewall alone to restrict communication, as some  communication between devices within the home may not traverse  the firewall.

The attack required physical access to the smart meters, and  it is believed that former employees of the meter manufacturer were  altering the smart meters to reduce power bills81.  Foscam IP baby-cam  hijacked  August 10, 2013  On April 11, 2013, a vulnerability in Foscam wireless cameras was  disclosed by security researchers in a presentation titled “To watch or to  be watched: Turning your surveillance camera against you”. Later, on  August 10, an attacker gained control of one of those cameras in Houston,  Texas, which was being used as a baby-cam. The attacker was able to see,  hear and speak through the camera82.  Target data breach  November 15 -  December 15, 2013  The intrusion into Target’s systems was traced back to network  credentials stolen from a third-party IoT HVAC vendor.  It is believed that Target allowed that HVAC vendor remote access to its  network in order to report fluctuations in store temperature which might  have affected how long a customer stayed within a given store.  Nevertheless, it remains a mystery why the point of sale system was not  segmented from the rest of the Target network83. The intrusion took  place on November 15, 2013, and one month later, the data breach had  already resulted in the theft of 40 million credit and debit card accounts84.  BMW’s Connected Drive  vulnerable (demonstration)  January 2015  A security vulnerability in BMW’s Connected Drive system allowed  researchers to unlock the vehicles affected without the car keys. The  attack took advantage of a feature that allows drivers who have been  locked out of their vehicles to request the remote unlocking of their car  from a BMW assistance line. The researchers were able to impersonate  BMW servers and send, over the public cellular network, remote  unlocking instructions to vehicles85.  The software patch for the 2.2 million cars equipped with Connected  Drive adds HTTPS encryption to the connection from BMW to the car and  ensures that the car only accepts connections from a server with the  correct security certificate86.  Jeep car remotely hijacked  (demonstration)  July 21, 2015  Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek developed a zero-day exploit that targets  Jeep Cherokees, giving an attacker, who may be miles away, complete  control -via the Internet- of thousands of vulnerable vehicles. The attack  is performed by sending commands through the Jeep’s entertainment  system to its dashboard functions, steering, brakes, and transmission87.  81 See https://www.metering.com/puerto-rico-smart-meters-believed-to-have-been-hacked-and-such-hacks-likely-to-spread/  82 See https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/08/13/how-a-creep-hacked-a-baby-monitor-to-say-lewd-things-to-a-2-year-old/  83 See https://www.mocana.com/blog/2014/02/05/iot-hack-connected-target-breach  84 See http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/02/target-hackers-broke-in-via-hvac-company/  85 AJ Trainor, Amalia Safer, Lily Houghton, «BMW ConnectedDrive Vulnerability».

The attacker could then compromise the scope’s targeting system,  preventing the gun from firing or even causing it to miss the intended  target, hitting another one88.  VTech Toymaker data  breach  November 8, 2015  A cyber-attack on digital toymaker VTech Holdings exposed the data of  6.4 million children and 4.9 million adults. The personal information  stolen was not encrypted, and it included names, email addresses,  passwords, secret questions and answers for password retrieval, IP  addresses, postal addresses, download histories, chat logs, and children’s  names, photos, genders and birth dates89.  Mirai - DDoS on OVH  hosting provider  September 19, 2016  Mirai gathered a botnet made up of more than one million hacked IoT  devices, mostly DVRs and CCTV cameras, which were infected through  their Telnet port.  The French hosting company OVH is believed to be the first to have  suffered a DDoS attack coming from the Mirai botnet, which was  reported to have peaked at 1 Tbps, one of the largest recorded in history  in terms of volume90.  Mirai - DDoS on “Krebs on  Security” website  September 20, 2016  Just a day after the attack against OVH, the Mirai botnet conducts a DDoS  attack on “Krebs on Security” website that surpassed 620 Gbps of traffic,  making it also one of the largest recorded in history in terms of volume90.  Hajime October 15, 2016  Hajime is a “vigilante” spreading IoT worm that, like Mirai, takes  advantage of devices with default usernames and passwords to gain  control over them, via their Telnet ports. Its purpose is believed to be  fighting the Mirai botnet for control over IoT products – once a device is  infected, Hajime blocks access to ports 23 (Telnet), 7547, 5555, and 5358,  which are common entry points for the rival Mirai worm and other  threats91.  At the moment, the Hajime worm is not doing anything malign – it just  displays the following message: “Just a white hat, securing some  systems”92.  Mirai - DDoS on Dyn DNS  provider  October 21, 2016  Some of Mirai’s targets were cloud-related services, such as DNS provider  Dyn, which suffered a DDoS attack that affected several high-profile  websites, including Amazon, Netflix, PayPal and Spotify. Unconfirmed  reports say the peak of the attack reached around 1.2 Tbps93.  DDoS on building blocks’  central heating system  November 3, 2016  In Finland, a DDoS Attack took down the heating systems of at least two  housing blocks in the city of Lappeenranta, leaving their residents without  heating in sub-zero temperatures for more than a week94.  88 See https://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-can-disable-sniper-rifleor-change-target/  89 See http://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/02/vtech-hack-data-of-64m-kids-exposed.html  90 See https://www.symantec.com/content/dam/symantec/docs/reports/istr-22-2017-en.pdf  91 See https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/04/hajime-futureproof-botnet/  92 See https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/hajime-worm-battles-mirai-control-internet-things  93 See https://dyn.com/blog/dyn-analysis-summary-of-friday-october-21-attack/  94 See http://thehackernews.com/2016/11/heating-system-hacked.html  https://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-can-disable-sniper-rifleor-change-target/ http://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/02/vtech-hack-data-of-64m-kids-exposed.html https://www.symantec.com/content/dam/symantec/docs/reports/istr-22-2017-en.pdf https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/04/hajime-futureproof-botnet/ https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/hajime-worm-battles-mirai-control-internet-things https://dyn.com/blog/dyn-analysis-summary-of-friday-october-21-attack/ http://thehackernews.com/2016/11/heating-system-hacked.html  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures  November 2017  102  SECURITY INCIDENT DATE DESCRIPTION  Mirai - DDoS on Deutsche  Telekom network  November 27, 2016  Mirai botnet targets Deutsche Telekom routers, affecting more than  900,000 customers95.  Cloudpets’ DB held for  ransom  December 25, 2016 -  January 8, 2017  Cloudpets is a company that sells Internet-connected teddy bears,  allowing kids to communicate with their far-away parents. Cloudpets  customers’ data were left for two weeks in a publicly available database  without password or firewall protection. More than 820,000 customer  credentials were exposed, as well as two million message recordings. In  addition, the database was also held for ransom96.  Romantik Seehotel  Jägerwirt  January 25, 2017  The Romantik Seehotel Jägerwirt, a 4-star hotel in the Austrian Alps, had  its digital key system breached and held for ransom. The attackers  managed to take down the entire key system – the guests could no longer  get into their hotel rooms and new key cards could not be programmed.  The hotel has admitted they had to pay a ransom worth thousands of  Bitcoin to the cybercriminals, who restored the key system and the  computers as soon as they received the payment. The attackers left a  backdoor in the system to exploit it in the near future, but when they  tried again, the hotel had already bolstered its security97.  Cloudpets and “Meine  Freundin Cayla” - insecure  Bluetooth  February 17 - 27,  2017  Apart from Cloudpets’ customer database being completely insecure, it  turns out Cloudpets’ teddy bears were themselves insecure too.  CloudPets' toys did not use any standard Bluetooth security features,  such as pairing encryption with their owner's smartphone app, so anyone  within range (10 meters with a normal smartphone) could just connect to  it and send and receive commands and data – e.g. uploading a message  to the toy, or silently triggering the toy's recording functionality and later  downloading the audio the toy has recorded. In other words, the teddy  bears could be turned into remote surveillance devices, used to harass  toddlers like some insecure baby monitors have in the past, such as the  Foscam IP baby-cam case98.  Just one week before, the German government banned the Internet- connected “Meine Freundin Cayla” doll for the same reasons that  concern Cloudpets’ toys – it had vulnerabilities that could be exploited by  an attacker to remotely spy on children99.  BrickerBot March 20, 2017  BrickerBot is a bot that permanently incapacitates –Permanent DoS  (PDoS)– poorly secured IoT devices, leaving them in a “bricked” state  before they can be conscripted into Internet-crippling denial-of-service  armies. The latest version BrickerBot.3 appeared April 20, one month  after BrickerBot.1 first surfaced100,101.  95 See https://www.engadget.com/2016/11/29/mirai-botnet-targets-deutsche-telekom-routers-in-global-cyberatt/  96 See https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/internet-of-things-teddy-bear-leaked-2-million-parent-and-kids-message-recordings  97 See https://www.thelocal.at/20170128/hotel-ransomed-by-hackers-as-guests-locked-in-rooms  98 See https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/how-this-internet-of-things-teddy-bear-can-be-remotely-turned-into-a-spy-device  99 See https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilungen/DE/2017/14012017_cayla.html  100 See https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/04/brickerbot-the-permanent-denial-of-service-botnet-is-back-with-a-vengeance/  101 See https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/alerts/ICS-ALERT-17-102-01A  https://www.engadget.com/2016/11/29/mirai-botnet-targets-deutsche-telekom-routers-in-global-cyberatt/ https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/internet-of-things-teddy-bear-leaked-2-million-parent-and-kids-message-recordings https://www.thelocal.at/20170128/hotel-ransomed-by-hackers-as-guests-locked-in-rooms https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/how-this-internet-of-things-teddy-bear-can-be-remotely-turned-into-a-spy-device https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilungen/DE/2017/14012017_cayla.html https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/04/brickerbot-the-permanent-denial-of-service-botnet-is-back-with-a-vengeance/ https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/alerts/ICS-ALERT-17-102-01A  ENISA  European Union Agency for Network  and Information Security  Science and Technology Park of Crete (ITE)  Vassilika Vouton, 700 13, Heraklion, Greece  Athens Office  1 Vasilissis Sofias & Meg.

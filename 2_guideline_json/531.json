The EP3R participants initiated many  discussions, saw a lot of commitment, and produced interesting conclusions. It also revealed some  further needs in the security and resilient field and also some gaps to be filled in order to reach a  higher maturity level of the Telecom Sector.  The EP3R closed down in April 2013, after 4 years of existence and practically 3 years of operations.  The impact of the very first European Public -Private Partnership for Resilience had to be assessed and  lessons had to be drawn for future similar initiatives and other funded actions for improving European  resilience.  Generally, the PPP approach is judged to be particularly appropriate for addressing complex  cooperation problems within multi-stakeholder scenarios. The case of EP3R is mirrored overseas by  the National Council of ISACs1 (Information Sharing and Analysis Centres) and many other similar  initiatives. This underlines the appropriateness of the PPP approach to address cooperation issues as  complex as the security and resilience ones.  The large number of PPP experiences worldwide has confirmed the value of such approach also for its  flexibility and appropriateness for today emerging challenges including cyber-attacks mitigation,  critical infrastructure protection and security and resilience of information and communications.  This study proposes to investigate the gap between expected optimal features of a Public Private  Partnership for Resilience and its implementation in the EP3R, and bases its conclusions both on  literature contributions and on a direct collection of information (i.e. interviews and surveys) with key  EP3R actual and potential stakeholders (i.e. Chief information security officers, Security senior experts  of both public and private European organisations).  The specific aim of this analysis was to:  - Review the experience of Public-Private Partnerships in the telecom and information  technology sector;  - Understand how a PPP addresses the needs of improving the network and information  security at Pan-European level;  - Assess how such cooperation platforms can positively impact on security and resilience.  1 http://www.isaccouncil.org/aboutus.html  http://www.isaccouncil.org/aboutus.html  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page v  Involved stakeholders, both through interviews and questionnaires, have suggested several important  observations:  Accordingly, the EP3R key drivers were “team building”, “trust consolidation”, “clear and focused  objectives identification”, and “tangible and specific outcomes definition”, but a clearer definition of  purpose and stable and agreed terms of reference were advocated by interviewees for a more  effective, consistent and reliable cooperation mechanism.  In 2011 ENISA published a Good Practice Guide on Cooperative Models for Effective PPPs 2  and  implemented the suggested features in the EP3R for the second half of its existence.  The main conclusions highlight that the PPP model for information sharing in the field of ICT security  deserves to be considered as an experiment due to its different possible set-up combinations. The  general perception among the respondents to the interviews carried out in this study is that the  outcomes of the EP3R were “partially satisfactory”. This can be considered as an encouraging outcome  for a very first platform of this kind, and an incentive for adapting the setup of features in future PPP  implementations. Some issues were raised by participants who stepped out after the first two years  of the EP3R existence (2010-2011) not having the opportunity to actively participate when these issues  have been addressed and to assist to the evolution of the platform in its last two years (2012-2013).  Finally, a large majority of respondents demonstrated strong affinity of the additional value associated  with such an approach and are supportive of such model.  The study allows to draw a number of recommendations:  - Setup and use agile PPPs: adapting rapidly to changes means that working groups should be  small, their scope focused and detailed, and with a closed end-date;  - Incentivise Industry initiatives and participation by providing financial and human resources  support;  - Define at the earliest stage simple but formal rules and governance;  - Publish and advertise successful results.  2 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/public-private-partnership/national-public- private-partnerships-ppps/good-practice-guide-on-cooperatve-models-for-effective-ppps  Public-Private Partnerships are regarded as a valuable option useful to address different types of complex  problems  Public-Private Partnerships do not have a single consolidated set of key features, but  they can be adapted  to the circumstances and to the issue at stake  Public-Private Partnership approaches re-balance the decision-making role in favour of the private  stakeholders  The effectiveness of the Public-Private Partnership approach is strictly related to the degree of ownership  of the project outcomes perceived by participant stakeholders  A bottom-up approach is essential to properly face the identified topics, to achieve the expected results of the  initiative and to maintain  a constant interest  of particpants  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/public-private-partnership/national-public-private-partnerships-ppps/good-practice-guide-on-cooperatve-models-for-effective-ppps http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/public-private-partnership/national-public-private-partnerships-ppps/good-practice-guide-on-cooperatve-models-for-effective-ppps  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page vi  Table of Contents  1 Introduction 1  1.1 Objectives 1  1.2 Methodology 2  1.3 Structure of this report 2  2 Industry perception of Public-Private Partnerships 3  2.1 Types of cooperation mechanisms 3  2.2 Previous experience of the respondents in PPP Initiatives 4  2.3 Industry indications on PPP needs 5  2.4 Benefits of PPPs 7  2.5 Purpose and European perspective 9  2.6 Reasons preventing participation in PPPs 9  3 EP3R: a European PPP on Networks Resilience 11  3.1 Addressed topics 16  3.2 Leadership approach 16  3.3 Effort for the involved stakeholders 17  3.4 Costs for the involved stakeholders 17  3.5 Geographical scope 17  3.6 Interaction model 18  3.7 Type of involved stakeholders 18  3.8 Profile of participants of the involved stakeholders 19  3.9 Expected outcome 19  3.10 Inclusion rule 20  3.11 Participation rule 20  4 Observations 21  5 Recommendations for future initiatives 26  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 1  1 Introduction  In the past few decades, information and communications became the backbone of today’s society.  Critical Information and Communication Infrastructures (CIIs) are a crucial component of economic  and social systems worldwide and a fundamental asset for social life, private business and public  services. As consequence the Telecom sector grew in size and complexity leading in Europe to a  situation of market fragmentation where also main industry players operate in several countries.  In this context, a coordinated cross-border multi-stakeholder approach can help to address the  challenges of the protection of CIIs. Such protection should be considered at three levels: Strategic  level, Governance level, and Management (or Operations) level. While international regulations and  national legislations refer to the strategic level, ICT providers are mainly interested in managing the  CIIs lifecycle. This governance issue led to the development of a cooperation mechanisms including  public-private partnerships (PPPs) at the European level to bridge the gap between the strategic and  management levels. It is essential to improve resilience and security of the CIIs also taking into account  the cross-border perspective.  In this study, many essential drivers have been identified in the ownership perception of the project  outcomes of the participant stakeholders and in the PPP model:  - Addressed topics;  - Leadership approach;  - Effort for the involved stakeholders;  - Costs for the involved stakeholders;  - Geographical scope;  - Interaction model;  - Type of involved stakeholders;  - Profile of participants of the involved stakeholders;  - Expected outcomes;  - Inclusion rule;  - Participation rule.  Systematic cross-border cooperation may improve the effectiveness of security and resilience  measures while lowering their cost. Market dynamics do not always provide sufficient incentives for  private operators in the Telecom sector to invest in security and resilience of CIIs. Coordination among  relevant public and private stakeholders therefore could be an important assets both at national and  international level.  The development of a European culture of PPPs for security and resilience of CIIs is an iterative  process. This report is a critical assessment of the experience collected in the first iteration of a PPP in  the field, the European Public Private Partnership for Resilience (EP3R).  1.1 Objectives  This report analyses the opportunities and challenges of the first European public-private partnerships  in the field of network and information security and resilience in Europe, the European Public-Private  Partnership for Resilience (EP3R) in which mainly participated stakeholders belonging to the Telecom  and Information Technology sectors.  The intention of this report is to draw a picture on:  - The affinity of respondents with security and resilience issues;  - The outcomes of PPPs in the Telecom and Information Technology sectors in comparison with  those focused on other sectors (e.g. transport, energy, health, finance);  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 2  - The needs for a public-private partnership to improve network and information security and  resilience;  - Other network and information security and resilience initiatives in the area of CIIs (different  from the EP3R).  Moreover, given the role of Member States and the European Institutions aimed to guarantee an  efficient and effective delivery of public utility services, the proposed analysis focus also on security  and resilience issues related to CIIs as strategic assets of the European economy.  1.2 Methodology  In order to understand how the approach of PPPs contributes to increased security and resilience of  CIIs, the following methods to collect information among stakeholders operating in the EU27 Member  States were used:  - An on-line questionnaire submitted to Chief Security Officers, Chief Information Security  Officers, directors/chiefs/responsible of the Security Department/Area and  directors/chiefs/responsible of the ICT Department/Area belonging to operators in Telecom  and Information Technology sectors as well as to operators of ICT-reliant sectors (e.g.  transport, energy, health, finance).  - Telephone interviews with the EP3R participant stakeholders.  - Further telephone interviews with outsiders in order to determine which key characteristics  of a PPP seem valuable to the ICT industry.  Finally, information and data collected from the respondents to the questionnaire and from the  participants to the interviews were analysed in order to address the above mentioned research  objectives.  1.3 Structure of this report  This report summarises the most relevant findings of the interviews and the questionnaires. Excluding  the introduction, main contents are structured in four chapters aimed at:  - Describing the ICT industry perception of PPPs (Chapter 2);  - Analysing the EP3R Experience, its history and development (Chapter 3);  - Reporting observations from the interviews and questionnaires (Chapter 4);  - Providing recommendations for future cooperation initiatives in the network security and  resilience such as PPPs (Chapter 5).  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 3  2 Industry perception of Public-Private Partnerships  Over the past few decades, ICT threats and concerns rose in complexity while resources available to  handle them decreased. In this scenario, the traditional approach –i.e. delegating issues of collective  interest to public management- has demonstrated some structural limitations. Public administrations,  are not exposed to failure risks and provide collective services disconnected from any profit-making  strategy. Private sector entities own and manage infrastructures of collective interest (such as CIIs)  and cannot bear alone the cost of security and resilience.  The New Public Management theory has tried to overturn this tendency by introducing a market- oriented management notion into the public sector. The basic assumption is that a market-oriented  management would have led to greater cost-efficiency for governments, without producing negative  effects in terms of objectives and outcomes3.  Since then Public-Private Partnerships have been used to introduce market practices in areas  traditionally dominated by non-market players, e.g. the delivery of infrastructural services and the  provision of public goods 4 . When establishing PPPs for project-financing, public administration  representatives are aware that the private partners will run the project under a profit-maximising  strategy.  For this report, cooperation mechanisms have been considered and investigated which all those that  fit the broad scope as defined in the report on Cooperative models for effective Public-Private  Partnership:  “[A PPP is] an organised relationship between public and private organisations, which establishes  common scope and objectives. It uses defined roles and a work methodology to achieve shared goals.”5  Furthermore, as one of the essential benefit of the PPP approach is its flexibility, one of the main goal  of this work is to identify which PPP model would be the most effective to improve CIIs security and  resilience according to the indications of participant stakeholders.  2.1 Types of cooperation mechanisms  The dialogue established with the stakeholders from industry revealed that information sharing and  cooperation on specific issues were common activities for the most of their PPP experiences.  As the interactions get global and increasingly complex, approaches based on multi-stakeholder  involvement become the sole option to effectively address horizontal issues related to security and  resilience. Thus in this field, the nature of cooperation has evolved from problem solving to shared  strategy building. The main purpose remains the creation of economies of scale.  Results of the direct interaction with participant stakeholders belonging to Telecom and Information  Technology sectors confirm this pattern. As shown below, respondents to the questionnaire declared  that cooperation initiatives are present and based on information sharing (37%) or on cooperation on  specific issues (53%).  3 HOOD C., “A Public Management for All Seasons.”, in Public Administration, 69 (Spring), 3-19, 1991  4 MENARD C., “Is Public-Private Partnership obsolete?

In order to  achieve these goals, the questionnaire has been designed to include all type of public-private  initiatives regardless of their types and aims.  As the majority of respondents declared to have had experience with PPPs in the last 5 years (65%), a  reasonable assumption is that in the Telecom and Information Technology sectors PPP initiatives can  be considered as a well-established cooperation mechanism.  Figure 2 – Answers to the question “Has your Organisation been involved in any kind of PPP in the past 5 years?”  Information Sharing 37%  Cooperation  established for  specific issues  53%  No forms are used 10%  Yes 65%  No 35%  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 5  As shown in Figure 2, new types of PPP emerged. The original project financing approach (i.e. delivery  of large infrastructures) is no longer the sole model used. PPPs in the Telecom and Information  Technology sectors for information sharing (29%) and ad-hoc cooperation on specific issues (35,5%)  can be considered as a well-established collaboration mechanism6.  Figure 2 - Respondents' previous PPP experiences7  2.3 Industry indications on PPP needs  The information collected through the questionnaire allows also to draw indications of the desired  features of a PPP for network and Information security and resilience. A key element is that regional  cooperation could be a fundamental driver to enhance European competitiveness. Furthermore,  industry representatives felt that significant results in this domain can no longer arise from private  stakeholders or public actors alone. In this context, PPPs become a pillar in network and information  Security and Resilience good practices.  In order to achieve these goals, human and relational capital should be considered an essential asset  to be exploited in PPPs.  6 A clarification on the low value related to the number of PPPs in project financing is needed. As PPPs for project  financing are commonly used for the creation of large physical public infrastructures (e.g. roads) or provision  ofcollective services (e.g. healthcare assistance), opportunities to adopt this type of interaction are structurally  less than those to create “soft infrastructures” (e.g. cooperation tables for security and resilience).  7 Questionnaire, Question 3.1 “Which form of PPP is usually used in your activity sector?”  6,5%  35,5%  29,0% 29,0%  Project Financing  Cooperation on Specific Issues  Information Sharing  No Form Used  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 6  According to the information collected from the respondents belonging to the Telecom, Information  Technology, Transport, Energy, Health, Finance sectors, the following features of a PPP should be  included in an effective European PPP for network and information security and resilience:  1. Leadership would be effective if based on a management approach agreed among  participants. The establishment of a responsibility structure is essential also to monitor  participants’ effort.  2. Funding should be based on participants’ efforts and time. Incentives such as ownership of  project objectives, reduction of threat exposure, benefits from a multi-stakeholders approach  may be used to increase to benefit/cost ratio of participants.  3. Expected outcome of the initiative should be at European level, even if potential benefits  could arise from addressing the issue at national level. Several issues related to security and  resilience in se seem to require an approach as wider as the national one.  4. Inclusion Rules should be properly defined taking into account also feasible options for  enhancing participation both on invitation and on spontaneous candidatures or expressions  of interest.  5. Participation should be limited to effective and proactive contribution to the general effort in  order to ensure coherence between goals and results of the partnership.  As shown in Figure 3, five main questions (Why, Where, how, What, Who) were used to identify the  key features for an effective PPP and represent them in a simplified scheme.  Figure 3 – Key features of a PPP for network and Information security and resilience  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 7  2.4 Benefits of PPPs  Over the past 20 years, the roles and responsibilities of the industrial players of Telecom and  Information technology sectors have remained abstract. A gap existed between the perception of the  industry players’ security and resilience duties for provided services and the existing regulatory  indications.  In this respect, PPPs could be also a bridging solution between industrial players and public authorities  enabling four advantages in this cooperation mechanism:  Figure 4 - Key Objectives of a PPP with industrial players of the Telecom and Information Technology sectors  Within this mechanism, private sector players may act in line with public needs and requirements and  interact for the decision-making process, while the public sector players increase their awareness of  emerging challenges and market dynamics. Mutual input from the public and private side gives the  opportunity to create synergies and improve resource allocation also in light of a more rational  selection of priorities leading to a so-called “soft regulation”.  According to the answers provided by respondents, the most relevant advantage of a PPP approach is  the opportunity to exchange information, knowledge, expertise and good practices (25%). The  opportunity to influence the decision making process is perceived by the 16,10% of the respondents  which considered PPPs also effective for networking opportunities (17,90%) .  Figure 5 – Answer to the question “Which could be the most relevant advantage of the PPP approach?”  Improved goal alignment between public authorities and private sector players  Enhanced trust among participants of public and private  side  Shared approach to obtain common outcomes for a given effort  Effective method for costs savings in the short, medium and long term  5,40%  17,90%  25%  10,70%  8,90%  16,10%  10,70%  5,40%  SAVE COSTS / IMPROVE INVESTMENTS EFFICIENCY  CREATE NETWORKING OPPORTUNITIES  EXCHANGE INFORMATION, KNOWLEDGE, EXPERTISE  AND GOOD PRACTICES  SHARE AND REDUCE PROJECT-RELATED RISKS  IMPROVE INSTITUTIONAL READINESS / EFFICIENCY  INFLUENCE BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DECISION  MAKING PROCESS  INVOLVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF STAKEHOLDERS  IMPROVE RESOURCE ALLOCATION EFFICIENCY  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 8  In particular, additional considerations should be mentioned also taking into account qualitative  indications collected:  - PPPs set up the opportunity to have a direct insight on specific issues by the point of view of  the participant stakeholders in a trusted environment instead of relying on second hand  information.  - Networking opportunities are crucial for interactions inside and outside PPPs opportunities of  direct peer-to-peer dialogue may represent an important added value for participant  stakeholders  - Potential gains in human and relational capital are considered the most relevant advantage  coming from this type of interaction.  According to the results of the questionnaire, existing PPP models and objectives need to be further  developed. A wide majority of respondents declared that their expectations were fulfilled only  partially (60%). No one reported that the public-private interaction was a failing approach that has to  be discouraged and unsatisfied respondents provided several suggestions to improve their outcomes.  Figure 6 – Answer to the question “Have PPPs produced expected positive outcomes for your organisation?”  The overall result is of particular interest because it represents a paradigm shift. The added value of  PPPs relates not mostly to the consolidation of human relations. The objective has shifted from  maximising the immediate revenue to ensuring long term opportunities based on cooperation  activities.  5%  35%  60%  No  Yes  Partially  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 9  2.5 Purpose and European perspective  Examples of the effective PPP approaches in the Telecom and Information Technology context already  exist at national level. In fact, different types of PPP mechanisms have experimented and tried with  different purposes. Successful examples8 were mentioned:  - The Superfast Cornwall9 project (UK);  - The Asturcorn10 (ES);  - The public outsourcing provision of broadband infrastructures realised by the Auvergne  Region11 (FR);  - The Metroweb project for the management of internet physical infrastructures and routes has  been established as a joint venture between a public subject (the A2a publicly owned  electricity company) and a private actor (F2i and Intesa Sanpaolo). Metroweb network covers  a 2700 km metropolitan area (almost the entire municipality of Milan), and its operations is  leased to different telecom companies (IT).12  As these examples confirm, the project financing PPP type has been applied with success at national  level and it will probably become one the main drivers for the achievement of the objectives of the  Digital Agenda. On the other side, the realisation of similar initiatives at European level remains  extremely complex.  On the contrary wider-scope PPPs focusing on information sharing and specific cooperation targets  may be easily set up at the European level. They would allow participants to share experiences which  public authorities and private actors can directly adopt and exploit, and further develop also later on  at National level. Due to the sensibility of the topics relating to security and resilience (both for  national public authorities and private companies) cooperation PPPs is the most promising approach.  2.6 Reasons preventing participation in PPPs  When considering information collected from other sectors (transport, energy, health, finance),  respondents declared that they have not been involved in any sort of PPP in the last 5 years. They  identified which factors impeded their direct involvement in these cooperation initiatives. The  question had a double purpose: to understand why respondents was not involved in a PPP and, if  involved before the last 5 years, to understand why they left the initiative.  8 Examples have been selected on the base of an EPEC study on the theme which includes a wider sample of  case studies, e.g. EPEC, Broadband. Delivering next generation access through PPP.  9 Private Design Build and Operate PPP for the provision of Next Generation broadband (FTTP and FTTC) in the  Cornwall area. For more information, see http://www.superfastcornwall.org  10 Public Design Build and Operate PPP for the provision of FTTP infrastructures in the Asturias region; to the  date EUR 55 million have been invested.  11 Public outsourcing PPP for the provision of high-speed broadband (at least 512kbit/sec) for a period of 10  years, basing on a 38,5 million EUR budget.  12 For further information, see http://www.metroweb.it  http://www.superfastcornwall.org/ http://www.metroweb.it/  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 10  Figure 7 – Answer to the question “Which were the reasons impeding the participation to PPP?”  As shown in Figure 7, a large majority of respondents did not participate to a PPP because these type  of initiatives are not common in their sector of activity. More than 20% of the respondents declared  that these initiatives are not used in the countries in which the organisation operates. These results  confirm that the PPP approach is not equally distributed both in considered sectors and in the Member  States.  The opinion that PPP initiatives are useless also remains. Several respondents claimed that:  - The lack of information or visibility on the PPP initiative itself or of its specific  objectives/expected outcomes;  - Difficulty in sharing of confidential information.  The perception that information sharing is a deterrent factor should not be considered as a structural  weakness of the PPP approach. Trust building is arguably one of the most crucial issues to be  addressed either by consolidated relationships or by establishing formal guarantee systems.  Mechanisms to improve cooperative behaviour of public and private stakeholders should be identified  in order to create PPP initiatives which address common issues and benefit from a multi-stakeholder  approach. Furthermore an increased awareness of current PPPs initiatives may enable cooperation  and interest in shared management of common goals.

The initial aim of this partnership was to establish a sustainable cross-border co-operation  devoted to address the CIIP Action Plan fundamental pillars. The objectives of the EP3R were:  “- Encourage information sharing and stock-taking of good policy and industrial practices to  foster common understanding;  - Discuss public policy priorities, objectives and measures;  - Baseline requirements for the security and resilience in Europe;  - Identify and promote the adoption of good baseline practices for security and resilience.”14  The CIIP Action Plan represents an important milestone in the implementation of the strategy for a  Secure Information Society, COM(2006)25115. The approach chosen by the Commission was mainly to  engage the public and private sector in a multilateral, open and inclusive dialogue for partnership and  empowerment in order to achieve the five pillars of the CIIP Action Plan:  - Preparedness and Prevention  - Detection and response  - Mitigation and recovery  - International Cooperation  - Criteria for European Critical Infrastructures in the ICT sector  The overall goal of the EP3R was to cope with the CIIP Action Plan prescriptions (with ad-hoc working  groups organized to address specific issues) and the EP3R scope itself evolved over the years in order  to better fit needs and policy evolutions.  Early days (2009-2011)  Bearing in mind these objectives, in 2010 the EP3R was devoted to information sharing and stock  taking of good policy and industrial practices. It aimed at improving the consistency and the  coordination of policies for security and resilience in Europe.  It was originally structured on three Working Groups (WG). Security Experts were invited from  National and pan European Telecom operators, Internet Service Providers, industrial associations,  Standardisation Bodies, Competent National Authorities, manufactures and solution providers. EP3R  intended to reach a regional scope (initially, EU27) with the participation of a number of selected  operators chosen among the categories mentioned previously.  13 Commission of European Communities, COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE  COUNCIL, THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS, on Critical  Information Infrastructure Protection \"Protecting Europe from large scale cyber-attacks and disruptions: enhancing  preparedness, security and resilience\", COM(2009)149, Brussels.  14 As stated in the ENISA web page http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/public-private- partnership/european-public-private-partnership-for-resilience-ep3r  15 Commission of European Communities, COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE  COUNCIL, THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE OF THE REGION, A strategy for a  Secure Information Society – “Dialogue, partnership and empowerment”, COM(2006)251, Brussels  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/public-private-partnership/european-public-private-partnership-for-resilience-ep3r http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/public-private-partnership/european-public-private-partnership-for-resilience-ep3r  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 12  Adopting the simplified scheme based on the five main questions (Why, Where, how, What, Who)  already used to describe the key features for an effective PPP, the EP3R set up can be summarised as  follows (see Figure 8).  Figure 8 – Main key features of the EP3R  With respect to the five key elements identified as to be included in an effective European PPP for  network and information security and resilience, EP3R presented:  1. A leadership approach based on coordination among participants that were sked to join  thematic working groups working mainly on a virtual basis using online collaboration, mailing  lists, call conferences or remote workshops.  2. A funding scheme based on time and efforts of the involved stakeholders.  3. An expected outcome strictly related to information sharing, policy priority identification,  CIIs security standards definition and promotion of CIIs’ security and resilience good  practices.  4. The participation (of involved stakeholders) was voluntary, inclusive and based on trust  5. Inclusion rule was set up on a profile of the stakeholder. Stakeholders admitted had to belong  to security sectors of National and pan European Telecom operators, Internet Service  Providers, industrial associations, Standardization Bodies, Competent National Authorities,  manufactures and solution providers.  An Improved model (2012-2013)  The evolution of participants’ needs for a more topic-focused and impact-oriented approach led to  implement structural changes after mid-2012. Since early 2012, also the management mechanism of  working groups was already modified significantly: EP3R introduced nominated Moderators,  organised frequent teleconferences and provided alternative additional meeting opportunities (e.g.  combination of plenary sessions with working group sessions the day before or after). These came to  force from April 2012 (in Rome).  According to the EP3R Activity Report 2012. Between August 2011 and March 2012 several discussions  were on-going in each working group:  Why? Where? How? What? Who?

Relevant considerations  came  also on a methodology to classify assets supporting CIIs infrastructures;   Working Group 2 gathered Hardware Manufacturers, Supply Chain operators, and Telecom  Operators to define “quick wins” to improve reliability, resilience and default security levels  of equipment;   Working Group 3b proposed to implement a pan-European botnet-fighting programme, along  with key recommendations on how to proceed;   Working Group 3e reflected mainly on the preparedness for a Preliminary Emergency  Communication and recommended the establishment of a European Crisis Coordination  Contact list.  Several topics emerged from each of the 3 initial areas and gradually evolved into smaller sub-groups.  The Work Programme 2013 acknowledged those observed changes, and already in September 2012,  Task Forces were created to address those emerging topics. The EP3R Work Programme 2013 reports  that “Much progress was achieved during the April 2012 Experts Meeting which was held in Rome.  Four position papers have been produced and have been consolidated in a general Working Groups’  Yearly Statement. [...] Several conclusions arose after the Rome Meeting, to allow for a maturing of  the work organisation, and therefore achieve a higher degree of reflection during the working sessions.  The natural next step was to divide each topic into smaller tasks assigned to 5-6 Experts maximum,  and later have them reviewed in an EP3R plenary session. [...] Such a model presents a series of  advantages:  - Shorter Time to Delivery for recommendations;  - Greater flexibility in addressing current issues, and prioritising the work based on its natural  dependencies;  - Sense of ownership of the topic by Experts working on it;  - The opportunity to address the trust related issues of effective information sharing in EP3R  and beyond;  - Better use of Subject Matter Experts’ time and better focus on issues based on their level of  knowledge.  [...] While keeping the coverage of the initial Terms of Reference (ToR), the structure of the Working  Groups [has] gradually been replaced by smaller Task Forces.”  The organisational change was implemented to allow a better trust building and to improve  stakeholders’ commitment in the overall collaboration environment.  Overall perception of the initiative  A set of Interviews addressed EP3R participants from both early and later years. Another set of  interviews was also conducted with persons who observed the development of the EP3R or were  indirectly involved. The overall experience of EP3R participants was considered positive and  appreciated. Several aspects of such cooperation initiative have been indicated to be improved in  order to actually achieve impacts and reach effective outcomes.  Among the questionnaire respondents only 23% participated in the EP3R. Almost half of them  participated to more than one working group (13%).  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 14  Figure 9 – Answer to the question “Have you ever been involved in the activities of the EP3R?”  Taking into account the fact that the EP3R was exclusively dedicated to Telecom and Information  Technology sectors, most of participants reported a general lack of information on the initiative, its  goals and outcomes.  No respondents reported that reasons to leave EP3R were related with the confidentiality of the  information to be shared despite the presence of competitors or due to an inappropriate selection of  stakeholders to be involved. 15% of the respondents did not consider the EP3R activities of particular  interest, while 8% of them clearly stated that the ratio between the effort required and the effective  gain was underbalanced. Another 15% of respondents reported that the EP3R was not opened to  operators of their sector.  In light of these results, it seems that EP3R participants partially validated the outsider perception that  the actual experience was not fully coherent with the initial objectives of the EP3R establishment.

Also  taking into account interview answers, many criticalities explicitly emerged:  1. Lack of participants,  2. Unclear perception of the objectives, and  3. Instability of both the organizational structure and the core set of involved participants.  Focusing on the eleven key feature taken into account, in the analysed PPP model, the “Addressed  topics” feature received the best average score confirming that network and information security and  resilience was a concrete need for the majority of the involved stakeholders. On the opposite, the  feature “Expected outcomes” was the lowest in the score suggesting that, on average, participants  were unsatisfied with the results achieved.

Many of them however reported that the general objectives and the topics themselves were not  initially properly detailed. EP3R participants declared that pre-defining a set of topics and asking them  to select the most interesting one was different from an expected bottom-up approach; the proposed  flexibility of choice in a limited set of options was perceived as a lack of vision regarding the concrete  objective of the proposed interaction.  The implementation of the Task Forces attempted to address that issue in 2012, but some respondents  saw this as another way to obtain the same pre-defined outcomes. Actual perception of EP3R  participants is the opposite of the desired effect: during an interview, one participant pointed out that  “Prioritisation was correct but there was a need to find ways to cope with the settled objectives and to  avoid important on-going changes”.  The build-up of the Task Forces on top of the existing initial areas was supposed to achieve the goals  of the ToR initially agreed by the EP3R constituency in June 2010 and reach a final outcome.  Among participants there was also a dichotomy of opinions: some reported that topics were pre- defined and some others that they were unclear or not fixed. In 2012 EP3R suffered an important  turnover of participants and major changes in its approach. Several “new comers” felt that topics were  predetermined since they simply inherited them as result of the suggestions of the early participants.  Observation 1: Objectives should be appropriately selected and clearly stated.  Observation 3: A bottom-up approach enhances participants’ ownership and engagement  Observation 4: Preliminary feasibility assessment of the expected outcomes can improve the  effectiveness of the strategy selected to reach them  Observation 8: Addressed topics should be selected among those related to protection of Critical  Information Infrastructures  3.2 Leadership approach  According to the literature overview, the leadership approach is one of the most relevant criticalities  in each PPP experience.  In the specific case of EP3R, the lack of the evidence in influencing and in having a direct role in the  regulatory and policy environment of the European institutions was perceived as a major obstacle to  achieve any reasonable impact and a “Lack of authority and ability to enforce the outcome in local  environment”.  In other words, the management approach based on the definition of objectives by the public actors  and on their achievement relying on cooperation activities among (private) stakeholders, was  perceived as a potential limitation for the impact of the EP3R activities at policy and regulatory level.  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 17  Observation 5: Management with defined roles enhances responsibility and commitment  Observation 6: Action sharing can be preferable to information sharing under certain circumstances  Observation 11: Leadership approach should be based on coordination among public and private  stakeholders  3.3 Effort for the involved stakeholders  The effort requested to each EP3R participant was based on their time and active commitment in the  activities mainly during the meetings (both virtual and in presence) and in contributing to shared  documents. The perceived lack of potential impact of EP3R affected participation and started a high  membership turnover. This prevented the creation of stable personal networks and led most of the  respondents to declare that the initiative was not valuable from the economic point of view.  Observation 12: Funding strategy should provision for participants’ time and effort investment.  3.4 Costs for the involved stakeholders  Participation to EP3R activities led to direct costs (i.e. travel costs to attend the meeting in presence).  Cost-opportunities (i.e. time of the human resources working for a company invested in contributing  to the EP3R debate) were based on resources of the involved stakeholders. A general perception  among participants was that funds available to sustain direct costs may have had a positive impact on  the number of participants and their commitment.  Observation 12: Funding strategy should provision for participants’ time and effort investment  3.5 Geographical scope  To the question about the appropriate geographical scope for a cooperative initiative such as the  EP3R, none of the respondents has reported a geographical perspective different from the regional  one.  There is much needed attention to be paid to coordinate efforts at regional level in order to reach in  Europe economies of scale results in security and resilience comparable to those obtained in the most  advanced countries (i.e. the USA, Japan).  On the other side, respondents mentioned also that an effective coordination of national initiatives  could have a greater and more concrete impact than one at regional level. In this perspective, one of  the participants to the interviews suggested that “a multiple approach, combining national PPPs with  a regional/multinational coordination initiatives would be desirable”.  Observation 7: Regulatory provisions should be established at regional level  Observation 9: Geographical scope should reach regional coverage involving all the EU28 Member  States  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 18  3.6 Interaction model  The interaction model proposed for the EP3R initiative was based on both in presence and virtual  meetings.  The general aim of such interaction was to identify a trade-off between the need of building stable  personal networks and trust among stakeholders and the intention of containing effort in time and  direct costs of participants. Answers provided by respondents revealed that the relevance of face to  face meetings in building a trust environment was underestimated. Respondents generally requested  as a need more frequent in presence meetings, although in 2012 EP3R hosted 4 meetings (3 combined  plenary/TF meetings) and in 2013 participants kicked off face to face in Task Force meetings.  Observation 10: Interaction model should necessarily include regular meetings in presence  3.7 Type of involved stakeholders  The EP3R experience was limited to public and private stakeholders of the Telecom and Information  Technology sectors operating in Europe.  Nevertheless a significant number of respondents mentioned a lack of presence of the larger players  from the private sector. This fact had in turn a negative impact on the attractiveness of the initiative  also for small and medium stakeholders.  Among the respondents to the questionnaire, Figure 12 shows participation in different types of PPP  initiatives including EP3R. 65% of the respondents were involved in some forms of PPPs in the last 5  years. Almost all of them participated in cooperation initiatives focused on information and  communications security and resilience but less than half of them experienced the EP3R.  Figure 12 – Involvement in different types of PPPs of the respondents to the questionnaire  This result provides indications on the involvement of the same stakeholders in initiatives similar to  the EP3R which were organised at national level. It reveals existing engagements in cross-sectors  23%  57%  65%  77%  43%  35%  Has your organisation been involved in any EP3R activity ?

No  Yes  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 19  cooperation activities. For this reason, in order to increase participation and commitment, it seems  more appropriate to better specify objectives and expected outcomes rather than to enlarge the set  of types of stakeholders that can be involved.  Observation 2: Ownership of the underlying project is a fundamental driver of the participants’  commitment  3.8 Profile of participants of the involved stakeholders  The EP3R involved by invitation stakeholders of the Telecom and Information Technology sectors but  participants were directly appointed by the involved organisations.  Suggested profiles of participants were high profile professionals such as ICT Manager, Security  Managers, Information Security Managers, Chief Security Officers, and Chief Information Security  Officers, directors/chiefs/responsible of the Security Department/Area and  directors/chiefs/responsible of the ICT Department/Area of the involved stakeholders. The appointed  representatives were asked to take part in the Working Groups (in the first EP3R period) or in Task  Forces (in the second EP3R period) activities. The open and inclusive nature of EP3R allowed several  members of each stakeholders to participate in different Working Groups or Task Forces. Some  participants to the interviews stressed that in the cases in which more than one person was involved  in the EP3R activities there was a loss of the knowledge in the working team in case of alternance of  the persons and an additional lack of trust in case of frequent change of the representative. As a final  result, contribution of stakeholders and consequent commitment was partially fragmented and  dispersed.  Observation 14: Participants’ profile should include both public sector decision makers and private  sector high level security managers  3.9 Expected outcome  Respondents to the questionnaire felt that the objectives selected within EP3R were initially not  aligned with the needs of private sector stakeholders. The three initial investigation areas defined in  the Terms of Reference of EP3R were set-up in June 2010 during the EP3R plenary meeting.  Later, participants’ turnover led to a partial disconnection between those initial goals and  requirements of new participants to the EP3R activities. This observation was shared among  participants and, in February 2012, an entire EP3R plenary meeting was again organised to re-open  the discussion around the Terms of Reference. Discussions were held and the development of a new,  specific and detailed Work Programme was approved, leading in December 2012 to the publication of  a series of Position Papers.  In any case, all participants reported that EP3R was lacking a way to enforce the desired outcomes in  a way or another. Several respondents mentioned that the lack of knowledge of the regulatory  environment at national level affected the understanding of the potential barriers and, ultimately, the  provision of effective recommendations.  Observation 1: Objectives should be appropriately selected and clearly stated.  Observation 6: Action sharing can be preferable to information sharing under certain circumstances  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 20  Observation 7: Regulatory provisions should be established at regional level  Observation 13: The most desirable outcome would be the delivery of technical/organizational  solutions  3.10 Inclusion rule  The involvement of participants was based both on individual invitation to targeted operators and on  open expression of interest of stakeholders belonging to the selected types.  Such inclusion mechanism had an adverse effect: the EP3R appeared as informally established. This  affected the commitment of the stakeholders resulting in a lack of a stable group of participants. This  observation was already made in 2011; new rules were adopted to mitigate this negative effect with  the creation of the Task Forces. The process took time to become really visible and EP3R activities  were closed before reaching the desired results.  Observation 15: Involved stakeholders should be organizations with specific predefined  characteristics and approved by a relevant part of the PPP participants  3.11 Participation rule  Participation in EP3R relied on voluntary commitment with no formal obligations for participants to  effectively contribute to the proposed activities proposed. As considered a weakness point, most of  the respondents proposed several ideas to address this point:  - The establishment of a guarantee system to improve commitment and trust among  participants (see Annex C);  - The obligation of participants to agree on a detailed commitment, in particular related to the  confidentiality of the shared information.  - The definition of an access rule based on the proof of an actual, effective and active  participation  In light of the 2012 structural change of the EP3R, commitment was expected to continue. The actual  behaviour seemed to be slightly different: as already shown in Figure 9, half of EP3R participants took  part in more than one Working Group. This created an organisational issue: since working sessions in  presence were held in parallel, these participants took part in the end to the group which was the  most interesting for them. No indications were provided on the reason of their choice and if it was a  behaviour led by the topic discussed in a specific meeting or by other factors. In any case the effect  was negative on the creation of a shared trusted environment and on the achievement of the expected  outcomes themselves. Also according to other respondents’ experiences in cooperation initiatives,  trust was pointed out by all respondents as the fundamental requirement on which to build up fruitful  interactions.  Observation 16: Participation rule should be based on formal membership and subordinate to active  involvement in the working groups  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 21  4 Observations  The aims and the relevance of the EP3R experience is appropriately understood and effectively  reported in the answers of the questionnaire and in the participants’ interviews. The initiative was  terminated as organisational features started to maximise the expected outcomes of the interactions  among the participants of the public and private sectors.  Along the years, EP3R has changed its configuration both in terms of internal organisation and  participants’ involvement: in these evolutions, participants were contingently asked to declare their  willingness to participate in cooperation activities and to take decisions on which activity to support.  As the participation was set on voluntary basis and on individuals’ time investment, the EP3R key  governance features should be considered correct from the theoretical point of view.  The presented results should not discourage from establishing later new PPP approaches but rather  encourage refinements and improvements.  In particular, the overview of an existing PPP allows the identification of considerations for an effective  PPP and in particular:  1. The public-private partnership model is strongly exploited among different sectors for its  added value in relational capital and for its contribution in information sharing;  2. Effective public-private partnerships are based on trust building which can be achieved by  establishing guarantee systems or by creating participants’ consolidated relations;  3. Sharing of objectives and expected outcomes among the involved stakeholders helps to build  a working community able to face the emerging challenges in an integrated manner.  Accordingly, the assessment of EP3R initiative leads to the following general remarks:  1. The application of a wide-scope PPP model for the EP3R experience was the first valuable  attempt to involve relevant stakeholders belonging to the Telecom and information  Technology sectors on the issue of Network and Information security and resilience.  2. Creation of thematic Working Groups, in the first period, and Tasks Forces, in the second  period, aimed at  building restricted groups in order to give to opportunity to focus on topics  of interest and to enhance trust building among participants  3. Perception of participants of the EP3R and its expected outcomes was far from the original  intentions; the main weakness points of the initiative were the lack of well-defined  participation rules, the soft leadership approach, the limited interaction opportunities and the  unclear definition of expected concrete outcomes.  This results encourages future PPP implementations which could refine the model through an ad-hoc  tailoring of its key features.  Respondents provided in addition to the structured answers several additional comments that  composed a set of observations. The following table synthesises the most relevant and important  ones, i.e. those which should be considered in the creation of future initiatives.  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 22  1.Objectives should  be appropriately  selected and clearly  stated  Both literature review and telephone  interviews confirmed the relevance  of clear set of well specified and  properly selected objectives.  Participants are more motivated to  invest their time and effort if the goal  to be achieved is concrete and in light  with their needs.  Advantages  Enhancement of participants’  commitment  Concrete and achievable  outputs  Pitfalls  Fragmentation of the general  objective in multiple and too  specific goals with problems to  rebuild a general framework  2. Ownership of the  underlying project is  a fundamental driver  of the participants’  commitment  The degree of commitment of  participants is strictly related to the  perception of the ownership of the  underlying project; a proper selection  and sharing of the outcomes to be  achieved and the output to be  produced can avoid any lack of  commitment from participants.  Advantages  Stronger  participants’  commitment  Pitfalls  Potential difficulties in conciliating  public and private interests in a  unique shared and common  project  3. A bottom-up  approach enhances  participants’  ownership and  engagement  The involvement of participants in  the selection of objectives and  expected outcomes is a crucial factor  for the success of a PPP, guaranteeing  participation and commitment.  Advantages  Enhance participants’ commitment  Pitfalls  More complexity in the decision  making process  4. Preliminary  feasibility assessment  of the expected  outcomes can  improve the  effectiveness of the  strategy selected to  reach them  A preliminary feasibility assessment  analysis can improve PPP  effectiveness by defining whether the  proposed approach can provide  added value, and by identifying the  most convenient specifications of the  identified key features.  Advantages  More effective selection of the  specification of the PPP key  features  Improvement of resources  allocation  Pitfalls  Additional time and effort costs  5. Management with  defined roles  enhances  responsibility and  commitment  Management with defined roles can  enhance the responsibility  perception among participants,  making clear to whom they are liable  to. In addition PPP activities should  be led by participants of recognised  professional reputation. This directly  and indirectly affects participants’  responsibility and commitment.  Advantages  Enhanced responsibility perception  Pitfalls  Dependency paths respect to the  selected leaders  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 23  6. Action sharing is  preferable to  information sharing  under certain  circumstances  Where objectives and purposes are  clearly set up, action sharing may be  preferable to information sharing.  This approach could be considered of  high value for security and resilience  issues related recovery and crisis  management.  Advantages  Lower risk of sensible information  loss perceived by participants  Concrete result achievement  Pitfalls  Immediate response instead of  consolidated interactions  Mainly based on bilateral  agreements  7. Regulatory  provisions should be  established at  regional level  The lack of regulatory homogeneity  among the EU28 Member States is a  systemic weakness and a cost for  private actors in terms of adaptive  efforts. The standardization of  regulatory requirements related to  Network and Information security  and resilience would enhance  regional interactions.  Advantages  Regional security and resilience  enhancement  Pitfalls  Initial relevant  adaptive costs for a  regulatory framework different  from the national one  8. Addressed topics  should be selected  among those related  to protection of  Critical Information  Infrastructures  The major issue at stake is Critical  Information Infrastructures  Protection. After the identification  about potential risks affecting CIIs, a  coordination strategy among the  public and private players seems to  be the most appropriate approach  also to raise awareness on the topics  of interest.  Advantages  Improvement of protection of  infrastructural assets and services  provided through CIIs  Pitfalls  Objective achievable only on long  term perspective and active  involvement of many actors  managing/ owning CIIs  9. Geographical scope  should reach regional  coverage involving all  the EU28 Member  States  The interdependent framework of  reference for the Network and  Information security and resilience  needs a more integrated and regional  approach in order to effectively  address emerging challenges. The  regional scope is considered the most  appropriate one even though  important difficultness should be  faced to translate national  experiences in a European initiative.  Advantages  European preparedness  enhancement  More effective response to security  threats and to resilience challenges  Pitfalls  Additional management effort  Issues in facing heterogeneity in  the national  contexts  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 24  10. Interaction model  should necessarily  include regular  meetings in presence  Meetings in presence are the best  option to improve trust and to  consolidate commitment among  participants.  Advantages  Trust improvement  Commitment consolidation  Pitfalls  High direct costs for participants  11. Leadership  approach should be  based on  coordination among  public and private  stakeholders  Within coordination among public  and private stakeholders, leadership  of public actors would be preferable.  Management roles covered by  professionals with recognised  reputation may improve participants’  commitment and responsibility.  Advantages  Improvement of commitment and  responsibility  Effective impact of the cooperation  initiative on policy/regulatory  decision makers  Pitfalls  Potential misalignment of the  public actors requirements with  the private actors needs  12. Funding strategy  should provision for  participants’ time and  effort investment  Participants’ time and effort seem to  be the most pragmatic solution also  by maintaining low the cost of  interaction and by guaranteeing  participation of stakeholders really  interested in the foreseen  cooperation activities.  Advantages  Low cost PPP initiatives  Pitfalls  Dependency of the cooperation  effort from  commitment of the  involved stakeholders and their  possibility to sustain direct and  indirect costs  13. The most  desirable outcome  would be the delivery  of technical/  organizational  solutions  Among the most desirable concrete  outcomes technical or organisational  solutions in terms of security and  resilience were identified. Action  sharing can be a preferable option  especially when sensible information  sharing is needed. A specific  operative outcome is preferred to a  general theoretical one.  Advantages  Tangible operative outcomes and  solutions  Pitfalls  Difficulties to achieve general  objectives  14. Participants’  profile should include  both public sector  decision makers and  private sector high  level security  managers  High-profile professionals in the  security and resilience domain should  be involved. Their decision making  position in the organisation to which  they belong to allow them to take  pro-active behaviours in the PPP.  Advantages  High probability to obtain concrete  outcomes and strong commitment  of the stakeholders  Pitfalls  Limited availability of effort out of  the organisation to which they  belong to  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 25  15. Involved  stakeholders should  be organizations with  specific predefined  characteristics and  approved by a  relevant part of the  PPP participants  Inclusion should be based on  participants’ approval and should be  open strictly to the stakeholders of  the identified sectors. Homogeneity  of stakeholders’ profiles helps to  focus on common issues in which all  participants have high interest to  face.  Advantages  Focus on common issues of  interest  Pitfalls  Limited number of participants  16. Participation rule  should be based on  formal membership  and subordinate to  active involvement in  the working groups  Participation based on a formal  membership and on proof of active  contribution help to avoid to involve  participant not interested to  contribute but mainly to benefit from  the activities in the PPP (i.e.  information sharing).  Advantages  Improvement of the commitment  of participants  Perception of the possibility to  achieve concrete outcomes  Pitfalls  Higher management effort  Figure 13 - Observations and lessons learnt for future initiatives  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 26  5 Recommendations for future initiatives  The key recommendations for the future pertain for four main areas:  - Implement agile PPPs which can adapt to new needs and topics;  - Incentivise Industry initiatives;  - Define simple but formal rules and governance;  - Publish and advertise successful results.  Use Agile PPPs  While the global constituency of the EP3R was large (more than 250 registered participants), the most  attractive aspect rapidly became the constitution of smaller groups of active participants (i.e. the  Working Groups). For this reason, while keeping bi-annual plenary meetings (mostly for the review  and acceptance of the produced work), experts participated to the actual works of the Working  Groups and then Task Forces on a more regular basis creating a trusted relationships among the group  participants.  The US and UK examples also support this model: such a PPP is most likely successful when it is  composed of several hives which can host and bear several different topics, but with similar methods.  Only then the cost effectiveness reaches its optimum.  The successors of EP3R in the security and resilience domain should take the form of a platform where  ISACs, Working Groups and Task Forces can be created very rapidly when the need arises and have a  short lifespan. Their scope should be focused and limited, and they should be assigned one clear  objective to reach. Such a platform could be co-chaired by European Officials and by major industry  players.  Incentivise participation in PPPs at industry level  While the bottom-up approach should be used to trigger activities in a PPP platform, the lack of  support of industry players could be a major barrier to a generalisation of this practice.  The engagement must be twofold:  - Initiatives can arise bottom-up, or top-down, or both;  - Financial and Human Resources support needs to be approved and engaged.  A formal partnership needs to be agreed and established by relevant European Officials and major  industry players on the base of a future commitment and a concrete activity plan.  Adopt formal PPPs rules and governance  A proper leadership team should be appointed to manage the PPP and to set-up basic rules that will  allow participants to understand the objective, the expected outcomes and how contribute to them.  Participants themselves need to understand the key features of the PPP16. In addition, the empirical  observation of the governance model of successful PPPs in the world allowed to design a typical PPP  skeleton.  Future PPP platform should adopt and document its governance model based on a structure similar  to the proposed one based on PPP key features.  16. This approach was already published in December 2011 on the ENISA Good Practice Guide on Cooperative  Models for Effective PPPs (http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/public-private- partnership/national-public-private-partnerships-ppps/good-practice-guide-on-cooperatve-models-for- effective-ppps)  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 27  Advertise successful initiatives  Larger geographical coverage, engagement of the right participants to take part in such a future  platform would require the increase of the attractiveness of its results. This means that the initiative  and the impact achieved should be properly advertised and publicised.  This requires the implementation of two preliminary activities:  - An Impact Assessment of any activity carried out within the Platform, i.e. the assurance that  the recommendations or reports issued were followed by effects and real-life  implementations;  - A surveying mechanism evaluating trend of satisfaction of participants and reputation out of  the platform.  Initiatives conducted within such platforms need to be properly evaluated, and the effects should be  assessed on a yearly basis to ensure that the time invested by participants achieved a positive impact.

Security of critical infrastructures has traditionally be an issue of main concern not only for the US  government but also for national private operators.  The National Council of ISACs (Information Sharing and Analysis Centres) is a volunteer group of ISACs  representatives who meet monthly since 2003. Their objective is to develop trusted relationships among  sectors and address common issues and concerns. The ISACs are trusted entities established by Critical  Infrastructure owners and operators, whose original primary business was to provide comprehensive  sector analysis to be shared among relevant stakeholders, including government. Services provided by  ISACs include risk mitigation, incident response, alert and information sharing. The mission of the National  Council of ISACs, “is to advance physical and cyber security of critical infrastructures of North America by  establishing and maintaining a framework for valuable interaction”.  In light of this purposes, the National Council of ISACs works for the realization of drills and exercises, real- time sector threat level reporting and emergency classified briefing. Furthermore, during incidents of  national significance, the Council hosts a private sector liaison at the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) in the National Infrastructure Coordinating Centre (NICC).  Among the initiatives sponsored by the National Council of ISACs it is worth to point out the case of NICCIC  (National Cyber security and Communication Integration Centre) whose mission is to address threats and  incidents affecting the Nation’s critical information technology and cyber infrastructures. The initiative  concerns the Level-Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI). NICCIC operates at steady  state (by promoting information sharing and data and situational awareness of its participants), during  incident response phase (e.g. joint incident management) and in de-escalation phase (decision-makers  support).  Furthermore, in July 2013 the U.S. Commerce Department’s National Institute of Standards and Technology  (NIST) released its draft outline on Preliminary Framework to Reduce Cyber Risks to Critical Infrastructures.  The objective addressed is to kick-off the establishment process of a voluntarily-based Cyber Security  Public-Private Framework which will involve “a broad mix of companies, not-for-profit organizations, and  government agencies across different sectors”. As stated in the document, the Partnership, besides being  lead and coordinated by the NIST department, will rely on “private sector inputs”. Issues have been  identified as of primary concern for the Framework attention, i.e. the “lack of standards, guidelines, and  practices to address privacy and civil liberties issues, as well as the scarcity of helpful metrics for an  organization’s cyber security effectiveness”. The general aim is to set up an adaptable, complete and  consistent interaction scheme able to deal with cyber security risks, innovation, emerging challenging and  awareness raising. Finally, the interaction strategy will be based on participants’ “response to public  notices, discussion at workshops […] direct communication and comments on […] documents”.

Consolidation of the relationships  • A guarantee system setting up basic rules of unishment of passive and unfair behaviours of participants is essential to set-up a collaborative interaction. All participants to the cooperation activities should subscribe it.  •An ex novo gurantee system should be set-up accordingly to the main features of the collaborative mechanism. A guarantee system can help to overpass initial mistrust among participants improving mutual agreement and commitment.  • Application methods of basic rules of the guarantee system should be defined and integrated in the governance of cooperation initiative.

The EP3R participants initiated many  discussions, saw a lot of commitment, and produced interesting conclusions. It also revealed some  further needs in the security and resilient field and also some gaps to be filled in order to reach a  higher maturity level of the Telecom Sector.  The EP3R closed down in April 2013, after 4 years of existence and practically 3 years of operations.  The impact of the very first European Public -Private Partnership for Resilience had to be assessed and  lessons had to be drawn for future similar initiatives and other funded actions for improving European  resilience.  Generally, the PPP approach is judged to be particularly appropriate for addressing complex  cooperation problems within multi-stakeholder scenarios. The case of EP3R is mirrored overseas by  the National Council of ISACs1 (Information Sharing and Analysis Centres) and many other similar  initiatives. This underlines the appropriateness of the PPP approach to address cooperation issues as  complex as the security and resilience ones.  The large number of PPP experiences worldwide has confirmed the value of such approach also for its  flexibility and appropriateness for today emerging challenges including cyber-attacks mitigation,  critical infrastructure protection and security and resilience of information and communications.  This study proposes to investigate the gap between expected optimal features of a Public Private  Partnership for Resilience and its implementation in the EP3R, and bases its conclusions both on  literature contributions and on a direct collection of information (i.e. interviews and surveys) with key  EP3R actual and potential stakeholders (i.e. Chief information security officers, Security senior experts  of both public and private European organisations).  The specific aim of this analysis was to:  - Review the experience of Public-Private Partnerships in the telecom and information  technology sector;  - Understand how a PPP addresses the needs of improving the network and information  security at Pan-European level;  - Assess how such cooperation platforms can positively impact on security and resilience.  1 http://www.isaccouncil.org/aboutus.html  http://www.isaccouncil.org/aboutus.html  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page v  Involved stakeholders, both through interviews and questionnaires, have suggested several important  observations:  Accordingly, the EP3R key drivers were “team building”, “trust consolidation”, “clear and focused  objectives identification”, and “tangible and specific outcomes definition”, but a clearer definition of  purpose and stable and agreed terms of reference were advocated by interviewees for a more  effective, consistent and reliable cooperation mechanism.  In 2011 ENISA published a Good Practice Guide on Cooperative Models for Effective PPPs 2  and  implemented the suggested features in the EP3R for the second half of its existence.  The main conclusions highlight that the PPP model for information sharing in the field of ICT security  deserves to be considered as an experiment due to its different possible set-up combinations. The  general perception among the respondents to the interviews carried out in this study is that the  outcomes of the EP3R were “partially satisfactory”. This can be considered as an encouraging outcome  for a very first platform of this kind, and an incentive for adapting the setup of features in future PPP  implementations. Some issues were raised by participants who stepped out after the first two years  of the EP3R existence (2010-2011) not having the opportunity to actively participate when these issues  have been addressed and to assist to the evolution of the platform in its last two years (2012-2013).  Finally, a large majority of respondents demonstrated strong affinity of the additional value associated  with such an approach and are supportive of such model.  The study allows to draw a number of recommendations:  - Setup and use agile PPPs: adapting rapidly to changes means that working groups should be  small, their scope focused and detailed, and with a closed end-date;  - Incentivise Industry initiatives and participation by providing financial and human resources  support;  - Define at the earliest stage simple but formal rules and governance;  - Publish and advertise successful results.  2 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/public-private-partnership/national-public- private-partnerships-ppps/good-practice-guide-on-cooperatve-models-for-effective-ppps  Public-Private Partnerships are regarded as a valuable option useful to address different types of complex  problems  Public-Private Partnerships do not have a single consolidated set of key features, but  they can be adapted  to the circumstances and to the issue at stake  Public-Private Partnership approaches re-balance the decision-making role in favour of the private  stakeholders  The effectiveness of the Public-Private Partnership approach is strictly related to the degree of ownership  of the project outcomes perceived by participant stakeholders  A bottom-up approach is essential to properly face the identified topics, to achieve the expected results of the  initiative and to maintain  a constant interest  of particpants  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/public-private-partnership/national-public-private-partnerships-ppps/good-practice-guide-on-cooperatve-models-for-effective-ppps http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/public-private-partnership/national-public-private-partnerships-ppps/good-practice-guide-on-cooperatve-models-for-effective-ppps  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page vi  Table of Contents  1 Introduction 1  1.1 Objectives 1  1.2 Methodology 2  1.3 Structure of this report 2  2 Industry perception of Public-Private Partnerships 3  2.1 Types of cooperation mechanisms 3  2.2 Previous experience of the respondents in PPP Initiatives 4  2.3 Industry indications on PPP needs 5  2.4 Benefits of PPPs 7  2.5 Purpose and European perspective 9  2.6 Reasons preventing participation in PPPs 9  3 EP3R: a European PPP on Networks Resilience 11  3.1 Addressed topics 16  3.2 Leadership approach 16  3.3 Effort for the involved stakeholders 17  3.4 Costs for the involved stakeholders 17  3.5 Geographical scope 17  3.6 Interaction model 18  3.7 Type of involved stakeholders 18  3.8 Profile of participants of the involved stakeholders 19  3.9 Expected outcome 19  3.10 Inclusion rule 20  3.11 Participation rule 20  4 Observations 21  5 Recommendations for future initiatives 26  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 1  1 Introduction  In the past few decades, information and communications became the backbone of today’s society.  Critical Information and Communication Infrastructures (CIIs) are a crucial component of economic  and social systems worldwide and a fundamental asset for social life, private business and public  services. As consequence the Telecom sector grew in size and complexity leading in Europe to a  situation of market fragmentation where also main industry players operate in several countries.  In this context, a coordinated cross-border multi-stakeholder approach can help to address the  challenges of the protection of CIIs. Such protection should be considered at three levels: Strategic  level, Governance level, and Management (or Operations) level. While international regulations and  national legislations refer to the strategic level, ICT providers are mainly interested in managing the  CIIs lifecycle. This governance issue led to the development of a cooperation mechanisms including  public-private partnerships (PPPs) at the European level to bridge the gap between the strategic and  management levels. It is essential to improve resilience and security of the CIIs also taking into account  the cross-border perspective.  In this study, many essential drivers have been identified in the ownership perception of the project  outcomes of the participant stakeholders and in the PPP model:  - Addressed topics;  - Leadership approach;  - Effort for the involved stakeholders;  - Costs for the involved stakeholders;  - Geographical scope;  - Interaction model;  - Type of involved stakeholders;  - Profile of participants of the involved stakeholders;  - Expected outcomes;  - Inclusion rule;  - Participation rule.  Systematic cross-border cooperation may improve the effectiveness of security and resilience  measures while lowering their cost. Market dynamics do not always provide sufficient incentives for  private operators in the Telecom sector to invest in security and resilience of CIIs. Coordination among  relevant public and private stakeholders therefore could be an important assets both at national and  international level.  The development of a European culture of PPPs for security and resilience of CIIs is an iterative  process. This report is a critical assessment of the experience collected in the first iteration of a PPP in  the field, the European Public Private Partnership for Resilience (EP3R).  1.1 Objectives  This report analyses the opportunities and challenges of the first European public-private partnerships  in the field of network and information security and resilience in Europe, the European Public-Private  Partnership for Resilience (EP3R) in which mainly participated stakeholders belonging to the Telecom  and Information Technology sectors.  The intention of this report is to draw a picture on:  - The affinity of respondents with security and resilience issues;  - The outcomes of PPPs in the Telecom and Information Technology sectors in comparison with  those focused on other sectors (e.g. transport, energy, health, finance);  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 2  - The needs for a public-private partnership to improve network and information security and  resilience;  - Other network and information security and resilience initiatives in the area of CIIs (different  from the EP3R).  Moreover, given the role of Member States and the European Institutions aimed to guarantee an  efficient and effective delivery of public utility services, the proposed analysis focus also on security  and resilience issues related to CIIs as strategic assets of the European economy.  1.2 Methodology  In order to understand how the approach of PPPs contributes to increased security and resilience of  CIIs, the following methods to collect information among stakeholders operating in the EU27 Member  States were used:  - An on-line questionnaire submitted to Chief Security Officers, Chief Information Security  Officers, directors/chiefs/responsible of the Security Department/Area and  directors/chiefs/responsible of the ICT Department/Area belonging to operators in Telecom  and Information Technology sectors as well as to operators of ICT-reliant sectors (e.g.  transport, energy, health, finance).  - Telephone interviews with the EP3R participant stakeholders.  - Further telephone interviews with outsiders in order to determine which key characteristics  of a PPP seem valuable to the ICT industry.  Finally, information and data collected from the respondents to the questionnaire and from the  participants to the interviews were analysed in order to address the above mentioned research  objectives.  1.3 Structure of this report  This report summarises the most relevant findings of the interviews and the questionnaires. Excluding  the introduction, main contents are structured in four chapters aimed at:  - Describing the ICT industry perception of PPPs (Chapter 2);  - Analysing the EP3R Experience, its history and development (Chapter 3);  - Reporting observations from the interviews and questionnaires (Chapter 4);  - Providing recommendations for future cooperation initiatives in the network security and  resilience such as PPPs (Chapter 5).  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 3  2 Industry perception of Public-Private Partnerships  Over the past few decades, ICT threats and concerns rose in complexity while resources available to  handle them decreased. In this scenario, the traditional approach –i.e. delegating issues of collective  interest to public management- has demonstrated some structural limitations. Public administrations,  are not exposed to failure risks and provide collective services disconnected from any profit-making  strategy. Private sector entities own and manage infrastructures of collective interest (such as CIIs)  and cannot bear alone the cost of security and resilience.  The New Public Management theory has tried to overturn this tendency by introducing a market- oriented management notion into the public sector. The basic assumption is that a market-oriented  management would have led to greater cost-efficiency for governments, without producing negative  effects in terms of objectives and outcomes3.  Since then Public-Private Partnerships have been used to introduce market practices in areas  traditionally dominated by non-market players, e.g. the delivery of infrastructural services and the  provision of public goods 4 . When establishing PPPs for project-financing, public administration  representatives are aware that the private partners will run the project under a profit-maximising  strategy.  For this report, cooperation mechanisms have been considered and investigated which all those that  fit the broad scope as defined in the report on Cooperative models for effective Public-Private  Partnership:  “[A PPP is] an organised relationship between public and private organisations, which establishes  common scope and objectives. It uses defined roles and a work methodology to achieve shared goals.”5  Furthermore, as one of the essential benefit of the PPP approach is its flexibility, one of the main goal  of this work is to identify which PPP model would be the most effective to improve CIIs security and  resilience according to the indications of participant stakeholders.  2.1 Types of cooperation mechanisms  The dialogue established with the stakeholders from industry revealed that information sharing and  cooperation on specific issues were common activities for the most of their PPP experiences.  As the interactions get global and increasingly complex, approaches based on multi-stakeholder  involvement become the sole option to effectively address horizontal issues related to security and  resilience. Thus in this field, the nature of cooperation has evolved from problem solving to shared  strategy building. The main purpose remains the creation of economies of scale.  Results of the direct interaction with participant stakeholders belonging to Telecom and Information  Technology sectors confirm this pattern. As shown below, respondents to the questionnaire declared  that cooperation initiatives are present and based on information sharing (37%) or on cooperation on  specific issues (53%).  3 HOOD C., “A Public Management for All Seasons.”, in Public Administration, 69 (Spring), 3-19, 1991  4 MENARD C., “Is Public-Private Partnership obsolete?

In order to  achieve these goals, the questionnaire has been designed to include all type of public-private  initiatives regardless of their types and aims.  As the majority of respondents declared to have had experience with PPPs in the last 5 years (65%), a  reasonable assumption is that in the Telecom and Information Technology sectors PPP initiatives can  be considered as a well-established cooperation mechanism.  Figure 2 – Answers to the question “Has your Organisation been involved in any kind of PPP in the past 5 years?”  Information Sharing 37%  Cooperation  established for  specific issues  53%  No forms are used 10%  Yes 65%  No 35%  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 5  As shown in Figure 2, new types of PPP emerged. The original project financing approach (i.e. delivery  of large infrastructures) is no longer the sole model used. PPPs in the Telecom and Information  Technology sectors for information sharing (29%) and ad-hoc cooperation on specific issues (35,5%)  can be considered as a well-established collaboration mechanism6.  Figure 2 - Respondents' previous PPP experiences7  2.3 Industry indications on PPP needs  The information collected through the questionnaire allows also to draw indications of the desired  features of a PPP for network and Information security and resilience. A key element is that regional  cooperation could be a fundamental driver to enhance European competitiveness. Furthermore,  industry representatives felt that significant results in this domain can no longer arise from private  stakeholders or public actors alone. In this context, PPPs become a pillar in network and information  Security and Resilience good practices.  In order to achieve these goals, human and relational capital should be considered an essential asset  to be exploited in PPPs.  6 A clarification on the low value related to the number of PPPs in project financing is needed. As PPPs for project  financing are commonly used for the creation of large physical public infrastructures (e.g. roads) or provision  ofcollective services (e.g. healthcare assistance), opportunities to adopt this type of interaction are structurally  less than those to create “soft infrastructures” (e.g. cooperation tables for security and resilience).  7 Questionnaire, Question 3.1 “Which form of PPP is usually used in your activity sector?”  6,5%  35,5%  29,0% 29,0%  Project Financing  Cooperation on Specific Issues  Information Sharing  No Form Used  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 6  According to the information collected from the respondents belonging to the Telecom, Information  Technology, Transport, Energy, Health, Finance sectors, the following features of a PPP should be  included in an effective European PPP for network and information security and resilience:  1. Leadership would be effective if based on a management approach agreed among  participants. The establishment of a responsibility structure is essential also to monitor  participants’ effort.  2. Funding should be based on participants’ efforts and time. Incentives such as ownership of  project objectives, reduction of threat exposure, benefits from a multi-stakeholders approach  may be used to increase to benefit/cost ratio of participants.  3. Expected outcome of the initiative should be at European level, even if potential benefits  could arise from addressing the issue at national level. Several issues related to security and  resilience in se seem to require an approach as wider as the national one.  4. Inclusion Rules should be properly defined taking into account also feasible options for  enhancing participation both on invitation and on spontaneous candidatures or expressions  of interest.  5. Participation should be limited to effective and proactive contribution to the general effort in  order to ensure coherence between goals and results of the partnership.  As shown in Figure 3, five main questions (Why, Where, how, What, Who) were used to identify the  key features for an effective PPP and represent them in a simplified scheme.  Figure 3 – Key features of a PPP for network and Information security and resilience  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 7  2.4 Benefits of PPPs  Over the past 20 years, the roles and responsibilities of the industrial players of Telecom and  Information technology sectors have remained abstract. A gap existed between the perception of the  industry players’ security and resilience duties for provided services and the existing regulatory  indications.  In this respect, PPPs could be also a bridging solution between industrial players and public authorities  enabling four advantages in this cooperation mechanism:  Figure 4 - Key Objectives of a PPP with industrial players of the Telecom and Information Technology sectors  Within this mechanism, private sector players may act in line with public needs and requirements and  interact for the decision-making process, while the public sector players increase their awareness of  emerging challenges and market dynamics. Mutual input from the public and private side gives the  opportunity to create synergies and improve resource allocation also in light of a more rational  selection of priorities leading to a so-called “soft regulation”.  According to the answers provided by respondents, the most relevant advantage of a PPP approach is  the opportunity to exchange information, knowledge, expertise and good practices (25%). The  opportunity to influence the decision making process is perceived by the 16,10% of the respondents  which considered PPPs also effective for networking opportunities (17,90%) .

According to the results of the questionnaire, existing PPP models and objectives need to be further  developed. A wide majority of respondents declared that their expectations were fulfilled only  partially (60%). No one reported that the public-private interaction was a failing approach that has to  be discouraged and unsatisfied respondents provided several suggestions to improve their outcomes.  Figure 6 – Answer to the question “Have PPPs produced expected positive outcomes for your organisation?”  The overall result is of particular interest because it represents a paradigm shift. The added value of  PPPs relates not mostly to the consolidation of human relations. The objective has shifted from  maximising the immediate revenue to ensuring long term opportunities based on cooperation  activities.  5%  35%  60%  No  Yes  Partially  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 9  2.5 Purpose and European perspective  Examples of the effective PPP approaches in the Telecom and Information Technology context already  exist at national level. In fact, different types of PPP mechanisms have experimented and tried with  different purposes. Successful examples8 were mentioned:  - The Superfast Cornwall9 project (UK);  - The Asturcorn10 (ES);  - The public outsourcing provision of broadband infrastructures realised by the Auvergne  Region11 (FR);  - The Metroweb project for the management of internet physical infrastructures and routes has  been established as a joint venture between a public subject (the A2a publicly owned  electricity company) and a private actor (F2i and Intesa Sanpaolo). Metroweb network covers  a 2700 km metropolitan area (almost the entire municipality of Milan), and its operations is  leased to different telecom companies (IT).12  As these examples confirm, the project financing PPP type has been applied with success at national  level and it will probably become one the main drivers for the achievement of the objectives of the  Digital Agenda. On the other side, the realisation of similar initiatives at European level remains  extremely complex.  On the contrary wider-scope PPPs focusing on information sharing and specific cooperation targets  may be easily set up at the European level. They would allow participants to share experiences which  public authorities and private actors can directly adopt and exploit, and further develop also later on  at National level. Due to the sensibility of the topics relating to security and resilience (both for  national public authorities and private companies) cooperation PPPs is the most promising approach.  2.6 Reasons preventing participation in PPPs  When considering information collected from other sectors (transport, energy, health, finance),  respondents declared that they have not been involved in any sort of PPP in the last 5 years. They  identified which factors impeded their direct involvement in these cooperation initiatives. The  question had a double purpose: to understand why respondents was not involved in a PPP and, if  involved before the last 5 years, to understand why they left the initiative.  8 Examples have been selected on the base of an EPEC study on the theme which includes a wider sample of  case studies, e.g. EPEC, Broadband. Delivering next generation access through PPP.  9 Private Design Build and Operate PPP for the provision of Next Generation broadband (FTTP and FTTC) in the  Cornwall area. For more information, see http://www.superfastcornwall.org  10 Public Design Build and Operate PPP for the provision of FTTP infrastructures in the Asturias region; to the  date EUR 55 million have been invested.  11 Public outsourcing PPP for the provision of high-speed broadband (at least 512kbit/sec) for a period of 10  years, basing on a 38,5 million EUR budget.  12 For further information, see http://www.metroweb.it  http://www.superfastcornwall.org/ http://www.metroweb.it/  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 10  Figure 7 – Answer to the question “Which were the reasons impeding the participation to PPP?”  As shown in Figure 7, a large majority of respondents did not participate to a PPP because these type  of initiatives are not common in their sector of activity. More than 20% of the respondents declared  that these initiatives are not used in the countries in which the organisation operates. These results  confirm that the PPP approach is not equally distributed both in considered sectors and in the Member  States.  The opinion that PPP initiatives are useless also remains. Several respondents claimed that:  - The lack of information or visibility on the PPP initiative itself or of its specific  objectives/expected outcomes;  - Difficulty in sharing of confidential information.  The perception that information sharing is a deterrent factor should not be considered as a structural  weakness of the PPP approach. Trust building is arguably one of the most crucial issues to be  addressed either by consolidated relationships or by establishing formal guarantee systems.  Mechanisms to improve cooperative behaviour of public and private stakeholders should be identified  in order to create PPP initiatives which address common issues and benefit from a multi-stakeholder  approach. Furthermore an increased awareness of current PPPs initiatives may enable cooperation  and interest in shared management of common goals.

The initial aim of this partnership was to establish a sustainable cross-border co-operation  devoted to address the CIIP Action Plan fundamental pillars. The objectives of the EP3R were:  “- Encourage information sharing and stock-taking of good policy and industrial practices to  foster common understanding;  - Discuss public policy priorities, objectives and measures;  - Baseline requirements for the security and resilience in Europe;  - Identify and promote the adoption of good baseline practices for security and resilience.”14  The CIIP Action Plan represents an important milestone in the implementation of the strategy for a  Secure Information Society, COM(2006)25115. The approach chosen by the Commission was mainly to  engage the public and private sector in a multilateral, open and inclusive dialogue for partnership and  empowerment in order to achieve the five pillars of the CIIP Action Plan:  - Preparedness and Prevention  - Detection and response  - Mitigation and recovery  - International Cooperation  - Criteria for European Critical Infrastructures in the ICT sector  The overall goal of the EP3R was to cope with the CIIP Action Plan prescriptions (with ad-hoc working  groups organized to address specific issues) and the EP3R scope itself evolved over the years in order  to better fit needs and policy evolutions.  Early days (2009-2011)  Bearing in mind these objectives, in 2010 the EP3R was devoted to information sharing and stock  taking of good policy and industrial practices. It aimed at improving the consistency and the  coordination of policies for security and resilience in Europe.  It was originally structured on three Working Groups (WG). Security Experts were invited from  National and pan European Telecom operators, Internet Service Providers, industrial associations,  Standardisation Bodies, Competent National Authorities, manufactures and solution providers. EP3R  intended to reach a regional scope (initially, EU27) with the participation of a number of selected  operators chosen among the categories mentioned previously.  13 Commission of European Communities, COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE  COUNCIL, THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS, on Critical  Information Infrastructure Protection \"Protecting Europe from large scale cyber-attacks and disruptions: enhancing  preparedness, security and resilience\", COM(2009)149, Brussels.  14 As stated in the ENISA web page http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/public-private- partnership/european-public-private-partnership-for-resilience-ep3r  15 Commission of European Communities, COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE  COUNCIL, THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE OF THE REGION, A strategy for a  Secure Information Society – “Dialogue, partnership and empowerment”, COM(2006)251, Brussels  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/public-private-partnership/european-public-private-partnership-for-resilience-ep3r http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/public-private-partnership/european-public-private-partnership-for-resilience-ep3r  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 12  Adopting the simplified scheme based on the five main questions (Why, Where, how, What, Who)  already used to describe the key features for an effective PPP, the EP3R set up can be summarised as  follows (see Figure 8).  Figure 8 – Main key features of the EP3R  With respect to the five key elements identified as to be included in an effective European PPP for  network and information security and resilience, EP3R presented:  1. A leadership approach based on coordination among participants that were sked to join  thematic working groups working mainly on a virtual basis using online collaboration, mailing  lists, call conferences or remote workshops.  2. A funding scheme based on time and efforts of the involved stakeholders.  3. An expected outcome strictly related to information sharing, policy priority identification,  CIIs security standards definition and promotion of CIIs’ security and resilience good  practices.  4. The participation (of involved stakeholders) was voluntary, inclusive and based on trust  5. Inclusion rule was set up on a profile of the stakeholder. Stakeholders admitted had to belong  to security sectors of National and pan European Telecom operators, Internet Service  Providers, industrial associations, Standardization Bodies, Competent National Authorities,  manufactures and solution providers.  An Improved model (2012-2013)  The evolution of participants’ needs for a more topic-focused and impact-oriented approach led to  implement structural changes after mid-2012. Since early 2012, also the management mechanism of  working groups was already modified significantly: EP3R introduced nominated Moderators,  organised frequent teleconferences and provided alternative additional meeting opportunities (e.g.  combination of plenary sessions with working group sessions the day before or after). These came to  force from April 2012 (in Rome).  According to the EP3R Activity Report 2012. Between August 2011 and March 2012 several discussions  were on-going in each working group:  Why? Where? How? What? Who?  PARTICIPANT  PROFILES Public and private  ICT stakeholders  INCLUSION RULE Restricted to organizations identified as relevant ICT stakeholders  PARTICIPATION  RULE Trust based participation  LEADERSHIP SYSTEM  Coordination  among  participants  FUNDING  Members’ time/direct costs  GEOGRAPHICAL SCOPE  EU27 level  INTERACTION  STRATEGY  Mailing lists Teleconference Workshops  EXPECTED  OUTCOME  • Encourage  information  sharing • Discuss public  policy priorities,  objectives and  measures • Baseline  requirements for  CIIs security and  resilience • Promote the  adoption of good  practices for CIIs  security and  resilience  TOPIC ADDRESSED  Follow-up to the policy initiative on Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP)  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 13   Working Group 1 addressed the Critical Information Infrastructure Protection approach and  delivered recommendations within the ICT Criteria Non-Paper. Relevant considerations  came  also on a methodology to classify assets supporting CIIs infrastructures;   Working Group 2 gathered Hardware Manufacturers, Supply Chain operators, and Telecom  Operators to define “quick wins” to improve reliability, resilience and default security levels  of equipment;   Working Group 3b proposed to implement a pan-European botnet-fighting programme, along  with key recommendations on how to proceed;   Working Group 3e reflected mainly on the preparedness for a Preliminary Emergency  Communication and recommended the establishment of a European Crisis Coordination  Contact list.  Several topics emerged from each of the 3 initial areas and gradually evolved into smaller sub-groups.  The Work Programme 2013 acknowledged those observed changes, and already in September 2012,  Task Forces were created to address those emerging topics. The EP3R Work Programme 2013 reports  that “Much progress was achieved during the April 2012 Experts Meeting which was held in Rome.  Four position papers have been produced and have been consolidated in a general Working Groups’  Yearly Statement. [...] Several conclusions arose after the Rome Meeting, to allow for a maturing of  the work organisation, and therefore achieve a higher degree of reflection during the working sessions.  The natural next step was to divide each topic into smaller tasks assigned to 5-6 Experts maximum,  and later have them reviewed in an EP3R plenary session. [...] Such a model presents a series of  advantages:  - Shorter Time to Delivery for recommendations;  - Greater flexibility in addressing current issues, and prioritising the work based on its natural  dependencies;  - Sense of ownership of the topic by Experts working on it;  - The opportunity to address the trust related issues of effective information sharing in EP3R  and beyond;  - Better use of Subject Matter Experts’ time and better focus on issues based on their level of  knowledge.  [...] While keeping the coverage of the initial Terms of Reference (ToR), the structure of the Working  Groups [has] gradually been replaced by smaller Task Forces.”  The organisational change was implemented to allow a better trust building and to improve  stakeholders’ commitment in the overall collaboration environment.  Overall perception of the initiative  A set of Interviews addressed EP3R participants from both early and later years. Another set of  interviews was also conducted with persons who observed the development of the EP3R or were  indirectly involved. The overall experience of EP3R participants was considered positive and  appreciated. Several aspects of such cooperation initiative have been indicated to be improved in  order to actually achieve impacts and reach effective outcomes.  Among the questionnaire respondents only 23% participated in the EP3R. Almost half of them  participated to more than one working group (13%).  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 14  Figure 9 – Answer to the question “Have you ever been involved in the activities of the EP3R?”  Taking into account the fact that the EP3R was exclusively dedicated to Telecom and Information  Technology sectors, most of participants reported a general lack of information on the initiative, its  goals and outcomes.  No respondents reported that reasons to leave EP3R were related with the confidentiality of the  information to be shared despite the presence of competitors or due to an inappropriate selection of  stakeholders to be involved. 15% of the respondents did not consider the EP3R activities of particular  interest, while 8% of them clearly stated that the ratio between the effort required and the effective  gain was underbalanced. Another 15% of respondents reported that the EP3R was not opened to  operators of their sector.  In light of these results, it seems that EP3R participants partially validated the outsider perception that  the actual experience was not fully coherent with the initial objectives of the EP3R establishment.

Also  taking into account interview answers, many criticalities explicitly emerged:  1. Lack of participants,  2. Unclear perception of the objectives, and  3. Instability of both the organizational structure and the core set of involved participants.  Focusing on the eleven key feature taken into account, in the analysed PPP model, the “Addressed  topics” feature received the best average score confirming that network and information security and  resilience was a concrete need for the majority of the involved stakeholders. On the opposite, the  feature “Expected outcomes” was the lowest in the score suggesting that, on average, participants  were unsatisfied with the results achieved.

Many of them however reported that the general objectives and the topics themselves were not  initially properly detailed. EP3R participants declared that pre-defining a set of topics and asking them  to select the most interesting one was different from an expected bottom-up approach; the proposed  flexibility of choice in a limited set of options was perceived as a lack of vision regarding the concrete  objective of the proposed interaction.  The implementation of the Task Forces attempted to address that issue in 2012, but some respondents  saw this as another way to obtain the same pre-defined outcomes. Actual perception of EP3R  participants is the opposite of the desired effect: during an interview, one participant pointed out that  “Prioritisation was correct but there was a need to find ways to cope with the settled objectives and to  avoid important on-going changes”.  The build-up of the Task Forces on top of the existing initial areas was supposed to achieve the goals  of the ToR initially agreed by the EP3R constituency in June 2010 and reach a final outcome.  Among participants there was also a dichotomy of opinions: some reported that topics were pre- defined and some others that they were unclear or not fixed. In 2012 EP3R suffered an important  turnover of participants and major changes in its approach. Several “new comers” felt that topics were  predetermined since they simply inherited them as result of the suggestions of the early participants.  Observation 1: Objectives should be appropriately selected and clearly stated.  Observation 3: A bottom-up approach enhances participants’ ownership and engagement  Observation 4: Preliminary feasibility assessment of the expected outcomes can improve the  effectiveness of the strategy selected to reach them  Observation 8: Addressed topics should be selected among those related to protection of Critical  Information Infrastructures  3.2 Leadership approach  According to the literature overview, the leadership approach is one of the most relevant criticalities  in each PPP experience.  In the specific case of EP3R, the lack of the evidence in influencing and in having a direct role in the  regulatory and policy environment of the European institutions was perceived as a major obstacle to  achieve any reasonable impact and a “Lack of authority and ability to enforce the outcome in local  environment”.  In other words, the management approach based on the definition of objectives by the public actors  and on their achievement relying on cooperation activities among (private) stakeholders, was  perceived as a potential limitation for the impact of the EP3R activities at policy and regulatory level.  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 17  Observation 5: Management with defined roles enhances responsibility and commitment  Observation 6: Action sharing can be preferable to information sharing under certain circumstances  Observation 11: Leadership approach should be based on coordination among public and private  stakeholders  3.3 Effort for the involved stakeholders  The effort requested to each EP3R participant was based on their time and active commitment in the  activities mainly during the meetings (both virtual and in presence) and in contributing to shared  documents. The perceived lack of potential impact of EP3R affected participation and started a high  membership turnover. This prevented the creation of stable personal networks and led most of the  respondents to declare that the initiative was not valuable from the economic point of view.  Observation 12: Funding strategy should provision for participants’ time and effort investment.  3.4 Costs for the involved stakeholders  Participation to EP3R activities led to direct costs (i.e. travel costs to attend the meeting in presence).  Cost-opportunities (i.e. time of the human resources working for a company invested in contributing  to the EP3R debate) were based on resources of the involved stakeholders. A general perception  among participants was that funds available to sustain direct costs may have had a positive impact on  the number of participants and their commitment.  Observation 12: Funding strategy should provision for participants’ time and effort investment  3.5 Geographical scope  To the question about the appropriate geographical scope for a cooperative initiative such as the  EP3R, none of the respondents has reported a geographical perspective different from the regional  one.  There is much needed attention to be paid to coordinate efforts at regional level in order to reach in  Europe economies of scale results in security and resilience comparable to those obtained in the most  advanced countries (i.e. the USA, Japan).  On the other side, respondents mentioned also that an effective coordination of national initiatives  could have a greater and more concrete impact than one at regional level. In this perspective, one of  the participants to the interviews suggested that “a multiple approach, combining national PPPs with  a regional/multinational coordination initiatives would be desirable”.  Observation 7: Regulatory provisions should be established at regional level  Observation 9: Geographical scope should reach regional coverage involving all the EU28 Member  States  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 18  3.6 Interaction model  The interaction model proposed for the EP3R initiative was based on both in presence and virtual  meetings.  The general aim of such interaction was to identify a trade-off between the need of building stable  personal networks and trust among stakeholders and the intention of containing effort in time and  direct costs of participants. Answers provided by respondents revealed that the relevance of face to  face meetings in building a trust environment was underestimated. Respondents generally requested  as a need more frequent in presence meetings, although in 2012 EP3R hosted 4 meetings (3 combined  plenary/TF meetings) and in 2013 participants kicked off face to face in Task Force meetings.  Observation 10: Interaction model should necessarily include regular meetings in presence  3.7 Type of involved stakeholders  The EP3R experience was limited to public and private stakeholders of the Telecom and Information  Technology sectors operating in Europe.  Nevertheless a significant number of respondents mentioned a lack of presence of the larger players  from the private sector. This fact had in turn a negative impact on the attractiveness of the initiative  also for small and medium stakeholders.  Among the respondents to the questionnaire, Figure 12 shows participation in different types of PPP  initiatives including EP3R. 65% of the respondents were involved in some forms of PPPs in the last 5  years. Almost all of them participated in cooperation initiatives focused on information and  communications security and resilience but less than half of them experienced the EP3R.  Figure 12 – Involvement in different types of PPPs of the respondents to the questionnaire  This result provides indications on the involvement of the same stakeholders in initiatives similar to  the EP3R which were organised at national level. It reveals existing engagements in cross-sectors  23%  57%  65%  77%  43%  35%  Has your organisation been involved in any EP3R activity ?

No  Yes  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 19  cooperation activities. For this reason, in order to increase participation and commitment, it seems  more appropriate to better specify objectives and expected outcomes rather than to enlarge the set  of types of stakeholders that can be involved.  Observation 2: Ownership of the underlying project is a fundamental driver of the participants’  commitment  3.8 Profile of participants of the involved stakeholders  The EP3R involved by invitation stakeholders of the Telecom and Information Technology sectors but  participants were directly appointed by the involved organisations.  Suggested profiles of participants were high profile professionals such as ICT Manager, Security  Managers, Information Security Managers, Chief Security Officers, and Chief Information Security  Officers, directors/chiefs/responsible of the Security Department/Area and  directors/chiefs/responsible of the ICT Department/Area of the involved stakeholders. The appointed  representatives were asked to take part in the Working Groups (in the first EP3R period) or in Task  Forces (in the second EP3R period) activities. The open and inclusive nature of EP3R allowed several  members of each stakeholders to participate in different Working Groups or Task Forces. Some  participants to the interviews stressed that in the cases in which more than one person was involved  in the EP3R activities there was a loss of the knowledge in the working team in case of alternance of  the persons and an additional lack of trust in case of frequent change of the representative. As a final  result, contribution of stakeholders and consequent commitment was partially fragmented and  dispersed.  Observation 14: Participants’ profile should include both public sector decision makers and private  sector high level security managers  3.9 Expected outcome  Respondents to the questionnaire felt that the objectives selected within EP3R were initially not  aligned with the needs of private sector stakeholders. The three initial investigation areas defined in  the Terms of Reference of EP3R were set-up in June 2010 during the EP3R plenary meeting.  Later, participants’ turnover led to a partial disconnection between those initial goals and  requirements of new participants to the EP3R activities. This observation was shared among  participants and, in February 2012, an entire EP3R plenary meeting was again organised to re-open  the discussion around the Terms of Reference. Discussions were held and the development of a new,  specific and detailed Work Programme was approved, leading in December 2012 to the publication of  a series of Position Papers.  In any case, all participants reported that EP3R was lacking a way to enforce the desired outcomes in  a way or another. Several respondents mentioned that the lack of knowledge of the regulatory  environment at national level affected the understanding of the potential barriers and, ultimately, the  provision of effective recommendations.  Observation 1: Objectives should be appropriately selected and clearly stated.  Observation 6: Action sharing can be preferable to information sharing under certain circumstances  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 20  Observation 7: Regulatory provisions should be established at regional level  Observation 13: The most desirable outcome would be the delivery of technical/organizational  solutions  3.10 Inclusion rule  The involvement of participants was based both on individual invitation to targeted operators and on  open expression of interest of stakeholders belonging to the selected types.  Such inclusion mechanism had an adverse effect: the EP3R appeared as informally established. This  affected the commitment of the stakeholders resulting in a lack of a stable group of participants. This  observation was already made in 2011; new rules were adopted to mitigate this negative effect with  the creation of the Task Forces. The process took time to become really visible and EP3R activities  were closed before reaching the desired results.  Observation 15: Involved stakeholders should be organizations with specific predefined  characteristics and approved by a relevant part of the PPP participants  3.11 Participation rule  Participation in EP3R relied on voluntary commitment with no formal obligations for participants to  effectively contribute to the proposed activities proposed. As considered a weakness point, most of  the respondents proposed several ideas to address this point:  - The establishment of a guarantee system to improve commitment and trust among  participants (see Annex C);  - The obligation of participants to agree on a detailed commitment, in particular related to the  confidentiality of the shared information.  - The definition of an access rule based on the proof of an actual, effective and active  participation  In light of the 2012 structural change of the EP3R, commitment was expected to continue. The actual  behaviour seemed to be slightly different: as already shown in Figure 9, half of EP3R participants took  part in more than one Working Group. This created an organisational issue: since working sessions in  presence were held in parallel, these participants took part in the end to the group which was the  most interesting for them. No indications were provided on the reason of their choice and if it was a  behaviour led by the topic discussed in a specific meeting or by other factors. In any case the effect  was negative on the creation of a shared trusted environment and on the achievement of the expected  outcomes themselves. Also according to other respondents’ experiences in cooperation initiatives,  trust was pointed out by all respondents as the fundamental requirement on which to build up fruitful  interactions.  Observation 16: Participation rule should be based on formal membership and subordinate to active  involvement in the working groups  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 21  4 Observations  The aims and the relevance of the EP3R experience is appropriately understood and effectively  reported in the answers of the questionnaire and in the participants’ interviews. The initiative was  terminated as organisational features started to maximise the expected outcomes of the interactions  among the participants of the public and private sectors.  Along the years, EP3R has changed its configuration both in terms of internal organisation and  participants’ involvement: in these evolutions, participants were contingently asked to declare their  willingness to participate in cooperation activities and to take decisions on which activity to support.  As the participation was set on voluntary basis and on individuals’ time investment, the EP3R key  governance features should be considered correct from the theoretical point of view.  The presented results should not discourage from establishing later new PPP approaches but rather  encourage refinements and improvements.  In particular, the overview of an existing PPP allows the identification of considerations for an effective  PPP and in particular:  1. The public-private partnership model is strongly exploited among different sectors for its  added value in relational capital and for its contribution in information sharing;  2. Effective public-private partnerships are based on trust building which can be achieved by  establishing guarantee systems or by creating participants’ consolidated relations;  3. Sharing of objectives and expected outcomes among the involved stakeholders helps to build  a working community able to face the emerging challenges in an integrated manner.  Accordingly, the assessment of EP3R initiative leads to the following general remarks:  1. The application of a wide-scope PPP model for the EP3R experience was the first valuable  attempt to involve relevant stakeholders belonging to the Telecom and information  Technology sectors on the issue of Network and Information security and resilience.  2. Creation of thematic Working Groups, in the first period, and Tasks Forces, in the second  period, aimed at  building restricted groups in order to give to opportunity to focus on topics  of interest and to enhance trust building among participants  3. Perception of participants of the EP3R and its expected outcomes was far from the original  intentions; the main weakness points of the initiative were the lack of well-defined  participation rules, the soft leadership approach, the limited interaction opportunities and the  unclear definition of expected concrete outcomes.  This results encourages future PPP implementations which could refine the model through an ad-hoc  tailoring of its key features.  Respondents provided in addition to the structured answers several additional comments that  composed a set of observations. The following table synthesises the most relevant and important  ones, i.e. those which should be considered in the creation of future initiatives.  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 22  1.Objectives should  be appropriately  selected and clearly  stated  Both literature review and telephone  interviews confirmed the relevance  of clear set of well specified and  properly selected objectives.  Participants are more motivated to  invest their time and effort if the goal  to be achieved is concrete and in light  with their needs.  Advantages  Enhancement of participants’  commitment  Concrete and achievable  outputs  Pitfalls  Fragmentation of the general  objective in multiple and too  specific goals with problems to  rebuild a general framework  2. Ownership of the  underlying project is  a fundamental driver  of the participants’  commitment  The degree of commitment of  participants is strictly related to the  perception of the ownership of the  underlying project; a proper selection  and sharing of the outcomes to be  achieved and the output to be  produced can avoid any lack of  commitment from participants.  Advantages  Stronger  participants’  commitment  Pitfalls  Potential difficulties in conciliating  public and private interests in a  unique shared and common  project  3. A bottom-up  approach enhances  participants’  ownership and  engagement  The involvement of participants in  the selection of objectives and  expected outcomes is a crucial factor  for the success of a PPP, guaranteeing  participation and commitment.  Advantages  Enhance participants’ commitment  Pitfalls  More complexity in the decision  making process  4. Preliminary  feasibility assessment  of the expected  outcomes can  improve the  effectiveness of the  strategy selected to  reach them  A preliminary feasibility assessment  analysis can improve PPP  effectiveness by defining whether the  proposed approach can provide  added value, and by identifying the  most convenient specifications of the  identified key features.  Advantages  More effective selection of the  specification of the PPP key  features  Improvement of resources  allocation  Pitfalls  Additional time and effort costs  5. Management with  defined roles  enhances  responsibility and  commitment  Management with defined roles can  enhance the responsibility  perception among participants,  making clear to whom they are liable  to. In addition PPP activities should  be led by participants of recognised  professional reputation. This directly  and indirectly affects participants’  responsibility and commitment.  Advantages  Enhanced responsibility perception  Pitfalls  Dependency paths respect to the  selected leaders  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 23  6. Action sharing is  preferable to  information sharing  under certain  circumstances  Where objectives and purposes are  clearly set up, action sharing may be  preferable to information sharing.  This approach could be considered of  high value for security and resilience  issues related recovery and crisis  management.  Advantages  Lower risk of sensible information  loss perceived by participants  Concrete result achievement  Pitfalls  Immediate response instead of  consolidated interactions  Mainly based on bilateral  agreements  7. Regulatory  provisions should be  established at  regional level  The lack of regulatory homogeneity  among the EU28 Member States is a  systemic weakness and a cost for  private actors in terms of adaptive  efforts. The standardization of  regulatory requirements related to  Network and Information security  and resilience would enhance  regional interactions.  Advantages  Regional security and resilience  enhancement  Pitfalls  Initial relevant  adaptive costs for a  regulatory framework different  from the national one  8. Addressed topics  should be selected  among those related  to protection of  Critical Information  Infrastructures  The major issue at stake is Critical  Information Infrastructures  Protection. After the identification  about potential risks affecting CIIs, a  coordination strategy among the  public and private players seems to  be the most appropriate approach  also to raise awareness on the topics  of interest.  Advantages  Improvement of protection of  infrastructural assets and services  provided through CIIs  Pitfalls  Objective achievable only on long  term perspective and active  involvement of many actors  managing/ owning CIIs  9. Geographical scope  should reach regional  coverage involving all  the EU28 Member  States  The interdependent framework of  reference for the Network and  Information security and resilience  needs a more integrated and regional  approach in order to effectively  address emerging challenges. The  regional scope is considered the most  appropriate one even though  important difficultness should be  faced to translate national  experiences in a European initiative.  Advantages  European preparedness  enhancement  More effective response to security  threats and to resilience challenges  Pitfalls  Additional management effort  Issues in facing heterogeneity in  the national  contexts  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 24  10. Interaction model  should necessarily  include regular  meetings in presence  Meetings in presence are the best  option to improve trust and to  consolidate commitment among  participants.  Advantages  Trust improvement  Commitment consolidation  Pitfalls  High direct costs for participants  11. Leadership  approach should be  based on  coordination among  public and private  stakeholders  Within coordination among public  and private stakeholders, leadership  of public actors would be preferable.  Management roles covered by  professionals with recognised  reputation may improve participants’  commitment and responsibility.  Advantages  Improvement of commitment and  responsibility  Effective impact of the cooperation  initiative on policy/regulatory  decision makers  Pitfalls  Potential misalignment of the  public actors requirements with  the private actors needs  12. Funding strategy  should provision for  participants’ time and  effort investment  Participants’ time and effort seem to  be the most pragmatic solution also  by maintaining low the cost of  interaction and by guaranteeing  participation of stakeholders really  interested in the foreseen  cooperation activities.  Advantages  Low cost PPP initiatives  Pitfalls  Dependency of the cooperation  effort from  commitment of the  involved stakeholders and their  possibility to sustain direct and  indirect costs  13. The most  desirable outcome  would be the delivery  of technical/  organizational  solutions  Among the most desirable concrete  outcomes technical or organisational  solutions in terms of security and  resilience were identified. Action  sharing can be a preferable option  especially when sensible information  sharing is needed. A specific  operative outcome is preferred to a  general theoretical one.  Advantages  Tangible operative outcomes and  solutions  Pitfalls  Difficulties to achieve general  objectives  14. Participants’  profile should include  both public sector  decision makers and  private sector high  level security  managers  High-profile professionals in the  security and resilience domain should  be involved. Their decision making  position in the organisation to which  they belong to allow them to take  pro-active behaviours in the PPP.  Advantages  High probability to obtain concrete  outcomes and strong commitment  of the stakeholders  Pitfalls  Limited availability of effort out of  the organisation to which they  belong to  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 25  15. Involved  stakeholders should  be organizations with  specific predefined  characteristics and  approved by a  relevant part of the  PPP participants  Inclusion should be based on  participants’ approval and should be  open strictly to the stakeholders of  the identified sectors. Homogeneity  of stakeholders’ profiles helps to  focus on common issues in which all  participants have high interest to  face.  Advantages  Focus on common issues of  interest  Pitfalls  Limited number of participants  16. Participation rule  should be based on  formal membership  and subordinate to  active involvement in  the working groups  Participation based on a formal  membership and on proof of active  contribution help to avoid to involve  participant not interested to  contribute but mainly to benefit from  the activities in the PPP (i.e.  information sharing).  Advantages  Improvement of the commitment  of participants  Perception of the possibility to  achieve concrete outcomes  Pitfalls  Higher management effort  Figure 13 - Observations and lessons learnt for future initiatives  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 26  5 Recommendations for future initiatives  The key recommendations for the future pertain for four main areas:  - Implement agile PPPs which can adapt to new needs and topics;  - Incentivise Industry initiatives;  - Define simple but formal rules and governance;  - Publish and advertise successful results.  Use Agile PPPs  While the global constituency of the EP3R was large (more than 250 registered participants), the most  attractive aspect rapidly became the constitution of smaller groups of active participants (i.e. the  Working Groups). For this reason, while keeping bi-annual plenary meetings (mostly for the review  and acceptance of the produced work), experts participated to the actual works of the Working  Groups and then Task Forces on a more regular basis creating a trusted relationships among the group  participants.  The US and UK examples also support this model: such a PPP is most likely successful when it is  composed of several hives which can host and bear several different topics, but with similar methods.  Only then the cost effectiveness reaches its optimum.  The successors of EP3R in the security and resilience domain should take the form of a platform where  ISACs, Working Groups and Task Forces can be created very rapidly when the need arises and have a  short lifespan. Their scope should be focused and limited, and they should be assigned one clear  objective to reach. Such a platform could be co-chaired by European Officials and by major industry  players.  Incentivise participation in PPPs at industry level  While the bottom-up approach should be used to trigger activities in a PPP platform, the lack of  support of industry players could be a major barrier to a generalisation of this practice.  The engagement must be twofold:  - Initiatives can arise bottom-up, or top-down, or both;  - Financial and Human Resources support needs to be approved and engaged.  A formal partnership needs to be agreed and established by relevant European Officials and major  industry players on the base of a future commitment and a concrete activity plan.  Adopt formal PPPs rules and governance  A proper leadership team should be appointed to manage the PPP and to set-up basic rules that will  allow participants to understand the objective, the expected outcomes and how contribute to them.  Participants themselves need to understand the key features of the PPP16. In addition, the empirical  observation of the governance model of successful PPPs in the world allowed to design a typical PPP  skeleton.  Future PPP platform should adopt and document its governance model based on a structure similar  to the proposed one based on PPP key features.  16. This approach was already published in December 2011 on the ENISA Good Practice Guide on Cooperative  Models for Effective PPPs (http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/public-private- partnership/national-public-private-partnerships-ppps/good-practice-guide-on-cooperatve-models-for- effective-ppps)  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 27  Advertise successful initiatives  Larger geographical coverage, engagement of the right participants to take part in such a future  platform would require the increase of the attractiveness of its results. This means that the initiative  and the impact achieved should be properly advertised and publicised.  This requires the implementation of two preliminary activities:  - An Impact Assessment of any activity carried out within the Platform, i.e. the assurance that  the recommendations or reports issued were followed by effects and real-life  implementations;  - A surveying mechanism evaluating trend of satisfaction of participants and reputation out of  the platform.  Initiatives conducted within such platforms need to be properly evaluated, and the effects should be  assessed on a yearly basis to ensure that the time invested by participants achieved a positive impact.  EP3R 2010-2013  Four Years of Pan-European Public Private Cooperation  FINAL, 1.0, November 2014  Page 28  Annex A:  An insight on overseas CIIP approach: the National Council of ISACs  and the Framework to Reduce Cyber Risks to Critical Infrastructure.  Security of critical infrastructures has traditionally be an issue of main concern not only for the US  government but also for national private operators.  The National Council of ISACs (Information Sharing and Analysis Centres) is a volunteer group of ISACs  representatives who meet monthly since 2003. Their objective is to develop trusted relationships among  sectors and address common issues and concerns. The ISACs are trusted entities established by Critical  Infrastructure owners and operators, whose original primary business was to provide comprehensive  sector analysis to be shared among relevant stakeholders, including government. Services provided by  ISACs include risk mitigation, incident response, alert and information sharing. The mission of the National  Council of ISACs, “is to advance physical and cyber security of critical infrastructures of North America by  establishing and maintaining a framework for valuable interaction”.  In light of this purposes, the National Council of ISACs works for the realization of drills and exercises, real- time sector threat level reporting and emergency classified briefing. Furthermore, during incidents of  national significance, the Council hosts a private sector liaison at the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) in the National Infrastructure Coordinating Centre (NICC).  Among the initiatives sponsored by the National Council of ISACs it is worth to point out the case of NICCIC  (National Cyber security and Communication Integration Centre) whose mission is to address threats and  incidents affecting the Nation’s critical information technology and cyber infrastructures. The initiative  concerns the Level-Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI). NICCIC operates at steady  state (by promoting information sharing and data and situational awareness of its participants), during  incident response phase (e.g. joint incident management) and in de-escalation phase (decision-makers  support).  Furthermore, in July 2013 the U.S. Commerce Department’s National Institute of Standards and Technology  (NIST) released its draft outline on Preliminary Framework to Reduce Cyber Risks to Critical Infrastructures.  The objective addressed is to kick-off the establishment process of a voluntarily-based Cyber Security  Public-Private Framework which will involve “a broad mix of companies, not-for-profit organizations, and  government agencies across different sectors”. As stated in the document, the Partnership, besides being  lead and coordinated by the NIST department, will rely on “private sector inputs”. Issues have been  identified as of primary concern for the Framework attention, i.e. the “lack of standards, guidelines, and  practices to address privacy and civil liberties issues, as well as the scarcity of helpful metrics for an  organization’s cyber security effectiveness”. The general aim is to set up an adaptable, complete and  consistent interaction scheme able to deal with cyber security risks, innovation, emerging challenging and  awareness raising. Finally, the interaction strategy will be based on participants’ “response to public  notices, discussion at workshops […] direct communication and comments on […] documents”.

Consolidation of the relationships  • A guarantee system setting up basic rules of unishment of passive and unfair behaviours of participants is essential to set-up a collaborative interaction. All participants to the cooperation activities should subscribe it.  •An ex novo gurantee system should be set-up accordingly to the main features of the collaborative mechanism. A guarantee system can help to overpass initial mistrust among participants improving mutual agreement and commitment.  • Application methods of basic rules of the guarantee system should be defined and integrated in the governance of cooperation initiative. Management should be in charge of applying punischments.

    "abstract": "The EP3R (European Public-Private Partnership for Resilience) was established in 2009 and was the very first attempt at Pan-European level to use a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) to address cross-border Security and Resilience concerns in the Telecom Sector. The EP3R participants initiated many discussions, saw a lot of commitment, and produced interesting conclusions. It also revealed some further needs in the security and resilient field and also some gaps to be filled in order to reach a higher maturity level of the Telecom Sector. The EP3R closed down in April 2013, after 4 years of existence and practically 3 years of operations. The impact of the very first European Public -Private Partnership for Resilience had to be assessed and lessons had to be drawn for future similar initiatives and other funded actions for improving European resilience."

By looking into the problem, ENISA identified Europe’s need  for a comprehensive approach to define a set of cybersecurity roles and skills that could be  leveraged to reduce the shortage and the skills gap. ENISA has worked on the development of  such a framework and presents the European Cybersecurity Skills Framework (ECSF),  which is intended to strengthen European cybersecurity culture by providing a common  European language across communities, taking an essential step forward towards Europe’s  digital future.  The ECSF provides a practical tool to support the identification and articulation of tasks,  competences, skills and knowledge associated with the roles of European cybersecurity  professionals. The main purpose of the framework is to create a common understanding  between individuals, employers and providers of learning programmes across EU Member  States, making it a valuable tool to bridge the gap between the cybersecurity professional  workplace and learning environments.  The framework describes the most important requirements of a professional cybersecurity  workplace by defining a set of 12 typical cybersecurity professional role profiles. These  profiles provide a common understanding of the main cybersecurity missions, tasks and skills  needed in a professional cybersecurity context, making it the perfect reference for profiling skills  and knowledge needed by cybersecurity professionals. The framework was designed to be  easily understood and comprehensive enough to provide appropriate in-depth cybersecurity  insights as well as flexible enough to allow customisation based on each user’s needs. By  incorporating all stakeholder perspectives, the framework is applicable to all types of  organisations and supports the development of all cybersecurity professions.  The ECSF is the result of work conducted by ENISA’s Ad-Hoc Working Group on the European  Cybersecurity Skills Framework1 formed by experts representing various views. The developed  framework is based on an analysis of existing frameworks, the results and findings from  research on market needs and agreement among experts. User case studies and indicative  examples, inspired by various workplace and learning environments, demonstrate the practical  implementation of this framework and support this work.  The main benefits of using the ECSF were found to be:  • ensuring a common terminology and shared understanding regarding cybersecurity  professionals across the EU;  • identifying the critical skills-set required from the perspective of the cybersecurity  workforce to support its further development and enhancement;  • promoting harmonisation in cybersecurity education, training and workforce  development programmes.  This ECSF User Manual provides a comprehensive overview of the ECSF’s main scope,  framework principles and application opportunities. The primary purpose of the manual is to  make the ECSF easily accessible by, understandable for, and usable by all stakeholders with  an active role or a need for appropriately skilled cybersecurity professionals.  1 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity-education/european-cybersecurity-skills-framework/adhoc_wg_calls  The European  Cybersecurity  Skills  Framework  (ECSF) is  intended to  strengthen  European  cybersecurity  culture by  providing a  common  European  language across  communities,  taking an  essential step  forward towards  Europe’s digital  future.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity-education/european-cybersecurity-skills-framework/adhoc_wg_calls  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  6  1. INTRODUCTION  The shortage of cybersecurity skills is one of the key challenges that needs to be addressed for  a cyber secure European Union. More specifically, there is a lack of skilled and qualified  personnel in the labour market to take on roles in cybersecurity and who can sufficiently  address the evolving cyber threats and the emerging cybersecurity challenges. The gap in  cybersecurity skills has a number of underlying drivers. These include an insufficient level of  understanding of the competences and skills needed in the cybersecurity discipline between  different actors in the market for cybersecurity skills. Over the years, this has become a well-  documented problem2, which continues to significantly affect countries at European and  international level.  In order to reduce the current and the future skills gap and shortage, more cybersecurity  professionals with appropriate skill sets are needed. To this end, the European Skills Agenda3,  the Digital Education Action Plan4, and the Pact for Skills5 remain important vehicles for  mobilising stakeholders to work together towards the goals of the Digital Decade6 by creating  more and better opportunities for training.  In this context, ENISA launched an Ad Hoc Working Group on the European Cybersecurity  Skills Framework7 in December 2020. A multi-disciplinary group of experts was brought together  with the aim of promoting harmonisation of cybersecurity education, training and workforce  development concepts. The developed framework (ECSF) provides an open European tool to  build a common understanding of the cybersecurity professional role profiles and common  mappings with the appropriate skills and competences required. This work provides the basis  for joining forces in a capacity building programme for the European cybersecurity workforce in  accordance with ongoing market demand.  1.1 TARGET AUDIENCE  Whilst the ultimate scope of the content of the ECSF framework is cybersecurity core  professionals, a particular emphasis is also placed on the ECSF target groups of non-  cybersecurity experts who need a comprehensive view of the discipline. This focus makes the  framework easy to understand for all stakeholders concerned.  The target audience for the ECSF is organisations’ leadership teams, human resources (HR)  and cybersecurity functions, cybersecurity professionals, newcomers and cyber enthusiasts, as  well as providers of learning programmes of all types in the public and private context, sector  associations, market researchers, and policy makers.  1.2 STRUCTURE OF THE MANUAL  The user manual is structured as follows:  • Chapter 1 introduces the key challenges that highlight the need to create a framework  for cybersecurity skills as well as the target audience for this work;  • Chapter 2 presents the ECSF design principles as well as the key benefits for using it;  2 ENISA, 2020, Cybersecurity Skills Development in the EU https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/the-status-of-cyber- security-education-in-the-european-union  3 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1196  4 https://education.ec.europa.eu/focus-topics/digital-education/action-plan  5 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_1197  6 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/node/157  7 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity-education/european-cybersecurity-skills-framework/adhoc_wg_calls  The ECSF  provides an  open European  tool to build a  common  understanding of  the  cybersecurity  professional role  profiles and  common  mappings with  the appropriate  skills and  competences  required.

Additionally, the document includes two (2) Annexes that support the ECSF user manual and its  objectives:  • Annex A connects the ECSF to other EU standards and frameworks.  The objective of this Annex is to connect the ECSF with existing recognised European  standards and frameworks that are relevant to this work.  • Annex B lists Use Cases of the ECSF.  The objective of this Annex is to provide real case scenarios to showcase the practical  implementation of this framework.  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  8  2. UNDERSTANDING THE  ECSF  The ECSF is comprised of a representative set of 12 role profiles for cybersecurity  professionals (presented in Figure 1) that are typically required and applied within  organisations deploying cybersecurity professionals. Each profile is defined by a common  template that incorporates key set criteria (i.e. title, alternative titles, summary statement,  mission, main tasks, key skills, key knowledge, e-Competences). The content of each criterion  is tailored to each role but is subject to possible adaption to enable flexible implementation to  meet specific situations and requirements.  Figure 1: The ECSF’s 12 Role Profiles for Cybersecurity Professionals  The 12 role profiles for cybersecurity professionals are provided in an EU-agreed, practice-  driven format dedicated to the cybersecurity professional domain. The profiles are easily  understood and offer alternative entry points according to context, perspective and need.  Through these profiles, the ECSF can be used as a common reference and communication tool  that can be applied across different organisations and countries for a common mutual internal  and external understanding.  The structure of each role profile is outlined in Table 1 below.  The ECSF  introduces a  representative  set of 12 role  profiles for  cybersecurity  professionals  (typically  required and  applied within  organisations) in  an EU-agreed,  practice-driven  format dedicated  to the  cybersecurity  professional  domain.  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  9  Table 1: The components of each ECSF role profile  Profile title The name of the Professional Role Profile  Alternative title(s) Lists typical alternative titles under the same profile.

As presented on Table 1, the profile for each role is populated by a set of descriptive items  designed to provide a snapshot of the role in terms of its description, tasks and competences.  Titles and typical alternative titles can be used as a quick reference to guide ECSF users to the  most appropriate role profiles for their application.  Components of the role profiles can be altered to better cover the stakeholder’s needs, and  role profiles (from the ECSF and other frameworks) can be mixed together for the same  reason. More information on applying the ECSF is given on Chapter 3.  Soft skills (also called transversal, transferrable or behavioural skills) are components that are  necessary in any professional skill set; thus, such skills are also needed for professionals in the  cybersecurity domain. A wide range of skills fall under soft skills such as the abilities to  communicate, collaborate with others, report, influence, think critically, and manage time and  stress. Key soft skills are incorporated in the key skills component.  For instance, the role profile for a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) includes as key  skills the abilities to influence, lead, communicate, cooperate and collaborate. All of these are  essential skills if a CISO is to achieve her or his missions and tasks. Based on a stakeholder’s  needs, more soft skills might be added to the profile for a CISO or a mapping with a soft skill  framework may be done.  Ethics is also an important cross-cutting element that impacts all the aspects of cybersecurity  and is therefore an essential skill component within the European Cybersecurity Skills  Framework (ECSF). In the context of cybersecurity, ethics is about what decisions are aligned  with our values and what is morally acceptable for both the data owner and the organisation. As  cybersecurity professionals could gain privileged access to various types of information, even  sensitive information, ethical awareness is an important value they should have. Apart from that,  ethical decision-making is an important skill that cybersecurity professionals should have as  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  10  their decisions affect other individuals. As in the case of soft skills, the ECSF explicitly analysed  whether the ethical side of the sector is aligned with European values and ethics.  A more detailed analysis of the soft and ethical skills might be done by the interested party  since the framework is flexible and adaptable.  2.1 THE ECSF DESIGN PRINCIPLES  The European Cybersecurity Skills Framework is based on a number of principles designed to  cover stakeholder needs. This offers easy understanding, adoption and application of the  framework whilst maintaining relevance and impact in the short and longer-term.  Figure 2: The ECSF’s design principles  2.1.1 Simple yet Comprehensive  The framework is designed to be suitably general to ensure that it may be easily understood  and applied by a wider audience. At the same time, it includes sufficient detail to provide in-  depth cybersecurity insights. These attributes facilitate use of the framework across a broad  spectrum of activities and environments and by stakeholders from a variety of backgrounds (e.g.  organisations of different sizes, technical expertise of varying intensity and business sectors  with different core activities).  This has been achieved by applying the appropriate level of detail to the content of the ECSF  that is not too specific nor too abstract. Offering 12 profiles, the ECSF covers a broad spectrum  of diverse work activities but maintains an easy-to-use format.  2.1.2 Flexible and Scalable  By adopting a modular approach and a flexible structure the framework enables each  component to be extendable or used independently. These characteristics support further  extension of the ECSF and/or linkage to other frameworks to expand its applications.  Applying this flexibility, the profiles and their components, as defined by the ECSF, can be  applied on a module-by-module basis allowing each to be adapted to meet specific needs. This  flexibility ensures the relevance of the framework over the years and will also allow simple  updates to the framework in the future.  2.1.3 Open and Impartial  The framework has been developed with input from a large and diverse working group of  professional cybersecurity experts. In order to develop an impartial framework, ENISA  established this group from a variety of experts from various backgrounds. By involving experts  with different backgrounds, the development process of the framework followed a multi-  perspective approach eliminating any bias towards specific areas of interest. Furthermore, as an  ENISA publication, the framework is publicly available, accessible and open.  The ECSF is  based on  principles  designed to  cover  stakeholder  needs, offering  easy  understanding,  adoption and  application  whilst  maintaining  relevance and  impact in the  short and  longer-term.  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  11  The ECSF profiles and components have been developed based upon a multi-stakeholder  perspective with a focus not only upon the viewpoint of employment in cybersecurity but also  from the perspective of providers of learning programmes. Furthermore, the veracity of the  framework has been enhanced by engagement and reviews from a variety of additional  stakeholders.  2.1.4 European  Driven by the requirement to minimise gaps in cybersecurity skills and shortages in the  workforce across Europe, the ECSF needed to be compliant with specific European  requirements, to enable easy adoption and use by European organisations. This direction was  informed by complying with existing European standards and frameworks.  The ECSF connects well with the current European ICT professional landscape to ensure easy  take-up and broad recognition. The ECSF takes the best benefit from existing experiences and  structures and provides consistent links with relevant EU ICT professional standards and  frameworks. The profiles defined by the framework are designed to be compliant and  complementary to European laws and regulations and to enhance approaches to European  ethics as identified in the European marketplace. The ECSF takes into consideration the  requirements for the protection of data and privacy set by European regulations, common job  roles requested by the European market, and European standards and frameworks used in the  ICT sector.  2.2 THE MAIN BENEFITS PROVIDED BY THE ECSF  The ECSF is an easy to use yet comprehensive tool. It is based upon recent market studies, the  collaboration of cybersecurity experts and an analysis of the broader cybersecurity and ICT  frameworks landscape. It thus expresses the relevant needs of the European market. It is  comprised of 12 typical professional roles in cybersecurity, with a related summary statement,  mission, observable outcomes (deliverables), tasks, competences, skills, knowledge and  proficiency levels, as required and applied in the context of work in Europe, to be understood  and used across Europe.  The ECSF provides an unambiguous reference to identify and reduce current and future  cybersecurity skills shortages and gaps. It is generic but at the same time sufficiently granular to  give the EU market a clear taxonomy of skills, competences and occupations in the  cybersecurity workforce. Furthermore, it may be easily connected with other existing structures  and frameworks in associated fields.  Using the ECSF as a common European language for professional cybersecurity roles, skills,  knowledge, and competences offers many benefits some of which are listed below.  1. Using the ECSF ensures a common terminology and shared understanding between  cybersecurity professional demand (workplace, recruitment) and supply (qualification,  training, assessment and recognition) across the EU.  2. The ECSF supports the identification of critical skill set requirements from the  perspective of the workforce. It enables providers of learning programmes to support  the development of critical skills and policy makers to support targeted initiatives to  mitigate identified gaps in skills.  3. The ECSF helps in understanding professional cybersecurity roles and the required  essential skills, and relevant legislation. In particular, non-experts and HR departments  are able to better understand requirements for cybersecurity resource planning,  recruitment and career planning.  4. The ECSF promotes harmonisation in cybersecurity education, training, and workforce  development. Additionally, the use of a common European language in cybersecurity  skills and roles relates directly to the entire ICT professional domain.  The ECSF  provides an  unambiguous  reference to  identify and  reduce current  and future  cybersecurity  skills shortages  and gaps.  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  12  5. The ECSF contributes to achieving better resilience to cyber-attacks and to ensuring  secure ICT systems across society. It provides a standard structure and gives advice  on how to enforce capacity building in the European cybersecurity workforce.  The ECSF provides additional benefits based on the type of stakeholder. An example of the  main stakeholders and key associated main benefits is shown in 3.  Figure 3: An example of the main ECSF beneficiaries expressing the need of a common Risk  Manager definition  A detailed list of potential applications and benefits in using the ECSF based on stakeholders is  shown in Table 2.

APPLICATIONS OF THE  ECSF  This chapter demonstrates how the European Cybersecurity Skills Framework (ECSF) can be  applied in a modular and flexible way based on the needs of different stakeholders.  Specific use and practical application depend on many factors such as the market perspective,  organisation size, the context of a particular performance and overall purpose.  The 12 role profiles for cybersecurity professionals defined by the ECSF are a flexible tool and a  standard European reference for customised use in a particular context.  The following general five-step guide provides basic orientation:  Figure 4: A modular five-step guide to apply the ECSF  1. Analyse the situation of the target environment.  Collect and process the appropriate information needed about the cybersecurity related  condition of the target environment (e.g. an organisation) to create a baseline. Identify  the parties involved and the goal to be achieved.  2. Identify specific objectives to be achieved.  Look into the status of the target environment and identify any specific cybersecurity-  related requirements to be covered or any objective to be achieved by the targeted  environment. Depending on the situation, it may be possible to use the ECSF as a  taxonomy to identify the objectives in question.  3. Select the appropriate components of the ECSF.  Review the ECSF profiles and select profiles that are relevant to a particular situation.  Then select the components that assist in covering the needs or achieving the required  objectives of the targeted environment.  4. Adapt the selected components according to your needs.  Make appropriate changes on selected components to better fit a particular situation  and/or targeted environment.

The framework thus provides a  valuable guide and roadmap not only for building, expanding and running cybersecurity  related functions within an organisation but also for ensuring its cybersecurity related  mission, vision and goals are met. Thus, an organisation can use the ECSF as a starting  point or guide to quickly and easily access the primary roles needed to manage their  cybersecurity risks and build up their cybersecurity approach. At the same time, the ECSF  profiles provide a common understanding among the parties involved regarding an  organisation’s cybersecurity roles.  Three indicative examples, which are presented later in this chapter, aim to showcase the  practical implementation of the framework in the:  I. enhancement of the cybersecurity practices of a small company;  II. recruitment process of a large company with increasing compliance requirements;  III. planning of cybersecurity resources in a large organisation.  Example I: Enhancing the cybersecurity practices of a small company presents the application  of the ECSF to address the needs of a small company seeking to enhance its cybersecurity  structure and practise. It shows how a company might use the ECSF to support the  development of a cybersecurity strategy, including the planning of human resources for  cybersecurity and planning the procurement of cybersecurity.  By using the ECSF as a starting point or as a guide, the company does not need to invent or  research basic roles needed to improve its cybersecurity posture. The roles can be granted to  different persons or can be merged to be undertaken by just one or only a few persons  depending upon the strategy, requirements, needs and budget.  The example also shows how the ECSF can support the organisation in the recruitment process  by identifying the cybersecurity roles and responsibilities that are needed inside a small  company. In this example, a cybersecurity role and skills gap analysis and consequent  forecasting of needs at the organisational level are also provided. Apart from supporting the  human resource processes in recruitment, the ECSF also provides a common language for  procuring cybersecurity services.  Example I: Enhancing the cybersecurity practices of a small company  A small cloud services company became successful in just a few months after the founders,  siblings Alicia and Max, implemented their idea for an innovative solution. Alicia was the expert  ‘techie’ genius while Max was a marketing genius. Unfortunately, neither of them had any  experience in running or building a company. After a year the company started to take off and  so they moved into their own office and employed staff to grow the business. During this  The ECSF can be  used as guide  and roadmap  providing a  common  understanding  among the  parties involved  regarding an  organisation’s  cybersecurity  roles.  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  17  expansion phase, no one considered organising the company. Many roles and duties were  shared, and challenges were handled in an ad-hoc way. Fortunately, no serious cybersecurity  incident occurred during this transition phase.  Eventually, the company gained some media exposure which went viral resulting in increased  interest by new investors and clients towards the small start-up. However, larger clients and  investors demanded assurance and proof of adequate security measures and an organisation  structure before getting involved with the company. The founders realised that they would have  to really shape things up inside their organisation. They were aware that the key to the success  of the organisation was the employees and, to enable the organisation to flourish and offer  resilient services, it was essential to define their cybersecurity roles and responsibilities.  However, the question to be answered was what organisation setup was needed and which  roles and what kind of competences did the organisation need?  Funders used the ECSF and identified that their organisation required five key roles to  support their cybersecurity baseline:  • a strategic cybersecurity manager (CISO)  • a cybersecurity legal officer  • a cybersecurity architect  • a few cybersecurity implementers  • a cyber incident responder.  Looking internally to identify whether their employees were able to cover these roles, they  found that their legal officer was already managing compliance with legal and regulatory  frameworks and that she had an interest in enriching her competences in privacy and  cybersecurity legal matters. Human Resources would be able to support upskilling by using  a list of key knowledge and skills obtained from the ECSF.  The ICT Architect of the organisation had prior experience in secure networks design and  therefore with additional training to update and enrich her competence he could also cover  the organisation’s architectural cybersecurity requirements.  The system administrators were following many cybersecurity best practices but worked mostly  in an ad-hoc way without a strategy or structure. Consequently, the founders identified a need  to recruit a Strategic Cybersecurity Manager. The Recruitment Officer was tasked with  drafting a job description based on the ECSF’s CISO profile and with listing the vacancy on  their website.  Finally, it was established that the company’s incident response functions needed to operate  24/7 to assure the continuous operation of services.  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  18  Figure 5: The key roles needed as identified using the ECSF and the actions to be taken  Example I showcased how useful the ECSF can be for the following benefits:  • understanding cybersecurity roles  • identifying workforce requirements  • evaluating processes and structure  • reskilling and/or upskilling employees  • supporting the recruitment process  • building cybersecurity capacity  • building a cybersecure and trusted organisation  • building resilience against cyberattacks.  Figure 6: Benefits of using the ECSF as shown by Example I  Example II: Crafting a job description demonstrates the application of the ECSF when creating  a job description. It shows how ECSF can be beneficial from the perspective of human  resources without the need to have a deep understanding of the cybersecurity profession. This  example shows how a job vacancy may be created and how to avoid the creation of misleading  or confusing expectations and how to attract appropriately skilled personnel. It also  demonstrates how to combine the components of an ECSF role profile and how to adapt them  according to the job needs of an organisation.  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  19  This example demonstrates how an organisation can use the ECSF to create a description of a  role. Even without an HR background, it is possible to define the tasks, skills and knowledge  required of a candidate for recruitment by knowing the mission of the role. Apart from providing  support to the recruitment process, the ECSF can also help the company to define training  plans for newly recruited personnel. It is noteworthy that the ECSF not only provides a common  language for cybersecurity procurement but also for audit purposes, especially where the  principle of accountability is being implemented, and an essential and clear segregation of  duties is required.  Example II: Crafting a job description  A large insurance company is extending its portfolio into cybersecurity insurance as many  customers are seeking this service. After a slight internal restructuring and the updating of the  personnel inventory, the company decides to add cybersecurity to the compliance department.  Consequently, the compliance department management concludes that they need to recruit a  Cyber Compliance Officer to support the new mission.  The company’s HR department is tasked with finding and recruiting the most suitable  candidate. As cybersecurity is a new area for the organisation, HR must also create a role  description. To define this new role, HR interviews knowledgeable managers and staff to  identify the needs and the key tasks for this position. These needs are identified and the key  tasks selected are as follows:  • ensure compliance with and provide legal advice and guidance on data privacy and  data protection standards, laws and regulations;  • identify and document gaps in compliance;  • develop an audit plan describing the frameworks, standards, procedures and auditing  tests;  • execute the audit plan and collect evidence and measurements;  • develop and communicate audit results (reporting).  The responsible HR officer recognises that this is a complex role and that no recruitment  templates to fit this role are available. Therefore, a new role description and template must  be created and approved by management.  The HR officer, now using the ECSF, analyses different roles within the framework. The  specified duties are included in the key tasks identified in the roles of Cyber Legal, Policy &  Compliance Officer and Cybersecurity Auditor.  To perform these tasks, the identified skills and the knowledge required are as follows:  • Skills  o understand the implications of modifications of the legal framework to the  organisation’s cybersecurity and data protection strategy and policies;  o follow and practice auditing frameworks, standards and methodologies;  o apply auditing tools and techniques;  o work as part of a team and collaborate with colleagues.  • Knowledge  o advanced knowledge of National, EU and international cybersecurity and  related privacy standards, legislation, policies and regulations;  o knowledge of information security compliance and regulatory requirements at  the international, national and EU level;  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  20  o basic understanding of data storage, processing and protections within  systems, services and infrastructures.  A new role description tailored to the companies needs may now be created by mapping and  combining parts of the profile for the role of Cyber Legal, Policy & Compliance Officer and  parts of the profile for the role of Cybersecurity Auditor. Significantly, by mapping to the  framework, this new unique role is based upon the core content of the ECSF. This provides a  uniform and structured role that may be traced back to its origin.  Figure 7: Cybersecurity job profile created based on the ECSF role profiles  Following this mapping to the ECSF, the role description required is available and can be used  to draft the role and subsequent job description that HR needs to obtain internal approval and  publish on the company’s recruitment website. Further elements, such as profile mission, may  be used as the introductory text for the publication of this vacancy.  Example II demonstrated how useful the ECSF can be for the following benefits:  • understanding cybersecurity roles  • identifying workforce requirements  • identifying role requirements  • supporting the recruitment process  • supporting the building of a customised vacancy template  • using a common language for vacancies.  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  21  Figure 8: Benefits of using the ECSF presented by Example II  Example III: A large corporation with its main business outside ICT needs to setup a  cybersecurity department demonstrates the application of the ECSF when creating a new  cybersecurity department and preparing a cybersecurity strategy for the corporation. It also  proposes a categorisation of the 12 profiles into four (4) macro areas for high-level  understanding and communication. It shows how a large organisation might use the ECSF to  support the development of a cybersecurity strategy, including human resource planning and  talent development in cybersecurity.  Example III: A large corporation with its main business outside ICT needs to setup a  cybersecurity department  A large corporation with a core business not related to ICT or cybersecurity services realised the  need to protect its valuable assets from cybersecurity threats. In fact, the adopted business  strategy incorporated a massive plan for the digitisation of business processes and the  dependency on ICT was becoming significantly higher for critical business operations.  As the company did not have any internal expertise to handle cybersecurity risks, the board  decided to hire a Chief Security Information Officer (CISO) to define the overall cybersecurity  strategy in alignment with the company business objectives. This would also require setting up  a department for dealing with cybersecurity risks.  The CISO, freshly appointed, used the ECSF as a guideline and as a solid reference for the  cybersecurity roles needed to handle its cybersecurity risks. She used it as a flexible tool to  help structure a cybersecurity department. She also recognised that, to provide a clear  schematic, it would be useful to place the ECSF roles in the context of a management circle,  under four (4) macro areas: a) Plan, b) Implement, c) Operate and d) Improve.  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  22  Figure 9: Placing the ECSF role profiles in the context of a management circle  In the Plan macro area, priorities and targets were set, strategies, policies and action plans  developed, architectures defined, resources allocated. In this macro area, the CISO, the Policy  and Compliance Officer, the Risk Manager and the Architect profiles were positioned naturally.  Implementation of cybersecurity measures (Implementer) and training and awareness raising  (Educator) were allocated to the Implement macro area.  The day-by-day Operations were the most ‘tangible’ area. Responding to incidents (including  SOC teams), forensic activities are daily activities of cybersecurity specialists. The threat  intelligence profile was also seen as an operational area, as these professionals work on  operational data using multiple sources.  Penetration tester (testing for current and emerging threats), Researcher (bringing new  technologies and solutions) and Auditor (identifying gaps) support the Improve stage.  However, since the ECSF is a flexible tool for customised use in a particular context, the CISO  applied the 5-step guide to adapt the role profiles to her specific needs and objectives.  The analysis of the ECSF profiles helped her define the resource plans needed to achieve the  corporate objective.  In the Plan macro area, she decided to:  • be in charge of policy and compliance tasks to streamline the organisation structure;  • hire a cybersecurity architect who would help to define the overall architecture strategy  to cope with cybersecurity risks and ensure secure-by-design solutions to support the  digital transformation;  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  23  • hire a cybersecurity risk manager who would help assess the corporate cybersecurity  risk posture and help define action plans to manage the risks identified.  In the Implementation macro area, she leveraged the ECSF skills and knowledge  components to understand what upskilling would be required to leverage the internal  resources available or alternatively decide to hire externally. The multinational corporation had  an existing team of instructors in a different field. However, there was no specialist team to  design and conduct cybersecurity awareness or trainings courses. The CISO investigated  whether some of the trainers had the skills and knowledge as listed in the ECSF and the  interest to join her new team.  In the Operate macro area, the CISO looked at how to manage the day-by-day cybersecurity  operations and decided to set up global security operation centres with incident  responders working on different continents to provide 24/7 support. Moreover, a threat  Intelligence specialist was employed to provide operational insights to guide hunting for  threats and the mitigation of risk. The CISO concluded there was no need to hire a digital  forensic investigator but rather engage a specialised consulting company for any forensic  needs.  In the Improve macro area, the CISO decided to employ an external service provider for  penetration testing with the objective of testing the resiliency of the corporate infrastructure  and applications. The CISO also assessed the capacity of the internal audit team and decided to  hire a cybersecurity auditor to audit on security related policies. The CISO did not feel the  need to hire a cybersecurity researcher since cybersecurity research was outside the scope of  her organisation.  To sum up, Example III highlighted how useful the ECSF can be for the following benefits:  • understanding cybersecurity roles  • assisting in the creation of an organisation structure  • identifying the requirements for cybersecurity roles  • assisting in planning human resources  • upskilling employees  • supporting the assessment of candidates  • using common terminology for collaboration.  Figure 10: Benefits of using the ECSF demonstrated by Example III  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  24  3.2 SKILLING CYBERSECURITY PROFESSIONALS – APPLY THE ECSF  AS A LEARNING PROVIDER  The ECSF offers a common language and vocabulary for the development of professional  cybersecurity skills to the providers of learning programmes and learning institutions of all types,  such as Higher Education (HE), Vocational Education and Training (VET), or any other  cybersecurity-related educational programme or training. The defined role profiles provide a  cybersecurity workplace-driven, European-embedded approach to link current requirements for  professional practice with cybersecurity related curricula and learning programmes.  The ECSF defines the typical requirements of a profile from two fundamental viewpoints.  • What does this role in the organisation do?  Addresses the workplace perspective (profile sections on mission, deliverables and  tasks)  • What does this role need to know and be able to do?  Address the learning perspective (profile sections on skills, knowledge and e-CF  competences)  Figure 11: The ECSF role profiles sections linked to the workplace and learning perspectives  The ECSF positions learning outcomes in a real workplace context. In particular, descriptions in  ECSF profiles of roles allow providers of learning programmes to review their curricula in a  structured and systematic manner, including from the point of view of practitioners.  As illustrated in Annex B.2, the ECSF might contribute to several activities undertaken in  academic institutions.  • The ECSF might serve to develop or update the learning outcome of courses and align  it to the needs of the job market. The skills, knowledge, and competences within a role  profile may be used to guide the design phase of curricula and support the  establishment of desired learning outcomes. For example, when analysing the  educational needs of a specific cybersecurity job, an aligned ECSF profile provides a  solid starting point to understand associated educational requirements.  • The ECSF might serve as a collaboration tool for creating joint academic programmes  and for allowing the mobility of students.  • The ECSF might serve as a basis for the definition of a framework for a cybersecurity  curriculum which would help universities to map the main focus of their cybersecurity  programme and communicate it to the students.  As illustrated in Annex B.1, the ECSF addresses some of the challenges identified in the  European cybersecurity professional qualifications landscape. In particular:  • the ECSF supports a cross domain and cross industry agreed terminology related to  cybersecurity skills;  • the ECSF might support the development of an integrated platform for skills to provide  up-to-date information regarding the job market, competences, training courses,  certification schemes and a career roadmap.  The ECSF offers  common  language and  vocabulary for  the development  of professional  cybersecurity  skills to the  providers of  learning  programmes and  learning  institutions of all  types.  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  25  Figure 12: Benefits of using the ECSF as a provider of learning  In the context of the development of cybersecurity qualifications and curriculum design, the  ECSF role profiles serve as a communication tool between employers and educators to improve  the consultation process and collaborative outcomes. The employer can quickly define the  required activities or tasks and work backwards to identify the competences, skills and  knowledge educators should include in curricula. This approach significantly speeds up the  design of curricula agreed between employers, governments and educators.  Figure 13 illustrates how the sections of the ECSF role profiles dedicated to competences,  knowledge, and skills can be used to define learning outcomes, identify the appropriate levels of  learning programmes, and create curricula for cybersecurity occupations. Since knowledge and  skills, like all content of role descriptions, are provided as guiding examples for flexible  adaptation to the context, other sources may also be used8.  Figure 13: ECSF profiles guiding cybersecurity professional learning  Connection of learning levels (EQF) and workplace proficiency levels (e-CF)  The European Qualifications Framework (EQF) is a common European reference framework  for qualifications. The purpose of the EQF is to compare qualifications and learning outcomes  that arise in different countries and national education systems. The EQF is based on the  8 The skills, knowledge and competences sections of the ECSF are neither exhaustive nor restrictive, allowing the user to  enrich them by also including external resources e.g., the Cyber Security Body Of Knowledge (CyBOK)  https://www.cybok.org/, JRC Classification https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/publications/unified-conceptual- framework-tasks-skills-and-competences_en  The ECSF can be  used as a  communication  tool between  employers and  educators.  https://www.cybok.org/ https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/publications/unified-conceptual-framework-tasks-skills-and-competences_en https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/publications/unified-conceptual-framework-tasks-skills-and-competences_en  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  26  Recommendation on the European Qualifications Framework for lifelong learning adopted by  the European Parliament and the Council on 23 April 20089.  The EQF defines eight (8) levels of educational attainment with descriptors that differentiate  each level. The criterion for each level is based upon assessment of Knowledge, Skills,  Responsibility, and Autonomy.  The European e-Competence Framework (e-CF), standard EN 16234-1, used by the ECSF, is  a common European framework for ICT Professional competences, knowledge and skills10. It  relates to competences as needed and applied at the workplace. Dimension 3 of the e-CF  defines competence levels originating from workplace proficiency. There are five (5) defined e-  Competence levels e-1 to e-5 related to the EQF learning levels 3 to 8 (EQF levels 1 and 2 are  not relevant in this context).  The relationship between e-CF levels e-1 to e-5 with the EQF levels 3 – 8 is illustrated below:  Figure 14: Relationship between EQF and e-CF levels  Owing to this systematically developed relationship, it is possible to relate the e-CF proficiency  levels with the EQF learning levels. The relationship, due to the different nature of each  framework, is not of full equivalence. However, it may be applied to increase transparency and  provide a shared language between requirements for professional competences in the  workplace and related qualifications from educational institutions11. Thus, the e-CF  competence levels incorporated within the ECSF role profiles can therefore be used as a  general guide to required educational levels.  9 European Qualifications Framework for lifelong learning  10 EN16234-1:2019: e-Competence Framework (e-CF) – a common European Framework for ICT professionals in all  sectors  11 For further practical guidance see: CEN/TS 17699:2022 Guidelines for developing ICT professional curricula as scoped  by EN16234-1 (e-CF)  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  27  3.3 MAKING OWN CAREER CHOICES – APPLY THE ECSF AS AN  INDIVIDUAL PROFESSIONAL  The common language defined by the ECSF can be used to clear any confusion between  professional cybersecurity job roles and cybersecurity educational programmes. By providing a  common language and a clear description of the professional job roles in cybersecurity, the  tasks expected to be carried out by them as well as the skills, the competences and the  knowledge required, the ECSF can build a shared understanding and provide the clarity  required to attract new individuals into the cybersecurity field or assist them in planning their  career paths.  Figure 15: Using the ECSF to define individual’s career paths  Professionals already working in cybersecurity related positions can use the ECSF as a guide  for advancing in their field. By mapping their skills and knowledge to ECSF role profiles of  interest, individuals can identify any missing skills or knowledge that they need to develop,  master or learn so that they are ready to cover future job requirements or possible transitions  between cybersecurity roles while they progress their professional career. This helps dialogue  between employees and employers when planning continuous education within the field of  cybersecurity. As the ECSF indicates both formal and non-formal learning paths, it also helps  new entrants who are unaware of where to start. Adding to previous knowledge and  competences is often an easier pathway than starting completely anew.  Annex B.6 deals with  this topic, and provides deeper insights and examples in ‘individual career decision-making’  using the ECSF.  Using the ECSF as a baseline, an individual can identify the required competences and skills to  move from one role to another or to identify current training needs.  The common language defined by the ECSF can be helpful for individuals looking for  cybersecurity jobs. The ECSF can assist in filtering job openings and in understanding the job  description while it can also make the job’s overall mobility within cybersecurity easier by  mapping the individual’s skills, knowledge and competences to the ECSF.  The ECSF can  build a shared  understanding  and provide the  clarity required to  attract new  individuals into  the cybersecurity  field or assist  them in planning  their career  paths.  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  28  Cybersecurity is a good career opportunity even for individuals currently specialised in other  fields, hence reskilling people and moving them into the cybersecurity field is a good way to  satisfy the workforce needs of the market and reduce the workforce gaps in the field. Since  cybersecurity is a multidisciplinary subject, such a career change could be faster for individuals  with backgrounds close to one of the main aspects of the field12:  • technical – related to technology, concrete technological approaches and solutions  that can be used to fight against cybercrime and cyberterrorism;  • human – related to human factors, behavioural aspects, privacy issues, as well as  raising awareness and knowledge of society with regards to cybercrime and terrorism  threats;  • organisational – related to processes, procedures and policies within organisations,  as well as cooperation (public-private, public-public) between organisations;  • regulatory – related to the provisions of the law, standardisation and forensics.  By having a clear understanding of the main profiles for cybersecurity roles in the field and a  common cybersecurity language across a broader range of sectors as provided by the ECSF,  individuals seeking to switch careers towards cybersecurity can use the ECSF as a starting  point to identify specific competences skills and knowledge that they need to acquire for the  transition.  Figure 16: Using the ECSF to analyse and compare cybersecurity learning programmes  Whether the individual is already working in cybersecurity (looking to expand their knowledge),  is currently employed in another field (looking to switch career) or is seeking an academic  education (looking to work in cybersecurity in the future), the ECSF can help in understanding  the main profiles of cybersecurity roles (by providing a description and analysing them into  tasks, skills, knowledge and competences) as well as help in the analysis and comparison of  available learning programmes (mapping the learning outcomes to the required skills and  knowledge of the cybersecurity profiles of preference).  3.4 BUILDING CYBERSECURITY COMMUNITIES – APPLY THE ECSF AS  A PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION  The ECSF creates a common terminology and shared understanding of the role profiles of  cybersecurity professionals. Thus, it can be used by professional associations as a standard to  ensure that their work can be used and applied across the EU, eliminating confusion in  terminology and any lack of understanding.  Professional organisations can use the framework to conduct market analyses using the ECSF  role profiles and present the results in a shared language. For example, the ECSF is expected  to be helpful in highlighting the profiles that are lacking in the market, the cybersecurity jobs that  12 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/analysis-of-the-european-r-d-priorities-in-cybersecurity  The ECSF  creates a  common  terminology and  shared  understanding of  the role profiles  of cybersecurity  professionals,  and so it can  eliminate  confusion in  terminology and  any lack of  understanding  By using the  ECSF, one can  ensure that a  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/analysis-of-the-european-r-d-priorities-in-cybersecurity  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  29  are in high demand, and the legislative aspects of some professional job profiles. Furthermore,  by using the ECSF as a common terminology, professional associations may work towards  professional guidance in the cybersecurity sector as presented by Annex B.5.  The use of the ECSF also allows the consolidation of a community of stakeholders to support  new developments, improvements and further implementation in EU Member States. Such a  framework for collaboration enables human interaction which results in benefits such as  knowledge sharing, identification of trends at EU scale, peer-learning activities, application of  multidisciplinary approaches and empowerment to adapt and customise the ECSF to specific  requirements.  Overall, the ECSF can be used by professional cybersecurity associations as a tool to base  their activities on ensuring their EU wide applicability, with the aim of achieving better hardening  against cyberattacks across the EU as a society.  3.5 EMPOWERING THE SECTOR STRATEGICALLY – APPLY THE ECSF  AS A POLICY MAKER  With the ECSF, a crucial professional community secures clear visibility as using the framework  creates a shared understanding of what cybersecurity specialists do. Hence, the ECSF provides  a tool to analyse and share critical cybersecurity workforce related collections of data and  statistics in a common and EU wide understandable terminology. Such data are important for  policymakers as they obtain better insights of the state of the cybersecurity workforce across the  EU, thus enabling them to understand and estimate the future needs of cybersecurity specialists  in quantity and quality. Such strategic input helps to update and maintain the ECSF itself, so  that its relevance in the future remains valid. Furthermore, by defining a common terminology,  the ECSF allows for cross border collaboration between policymakers through data and  information sharing.  Given a structured approach to a very diverse market environment, the ECSF role profiles  provide a valuable tool for the support of policymakers, market surveyors and other  stakeholders with the influence and role to empower the sector strategically. The ECSF Profiles  can be helpful for data studies on supply and demand carried out at national, European and  international levels. The profiles provide a shared, agreed definition to facilitate the collection of  reliable and comparable data in the cybersecurity job market, including the supply and demand  for different types of cybersecurity professionals and related requirements for particular skills.  Policy-making processes addressing cybersecurity can benefit from data collection at the time  of making decisions, e.g. funding provisions, investment priorities and periods of intervention.  Besides the core activities of each profile, the activities carried out by them may contribute to  generating and gathering relevant data sets that can support policy decisions. Annex B.3 shows  how fragmented information constitutes a challenge when making decisions and the actions  INCIBE is taking in addressing this challenge with the support of the ECSF. By incorporating the  ECSF as a homogeneous framework for the definition of cybersecurity profiles, EU member  states get valuable support in achieving their objectives of increasing cybersecurity talents and  becoming aligned with the rest of the countries at the European level.  Given a  structured  approach to a  very diverse  market  environment, the  ECSF role  profiles provide  a valuable tool  for the support  of policymakers,  market  surveyors and  other  stakeholders  with the  influence and  role to empower  the sector  strategically.

Connecting existing recognised European structures of relevance to the EU’s professional  cybersecurity domain was a vital ECSF design principle (see section 2.1)  The following paragraphs provide a brief overview of the main standards and frameworks to  which the ECSF is connecting.  A.1 EN16234-1 E-CF A COMMON EUROPEAN REFERENCE  FRAMEWORK FOR ICT PROFESSIONALS IN ALL SECTORS  The European Norm (EN) 16234-1 European e-Competence Framework (e-CF) provides a  reference of 41 competences as applied in the information and communication technology (ICT)  workplace using a standard European language for competences, skills, knowledge and  proficiency levels that can be understood across Europe. The prime objective of this standard is  to provide a common European language for ICT workplace-related competences, skills,  knowledge and proficiency levels as required and applied by organisations and professionals. In  this way, all sector stakeholders, including the public and private sectors and individuals, have  access to a shared reference.  The standard was established as a tool to support mutual understanding and provide  transparency of language through the articulation of competences required and deployed by  ICT professionals. This standard is structured across multiple dimensions. The dimensions  reflect areas of business and human resource planning and incorporate job and work  proficiency guidelines. In addition, this standard adds a transversal component which provides  basic generic ICT descriptors for successful application of e-CF competences in the context of a  workplace.

Information Systems Governance  The e-CF provides consistent links in the context of ICT qualifications and other frameworks of  relevance to the sector (in particular, EQF, DigComp, European ICT Professional Role Profiles,  behavioural skills, ESCO, EQANIE, SFIA, Foundational Body of Knowledge for the ICT  Profession, ISO and other ICT industry standards).  For each cybersecurity role, a set of applicable e-CF competences was selected at the  application level as an incorporated element of the profile description for the role of  cybersecurity professional.  A.2 EUROPEAN ICT PROFESSIONAL ROLE PROFILES  The CWA 16458 European ICT Professional Role Profiles provides a generic set of typical roles  performed by ICT Professionals in any organisation, covering the entire ICT business process.  Thirty profiles in total provide a sound starting point and inspiration for the creation of more  context-specific and flexible profiles based upon organisational roles, individual job descriptions  or sub-domain specialisations from various contexts. By applying e-CF competences to the  construction of ICT profiles, the European ICT Professional Role Profiles also provide a tool and  entry point for e-CF application to individuals and organisations who wish to work with the e-CF.  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  36  The European ICT Professional Role Profiles are described by using a consistent format  incorporating the following elements: a summary statement, a mission statement, deliverables,  main tasks, e-Competences, and Key Performance Indicators (KPI) areas13.  By adopting the most suitable elements of the European agreed and practice-driven ICT Profile  description scheme, the ECSF profiles become comparable and provide a unique, easily  accessible and comprehensive overview of the requirements for European cybersecurity  professionals.  These detailed high content profiles have loose links to the generic roles incorporated in the  overall European ICT Professional Profile set. From the ECSF user perspective, confidence can  be established in the sustainability of the structure through its association with European ICT  Profiles but with focused application for the cybersecurity community.  A.3 EUROPEAN QUALIFICATIONS FRAMEWORK  The EU developed the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) as a translation tool to  make national qualifications easier to understand and more comparable. The EQF seeks to  support cross-border mobility of learners and workers, and to promote lifelong learning and  professional development across Europe.  The EQF is an 8-level, learning outcomes-based framework14 for all types of qualifications. It  serves as a translation tool between the various frameworks of national qualifications. This  framework helps improve transparency, comparability and portability of people’s qualifications  and makes it possible to compare qualifications from different countries and institutions.  The EQF covers all types and all levels of qualifications and the use of learning outcomes  makes clear what a person knows, understands and is able to do. The level increases  according to the level of learning, with level 1 the lowest and 8 the highest level. Most  importantly the EQF is closely linked to national qualification frameworks15, so it provides a  comprehensive map of all types and levels of qualifications in Europe, which are increasingly  accessible through qualification databases. The EQF was set up in 2008 and later revised in  201716.  The ECSF profiles contain e-CF competences and e-CF level assignments, which provide a  consistent link with EQF levels (see section 3.2). This orienting relationship provides a bridge in  understanding between the provision of learning programmes and workplace requirements.  A.4 ESCO - EUROPEAN CLASSIFICATION OF SKILLS, COMPETENCES  AND OCCUPATIONS  ESCO is the multilingual classification of European skills, competences, qualifications and  occupations. The key purpose of ESCO is to provide a dictionary, describing, identifying and  classifying professional occupations and skills relevant to the EU labour market, education and  training and systematically showing the relations between those occupations and skills. ESCO  is managed by the European Commission, which is responsible for updating the classification.  The ESCO resource supports two of the EU’s key strategies in the field, Europe 2020 and Skills  Agenda for Europe17.  13 CWA 16458 European ICT Professional Role Profiles  14 https://europa.eu/europass/en/description-eight-eqf-levels  15 https://europa.eu/europass/en/national-qualifications-frameworks-nqfs  16 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32017H0615(01)&from=EN  17 https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1326&langId=en  https://europa.eu/europass/en/description-eight-eqf-levels https://europa.eu/europass/en/national-qualifications-frameworks-nqfs https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32017H0615(01)&from=EN https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1326&langId=en  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  37  The goal of ESCO is to describe all occupations in the European labour market, thus including  cybersecurity. It is therefore useful to establish an orienting mapping between the ECSF role  profiles and some of the ESCO profiles.  On Table 5, several cybersecurity related ESCO Occupations are listed along with an indicative  mapping to ECSF role profiles. Since the relationship between them is not always one- to-one,  the following relationships were defined to explain the corresponding connections:  • is – This ESCO Occupation can be mapped to the corresponding ECSF role profile as  both describe the same cybersecurity role.  • might include – This ESCO Occupation may include, based on the context, the ECSF  role profile listed. (This is an indicative mapping.)  • might be included – Some aspects of this ESCO Occupation may describe parts of  the ECSF role profile listed. (This is an indicative mapping.)  Table 5: The ESCO profiles and the ECSF profiles relationships  ESCO code ESCO Occupation Relationship ECSF role profile  2149.2.8 Research engineer might include Cybersecurity Researcher  2310.1 Higher education lecturer might include Cybersecurity Educator  2356 Information technology  trainer  might include Cybersecurity Educator  2511.18 IT auditor might include Cybersecurity Auditor  2519.2 ICT auditor manager might include Cybersecurity Auditor  2529.1 Chief ICT security officer is Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)  2529.2 Digital forensic expert is Digital Forensics Investigator  2529.3 Embedded system security  engineer  might be included Cybersecurity Implementer  2529.4 Ethical hacker is Penetration Tester  2529.6 ICT Security administrator  might be included Cybersecurity Implementer  2529.7 ICT security engineer might be included Cybersecurity Architect  2529.7 ICT security engineer might be included Cybersecurity Implementer  2619.4 Data protection officer is Cyber Legal, Policy & Compliance Officer  Important note: The relationship between the ESCO occupation and the ECSF role profile does  not represent an equivalence; it offers a best fit approximation that readers may wish to  investigate.  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  38  B ANNEX:  USE CASES  A use case shows why and how an organisation is using the ECSF, emphasising the variety of  approaches and benefits. This annex is a collection of cases that were publicly available on 20  July 2022.  The following use cases are merely illustrative examples. The Information and contents included  in these cases should not be considered as an endorsement or validation statement from  ENISA. The use of these examples should be seen as inspirational cases rather than as  conditioning baselines or benchmarking references.  B.1 USE CASE FROM CONCORDIA H2020 PROJECT  This section includes parts from the use case written by CONCORDIA H2020 project18.  Towards an integrated platform for skills in cyber built on the European Cybersecurity  Skills Framework  Difficult to understand the trainings big picture  The needs to protect oneself against threats to information and operations, to maintain the  cybersecurity posture of an organization and to increase the resilience against such threats, are  still urgently felt by all interested parties. A core component to fulfilling these needs, is the  existence of cyber – competent professionals. And competence regarding cybersecurity is not  only needed for the dedicated professionals (external or internal to an organization) but also for  all staff members of an organization even if they are not directly involved in cybersecurity  processes and activities.  When it comes to the cybersecurity professionals, various publications still report a  cybersecurity skills gap, flagging that the top 3 competencies missing or not enough covered by  the existing professionals varies from one year to another19. On the other hand, a considerable  amount of Cybersecurity related courses and trainings are offered by various European and  international organisations. A simple search on the internet will reveal many courses that relate  to the cybersecurity domain, without providing a clear picture on the competencies offered or  how they could relate to a specific role. To add to this confusion, there are training courses that  seem to address one specific role (e.g. CISO), have similar titles but have different curriculum.  Hence, in several cases, the information provided is confusing the trainee on what and how they  should perceive cybersecurity concepts, as well as how to use them to cover their professional  needs. Besides, the courses for professionals are promoted on a variety of platforms and they  are difficult to be compared with respect to the competencies covered and role profile  addressed. This makes difficult for an individual to build a clear career path and identify  development opportunities.  18 https://www.concordia-h2020.eu/blog-post/towards-an-integrated-platform-for-skills-in-cyberbuilt-on-the-european- cybersecurity-skills-framework/  19 https://www.isaca.org/why-isaca/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/2022/state-of-the-cybersecurity-workforce-new- isaca-research-shows-retention-difficulties-in-years  https://www.concordia-h2020.eu/blog-post/towards-an-integrated-platform-for-skills-in-cyberbuilt-on-the-european-cybersecurity-skills-framework/ https://www.concordia-h2020.eu/blog-post/towards-an-integrated-platform-for-skills-in-cyberbuilt-on-the-european-cybersecurity-skills-framework/ https://www.isaca.org/why-isaca/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/2022/state-of-the-cybersecurity-workforce-new-isaca-research-shows-retention-difficulties-in-years https://www.isaca.org/why-isaca/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/2022/state-of-the-cybersecurity-workforce-new-isaca-research-shows-retention-difficulties-in-years  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  39  The CONCORDIA map of courses for cybersecurity professionals  In an attempt to address these challenges, we have built the CONCORDIA map of courses and  trainings for cybersecurity professionals20. The map is displaying structured information on  existing European offer for short courses/trainings and provides different filters as to help match  easier the specific need for skills development with the offer. [...]  One can choose to sort the courses based on the cybersecurity level addressed (Device-,  Network-, Software/ System, Data/ Application-, User-Centric), or on the relevance to an  industry sector (e.g. Telecom, Financial, Transport e-mobility, e-Health or Defence), but also on  the format (face-to-face, online, blended), and the timing of the course/training.  Missing a key ingredient – Solution enabled by ECSF  Although we are offering on the CONCORDIA map a large plethora of filters to help the users  identify easier the course(s) of interest, the database lacks a key ingredient – the links to role  profiles that each of the courses are addressing through the knowledge and skills covered. The  e‑CF European Competence Framework for ICT professionals available at the time of building  the map defines 30 role profiles and 40 associated competencies but they are difficult to be  associated to the specificities of the cybersecurity domain.  This was a challenge of the cybersecurity education ecosystem we flagged already two years  ago and captured in the CONCORDIA Roadmap for Education21 under the heading C5:  Heterogeneity of competencies related terminology. This lack of a cross‑domain and  cross‑industry agreed terminology related to the cybersecurity skills necessary for a specific role  makes it difficult for companies to fill in open positions. They find it hard to match the recruitment  criteria with the studies and the qualifications listed in the CVs of the applicants because of the  use of non‑standard terminology. Individuals, in turn, cannot easily identify the skills they need  to possess or develop to match market demand. And, finally, course providers have difficulties  in designing curricula that answer to the market needs.  As part of the CONCORDIA roadmap, we pledged for one single platform hosting all the existing  Cybersecurity related programs (university level and Ph.D. programs, short courses and  trainings for professionals). [...]  The platform should consider collecting the content by using categories based on a standard  terminology (specific skills framework included). The categories would be further used as filters  for different enquires of the courses database. The 12 role profiles defined in the current version  of the European Cybersecurity Skills Framework (ECSF) seem to be a natural solution.  The benefit for stakeholders  The adoption of a standard lexicon such as the one proposed by the ESCF, including  cybersecurity role profiles will help companies identifying the right talent for the jobs as well as  education providers to better shape their curriculum to match the cyber workforce needs. By  applying the same terminology and using an EU wide skills framework to job descriptions,  course description and role profile would help individuals selecting the right education modules  to support their career path, and filtering better the jobs openings according to their competence  and level of expertise. Finally, the policy makers would be able to collect more structured data at  country/regional level in support of future policy development and have a solid basis when  coordinating with external countries towards addressing global scale cyber security challenges.  20 https://www.concordia-h2020.eu/map-courses-cyber-professionals/  21 https://www.concordia-h2020.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/roadmaps-05-Education.pdf  https://www.concordia-h2020.eu/map-courses-cyber-professionals/ https://www.concordia-h2020.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/roadmaps-05-Education.pdf  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  40  Towards an integrated platform for skills  Building on the CONCORDIA database of courses and trainings for cybersecurity professionals,  the REWIRE project22 attempts to make further steps towards integrating the relevant  cybersecurity skills related content. The REWIRE CyberABILITY platform – currently in design  phase – will provide up-to-date information regarding the job market, competences, training  courses, certification schemes and a career roadmap.  B.2 USE CASE FROM SPARTA H2020 PROJECT  This section includes parts from the use case written by SPARTA H2020 project23.  Improving higher education using ECSF and SPARTA Curricula Designer  Introduction  This use case provides recommendations on how ECSF can be used to shape education  programmes that are linked with cybersecurity. As ECSF manifests the structure of high-level  profiles from practitioners’ point of view, including main tasks, relevant knowledge and skills, this  can provide more focused approach for building specialized and comprehensive study  programs, tailored to specific profiles, instead of covering cybersecurity in general.  Challenge  Education institutions compose their curricula considering the complete path – starting with the  fundamental courses that are required for the student to learn as a basis for the next set of  follow-on courses, which are often cybersecurity-specific. However, the selection of courses to  be included in the cybersecurity curricula is up to the institution.  Each education institution has its own specific environment (determined by, e.g., infrastructure,  equipment, expertise of teachers, composition of existing programs, etc.) and there is no  universal way how the curriculum should be constructed.  Education providers differ in what concrete subdomain of cybersecurity they would like to focus  on. Some providers are very technical, focusing on, e.g., computer science, some more social-  oriented, focusing on legal and societal aspects. Therefore, the interoperability among the  resulting study programs and a common language is currently a significant challenge.  Some academic programmes do not build skills and competencies that prepare students for  specific work roles available on the job market. This poses a challenge for students which do not  understand what are the occupational possibilities at the end of their studies.  Solution enabled by ECSF  The ECSF may contribute to the following activities that address challenges above:  • Evaluation: Description of profiles allows institutions to review their curricula in a  structured and systematic manner, understanding the practitioners’ point of view. This  allows to understand for what profile institution is mainly targeting their graduates.  22 https://rewireproject.eu/  23  https://sparta.eu/assets/pdf/ECSF%20Training%20and%20education%20use%20case%20with%20SPARTA%20Curricula %20Designer.pdf  https://rewireproject.eu/ https://sparta.eu/assets/pdf/ECSF%20Training%20and%20education%20use%20case%20with%20SPARTA%20Curricula%20Designer.pdf https://sparta.eu/assets/pdf/ECSF%20Training%20and%20education%20use%20case%20with%20SPARTA%20Curricula%20Designer.pdf  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  41  • Improvement: Can be done based on the evaluation exercise. This is especially  important considering the set of knowledge / skills ascribed to specific profile.  • Focus: Education provided by universities may differ in the way they address core  competencies. Some might be more focused on specific technological courses, some  on law, others on forensics, etc. Having an ECSF to work with, they can map their core  competencies onto various courses areas, important for defined profiles. This enables  the institution to develop more effective targeted programs in house around the main  competencies.  • Collaboration: ECSF gives the education providers the common language and  vocabulary for describing their courses, creating joint programmes and allowing  mobility of students.  While applying ECSF to cybersecurity education, the following approach is recommended:  • Courses in curricula can be classed as belonging to either Fundamental or Cyber  Security categories. Fundamental courses are those that might not be directly linked to  the ECSF, but which serve as a prerequisite for later studies. For example,  Fundamental Cryptology is the prerequisite for Cryptanalysis or Advanced Cryptology;  Number Theory is necessary for most intermediate and advanced computer related  courses.  • Once the Fundamental courses are identified, the Cybersecurity courses can be  proposed to address requirements of work roles the students are aiming to. Linking is  achieved based on the content of individual courses, which can be linked to the profiles  and finally to work roles. The concrete steps, [...], are:  a. For a specific Work Role 1, education providers find the relevant Profiles  (Profile 1 and Profile 12 in our example). This mapping, marked by brown  arrows, should be specified by the job advertisers/employers.  b. Education providers identify the necessary knowledge and skills for selected  profiles. These requirements are defined by the ECSF, marked by blue  arrows.  c. Education providers design new or reuse existing courses (in our example  courses 1, 2, 3, 4) that address the knowledge and skills identified in the step  above. This mapping between courses and their content must be done by  course administrators.  d. Having all necessary courses (and all prerequisites for them, general non-  cybersecurity courses, other courses for broadening the scope of students,  etc.), the core of the curriculum is ready.  • Of course, the ECSF can be applied also in an exactly opposite way: first composing  the curriculum from individual courses, analysing the knowledge and skills provided,  using the ECSF to identify profiles and, finally, finding the work roles that are supported  by the curriculum. This mapping reveals what exact knowledge and skills is already  present in the curricula or, on the other side, what is missing and should be stressed or  added to the courses. In this way, the ECSF helps to structure the curricula for a better  fit with the expected profiles and job roles.  Result / added Value by SPARTA  SPARTA project used a cybersecurity skills framework to create a free tool called Cybersecurity  Curricula Designer. It is a simple web application that helps education providers to create new  study programs on cybersecurity and/or to analyze existing study programs according to their  content and its reflection of cybersecurity jobs requirements.  The tool [...] allows study program administrators to compose their study program by dragging  and dropping courses from the left section to the middle section. Courses, from which  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  42  administrators develop the study programs, can be either pre-defined or custom. While  composing the study program, the statistical data about its content is displayed in the right  section. Besides other data, the information about what competencies and work roles are  supported by the program are provided. By using the tool, it is easy to find out what content is  missing in the study program and what specific work roles are best-suited for the graduates of  the program. In this case, the cybersecurity skills framework is the core of the applications which  allows linking the skills and knowledge with job roles. [...]  B.3 USE CASE FROM INCIBE  This section includes parts from the use case written by INCIBE24.  Use case from INCIBE  Introduction  The effectiveness in protecting a country depends largely on the capabilities of its people, and  estimates in this regard are that by 2022, Spain could reach a cybersecurity workforce of close  to 122,284 workers with a talent gap estimated at 24,119. Consequently, one of the top priorities  for the administration today is to meet the challenge of identifying, attracting, developing, and  retaining talent in the various fields of cybersecurity.  Proof of this commitment is the development of the Spanish government's 2019 National  Cybersecurity Strategy25, which emphasizes the need not only to have a defense and protection  position for companies and citizens, but also to support the boosting of the cyber industry,  recognizing the key role that cybersecurity plays in the current environment of transformation  and uncertainty and the opportunity it offers to increase Spain's competitiveness. Aligned with  objective 4 of the Strategy, action line 5 highlights the importance of boosting the Spanish  cybersecurity industry, in addition to the generation and retention of talent for the strengthening  of digital autonomy.  On the other hand, the Digital Spain 2025 Plan26 seeks to reinforce the levers that will facilitate  a return to the path of economic growth, and one of its strategic axes is to strengthen Spain's  cybersecurity capacity to mitigate risks and increase confidence in the path towards a digital and  sustainable economy.  In its strategic axis 4, dedicated monographically to cybersecurity, it incorporates the measures  that make up INCIBE's three main lines of action for the coming years: increasing the  cybersecurity capabilities of citizens and companies; boosting the Spanish cybersecurity  ecosystem around its industry, R&D&I and cybersecurity talent; and consolidating Spain as an  international node in the sector. Spain Digital 2025 already recognizes the key role of  cybersecurity talent as a driving force for the sector.  These national initiatives generate a suitable scenario that favors research, innovation, and  involves the most relevant agents of the value chain, such as educational institutions and  organizations, so that they see the benefit of managing the knowledge, capabilities and  technological experiences that respond to the great challenges that the country has in terms of  cybersecurity.  24 http://www.incibe.es/en/talento-hacker/publications/european-cybersecurity-skills  25 https://www.dsn.gob.es/es/documento/estrategia-nacional-ciberseguridad-2019  26 https://portal.mineco.gob.es/ca-es/ministerio/estrategias/Pagines/00_Espana_Digital_2025.aspx  http://www.incibe.es/en/talento-hacker/publications/european-cybersecurity-skills https://www.dsn.gob.es/es/documento/estrategia-nacional-ciberseguridad-2019 https://portal.mineco.gob.es/ca-es/ministerio/estrategias/Pagines/00_Espana_Digital_2025.aspx  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  43  For its part, the Spanish National Cybersecurity Institute (INCIBE), a company under the  Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation, through the Secretary of State for  Digitalization and Artificial Intelligence; and the reference entity for the development of  cybersecurity and digital trust of citizens and companies, and of the Spanish academic and  research network (RedIRIS), has the mission of improving cybersecurity and digital trust of  citizens, minors and private companies in Spain.  In addition, its mission includes the protection and defense of these groups, the promotion of  Spanish industry and R&D&I in cybersecurity, as well as the identification, generation and  attraction of talent to the cybersecurity sector.  Cybersecurity talent is, therefore, a cornerstone of INCIBE's actions. Without talent it is  impossible to develop a strong industry or the high value-added solutions needed to participate  in a highly competitive market such as cybersecurity.  However, the information available so far on the state of talent in the cybersecurity sector in  Spain was varied and fragmented, coming from different sources, which hindered the deep  understanding of the environment necessary to channel actions. [...]  That is why, with the aim of offering a clear vision of cybersecurity talent in Spain, INCIBE  publishes in March 2022, the results of an analysis and diagnosis of cybersecurity talent at  national level, whose process has been carried out through rigorous analytical premises, global  work approach and participatory and inclusive processes that have taken into account the main  actors of the cybersecurity ecosystem. [...]  Challenge  The recommendations derived from this analysis project are the starting point for ensuring a  robust and profitable cybersecurity industry that is characterized by putting people talent at the  core of initiatives. In this sense, the entire cybersecurity value chain can see this study as an  opportunity to further connect with and better understand the cybersecurity talent in Spain.  It is therefore necessary to structure and implement effective practices that impact the  management of this specific type of talent in organizations. The importance of cybersecurity for  the survival of organizations requires the need to address the problem of identifying this type of  specific talent in cybersecurity, the evolution of the recruitment and on boarding process, as well  as the adoption of actions that contribute to improving management and mitigating talent drain.  For this reason, the promotion of national policies, coordinated from the administration that  focus on strengthening and promoting initiatives to make cybersecurity a strategic priority in  organizations, as well as structuring and structuring a training itinerary for the performance of  cybersecurity as a professional activity are priorities on which both organizations and  recruitment companies will establish in their actions for the identification, attraction, recruitment  and management of cybersecurity talent.  In this way, a set of recommendations are established that this type of agents (Public  Administration, recruitment companies and other organizations) could implement to increase  cybersecurity talent in Spain and that set the starting point to solve the challenges that lie ahead  in this regard. [...]  Solution enabled by ECSF  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  44  There are several factors (political, economic, social, technological, legal, etc.) that can impact  the cybersecurity industry, and consequently, the shortage of talent, gaps and in general a  mismatch between supply and demand.  One of these relevant factors in the European Union, is the lack of standardization of the  definition of cybersecurity roles and skills associated with those roles.  Provide a basis for continuous communication between different stakeholders (government,  industry, academia, policy makers and citizens).  This type of tool serves as a basis for a more competent and complete workforce that  understands the same language as other professionals at the European. [...]  Result / added Value  Therefore, in the context presented, two initiatives have been launched at the national level,  which will give value to the ECSF developed by ENISA and which will be very useful. [...]  Both initiatives, coordinated with each other, will incorporate the ECSF as a homogeneous  framework for the definition of cybersecurity profiles, which will allow Spain to achieve its talent  objectives and be aligned with the rest of the countries at European level. [...]  B.4 USE CASE FROM THE EUROPEAN CYBER SECURITY  ORGANISATION (ECSO)  This section includes parts from the use case written by the European Cyber Security  Organisation (ECSO)27.  Towards a harmonised education approach with the European Cybersecurity Skills  Framework (ECSF)  Having worked on education, training and skills in its WG5 since 2016, ECSO has seen first-  hand the challenges posed by the fragmentation and scattered approaches that exist within  cybersecurity today. In this blog post, ECSO reflects on the existing European approaches to  education and up-skilling and focuses on ENISA’s European Cybersecurity Skills Framework  (ECSF).  Education is not only a national prerogative. It is it also inherently linked to collaboration  between national entities, the wider cybersecurity community and European bodies. With this in  mind, collaboration is key when coming up with pan-European approaches to harmonise  cybersecurity education curricula and tackling the skills or, more concretely, the workforce gap.  There is ample opportunity to leverage the collaborative spirit of the European cybersecurity  community to deliver practical solutions and initiatives that can have an impact “on the ground”,  and ENISA’s European Cybersecurity Skills Framework (ECSF) can play a big part in this  respect.  Cybersecurity education: an ECSO perspective  From the perspective of the European Cyber Security Organisation (ECSO), as representative  body of the European cybersecurity public-private ecosystem and community), the potential  27 https://www.ecs-org.eu/newsroom/consolidated-educational-and-recruiting-scheme-the-glue-to-fix-todays-scattered- approach  https://www.ecs-org.eu/newsroom/consolidated-educational-and-recruiting-scheme-the-glue-to-fix-todays-scattered-approach https://www.ecs-org.eu/newsroom/consolidated-educational-and-recruiting-scheme-the-glue-to-fix-todays-scattered-approach  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  45  value of the ECSF is non-negligible when it comes to linking existing efforts, providing  foundational elements for a European cybersecurity workforce, and delivering a common  framework and taxonomy for the application of profiles and skills. Cybersecurity professionals,  education & training providers, policy makers, and recruitment professionals, alike, stand to gain  from the wider implementation of the ECSF.  The Challenge  It is evident that there is a growing need for a skilled cybersecurity workforce. Various studies  across the globe from industry and academia confirm that the cybersecurity workforce demand  is very high and that it is difficult to hire competent professionals. The 2021 edition of the annual  Cybersecurity Workforce Study published by ECSO Member (ISC)²28 states that the shortage of  cybersecurity professionals is 2.72 million globally which, although having decreased from 3.12  million the year prior, is still a significant number. While these studies offer a basis upon which  to assess the global situation, the reality is that it is very difficult to quantify the extent of the  cybersecurity talent shortage in Europe. We know that the demand for experts will inevitably rise  due to the growth of the cybersecurity market and regulatory landscape, leaving an urgent gap  to fill with more (and different kinds of) experts. [...]  But it is not only a matter of numbers. Through a recent ECSO study on HR recruitment  practices and trends, ECSO has also observed an increase in the time it takes, on average, for  organisations to fill their cybersecurity positions. Many organisations indicate that it may take up  to six months for the recruitment process, which is slower than in order knowledge domains,  while others state that they have difficulties with filling their cybersecurity positions altogether.  This clearly indicates that there is a mismatch between the supply and demand (i.e. gap  between academia and industry requirements) and push/pull factors (i.e. candidate suitability  and assessment, attraction to jobs and benefits). However, the main issue for employers  remains the general lack, worldwide, of cybersecurity specialists, while the demand is constantly  growing. Several organisations also highlight the complexity of hiring experts for a domain that  they do not master. ECSO’s survey also indicated that, as a growing trend, several candidates,  despite lacking significant cybersecurity skills, still enrich their CV with cybersecurity concepts  and keywords.  These challenges clearly highlight the need for a common language to support recruitment  efforts and the importance of considering the multidisciplinary nature of cybersecurity that is so  unique to the field vs the more traditional IT/ICT professions. While existing frameworks such as  NICE, CyBoK, and eCF provide useful guidelines for skills development, a European framework  that provides an overarching profile taxonomy and career pathways inherent to cybersecurity,  has been missing. The release of the ECSF is therefore very timely and fundamental to  supporting the European cybersecurity community in attracting, skilling, and re-skilling experts.  There is a solution  ECSO will apply the ECSF in a number of ways to boost its uptake and leverage its potential to  harmonise cybersecurity education and skills across Europe.  ECSO will:  • Map out its Minimum Reference Curriculum to the ECSF, giving course designers and  practitioners a first-hand look at how best to define their curricula towards dedicated  career pathways. This will help ensure that university courses adequately reflect the  realities of the needs of the cybersecurity job market while allowing for a continuous  updating of the curriculum.  28 https://www.isc2.org/Research/Workforce-Study  https://www.isc2.org/Research/Workforce-Study  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  46  • Use the ECSF and associated use manual to support HR/recruitment in the drafting of  job advertisements and organisation of practical skills assessment/evaluation  procedures. We will also conduct a follow up HR survey using the ECSF job profiles to  understand what roles are most needed by organisations and progressively build up a  quantitative understanding of the European cybersecurity job market.  • Use the ECSF as base taxonomy for two dedicated platforms envisaged by the  Women4Cyber Foundation and ECSO [...]  Result and added value  The added value of the ECSF for the European cybersecurity community is first to have a  common framework and taxonomy upon which to work. This will lead to a better understanding  of the skills needs and the practical realities of different job profiles, which will enhance the  cybersecurity workforce, not only through more efficient recruitment and retention measures, but  also through facilitating the entry or re-entry of more women and other underrepresented groups  (i.e., the neurodiverse) into the field. The ECSF, in highlighting the technical and non-technical  aspects of different profiles, will contribute to removing the misconception that cybersecurity is  only a technical topic, when it is as much about people and processes. In this respect,  emphasising the importance of soft (transferable) skills in the domain will contribute significantly  to attracting more women into the cybersecurity profession. The ECSF will also reduce the  fragmentation of approaches by introducing top-down guidelines for how to categorise the  multifaceted nature of the cybersecurity profession. The profiles proposed by the ECSF are  sufficiently broad to be able to underpin the many roles that the profession has to offer while  being segmented in a way that makes it understandable and applicable for practitioners,  industry experts, policy makers, recruitment specialists and job seekers alike.  At ECSO, we are convinced that the ECSF will provide significant value to  our work and support the wider community with a concrete tool for  harmonising efforts and bridging the gap between the demand and supply  of experts.  B.5 USE CASE FROM ISC2  This section includes parts from the use case written by the (ISC)²29.  Using the (ISC)² CISSP CBK to support the European Cybersecurity Skills Framework /  Cybersecurity professional communities  Introduction  The (ISC)² CISSP CBK – sometimes simply called the “Body of Knowledge” – refers to a peer-  developed compendium of what a competent cybersecurity professional must identify and  possess, including knowledge, skills, abilities, techniques and practices to be successful. The  (ISC)² CBK is a collection of topics relevant to cybersecurity professionals around the world. It  establishes a common framework of information security terms and principles which enables  cybersecurity and IT/ICT professionals worldwide to discuss, debate and resolve matters  pertaining to the profession with a common understanding, taxonomy and lexicon. (ISC)² was  established, in part, to aggregate, standardize and maintain the (ISC)² CBK for cybersecurity  professionals worldwide. The (ISC)2 CBK presents a readymade resource for current and  aspiring cybersecurity professionals to adopt within the ECSF framework.  29 https://www.isc2.org/-/media/9644E0ED44954F7CAF895D45620213EA.ashx  https://www.isc2.org/-/media/9644E0ED44954F7CAF895D45620213EA.ashx  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  47  Challenge  As ENISA describes in their recently published report “Addressing The EU Cybersecurity Skills  Shortage And Gap Through Higher Education”, global cybersecurity skills shortages and a lack  of a sufficient and qualified workforce are concerns having a significant impact on EU member  states ability to protect the public from increasing threats emanating from the ever-increasing  use of technology in society. Despite work that has been accomplished, cyber-attacks and the  threat of cyber-attacks continue to be a significant risk to public safety. European organizations  are struggling to adequately staff their cybersecurity teams. The preventable consequences –  misconfigured systems, rushed deployments, incomplete incident response, delayed patching,  inadequate risk management – make many European organizations enticing targets for threat  actors around the world.  Solution enabled by the ECSF (how the challenges were faced)  To meet the challenges presented by the skills gap and workforce shortage, (ISC)² proposes a  solution focused on helping cybersecurity professionals identify and map needed knowledge,  skills, abilities, techniques and practices to profiles identified in the European Cybersecurity  Skills Framework (ECSF). The (ISC)2 CISSP CBK maps to several skills and knowledge areas  in the following ECSF profiles:  • 2.1 Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)  • 2.2 Cyber Incident Responder  • 2.3 Cyber Legal, Policy & Compliance Officer  • 2.4 Cyber Threat Intelligence Specialist  • 2.5 Cybersecurity Architect  • 2.6 Cybersecurity Auditor  Using the concepts covered in the CBK, professionals who are currently working in the above  listed profiles or those who are aspiring to work in these profiles can use the key skills and  knowledge areas from the ECSF profiles combined with the (ISC)2 CBK to determine how the  CBK fulfills the knowledge and skills required for the position and where they may need to  supplement their education/training from other sources. This will enable candidates to build an  educational/training path to achieve their goals.  The following table provides an example of how the (ISC)2 CISSP CBK can be used by a  current or aspiring CISO to identify the key skills and knowledge areas from ECSF CISO Profile  that they have or need to build. [...]  Result / Added value  The intended benefit of the (ISC)² CISSP CBK mapping to the ECSF is that it will create career  guidance and professional educational pathways to assist current and aspiring cybersecurity  professionals identify and obtain needed professional knowledge, skills and abilities in order to  more rapidly obtain and fill open profiles, as identified in the ECSF, thereby mitigating global  cybersecurity skills shortages and diminishing the qualified workforce gap.  B.6 USE CASE FROM ISACA  This section includes parts from the use case written by ISACA30.  30 https://www.isaca.org/training-and-events/careers-home/career-pathway/european-cybersecurity-skills-framework-and- isaca-credentials  https://www.isaca.org/training-and-events/careers-home/career-pathway/european-cybersecurity-skills-framework-and-isaca-credentials https://www.isaca.org/training-and-events/careers-home/career-pathway/european-cybersecurity-skills-framework-and-isaca-credentials  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  48  Individual Career Decision Making: Professional Credentials European Cybersecurity  Skills Framework  Introduction  Sabine was working as a SOC analyst a few years after obtaining her university degree, and  was interested in learning how best to advance her career. She spoke with her mentor, who  advised her that ISACA had been a great launching pad for his career and encouraged her to  look into membership and eventual certification. One must realize that going into Cybersecurity  gives the possibility to work with everything, from people and psychology via legal, policy, and  governing, down to the lowest (or Highest) level technical level. The challenge is to find a  starting point and then identify what specific competences one can learn and then master to  broaden or even transition between cyber security roles. The ESCF specifies several roles with  their competences needed to work within that specific role. Observe that these competences are  not all that’s needed for a specific role, but the bare minimum. By using this Sabine can identify  the competence gap if one wants to change a role or move into another area within  Cybersecurity.  Challenge  As a new professional in a high-demand field and as a woman in cybersecurity, Sabine was in  seeking help in a few different areas:  • Career guidance and resources—including credentials—to help advance her career  • A network of peers and industry leaders to help her navigate professional challenges  • Assistance in developing soft skills to help her become well-rounded future leader  • Insights on overcoming challenges and leveraging opportunities as a woman in  cybersecurity  • Information to help her do her current job well and help her prepare for future  challenges in higher-level roles  Any individual can use the ESCF to see what roles are needed to handle almost any type of  challenge or task within the cybersecurity domain. Also, by using the ESCF as a baseline an  individual can then identify which competences are needed to move from one role to another.  This will benefit the dialogue between employees and employers when planning the continuous  education within the Cybersecurity field. This will also benefit an individual who wants to enter  into Cybersecurity, but are unsure where to start. For most individuals adding to previous  knowledge and competences is easier than learning something completely new.  With the mission of becoming a C-suite cybersecurity professional in this challenging field  Sabine researched the outline of CISO responsibilities:  Profile 1  CISO  Mission  Defines, maintains and communicates the cybersecurity vision, strategy,  policies, and procedures and manages implementation across the  organization. Governs cybersecurity related activities across the organization.  Manages links/liaisons with external authorities and professional bodies.  Sabine's ambition is to identify the gaps in her skills in order to progress her career with an  appropriately aligned credentials to the next level.  ECSF Solution  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  49  Sabine researched the ECSF PROFILE 1 and identified gaps in her knowledge:  Key  knowledge  ✔ Knowledge of cybersecurity and privacy standards, frameworks, policies,  regulations, legislations, certifications and best practices  Understanding of ethical cybersecurity organization requirements  ✔ Knowledge of security controls  Knowledge of cybersecurity maturity models  ✔ Knowledge of cybersecurity tactics, techniques and procedures  Knowledge of resource management  Knowledge of management practices  Knowledge of risk management frameworks  Sabine decided to take her mentor’s advice and attend a local ISACA chapter meeting to see if  it was the right fit. She was immediately impressed by the opportunities it provided. The chapter  warmly welcomed her, introducing her to several key people in the chapter—people who worked  in exactly the type of roles Sabine was seeking and would be excellent mentors or sponsors.  The chapter’s certification chair informed Sabine that the Certified Information Security Manager  (CISM) certification would be a great fit for her, as it demonstrates well-rounded knowledge of  information security as well as strong managerial skills. The certification is for those with five or  more years of experience, so Sabine decided to make an 18-month plan to study and obtain the  certification.  She joined ISACA as a member that night and took full advantage of the resources the  association offered at both the global and local levels. She joined the association’s online  communities, began attending webinars and local chapter meetings offered through  SheLeadsTech, a program offered by ISACA’s One in Tech Foundation. And she attended  nearly every meeting the local chapter offered.  Just six months into her membership, a fellow chapter member approached her about a job as  an information security analyst at their organization.  Result  Sabine has now been a member of ISACA for seven years. She earned her CISM certification  and was soon promoted to information security manager. She is now a director of information  security, with a clear path to a CISO role.  In addition to finding credentials and jobs through ISACA, Sabine also found several resources  that helped her add value to her organization. Before GDPR went into effect, Sabine was able to  leverage the GDPR Resource Hub offered by ISACA to help her understand the situation  thoroughly and learn what the most critical steps to take were in her current role.  The interest and experience she gained in privacy as a result of that project enabled her to  qualify for ISACA’s Certified Data Privacy Solutions Engineer (CDPSE) credential through its  early adopter program.  She has presented at ISACA conferences at the chapter and national levels—honing her  communications skills—and she took on a chapter board position last year. As a director, she  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  50  has had the opportunity to hire for a few positions, and most of her hires have come from the  ISACA chapter—just as she found her first promotion six years ago. Having seen the value of  the CISM certification in her own career, she has begun offering CISM certification prep to her  team through ISACA’s enterprise training offerings.  Sabine’s newest area of focus as she prepares for her CISO role is securing emerging  technologies. Given the increased regulatory focus on AI in Europe, she has directed her efforts  on that area first, recently obtaining an Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals Certificate from  ISACA.  Seven years after walking through the doors of her first ISACA chapter meeting, Sabine has  grown her network by hundreds of professionals locally and thousands globally. She is a  confident leader and speaker, and she is now a mentor to several others who were once in her  position. Among her advice to her mentees is to always be learning—and that ISACA, as a  global learning community, is a great resource.  Sabine has outlined steps to take to get the C-suite and plans to hold a CISO role within five  years. She is confident that her ISACA network and credentials will be a significant advantage  as she pursues her goals.  Career Path:  • SOC Analyst  • Information Security Analyst  • Information Security Manager  • Director of Information Security.  B.7 USE CASE FROM SANS/GIAC  This section includes parts from the use case written by SANS institute and GIAC (Global  Information Assurance Certification)31.  Why Workforce Frameworks and Certifications Matter in Cybersecurity  The Network and Information (NIS) II Directive is an update to the existing mandate for the  European Union. This will help to encourage a common cyber security language across a  broader range of sectors of the economy and will require sharing of information between  member states and cross sectors. Directives like this one have increasing importance in  establishing guardrails for cyber activities. To protect shareholder value, the Security and  Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering a cyber report for publicly traded companies  requiring reporting on how their security teams will manage risk, incidents, and the cyber  expertise of the board of the directors. The security risk mitigation report will tie back to job roles  skill sets.  Frameworks are helping to articulate these job roles. Most job openings until recently were  generic listings seeking cyber security professionals without well-defined tasks, skills, or the  knowledge of what is needed to protect the organizations assets. Workforce frameworks such  as the ECSF European Cybersecurity Skills Framework (ECSF) are starting to standardize the  talent needed for positions as a Cyber Incident Responder, Digital Forensics Investigator, and  Chief Information Security Officer. Standardization enables organizations to identify the right  31 https://www.giac.org/blog/why-workforce-frameworks-certifications-matter-cybersecurity/  https://www.giac.org/blog/why-workforce-frameworks-certifications-matter-cybersecurity/  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  51  talent to handle future threats. This is in-line with other professions. For example, doctors have  specialized areas such as radiologists, pediatricians, and brain surgeons who have the  expertise needed in their area to provide proper treatment.  Certification plays an important part in readying people for specific job roles. Certification  validates the individual by utilizing best practices and guidelines for educational and  psychological testing such as ISO/IEC 17024 International Standards. An example of a  certification considered the global standard is a Certified Public Accountant (CPA). Work  experience can make someone an expert, but the CPA is the well-respected baseline of a  certified professional and can even be a requirement for compliance on specific projects or  audits.  Some examples where workforce frameworks have helped advance the cyber security industry  include:  • Large tech and financial firms often have multiple security teams that are standardizing  their work roles and requirements through the framework to reposition and rotate  workers quickly based on the mission.  • Organizations can map their workforce’s experience and certification to quickly match  staff skills with project requirements. This is especially important for consulting firms,  tech firms, and contractors.  • Frameworks provide a common language in the workforce across industries like  technology, financial, healthcare, retail, and utilities, allowing teams to work together to  protect cyber and physical security threats.  • Frameworks provide a template for academic institutions to bridge the gap between  their educational offerings and the current cyber security skills needed across  industries, preparing their students for jobs.  SANS and GIAC understand the importance of frameworks and have aligned courses and  certifications to these frameworks. Frameworks are a template for organizations to standardize  job requirements even though every organization and mission will need some customization tied  to their specific mission. We have helped design and implement workforce development  programs using frameworks as a template for Fortune 500 companies, government agencies,  and organizations of all sizes.

By looking into the problem, ENISA identified Europe’s need  for a comprehensive approach to define a set of cybersecurity roles and skills that could be  leveraged to reduce the shortage and the skills gap. ENISA has worked on the development of  such a framework and presents the European Cybersecurity Skills Framework (ECSF),  which is intended to strengthen European cybersecurity culture by providing a common  European language across communities, taking an essential step forward towards Europe’s  digital future.  The ECSF provides a practical tool to support the identification and articulation of tasks,  competences, skills and knowledge associated with the roles of European cybersecurity  professionals. The main purpose of the framework is to create a common understanding  between individuals, employers and providers of learning programmes across EU Member  States, making it a valuable tool to bridge the gap between the cybersecurity professional  workplace and learning environments.  The framework describes the most important requirements of a professional cybersecurity  workplace by defining a set of 12 typical cybersecurity professional role profiles. These  profiles provide a common understanding of the main cybersecurity missions, tasks and skills  needed in a professional cybersecurity context, making it the perfect reference for profiling skills  and knowledge needed by cybersecurity professionals. The framework was designed to be  easily understood and comprehensive enough to provide appropriate in-depth cybersecurity  insights as well as flexible enough to allow customisation based on each user’s needs. By  incorporating all stakeholder perspectives, the framework is applicable to all types of  organisations and supports the development of all cybersecurity professions.  The ECSF is the result of work conducted by ENISA’s Ad-Hoc Working Group on the European  Cybersecurity Skills Framework1 formed by experts representing various views. The developed  framework is based on an analysis of existing frameworks, the results and findings from  research on market needs and agreement among experts. User case studies and indicative  examples, inspired by various workplace and learning environments, demonstrate the practical  implementation of this framework and support this work.  The main benefits of using the ECSF were found to be:  • ensuring a common terminology and shared understanding regarding cybersecurity  professionals across the EU;  • identifying the critical skills-set required from the perspective of the cybersecurity  workforce to support its further development and enhancement;  • promoting harmonisation in cybersecurity education, training and workforce  development programmes.  This ECSF User Manual provides a comprehensive overview of the ECSF’s main scope,  framework principles and application opportunities. The primary purpose of the manual is to  make the ECSF easily accessible by, understandable for, and usable by all stakeholders with  an active role or a need for appropriately skilled cybersecurity professionals.  1 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity-education/european-cybersecurity-skills-framework/adhoc_wg_calls  The European  Cybersecurity  Skills  Framework  (ECSF) is  intended to  strengthen  European  cybersecurity  culture by  providing a  common  European  language across  communities,  taking an  essential step  forward towards  Europe’s digital  future.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity-education/european-cybersecurity-skills-framework/adhoc_wg_calls  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  6  1. INTRODUCTION  The shortage of cybersecurity skills is one of the key challenges that needs to be addressed for  a cyber secure European Union. More specifically, there is a lack of skilled and qualified  personnel in the labour market to take on roles in cybersecurity and who can sufficiently  address the evolving cyber threats and the emerging cybersecurity challenges. The gap in  cybersecurity skills has a number of underlying drivers. These include an insufficient level of  understanding of the competences and skills needed in the cybersecurity discipline between  different actors in the market for cybersecurity skills. Over the years, this has become a well-  documented problem2, which continues to significantly affect countries at European and  international level.  In order to reduce the current and the future skills gap and shortage, more cybersecurity  professionals with appropriate skill sets are needed. To this end, the European Skills Agenda3,  the Digital Education Action Plan4, and the Pact for Skills5 remain important vehicles for  mobilising stakeholders to work together towards the goals of the Digital Decade6 by creating  more and better opportunities for training.  In this context, ENISA launched an Ad Hoc Working Group on the European Cybersecurity  Skills Framework7 in December 2020. A multi-disciplinary group of experts was brought together  with the aim of promoting harmonisation of cybersecurity education, training and workforce  development concepts. The developed framework (ECSF) provides an open European tool to  build a common understanding of the cybersecurity professional role profiles and common  mappings with the appropriate skills and competences required. This work provides the basis  for joining forces in a capacity building programme for the European cybersecurity workforce in  accordance with ongoing market demand.  1.1 TARGET AUDIENCE  Whilst the ultimate scope of the content of the ECSF framework is cybersecurity core  professionals, a particular emphasis is also placed on the ECSF target groups of non-  cybersecurity experts who need a comprehensive view of the discipline. This focus makes the  framework easy to understand for all stakeholders concerned.  The target audience for the ECSF is organisations’ leadership teams, human resources (HR)  and cybersecurity functions, cybersecurity professionals, newcomers and cyber enthusiasts, as  well as providers of learning programmes of all types in the public and private context, sector  associations, market researchers, and policy makers.  1.2 STRUCTURE OF THE MANUAL  The user manual is structured as follows:  • Chapter 1 introduces the key challenges that highlight the need to create a framework  for cybersecurity skills as well as the target audience for this work;  • Chapter 2 presents the ECSF design principles as well as the key benefits for using it;  2 ENISA, 2020, Cybersecurity Skills Development in the EU https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/the-status-of-cyber- security-education-in-the-european-union  3 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1196  4 https://education.ec.europa.eu/focus-topics/digital-education/action-plan  5 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_1197  6 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/node/157  7 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity-education/european-cybersecurity-skills-framework/adhoc_wg_calls  The ECSF  provides an  open European  tool to build a  common  understanding of  the  cybersecurity  professional role  profiles and  common  mappings with  the appropriate  skills and  competences  required.

Additionally, the document includes two (2) Annexes that support the ECSF user manual and its  objectives:  • Annex A connects the ECSF to other EU standards and frameworks.  The objective of this Annex is to connect the ECSF with existing recognised European  standards and frameworks that are relevant to this work.  • Annex B lists Use Cases of the ECSF.  The objective of this Annex is to provide real case scenarios to showcase the practical  implementation of this framework.  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  8  2. UNDERSTANDING THE  ECSF  The ECSF is comprised of a representative set of 12 role profiles for cybersecurity  professionals (presented in Figure 1) that are typically required and applied within  organisations deploying cybersecurity professionals. Each profile is defined by a common  template that incorporates key set criteria (i.e. title, alternative titles, summary statement,  mission, main tasks, key skills, key knowledge, e-Competences). The content of each criterion  is tailored to each role but is subject to possible adaption to enable flexible implementation to  meet specific situations and requirements.  Figure 1: The ECSF’s 12 Role Profiles for Cybersecurity Professionals  The 12 role profiles for cybersecurity professionals are provided in an EU-agreed, practice-  driven format dedicated to the cybersecurity professional domain. The profiles are easily  understood and offer alternative entry points according to context, perspective and need.  Through these profiles, the ECSF can be used as a common reference and communication tool  that can be applied across different organisations and countries for a common mutual internal  and external understanding.  The structure of each role profile is outlined in Table 1 below.  The ECSF  introduces a  representative  set of 12 role  profiles for  cybersecurity  professionals  (typically  required and  applied within  organisations) in  an EU-agreed,  practice-driven  format dedicated  to the  cybersecurity  professional  domain.  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  9  Table 1: The components of each ECSF role profile  Profile title The name of the Professional Role Profile  Alternative title(s) Lists typical alternative titles under the same profile.  Summary statement Indicates the main purpose of the profile.  Mission Describes the rationale of the profile.  Deliverable(s) A list of typical outcomes of the profile, also explaining profile relevance from a non-expert  viewpoint.  Main task(s) A list of typical tasks performed by the profiled role.  Key skill(s) A list of abilities needed to perform the work functions and duties of the role. Soft skills and  ethics are made explicit in some cases.  Key knowledge A list of the essential knowledge required to perform the work functions and duties in the  profiled role.  e-Competences  (EN16234-1 e-CF)  Connection to EN16234-1 e-Competence Framework (e-CF) - A common European  Framework for ICT Professionals in all sectors.  As presented on Table 1, the profile for each role is populated by a set of descriptive items  designed to provide a snapshot of the role in terms of its description, tasks and competences.  Titles and typical alternative titles can be used as a quick reference to guide ECSF users to the  most appropriate role profiles for their application.  Components of the role profiles can be altered to better cover the stakeholder’s needs, and  role profiles (from the ECSF and other frameworks) can be mixed together for the same  reason. More information on applying the ECSF is given on Chapter 3.  Soft skills (also called transversal, transferrable or behavioural skills) are components that are  necessary in any professional skill set; thus, such skills are also needed for professionals in the  cybersecurity domain. A wide range of skills fall under soft skills such as the abilities to  communicate, collaborate with others, report, influence, think critically, and manage time and  stress. Key soft skills are incorporated in the key skills component.  For instance, the role profile for a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) includes as key  skills the abilities to influence, lead, communicate, cooperate and collaborate. All of these are  essential skills if a CISO is to achieve her or his missions and tasks. Based on a stakeholder’s  needs, more soft skills might be added to the profile for a CISO or a mapping with a soft skill  framework may be done.  Ethics is also an important cross-cutting element that impacts all the aspects of cybersecurity  and is therefore an essential skill component within the European Cybersecurity Skills  Framework (ECSF). In the context of cybersecurity, ethics is about what decisions are aligned  with our values and what is morally acceptable for both the data owner and the organisation. As  cybersecurity professionals could gain privileged access to various types of information, even  sensitive information, ethical awareness is an important value they should have. Apart from that,  ethical decision-making is an important skill that cybersecurity professionals should have as  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  10  their decisions affect other individuals. As in the case of soft skills, the ECSF explicitly analysed  whether the ethical side of the sector is aligned with European values and ethics.  A more detailed analysis of the soft and ethical skills might be done by the interested party  since the framework is flexible and adaptable.  2.1 THE ECSF DESIGN PRINCIPLES  The European Cybersecurity Skills Framework is based on a number of principles designed to  cover stakeholder needs. This offers easy understanding, adoption and application of the  framework whilst maintaining relevance and impact in the short and longer-term.  Figure 2: The ECSF’s design principles  2.1.1 Simple yet Comprehensive  The framework is designed to be suitably general to ensure that it may be easily understood  and applied by a wider audience. At the same time, it includes sufficient detail to provide in-  depth cybersecurity insights. These attributes facilitate use of the framework across a broad  spectrum of activities and environments and by stakeholders from a variety of backgrounds (e.g.  organisations of different sizes, technical expertise of varying intensity and business sectors  with different core activities).  This has been achieved by applying the appropriate level of detail to the content of the ECSF  that is not too specific nor too abstract. Offering 12 profiles, the ECSF covers a broad spectrum  of diverse work activities but maintains an easy-to-use format.  2.1.2 Flexible and Scalable  By adopting a modular approach and a flexible structure the framework enables each  component to be extendable or used independently. These characteristics support further  extension of the ECSF and/or linkage to other frameworks to expand its applications.  Applying this flexibility, the profiles and their components, as defined by the ECSF, can be  applied on a module-by-module basis allowing each to be adapted to meet specific needs. This  flexibility ensures the relevance of the framework over the years and will also allow simple  updates to the framework in the future.  2.1.3 Open and Impartial  The framework has been developed with input from a large and diverse working group of  professional cybersecurity experts. In order to develop an impartial framework, ENISA  established this group from a variety of experts from various backgrounds. By involving experts  with different backgrounds, the development process of the framework followed a multi-  perspective approach eliminating any bias towards specific areas of interest. Furthermore, as an  ENISA publication, the framework is publicly available, accessible and open.  The ECSF is  based on  principles  designed to  cover  stakeholder  needs, offering  easy  understanding,  adoption and  application  whilst  maintaining  relevance and  impact in the  short and  longer-term.  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  11  The ECSF profiles and components have been developed based upon a multi-stakeholder  perspective with a focus not only upon the viewpoint of employment in cybersecurity but also  from the perspective of providers of learning programmes. Furthermore, the veracity of the  framework has been enhanced by engagement and reviews from a variety of additional  stakeholders.  2.1.4 European  Driven by the requirement to minimise gaps in cybersecurity skills and shortages in the  workforce across Europe, the ECSF needed to be compliant with specific European  requirements, to enable easy adoption and use by European organisations. This direction was  informed by complying with existing European standards and frameworks.  The ECSF connects well with the current European ICT professional landscape to ensure easy  take-up and broad recognition. The ECSF takes the best benefit from existing experiences and  structures and provides consistent links with relevant EU ICT professional standards and  frameworks. The profiles defined by the framework are designed to be compliant and  complementary to European laws and regulations and to enhance approaches to European  ethics as identified in the European marketplace. The ECSF takes into consideration the  requirements for the protection of data and privacy set by European regulations, common job  roles requested by the European market, and European standards and frameworks used in the  ICT sector.  2.2 THE MAIN BENEFITS PROVIDED BY THE ECSF  The ECSF is an easy to use yet comprehensive tool. It is based upon recent market studies, the  collaboration of cybersecurity experts and an analysis of the broader cybersecurity and ICT  frameworks landscape. It thus expresses the relevant needs of the European market. It is  comprised of 12 typical professional roles in cybersecurity, with a related summary statement,  mission, observable outcomes (deliverables), tasks, competences, skills, knowledge and  proficiency levels, as required and applied in the context of work in Europe, to be understood  and used across Europe.  The ECSF provides an unambiguous reference to identify and reduce current and future  cybersecurity skills shortages and gaps. It is generic but at the same time sufficiently granular to  give the EU market a clear taxonomy of skills, competences and occupations in the  cybersecurity workforce. Furthermore, it may be easily connected with other existing structures  and frameworks in associated fields.  Using the ECSF as a common European language for professional cybersecurity roles, skills,  knowledge, and competences offers many benefits some of which are listed below.  1. Using the ECSF ensures a common terminology and shared understanding between  cybersecurity professional demand (workplace, recruitment) and supply (qualification,  training, assessment and recognition) across the EU.  2. The ECSF supports the identification of critical skill set requirements from the  perspective of the workforce. It enables providers of learning programmes to support  the development of critical skills and policy makers to support targeted initiatives to  mitigate identified gaps in skills.  3. The ECSF helps in understanding professional cybersecurity roles and the required  essential skills, and relevant legislation. In particular, non-experts and HR departments  are able to better understand requirements for cybersecurity resource planning,  recruitment and career planning.  4. The ECSF promotes harmonisation in cybersecurity education, training, and workforce  development. Additionally, the use of a common European language in cybersecurity  skills and roles relates directly to the entire ICT professional domain.  The ECSF  provides an  unambiguous  reference to  identify and  reduce current  and future  cybersecurity  skills shortages  and gaps.  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  12  5. The ECSF contributes to achieving better resilience to cyber-attacks and to ensuring  secure ICT systems across society. It provides a standard structure and gives advice  on how to enforce capacity building in the European cybersecurity workforce.  The ECSF provides additional benefits based on the type of stakeholder. An example of the  main stakeholders and key associated main benefits is shown in 3.  Figure 3: An example of the main ECSF beneficiaries expressing the need of a common Risk  Manager definition  A detailed list of potential applications and benefits in using the ECSF based on stakeholders is  shown in Table 2.

APPLICATIONS OF THE  ECSF  This chapter demonstrates how the European Cybersecurity Skills Framework (ECSF) can be  applied in a modular and flexible way based on the needs of different stakeholders.  Specific use and practical application depend on many factors such as the market perspective,  organisation size, the context of a particular performance and overall purpose.  The 12 role profiles for cybersecurity professionals defined by the ECSF are a flexible tool and a  standard European reference for customised use in a particular context.  The following general five-step guide provides basic orientation:  Figure 4: A modular five-step guide to apply the ECSF  1. Analyse the situation of the target environment.  Collect and process the appropriate information needed about the cybersecurity related  condition of the target environment (e.g. an organisation) to create a baseline.

Look into the status of the target environment and identify any specific cybersecurity-  related requirements to be covered or any objective to be achieved by the targeted  environment. Depending on the situation, it may be possible to use the ECSF as a  taxonomy to identify the objectives in question.  3. Select the appropriate components of the ECSF.  Review the ECSF profiles and select profiles that are relevant to a particular situation.  Then select the components that assist in covering the needs or achieving the required  objectives of the targeted environment.  4. Adapt the selected components according to your needs.  Make appropriate changes on selected components to better fit a particular situation  and/or targeted environment.

The framework thus provides a  valuable guide and roadmap not only for building, expanding and running cybersecurity  related functions within an organisation but also for ensuring its cybersecurity related  mission, vision and goals are met. Thus, an organisation can use the ECSF as a starting  point or guide to quickly and easily access the primary roles needed to manage their  cybersecurity risks and build up their cybersecurity approach. At the same time, the ECSF  profiles provide a common understanding among the parties involved regarding an  organisation’s cybersecurity roles.  Three indicative examples, which are presented later in this chapter, aim to showcase the  practical implementation of the framework in the:  I. enhancement of the cybersecurity practices of a small company;  II. recruitment process of a large company with increasing compliance requirements;  III. planning of cybersecurity resources in a large organisation.  Example I: Enhancing the cybersecurity practices of a small company presents the application  of the ECSF to address the needs of a small company seeking to enhance its cybersecurity  structure and practise. It shows how a company might use the ECSF to support the  development of a cybersecurity strategy, including the planning of human resources for  cybersecurity and planning the procurement of cybersecurity.  By using the ECSF as a starting point or as a guide, the company does not need to invent or  research basic roles needed to improve its cybersecurity posture. The roles can be granted to  different persons or can be merged to be undertaken by just one or only a few persons  depending upon the strategy, requirements, needs and budget.  The example also shows how the ECSF can support the organisation in the recruitment process  by identifying the cybersecurity roles and responsibilities that are needed inside a small  company. In this example, a cybersecurity role and skills gap analysis and consequent  forecasting of needs at the organisational level are also provided. Apart from supporting the  human resource processes in recruitment, the ECSF also provides a common language for  procuring cybersecurity services.  Example I: Enhancing the cybersecurity practices of a small company  A small cloud services company became successful in just a few months after the founders,  siblings Alicia and Max, implemented their idea for an innovative solution. Alicia was the expert  ‘techie’ genius while Max was a marketing genius. Unfortunately, neither of them had any  experience in running or building a company. After a year the company started to take off and  so they moved into their own office and employed staff to grow the business. During this  The ECSF can be  used as guide  and roadmap  providing a  common  understanding  among the  parties involved  regarding an  organisation’s  cybersecurity  roles.  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  17  expansion phase, no one considered organising the company. Many roles and duties were  shared, and challenges were handled in an ad-hoc way. Fortunately, no serious cybersecurity  incident occurred during this transition phase.  Eventually, the company gained some media exposure which went viral resulting in increased  interest by new investors and clients towards the small start-up. However, larger clients and  investors demanded assurance and proof of adequate security measures and an organisation  structure before getting involved with the company. The founders realised that they would have  to really shape things up inside their organisation. They were aware that the key to the success  of the organisation was the employees and, to enable the organisation to flourish and offer  resilient services, it was essential to define their cybersecurity roles and responsibilities.  However, the question to be answered was what organisation setup was needed and which  roles and what kind of competences did the organisation need?  Funders used the ECSF and identified that their organisation required five key roles to  support their cybersecurity baseline:  • a strategic cybersecurity manager (CISO)  • a cybersecurity legal officer  • a cybersecurity architect  • a few cybersecurity implementers  • a cyber incident responder.  Looking internally to identify whether their employees were able to cover these roles, they  found that their legal officer was already managing compliance with legal and regulatory  frameworks and that she had an interest in enriching her competences in privacy and  cybersecurity legal matters. Human Resources would be able to support upskilling by using  a list of key knowledge and skills obtained from the ECSF.  The ICT Architect of the organisation had prior experience in secure networks design and  therefore with additional training to update and enrich her competence he could also cover  the organisation’s architectural cybersecurity requirements.  The system administrators were following many cybersecurity best practices but worked mostly  in an ad-hoc way without a strategy or structure. Consequently, the founders identified a need  to recruit a Strategic Cybersecurity Manager. The Recruitment Officer was tasked with  drafting a job description based on the ECSF’s CISO profile and with listing the vacancy on  their website.  Finally, it was established that the company’s incident response functions needed to operate  24/7 to assure the continuous operation of services.  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  18  Figure 5: The key roles needed as identified using the ECSF and the actions to be taken  Example I showcased how useful the ECSF can be for the following benefits:  • understanding cybersecurity roles  • identifying workforce requirements  • evaluating processes and structure  • reskilling and/or upskilling employees  • supporting the recruitment process  • building cybersecurity capacity  • building a cybersecure and trusted organisation  • building resilience against cyberattacks.  Figure 6: Benefits of using the ECSF as shown by Example I  Example II: Crafting a job description demonstrates the application of the ECSF when creating  a job description. It shows how ECSF can be beneficial from the perspective of human  resources without the need to have a deep understanding of the cybersecurity profession. This  example shows how a job vacancy may be created and how to avoid the creation of misleading  or confusing expectations and how to attract appropriately skilled personnel. It also  demonstrates how to combine the components of an ECSF role profile and how to adapt them  according to the job needs of an organisation.  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  19  This example demonstrates how an organisation can use the ECSF to create a description of a  role. Even without an HR background, it is possible to define the tasks, skills and knowledge  required of a candidate for recruitment by knowing the mission of the role. Apart from providing  support to the recruitment process, the ECSF can also help the company to define training  plans for newly recruited personnel. It is noteworthy that the ECSF not only provides a common  language for cybersecurity procurement but also for audit purposes, especially where the  principle of accountability is being implemented, and an essential and clear segregation of  duties is required.  Example II: Crafting a job description  A large insurance company is extending its portfolio into cybersecurity insurance as many  customers are seeking this service. After a slight internal restructuring and the updating of the  personnel inventory, the company decides to add cybersecurity to the compliance department.  Consequently, the compliance department management concludes that they need to recruit a  Cyber Compliance Officer to support the new mission.  The company’s HR department is tasked with finding and recruiting the most suitable  candidate. As cybersecurity is a new area for the organisation, HR must also create a role  description. To define this new role, HR interviews knowledgeable managers and staff to  identify the needs and the key tasks for this position. These needs are identified and the key  tasks selected are as follows:  • ensure compliance with and provide legal advice and guidance on data privacy and  data protection standards, laws and regulations;  • identify and document gaps in compliance;  • develop an audit plan describing the frameworks, standards, procedures and auditing  tests;  • execute the audit plan and collect evidence and measurements;  • develop and communicate audit results (reporting).  The responsible HR officer recognises that this is a complex role and that no recruitment  templates to fit this role are available. Therefore, a new role description and template must  be created and approved by management.  The HR officer, now using the ECSF, analyses different roles within the framework. The  specified duties are included in the key tasks identified in the roles of Cyber Legal, Policy &  Compliance Officer and Cybersecurity Auditor.  To perform these tasks, the identified skills and the knowledge required are as follows:  • Skills  o understand the implications of modifications of the legal framework to the  organisation’s cybersecurity and data protection strategy and policies;  o follow and practice auditing frameworks, standards and methodologies;  o apply auditing tools and techniques;  o work as part of a team and collaborate with colleagues.  • Knowledge  o advanced knowledge of National, EU and international cybersecurity and  related privacy standards, legislation, policies and regulations;  o knowledge of information security compliance and regulatory requirements at  the international, national and EU level;  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  20  o basic understanding of data storage, processing and protections within  systems, services and infrastructures.  A new role description tailored to the companies needs may now be created by mapping and  combining parts of the profile for the role of Cyber Legal, Policy & Compliance Officer and  parts of the profile for the role of Cybersecurity Auditor. Significantly, by mapping to the  framework, this new unique role is based upon the core content of the ECSF. This provides a  uniform and structured role that may be traced back to its origin.  Figure 7: Cybersecurity job profile created based on the ECSF role profiles  Following this mapping to the ECSF, the role description required is available and can be used  to draft the role and subsequent job description that HR needs to obtain internal approval and  publish on the company’s recruitment website. Further elements, such as profile mission, may  be used as the introductory text for the publication of this vacancy.  Example II demonstrated how useful the ECSF can be for the following benefits:  • understanding cybersecurity roles  • identifying workforce requirements  • identifying role requirements  • supporting the recruitment process  • supporting the building of a customised vacancy template  • using a common language for vacancies.  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  21  Figure 8: Benefits of using the ECSF presented by Example II  Example III: A large corporation with its main business outside ICT needs to setup a  cybersecurity department demonstrates the application of the ECSF when creating a new  cybersecurity department and preparing a cybersecurity strategy for the corporation. It also  proposes a categorisation of the 12 profiles into four (4) macro areas for high-level  understanding and communication. It shows how a large organisation might use the ECSF to  support the development of a cybersecurity strategy, including human resource planning and  talent development in cybersecurity.  Example III: A large corporation with its main business outside ICT needs to setup a  cybersecurity department  A large corporation with a core business not related to ICT or cybersecurity services realised the  need to protect its valuable assets from cybersecurity threats. In fact, the adopted business  strategy incorporated a massive plan for the digitisation of business processes and the  dependency on ICT was becoming significantly higher for critical business operations.  As the company did not have any internal expertise to handle cybersecurity risks, the board  decided to hire a Chief Security Information Officer (CISO) to define the overall cybersecurity  strategy in alignment with the company business objectives. This would also require setting up  a department for dealing with cybersecurity risks.  The CISO, freshly appointed, used the ECSF as a guideline and as a solid reference for the  cybersecurity roles needed to handle its cybersecurity risks. She used it as a flexible tool to  help structure a cybersecurity department. She also recognised that, to provide a clear  schematic, it would be useful to place the ECSF roles in the context of a management circle,  under four (4) macro areas: a) Plan, b) Implement, c) Operate and d) Improve.  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  22  Figure 9: Placing the ECSF role profiles in the context of a management circle  In the Plan macro area, priorities and targets were set, strategies, policies and action plans  developed, architectures defined, resources allocated. In this macro area, the CISO, the Policy  and Compliance Officer, the Risk Manager and the Architect profiles were positioned naturally.  Implementation of cybersecurity measures (Implementer) and training and awareness raising  (Educator) were allocated to the Implement macro area.  The day-by-day Operations were the most ‘tangible’ area. Responding to incidents (including  SOC teams), forensic activities are daily activities of cybersecurity specialists. The threat  intelligence profile was also seen as an operational area, as these professionals work on  operational data using multiple sources.  Penetration tester (testing for current and emerging threats), Researcher (bringing new  technologies and solutions) and Auditor (identifying gaps) support the Improve stage.  However, since the ECSF is a flexible tool for customised use in a particular context, the CISO  applied the 5-step guide to adapt the role profiles to her specific needs and objectives.  The analysis of the ECSF profiles helped her define the resource plans needed to achieve the  corporate objective.  In the Plan macro area, she decided to:  • be in charge of policy and compliance tasks to streamline the organisation structure;  • hire a cybersecurity architect who would help to define the overall architecture strategy  to cope with cybersecurity risks and ensure secure-by-design solutions to support the  digital transformation;  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  23  • hire a cybersecurity risk manager who would help assess the corporate cybersecurity  risk posture and help define action plans to manage the risks identified.  In the Implementation macro area, she leveraged the ECSF skills and knowledge  components to understand what upskilling would be required to leverage the internal  resources available or alternatively decide to hire externally. The multinational corporation had  an existing team of instructors in a different field. However, there was no specialist team to  design and conduct cybersecurity awareness or trainings courses. The CISO investigated  whether some of the trainers had the skills and knowledge as listed in the ECSF and the  interest to join her new team.  In the Operate macro area, the CISO looked at how to manage the day-by-day cybersecurity  operations and decided to set up global security operation centres with incident  responders working on different continents to provide 24/7 support. Moreover, a threat  Intelligence specialist was employed to provide operational insights to guide hunting for  threats and the mitigation of risk. The CISO concluded there was no need to hire a digital  forensic investigator but rather engage a specialised consulting company for any forensic  needs.  In the Improve macro area, the CISO decided to employ an external service provider for  penetration testing with the objective of testing the resiliency of the corporate infrastructure  and applications. The CISO also assessed the capacity of the internal audit team and decided to  hire a cybersecurity auditor to audit on security related policies. The CISO did not feel the  need to hire a cybersecurity researcher since cybersecurity research was outside the scope of  her organisation.  To sum up, Example III highlighted how useful the ECSF can be for the following benefits:  • understanding cybersecurity roles  • assisting in the creation of an organisation structure  • identifying the requirements for cybersecurity roles  • assisting in planning human resources  • upskilling employees  • supporting the assessment of candidates  • using common terminology for collaboration.  Figure 10: Benefits of using the ECSF demonstrated by Example III  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  24  3.2 SKILLING CYBERSECURITY PROFESSIONALS – APPLY THE ECSF  AS A LEARNING PROVIDER  The ECSF offers a common language and vocabulary for the development of professional  cybersecurity skills to the providers of learning programmes and learning institutions of all types,  such as Higher Education (HE), Vocational Education and Training (VET), or any other  cybersecurity-related educational programme or training. The defined role profiles provide a  cybersecurity workplace-driven, European-embedded approach to link current requirements for  professional practice with cybersecurity related curricula and learning programmes.  The ECSF defines the typical requirements of a profile from two fundamental viewpoints.  • What does this role in the organisation do?  Addresses the workplace perspective (profile sections on mission, deliverables and  tasks)  • What does this role need to know and be able to do?  Address the learning perspective (profile sections on skills, knowledge and e-CF  competences)  Figure 11: The ECSF role profiles sections linked to the workplace and learning perspectives  The ECSF positions learning outcomes in a real workplace context. In particular, descriptions in  ECSF profiles of roles allow providers of learning programmes to review their curricula in a  structured and systematic manner, including from the point of view of practitioners.  As illustrated in Annex B.2, the ECSF might contribute to several activities undertaken in  academic institutions.  • The ECSF might serve to develop or update the learning outcome of courses and align  it to the needs of the job market. The skills, knowledge, and competences within a role  profile may be used to guide the design phase of curricula and support the  establishment of desired learning outcomes. For example, when analysing the  educational needs of a specific cybersecurity job, an aligned ECSF profile provides a  solid starting point to understand associated educational requirements.  • The ECSF might serve as a collaboration tool for creating joint academic programmes  and for allowing the mobility of students.  • The ECSF might serve as a basis for the definition of a framework for a cybersecurity  curriculum which would help universities to map the main focus of their cybersecurity  programme and communicate it to the students.  As illustrated in Annex B.1, the ECSF addresses some of the challenges identified in the  European cybersecurity professional qualifications landscape. In particular:  • the ECSF supports a cross domain and cross industry agreed terminology related to  cybersecurity skills;  • the ECSF might support the development of an integrated platform for skills to provide  up-to-date information regarding the job market, competences, training courses,  certification schemes and a career roadmap.  The ECSF offers  common  language and  vocabulary for  the development  of professional  cybersecurity  skills to the  providers of  learning  programmes and  learning  institutions of all  types.  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  25  Figure 12: Benefits of using the ECSF as a provider of learning  In the context of the development of cybersecurity qualifications and curriculum design, the  ECSF role profiles serve as a communication tool between employers and educators to improve  the consultation process and collaborative outcomes. The employer can quickly define the  required activities or tasks and work backwards to identify the competences, skills and  knowledge educators should include in curricula. This approach significantly speeds up the  design of curricula agreed between employers, governments and educators.  Figure 13 illustrates how the sections of the ECSF role profiles dedicated to competences,  knowledge, and skills can be used to define learning outcomes, identify the appropriate levels of  learning programmes, and create curricula for cybersecurity occupations. Since knowledge and  skills, like all content of role descriptions, are provided as guiding examples for flexible  adaptation to the context, other sources may also be used8.  Figure 13: ECSF profiles guiding cybersecurity professional learning  Connection of learning levels (EQF) and workplace proficiency levels (e-CF)  The European Qualifications Framework (EQF) is a common European reference framework  for qualifications. The purpose of the EQF is to compare qualifications and learning outcomes  that arise in different countries and national education systems. The EQF is based on the  8 The skills, knowledge and competences sections of the ECSF are neither exhaustive nor restrictive, allowing the user to  enrich them by also including external resources e.g., the Cyber Security Body Of Knowledge (CyBOK)  https://www.cybok.org/, JRC Classification https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/publications/unified-conceptual- framework-tasks-skills-and-competences_en  The ECSF can be  used as a  communication  tool between  employers and  educators.  https://www.cybok.org/ https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/publications/unified-conceptual-framework-tasks-skills-and-competences_en https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/publications/unified-conceptual-framework-tasks-skills-and-competences_en  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  26  Recommendation on the European Qualifications Framework for lifelong learning adopted by  the European Parliament and the Council on 23 April 20089.  The EQF defines eight (8) levels of educational attainment with descriptors that differentiate  each level. The criterion for each level is based upon assessment of Knowledge, Skills,  Responsibility, and Autonomy.  The European e-Competence Framework (e-CF), standard EN 16234-1, used by the ECSF, is  a common European framework for ICT Professional competences, knowledge and skills10. It  relates to competences as needed and applied at the workplace. Dimension 3 of the e-CF  defines competence levels originating from workplace proficiency. There are five (5) defined e-  Competence levels e-1 to e-5 related to the EQF learning levels 3 to 8 (EQF levels 1 and 2 are  not relevant in this context).  The relationship between e-CF levels e-1 to e-5 with the EQF levels 3 – 8 is illustrated below:  Figure 14: Relationship between EQF and e-CF levels  Owing to this systematically developed relationship, it is possible to relate the e-CF proficiency  levels with the EQF learning levels. The relationship, due to the different nature of each  framework, is not of full equivalence. However, it may be applied to increase transparency and  provide a shared language between requirements for professional competences in the  workplace and related qualifications from educational institutions11. Thus, the e-CF  competence levels incorporated within the ECSF role profiles can therefore be used as a  general guide to required educational levels.  9 European Qualifications Framework for lifelong learning  10 EN16234-1:2019: e-Competence Framework (e-CF) – a common European Framework for ICT professionals in all  sectors  11 For further practical guidance see: CEN/TS 17699:2022 Guidelines for developing ICT professional curricula as scoped  by EN16234-1 (e-CF)  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  27  3.3 MAKING OWN CAREER CHOICES – APPLY THE ECSF AS AN  INDIVIDUAL PROFESSIONAL  The common language defined by the ECSF can be used to clear any confusion between  professional cybersecurity job roles and cybersecurity educational programmes. By providing a  common language and a clear description of the professional job roles in cybersecurity, the  tasks expected to be carried out by them as well as the skills, the competences and the  knowledge required, the ECSF can build a shared understanding and provide the clarity  required to attract new individuals into the cybersecurity field or assist them in planning their  career paths.  Figure 15: Using the ECSF to define individual’s career paths  Professionals already working in cybersecurity related positions can use the ECSF as a guide  for advancing in their field. By mapping their skills and knowledge to ECSF role profiles of  interest, individuals can identify any missing skills or knowledge that they need to develop,  master or learn so that they are ready to cover future job requirements or possible transitions  between cybersecurity roles while they progress their professional career. This helps dialogue  between employees and employers when planning continuous education within the field of  cybersecurity. As the ECSF indicates both formal and non-formal learning paths, it also helps  new entrants who are unaware of where to start. Adding to previous knowledge and  competences is often an easier pathway than starting completely anew.  Annex B.6 deals with  this topic, and provides deeper insights and examples in ‘individual career decision-making’  using the ECSF.  Using the ECSF as a baseline, an individual can identify the required competences and skills to  move from one role to another or to identify current training needs.  The common language defined by the ECSF can be helpful for individuals looking for  cybersecurity jobs. The ECSF can assist in filtering job openings and in understanding the job  description while it can also make the job’s overall mobility within cybersecurity easier by  mapping the individual’s skills, knowledge and competences to the ECSF.  The ECSF can  build a shared  understanding  and provide the  clarity required to  attract new  individuals into  the cybersecurity  field or assist  them in planning  their career  paths.  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  28  Cybersecurity is a good career opportunity even for individuals currently specialised in other  fields, hence reskilling people and moving them into the cybersecurity field is a good way to  satisfy the workforce needs of the market and reduce the workforce gaps in the field. Since  cybersecurity is a multidisciplinary subject, such a career change could be faster for individuals  with backgrounds close to one of the main aspects of the field12:  • technical – related to technology, concrete technological approaches and solutions  that can be used to fight against cybercrime and cyberterrorism;  • human – related to human factors, behavioural aspects, privacy issues, as well as  raising awareness and knowledge of society with regards to cybercrime and terrorism  threats;  • organisational – related to processes, procedures and policies within organisations,  as well as cooperation (public-private, public-public) between organisations;  • regulatory – related to the provisions of the law, standardisation and forensics.  By having a clear understanding of the main profiles for cybersecurity roles in the field and a  common cybersecurity language across a broader range of sectors as provided by the ECSF,  individuals seeking to switch careers towards cybersecurity can use the ECSF as a starting  point to identify specific competences skills and knowledge that they need to acquire for the  transition.  Figure 16: Using the ECSF to analyse and compare cybersecurity learning programmes  Whether the individual is already working in cybersecurity (looking to expand their knowledge),  is currently employed in another field (looking to switch career) or is seeking an academic  education (looking to work in cybersecurity in the future), the ECSF can help in understanding  the main profiles of cybersecurity roles (by providing a description and analysing them into  tasks, skills, knowledge and competences) as well as help in the analysis and comparison of  available learning programmes (mapping the learning outcomes to the required skills and  knowledge of the cybersecurity profiles of preference).  3.4 BUILDING CYBERSECURITY COMMUNITIES – APPLY THE ECSF AS  A PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION  The ECSF creates a common terminology and shared understanding of the role profiles of  cybersecurity professionals. Thus, it can be used by professional associations as a standard to  ensure that their work can be used and applied across the EU, eliminating confusion in  terminology and any lack of understanding.  Professional organisations can use the framework to conduct market analyses using the ECSF  role profiles and present the results in a shared language. For example, the ECSF is expected  to be helpful in highlighting the profiles that are lacking in the market, the cybersecurity jobs that  12 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/analysis-of-the-european-r-d-priorities-in-cybersecurity  The ECSF  creates a  common  terminology and  shared  understanding of  the role profiles  of cybersecurity  professionals,  and so it can  eliminate  confusion in  terminology and  any lack of  understanding  By using the  ECSF, one can  ensure that a  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/analysis-of-the-european-r-d-priorities-in-cybersecurity  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  29  are in high demand, and the legislative aspects of some professional job profiles. Furthermore,  by using the ECSF as a common terminology, professional associations may work towards  professional guidance in the cybersecurity sector as presented by Annex B.5.  The use of the ECSF also allows the consolidation of a community of stakeholders to support  new developments, improvements and further implementation in EU Member States. Such a  framework for collaboration enables human interaction which results in benefits such as  knowledge sharing, identification of trends at EU scale, peer-learning activities, application of  multidisciplinary approaches and empowerment to adapt and customise the ECSF to specific  requirements.  Overall, the ECSF can be used by professional cybersecurity associations as a tool to base  their activities on ensuring their EU wide applicability, with the aim of achieving better hardening  against cyberattacks across the EU as a society.  3.5 EMPOWERING THE SECTOR STRATEGICALLY – APPLY THE ECSF  AS A POLICY MAKER  With the ECSF, a crucial professional community secures clear visibility as using the framework  creates a shared understanding of what cybersecurity specialists do. Hence, the ECSF provides  a tool to analyse and share critical cybersecurity workforce related collections of data and  statistics in a common and EU wide understandable terminology. Such data are important for  policymakers as they obtain better insights of the state of the cybersecurity workforce across the  EU, thus enabling them to understand and estimate the future needs of cybersecurity specialists  in quantity and quality. Such strategic input helps to update and maintain the ECSF itself, so  that its relevance in the future remains valid. Furthermore, by defining a common terminology,  the ECSF allows for cross border collaboration between policymakers through data and  information sharing.  Given a structured approach to a very diverse market environment, the ECSF role profiles  provide a valuable tool for the support of policymakers, market surveyors and other  stakeholders with the influence and role to empower the sector strategically. The ECSF Profiles  can be helpful for data studies on supply and demand carried out at national, European and  international levels. The profiles provide a shared, agreed definition to facilitate the collection of  reliable and comparable data in the cybersecurity job market, including the supply and demand  for different types of cybersecurity professionals and related requirements for particular skills.  Policy-making processes addressing cybersecurity can benefit from data collection at the time  of making decisions, e.g. funding provisions, investment priorities and periods of intervention.  Besides the core activities of each profile, the activities carried out by them may contribute to  generating and gathering relevant data sets that can support policy decisions. Annex B.3 shows  how fragmented information constitutes a challenge when making decisions and the actions  INCIBE is taking in addressing this challenge with the support of the ECSF. By incorporating the  ECSF as a homogeneous framework for the definition of cybersecurity profiles, EU member  states get valuable support in achieving their objectives of increasing cybersecurity talents and  becoming aligned with the rest of the countries at the European level.  Given a  structured  approach to a  very diverse  market  environment, the  ECSF role  profiles provide  a valuable tool  for the support  of policymakers,  market  surveyors and  other  stakeholders  with the  influence and  role to empower  the sector  strategically.

Connecting existing recognised European structures of relevance to the EU’s professional  cybersecurity domain was a vital ECSF design principle (see section 2.1)  The following paragraphs provide a brief overview of the main standards and frameworks to  which the ECSF is connecting.  A.1 EN16234-1 E-CF A COMMON EUROPEAN REFERENCE  FRAMEWORK FOR ICT PROFESSIONALS IN ALL SECTORS  The European Norm (EN) 16234-1 European e-Competence Framework (e-CF) provides a  reference of 41 competences as applied in the information and communication technology (ICT)  workplace using a standard European language for competences, skills, knowledge and  proficiency levels that can be understood across Europe. The prime objective of this standard is  to provide a common European language for ICT workplace-related competences, skills,  knowledge and proficiency levels as required and applied by organisations and professionals. In  this way, all sector stakeholders, including the public and private sectors and individuals, have  access to a shared reference.  The standard was established as a tool to support mutual understanding and provide  transparency of language through the articulation of competences required and deployed by  ICT professionals. This standard is structured across multiple dimensions. The dimensions  reflect areas of business and human resource planning and incorporate job and work  proficiency guidelines. In addition, this standard adds a transversal component which provides  basic generic ICT descriptors for successful application of e-CF competences in the context of a  workplace.

Information Systems Governance  The e-CF provides consistent links in the context of ICT qualifications and other frameworks of  relevance to the sector (in particular, EQF, DigComp, European ICT Professional Role Profiles,  behavioural skills, ESCO, EQANIE, SFIA, Foundational Body of Knowledge for the ICT  Profession, ISO and other ICT industry standards).  For each cybersecurity role, a set of applicable e-CF competences was selected at the  application level as an incorporated element of the profile description for the role of  cybersecurity professional.  A.2 EUROPEAN ICT PROFESSIONAL ROLE PROFILES  The CWA 16458 European ICT Professional Role Profiles provides a generic set of typical roles  performed by ICT Professionals in any organisation, covering the entire ICT business process.  Thirty profiles in total provide a sound starting point and inspiration for the creation of more  context-specific and flexible profiles based upon organisational roles, individual job descriptions  or sub-domain specialisations from various contexts. By applying e-CF competences to the  construction of ICT profiles, the European ICT Professional Role Profiles also provide a tool and  entry point for e-CF application to individuals and organisations who wish to work with the e-CF.  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  36  The European ICT Professional Role Profiles are described by using a consistent format  incorporating the following elements: a summary statement, a mission statement, deliverables,  main tasks, e-Competences, and Key Performance Indicators (KPI) areas13.  By adopting the most suitable elements of the European agreed and practice-driven ICT Profile  description scheme, the ECSF profiles become comparable and provide a unique, easily  accessible and comprehensive overview of the requirements for European cybersecurity  professionals.  These detailed high content profiles have loose links to the generic roles incorporated in the  overall European ICT Professional Profile set. From the ECSF user perspective, confidence can  be established in the sustainability of the structure through its association with European ICT  Profiles but with focused application for the cybersecurity community.  A.3 EUROPEAN QUALIFICATIONS FRAMEWORK  The EU developed the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) as a translation tool to  make national qualifications easier to understand and more comparable. The EQF seeks to  support cross-border mobility of learners and workers, and to promote lifelong learning and  professional development across Europe.  The EQF is an 8-level, learning outcomes-based framework14 for all types of qualifications. It  serves as a translation tool between the various frameworks of national qualifications. This  framework helps improve transparency, comparability and portability of people’s qualifications  and makes it possible to compare qualifications from different countries and institutions.  The EQF covers all types and all levels of qualifications and the use of learning outcomes  makes clear what a person knows, understands and is able to do. The level increases  according to the level of learning, with level 1 the lowest and 8 the highest level. Most  importantly the EQF is closely linked to national qualification frameworks15, so it provides a  comprehensive map of all types and levels of qualifications in Europe, which are increasingly  accessible through qualification databases. The EQF was set up in 2008 and later revised in  201716.  The ECSF profiles contain e-CF competences and e-CF level assignments, which provide a  consistent link with EQF levels (see section 3.2). This orienting relationship provides a bridge in  understanding between the provision of learning programmes and workplace requirements.  A.4 ESCO - EUROPEAN CLASSIFICATION OF SKILLS, COMPETENCES  AND OCCUPATIONS  ESCO is the multilingual classification of European skills, competences, qualifications and  occupations. The key purpose of ESCO is to provide a dictionary, describing, identifying and  classifying professional occupations and skills relevant to the EU labour market, education and  training and systematically showing the relations between those occupations and skills. ESCO  is managed by the European Commission, which is responsible for updating the classification.  The ESCO resource supports two of the EU’s key strategies in the field, Europe 2020 and Skills  Agenda for Europe17.  13 CWA 16458 European ICT Professional Role Profiles  14 https://europa.eu/europass/en/description-eight-eqf-levels  15 https://europa.eu/europass/en/national-qualifications-frameworks-nqfs  16 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32017H0615(01)&from=EN  17 https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1326&langId=en  https://europa.eu/europass/en/description-eight-eqf-levels https://europa.eu/europass/en/national-qualifications-frameworks-nqfs https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32017H0615(01)&from=EN https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1326&langId=en  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  37  The goal of ESCO is to describe all occupations in the European labour market, thus including  cybersecurity. It is therefore useful to establish an orienting mapping between the ECSF role  profiles and some of the ESCO profiles.  On Table 5, several cybersecurity related ESCO Occupations are listed along with an indicative  mapping to ECSF role profiles. Since the relationship between them is not always one- to-one,  the following relationships were defined to explain the corresponding connections:  • is – This ESCO Occupation can be mapped to the corresponding ECSF role profile as  both describe the same cybersecurity role.  • might include – This ESCO Occupation may include, based on the context, the ECSF  role profile listed. (This is an indicative mapping.)  • might be included – Some aspects of this ESCO Occupation may describe parts of  the ECSF role profile listed. (This is an indicative mapping.)

USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  38  B ANNEX:  USE CASES  A use case shows why and how an organisation is using the ECSF, emphasising the variety of  approaches and benefits. This annex is a collection of cases that were publicly available on 20  July 2022.  The following use cases are merely illustrative examples. The Information and contents included  in these cases should not be considered as an endorsement or validation statement from  ENISA. The use of these examples should be seen as inspirational cases rather than as  conditioning baselines or benchmarking references.  B.1 USE CASE FROM CONCORDIA H2020 PROJECT  This section includes parts from the use case written by CONCORDIA H2020 project18.  Towards an integrated platform for skills in cyber built on the European Cybersecurity  Skills Framework  Difficult to understand the trainings big picture  The needs to protect oneself against threats to information and operations, to maintain the  cybersecurity posture of an organization and to increase the resilience against such threats, are  still urgently felt by all interested parties. A core component to fulfilling these needs, is the  existence of cyber – competent professionals. And competence regarding cybersecurity is not  only needed for the dedicated professionals (external or internal to an organization) but also for  all staff members of an organization even if they are not directly involved in cybersecurity  processes and activities.  When it comes to the cybersecurity professionals, various publications still report a  cybersecurity skills gap, flagging that the top 3 competencies missing or not enough covered by  the existing professionals varies from one year to another19. On the other hand, a considerable  amount of Cybersecurity related courses and trainings are offered by various European and  international organisations. A simple search on the internet will reveal many courses that relate  to the cybersecurity domain, without providing a clear picture on the competencies offered or  how they could relate to a specific role. To add to this confusion, there are training courses that  seem to address one specific role (e.g. CISO), have similar titles but have different curriculum.  Hence, in several cases, the information provided is confusing the trainee on what and how they  should perceive cybersecurity concepts, as well as how to use them to cover their professional  needs. Besides, the courses for professionals are promoted on a variety of platforms and they  are difficult to be compared with respect to the competencies covered and role profile  addressed. This makes difficult for an individual to build a clear career path and identify  development opportunities.  18 https://www.concordia-h2020.eu/blog-post/towards-an-integrated-platform-for-skills-in-cyberbuilt-on-the-european- cybersecurity-skills-framework/  19 https://www.isaca.org/why-isaca/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/2022/state-of-the-cybersecurity-workforce-new- isaca-research-shows-retention-difficulties-in-years  https://www.concordia-h2020.eu/blog-post/towards-an-integrated-platform-for-skills-in-cyberbuilt-on-the-european-cybersecurity-skills-framework/ https://www.concordia-h2020.eu/blog-post/towards-an-integrated-platform-for-skills-in-cyberbuilt-on-the-european-cybersecurity-skills-framework/ https://www.isaca.org/why-isaca/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/2022/state-of-the-cybersecurity-workforce-new-isaca-research-shows-retention-difficulties-in-years https://www.isaca.org/why-isaca/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/2022/state-of-the-cybersecurity-workforce-new-isaca-research-shows-retention-difficulties-in-years  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  39  The CONCORDIA map of courses for cybersecurity professionals  In an attempt to address these challenges, we have built the CONCORDIA map of courses and  trainings for cybersecurity professionals20. The map is displaying structured information on  existing European offer for short courses/trainings and provides different filters as to help match  easier the specific need for skills development with the offer. [...]  One can choose to sort the courses based on the cybersecurity level addressed (Device-,  Network-, Software/ System, Data/ Application-, User-Centric), or on the relevance to an  industry sector (e.g. Telecom, Financial, Transport e-mobility, e-Health or Defence), but also on  the format (face-to-face, online, blended), and the timing of the course/training.  Missing a key ingredient – Solution enabled by ECSF  Although we are offering on the CONCORDIA map a large plethora of filters to help the users  identify easier the course(s) of interest, the database lacks a key ingredient – the links to role  profiles that each of the courses are addressing through the knowledge and skills covered. The  e‑CF European Competence Framework for ICT professionals available at the time of building  the map defines 30 role profiles and 40 associated competencies but they are difficult to be  associated to the specificities of the cybersecurity domain.  This was a challenge of the cybersecurity education ecosystem we flagged already two years  ago and captured in the CONCORDIA Roadmap for Education21 under the heading C5:  Heterogeneity of competencies related terminology. This lack of a cross‑domain and  cross‑industry agreed terminology related to the cybersecurity skills necessary for a specific role  makes it difficult for companies to fill in open positions. They find it hard to match the recruitment  criteria with the studies and the qualifications listed in the CVs of the applicants because of the  use of non‑standard terminology. Individuals, in turn, cannot easily identify the skills they need  to possess or develop to match market demand. And, finally, course providers have difficulties  in designing curricula that answer to the market needs.  As part of the CONCORDIA roadmap, we pledged for one single platform hosting all the existing  Cybersecurity related programs (university level and Ph.D. programs, short courses and  trainings for professionals). [...]  The platform should consider collecting the content by using categories based on a standard  terminology (specific skills framework included). The categories would be further used as filters  for different enquires of the courses database. The 12 role profiles defined in the current version  of the European Cybersecurity Skills Framework (ECSF) seem to be a natural solution.  The benefit for stakeholders  The adoption of a standard lexicon such as the one proposed by the ESCF, including  cybersecurity role profiles will help companies identifying the right talent for the jobs as well as  education providers to better shape their curriculum to match the cyber workforce needs. By  applying the same terminology and using an EU wide skills framework to job descriptions,  course description and role profile would help individuals selecting the right education modules  to support their career path, and filtering better the jobs openings according to their competence  and level of expertise. Finally, the policy makers would be able to collect more structured data at  country/regional level in support of future policy development and have a solid basis when  coordinating with external countries towards addressing global scale cyber security challenges.  20 https://www.concordia-h2020.eu/map-courses-cyber-professionals/  21 https://www.concordia-h2020.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/roadmaps-05-Education.pdf  https://www.concordia-h2020.eu/map-courses-cyber-professionals/ https://www.concordia-h2020.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/roadmaps-05-Education.pdf  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  40  Towards an integrated platform for skills  Building on the CONCORDIA database of courses and trainings for cybersecurity professionals,  the REWIRE project22 attempts to make further steps towards integrating the relevant  cybersecurity skills related content. The REWIRE CyberABILITY platform – currently in design  phase – will provide up-to-date information regarding the job market, competences, training  courses, certification schemes and a career roadmap.  B.2 USE CASE FROM SPARTA H2020 PROJECT  This section includes parts from the use case written by SPARTA H2020 project23.  Improving higher education using ECSF and SPARTA Curricula Designer  Introduction  This use case provides recommendations on how ECSF can be used to shape education  programmes that are linked with cybersecurity. As ECSF manifests the structure of high-level  profiles from practitioners’ point of view, including main tasks, relevant knowledge and skills, this  can provide more focused approach for building specialized and comprehensive study  programs, tailored to specific profiles, instead of covering cybersecurity in general.  Challenge  Education institutions compose their curricula considering the complete path – starting with the  fundamental courses that are required for the student to learn as a basis for the next set of  follow-on courses, which are often cybersecurity-specific. However, the selection of courses to  be included in the cybersecurity curricula is up to the institution.  Each education institution has its own specific environment (determined by, e.g., infrastructure,  equipment, expertise of teachers, composition of existing programs, etc.) and there is no  universal way how the curriculum should be constructed.  Education providers differ in what concrete subdomain of cybersecurity they would like to focus  on. Some providers are very technical, focusing on, e.g., computer science, some more social-  oriented, focusing on legal and societal aspects. Therefore, the interoperability among the  resulting study programs and a common language is currently a significant challenge.  Some academic programmes do not build skills and competencies that prepare students for  specific work roles available on the job market. This poses a challenge for students which do not  understand what are the occupational possibilities at the end of their studies.  Solution enabled by ECSF  The ECSF may contribute to the following activities that address challenges above:  • Evaluation: Description of profiles allows institutions to review their curricula in a  structured and systematic manner, understanding the practitioners’ point of view. This  allows to understand for what profile institution is mainly targeting their graduates.  22 https://rewireproject.eu/  23  https://sparta.eu/assets/pdf/ECSF%20Training%20and%20education%20use%20case%20with%20SPARTA%20Curricula %20Designer.pdf  https://rewireproject.eu/ https://sparta.eu/assets/pdf/ECSF%20Training%20and%20education%20use%20case%20with%20SPARTA%20Curricula%20Designer.pdf https://sparta.eu/assets/pdf/ECSF%20Training%20and%20education%20use%20case%20with%20SPARTA%20Curricula%20Designer.pdf  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  41  • Improvement: Can be done based on the evaluation exercise. This is especially  important considering the set of knowledge / skills ascribed to specific profile.  • Focus: Education provided by universities may differ in the way they address core  competencies. Some might be more focused on specific technological courses, some  on law, others on forensics, etc. Having an ECSF to work with, they can map their core  competencies onto various courses areas, important for defined profiles. This enables  the institution to develop more effective targeted programs in house around the main  competencies.  • Collaboration: ECSF gives the education providers the common language and  vocabulary for describing their courses, creating joint programmes and allowing  mobility of students.  While applying ECSF to cybersecurity education, the following approach is recommended:  • Courses in curricula can be classed as belonging to either Fundamental or Cyber  Security categories. Fundamental courses are those that might not be directly linked to  the ECSF, but which serve as a prerequisite for later studies. For example,  Fundamental Cryptology is the prerequisite for Cryptanalysis or Advanced Cryptology;  Number Theory is necessary for most intermediate and advanced computer related  courses.  • Once the Fundamental courses are identified, the Cybersecurity courses can be  proposed to address requirements of work roles the students are aiming to. Linking is  achieved based on the content of individual courses, which can be linked to the profiles  and finally to work roles. The concrete steps, [...], are:  a. For a specific Work Role 1, education providers find the relevant Profiles  (Profile 1 and Profile 12 in our example). This mapping, marked by brown  arrows, should be specified by the job advertisers/employers.  b. Education providers identify the necessary knowledge and skills for selected  profiles. These requirements are defined by the ECSF, marked by blue  arrows.  c. Education providers design new or reuse existing courses (in our example  courses 1, 2, 3, 4) that address the knowledge and skills identified in the step  above. This mapping between courses and their content must be done by  course administrators.  d. Having all necessary courses (and all prerequisites for them, general non-  cybersecurity courses, other courses for broadening the scope of students,  etc.), the core of the curriculum is ready.  • Of course, the ECSF can be applied also in an exactly opposite way: first composing  the curriculum from individual courses, analysing the knowledge and skills provided,  using the ECSF to identify profiles and, finally, finding the work roles that are supported  by the curriculum. This mapping reveals what exact knowledge and skills is already  present in the curricula or, on the other side, what is missing and should be stressed or  added to the courses. In this way, the ECSF helps to structure the curricula for a better  fit with the expected profiles and job roles.  Result / added Value by SPARTA  SPARTA project used a cybersecurity skills framework to create a free tool called Cybersecurity  Curricula Designer. It is a simple web application that helps education providers to create new  study programs on cybersecurity and/or to analyze existing study programs according to their  content and its reflection of cybersecurity jobs requirements.  The tool [...] allows study program administrators to compose their study program by dragging  and dropping courses from the left section to the middle section. Courses, from which  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  42  administrators develop the study programs, can be either pre-defined or custom. While  composing the study program, the statistical data about its content is displayed in the right  section. Besides other data, the information about what competencies and work roles are  supported by the program are provided. By using the tool, it is easy to find out what content is  missing in the study program and what specific work roles are best-suited for the graduates of  the program. In this case, the cybersecurity skills framework is the core of the applications which  allows linking the skills and knowledge with job roles. [...]  B.3 USE CASE FROM INCIBE  This section includes parts from the use case written by INCIBE24.  Use case from INCIBE  Introduction  The effectiveness in protecting a country depends largely on the capabilities of its people, and  estimates in this regard are that by 2022, Spain could reach a cybersecurity workforce of close  to 122,284 workers with a talent gap estimated at 24,119. Consequently, one of the top priorities  for the administration today is to meet the challenge of identifying, attracting, developing, and  retaining talent in the various fields of cybersecurity.  Proof of this commitment is the development of the Spanish government's 2019 National  Cybersecurity Strategy25, which emphasizes the need not only to have a defense and protection  position for companies and citizens, but also to support the boosting of the cyber industry,  recognizing the key role that cybersecurity plays in the current environment of transformation  and uncertainty and the opportunity it offers to increase Spain's competitiveness. Aligned with  objective 4 of the Strategy, action line 5 highlights the importance of boosting the Spanish  cybersecurity industry, in addition to the generation and retention of talent for the strengthening  of digital autonomy.  On the other hand, the Digital Spain 2025 Plan26 seeks to reinforce the levers that will facilitate  a return to the path of economic growth, and one of its strategic axes is to strengthen Spain's  cybersecurity capacity to mitigate risks and increase confidence in the path towards a digital and  sustainable economy.  In its strategic axis 4, dedicated monographically to cybersecurity, it incorporates the measures  that make up INCIBE's three main lines of action for the coming years: increasing the  cybersecurity capabilities of citizens and companies; boosting the Spanish cybersecurity  ecosystem around its industry, R&D&I and cybersecurity talent; and consolidating Spain as an  international node in the sector. Spain Digital 2025 already recognizes the key role of  cybersecurity talent as a driving force for the sector.  These national initiatives generate a suitable scenario that favors research, innovation, and  involves the most relevant agents of the value chain, such as educational institutions and  organizations, so that they see the benefit of managing the knowledge, capabilities and  technological experiences that respond to the great challenges that the country has in terms of  cybersecurity.  24 http://www.incibe.es/en/talento-hacker/publications/european-cybersecurity-skills  25 https://www.dsn.gob.es/es/documento/estrategia-nacional-ciberseguridad-2019  26 https://portal.mineco.gob.es/ca-es/ministerio/estrategias/Pagines/00_Espana_Digital_2025.aspx  http://www.incibe.es/en/talento-hacker/publications/european-cybersecurity-skills https://www.dsn.gob.es/es/documento/estrategia-nacional-ciberseguridad-2019 https://portal.mineco.gob.es/ca-es/ministerio/estrategias/Pagines/00_Espana_Digital_2025.aspx  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  43  For its part, the Spanish National Cybersecurity Institute (INCIBE), a company under the  Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation, through the Secretary of State for  Digitalization and Artificial Intelligence; and the reference entity for the development of  cybersecurity and digital trust of citizens and companies, and of the Spanish academic and  research network (RedIRIS), has the mission of improving cybersecurity and digital trust of  citizens, minors and private companies in Spain.  In addition, its mission includes the protection and defense of these groups, the promotion of  Spanish industry and R&D&I in cybersecurity, as well as the identification, generation and  attraction of talent to the cybersecurity sector.  Cybersecurity talent is, therefore, a cornerstone of INCIBE's actions. Without talent it is  impossible to develop a strong industry or the high value-added solutions needed to participate  in a highly competitive market such as cybersecurity.  However, the information available so far on the state of talent in the cybersecurity sector in  Spain was varied and fragmented, coming from different sources, which hindered the deep  understanding of the environment necessary to channel actions. [...]  That is why, with the aim of offering a clear vision of cybersecurity talent in Spain, INCIBE  publishes in March 2022, the results of an analysis and diagnosis of cybersecurity talent at  national level, whose process has been carried out through rigorous analytical premises, global  work approach and participatory and inclusive processes that have taken into account the main  actors of the cybersecurity ecosystem. [...]  Challenge  The recommendations derived from this analysis project are the starting point for ensuring a  robust and profitable cybersecurity industry that is characterized by putting people talent at the  core of initiatives. In this sense, the entire cybersecurity value chain can see this study as an  opportunity to further connect with and better understand the cybersecurity talent in Spain.  It is therefore necessary to structure and implement effective practices that impact the  management of this specific type of talent in organizations. The importance of cybersecurity for  the survival of organizations requires the need to address the problem of identifying this type of  specific talent in cybersecurity, the evolution of the recruitment and on boarding process, as well  as the adoption of actions that contribute to improving management and mitigating talent drain.  For this reason, the promotion of national policies, coordinated from the administration that  focus on strengthening and promoting initiatives to make cybersecurity a strategic priority in  organizations, as well as structuring and structuring a training itinerary for the performance of  cybersecurity as a professional activity are priorities on which both organizations and  recruitment companies will establish in their actions for the identification, attraction, recruitment  and management of cybersecurity talent.  In this way, a set of recommendations are established that this type of agents (Public  Administration, recruitment companies and other organizations) could implement to increase  cybersecurity talent in Spain and that set the starting point to solve the challenges that lie ahead  in this regard. [...]  Solution enabled by ECSF  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  44  There are several factors (political, economic, social, technological, legal, etc.) that can impact  the cybersecurity industry, and consequently, the shortage of talent, gaps and in general a  mismatch between supply and demand.  One of these relevant factors in the European Union, is the lack of standardization of the  definition of cybersecurity roles and skills associated with those roles.  Provide a basis for continuous communication between different stakeholders (government,  industry, academia, policy makers and citizens).  This type of tool serves as a basis for a more competent and complete workforce that  understands the same language as other professionals at the European. [...]  Result / added Value  Therefore, in the context presented, two initiatives have been launched at the national level,  which will give value to the ECSF developed by ENISA and which will be very useful. [...]  Both initiatives, coordinated with each other, will incorporate the ECSF as a homogeneous  framework for the definition of cybersecurity profiles, which will allow Spain to achieve its talent  objectives and be aligned with the rest of the countries at European level. [...]  B.4 USE CASE FROM THE EUROPEAN CYBER SECURITY  ORGANISATION (ECSO)  This section includes parts from the use case written by the European Cyber Security  Organisation (ECSO)27.  Towards a harmonised education approach with the European Cybersecurity Skills  Framework (ECSF)  Having worked on education, training and skills in its WG5 since 2016, ECSO has seen first-  hand the challenges posed by the fragmentation and scattered approaches that exist within  cybersecurity today. In this blog post, ECSO reflects on the existing European approaches to  education and up-skilling and focuses on ENISA’s European Cybersecurity Skills Framework  (ECSF).  Education is not only a national prerogative. It is it also inherently linked to collaboration  between national entities, the wider cybersecurity community and European bodies. With this in  mind, collaboration is key when coming up with pan-European approaches to harmonise  cybersecurity education curricula and tackling the skills or, more concretely, the workforce gap.  There is ample opportunity to leverage the collaborative spirit of the European cybersecurity  community to deliver practical solutions and initiatives that can have an impact “on the ground”,  and ENISA’s European Cybersecurity Skills Framework (ECSF) can play a big part in this  respect.  Cybersecurity education: an ECSO perspective  From the perspective of the European Cyber Security Organisation (ECSO), as representative  body of the European cybersecurity public-private ecosystem and community), the potential  27 https://www.ecs-org.eu/newsroom/consolidated-educational-and-recruiting-scheme-the-glue-to-fix-todays-scattered- approach  https://www.ecs-org.eu/newsroom/consolidated-educational-and-recruiting-scheme-the-glue-to-fix-todays-scattered-approach https://www.ecs-org.eu/newsroom/consolidated-educational-and-recruiting-scheme-the-glue-to-fix-todays-scattered-approach  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  45  value of the ECSF is non-negligible when it comes to linking existing efforts, providing  foundational elements for a European cybersecurity workforce, and delivering a common  framework and taxonomy for the application of profiles and skills. Cybersecurity professionals,  education & training providers, policy makers, and recruitment professionals, alike, stand to gain  from the wider implementation of the ECSF.  The Challenge  It is evident that there is a growing need for a skilled cybersecurity workforce. Various studies  across the globe from industry and academia confirm that the cybersecurity workforce demand  is very high and that it is difficult to hire competent professionals. The 2021 edition of the annual  Cybersecurity Workforce Study published by ECSO Member (ISC)²28 states that the shortage of  cybersecurity professionals is 2.72 million globally which, although having decreased from 3.12  million the year prior, is still a significant number. While these studies offer a basis upon which  to assess the global situation, the reality is that it is very difficult to quantify the extent of the  cybersecurity talent shortage in Europe. We know that the demand for experts will inevitably rise  due to the growth of the cybersecurity market and regulatory landscape, leaving an urgent gap  to fill with more (and different kinds of) experts. [...]  But it is not only a matter of numbers. Through a recent ECSO study on HR recruitment  practices and trends, ECSO has also observed an increase in the time it takes, on average, for  organisations to fill their cybersecurity positions. Many organisations indicate that it may take up  to six months for the recruitment process, which is slower than in order knowledge domains,  while others state that they have difficulties with filling their cybersecurity positions altogether.  This clearly indicates that there is a mismatch between the supply and demand (i.e. gap  between academia and industry requirements) and push/pull factors (i.e. candidate suitability  and assessment, attraction to jobs and benefits). However, the main issue for employers  remains the general lack, worldwide, of cybersecurity specialists, while the demand is constantly  growing. Several organisations also highlight the complexity of hiring experts for a domain that  they do not master. ECSO’s survey also indicated that, as a growing trend, several candidates,  despite lacking significant cybersecurity skills, still enrich their CV with cybersecurity concepts  and keywords.  These challenges clearly highlight the need for a common language to support recruitment  efforts and the importance of considering the multidisciplinary nature of cybersecurity that is so  unique to the field vs the more traditional IT/ICT professions. While existing frameworks such as  NICE, CyBoK, and eCF provide useful guidelines for skills development, a European framework  that provides an overarching profile taxonomy and career pathways inherent to cybersecurity,  has been missing. The release of the ECSF is therefore very timely and fundamental to  supporting the European cybersecurity community in attracting, skilling, and re-skilling experts.  There is a solution  ECSO will apply the ECSF in a number of ways to boost its uptake and leverage its potential to  harmonise cybersecurity education and skills across Europe.  ECSO will:  • Map out its Minimum Reference Curriculum to the ECSF, giving course designers and  practitioners a first-hand look at how best to define their curricula towards dedicated  career pathways. This will help ensure that university courses adequately reflect the  realities of the needs of the cybersecurity job market while allowing for a continuous  updating of the curriculum.  28 https://www.isc2.org/Research/Workforce-Study  https://www.isc2.org/Research/Workforce-Study  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  46  • Use the ECSF and associated use manual to support HR/recruitment in the drafting of  job advertisements and organisation of practical skills assessment/evaluation  procedures. We will also conduct a follow up HR survey using the ECSF job profiles to  understand what roles are most needed by organisations and progressively build up a  quantitative understanding of the European cybersecurity job market.  • Use the ECSF as base taxonomy for two dedicated platforms envisaged by the  Women4Cyber Foundation and ECSO [...]  Result and added value  The added value of the ECSF for the European cybersecurity community is first to have a  common framework and taxonomy upon which to work. This will lead to a better understanding  of the skills needs and the practical realities of different job profiles, which will enhance the  cybersecurity workforce, not only through more efficient recruitment and retention measures, but  also through facilitating the entry or re-entry of more women and other underrepresented groups  (i.e., the neurodiverse) into the field. The ECSF, in highlighting the technical and non-technical  aspects of different profiles, will contribute to removing the misconception that cybersecurity is  only a technical topic, when it is as much about people and processes. In this respect,  emphasising the importance of soft (transferable) skills in the domain will contribute significantly  to attracting more women into the cybersecurity profession. The ECSF will also reduce the  fragmentation of approaches by introducing top-down guidelines for how to categorise the  multifaceted nature of the cybersecurity profession. The profiles proposed by the ECSF are  sufficiently broad to be able to underpin the many roles that the profession has to offer while  being segmented in a way that makes it understandable and applicable for practitioners,  industry experts, policy makers, recruitment specialists and job seekers alike.  At ECSO, we are convinced that the ECSF will provide significant value to  our work and support the wider community with a concrete tool for  harmonising efforts and bridging the gap between the demand and supply  of experts.  B.5 USE CASE FROM ISC2  This section includes parts from the use case written by the (ISC)²29.  Using the (ISC)² CISSP CBK to support the European Cybersecurity Skills Framework /  Cybersecurity professional communities  Introduction  The (ISC)² CISSP CBK – sometimes simply called the “Body of Knowledge” – refers to a peer-  developed compendium of what a competent cybersecurity professional must identify and  possess, including knowledge, skills, abilities, techniques and practices to be successful. The  (ISC)² CBK is a collection of topics relevant to cybersecurity professionals around the world. It  establishes a common framework of information security terms and principles which enables  cybersecurity and IT/ICT professionals worldwide to discuss, debate and resolve matters  pertaining to the profession with a common understanding, taxonomy and lexicon. (ISC)² was  established, in part, to aggregate, standardize and maintain the (ISC)² CBK for cybersecurity  professionals worldwide. The (ISC)2 CBK presents a readymade resource for current and  aspiring cybersecurity professionals to adopt within the ECSF framework.  29 https://www.isc2.org/-/media/9644E0ED44954F7CAF895D45620213EA.ashx  https://www.isc2.org/-/media/9644E0ED44954F7CAF895D45620213EA.ashx  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  47  Challenge  As ENISA describes in their recently published report “Addressing The EU Cybersecurity Skills  Shortage And Gap Through Higher Education”, global cybersecurity skills shortages and a lack  of a sufficient and qualified workforce are concerns having a significant impact on EU member  states ability to protect the public from increasing threats emanating from the ever-increasing  use of technology in society. Despite work that has been accomplished, cyber-attacks and the  threat of cyber-attacks continue to be a significant risk to public safety. European organizations  are struggling to adequately staff their cybersecurity teams. The preventable consequences –  misconfigured systems, rushed deployments, incomplete incident response, delayed patching,  inadequate risk management – make many European organizations enticing targets for threat  actors around the world.  Solution enabled by the ECSF (how the challenges were faced)  To meet the challenges presented by the skills gap and workforce shortage, (ISC)² proposes a  solution focused on helping cybersecurity professionals identify and map needed knowledge,  skills, abilities, techniques and practices to profiles identified in the European Cybersecurity  Skills Framework (ECSF). The (ISC)2 CISSP CBK maps to several skills and knowledge areas  in the following ECSF profiles:  • 2.1 Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)  • 2.2 Cyber Incident Responder  • 2.3 Cyber Legal, Policy & Compliance Officer  • 2.4 Cyber Threat Intelligence Specialist  • 2.5 Cybersecurity Architect  • 2.6 Cybersecurity Auditor  Using the concepts covered in the CBK, professionals who are currently working in the above  listed profiles or those who are aspiring to work in these profiles can use the key skills and  knowledge areas from the ECSF profiles combined with the (ISC)2 CBK to determine how the  CBK fulfills the knowledge and skills required for the position and where they may need to  supplement their education/training from other sources. This will enable candidates to build an  educational/training path to achieve their goals.  The following table provides an example of how the (ISC)2 CISSP CBK can be used by a  current or aspiring CISO to identify the key skills and knowledge areas from ECSF CISO Profile  that they have or need to build. [...]  Result / Added value  The intended benefit of the (ISC)² CISSP CBK mapping to the ECSF is that it will create career  guidance and professional educational pathways to assist current and aspiring cybersecurity  professionals identify and obtain needed professional knowledge, skills and abilities in order to  more rapidly obtain and fill open profiles, as identified in the ECSF, thereby mitigating global  cybersecurity skills shortages and diminishing the qualified workforce gap.  B.6 USE CASE FROM ISACA  This section includes parts from the use case written by ISACA30.  30 https://www.isaca.org/training-and-events/careers-home/career-pathway/european-cybersecurity-skills-framework-and- isaca-credentials  https://www.isaca.org/training-and-events/careers-home/career-pathway/european-cybersecurity-skills-framework-and-isaca-credentials https://www.isaca.org/training-and-events/careers-home/career-pathway/european-cybersecurity-skills-framework-and-isaca-credentials  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  48  Individual Career Decision Making: Professional Credentials European Cybersecurity  Skills Framework  Introduction  Sabine was working as a SOC analyst a few years after obtaining her university degree, and  was interested in learning how best to advance her career. She spoke with her mentor, who  advised her that ISACA had been a great launching pad for his career and encouraged her to  look into membership and eventual certification. One must realize that going into Cybersecurity  gives the possibility to work with everything, from people and psychology via legal, policy, and  governing, down to the lowest (or Highest) level technical level. The challenge is to find a  starting point and then identify what specific competences one can learn and then master to  broaden or even transition between cyber security roles. The ESCF specifies several roles with  their competences needed to work within that specific role. Observe that these competences are  not all that’s needed for a specific role, but the bare minimum. By using this Sabine can identify  the competence gap if one wants to change a role or move into another area within  Cybersecurity.  Challenge  As a new professional in a high-demand field and as a woman in cybersecurity, Sabine was in  seeking help in a few different areas:  • Career guidance and resources—including credentials—to help advance her career  • A network of peers and industry leaders to help her navigate professional challenges  • Assistance in developing soft skills to help her become well-rounded future leader  • Insights on overcoming challenges and leveraging opportunities as a woman in  cybersecurity  • Information to help her do her current job well and help her prepare for future  challenges in higher-level roles  Any individual can use the ESCF to see what roles are needed to handle almost any type of  challenge or task within the cybersecurity domain. Also, by using the ESCF as a baseline an  individual can then identify which competences are needed to move from one role to another.  This will benefit the dialogue between employees and employers when planning the continuous  education within the Cybersecurity field. This will also benefit an individual who wants to enter  into Cybersecurity, but are unsure where to start. For most individuals adding to previous  knowledge and competences is easier than learning something completely new.  With the mission of becoming a C-suite cybersecurity professional in this challenging field  Sabine researched the outline of CISO responsibilities:  Profile 1  CISO  Mission  Defines, maintains and communicates the cybersecurity vision, strategy,  policies, and procedures and manages implementation across the  organization. Governs cybersecurity related activities across the organization.  Manages links/liaisons with external authorities and professional bodies.  Sabine's ambition is to identify the gaps in her skills in order to progress her career with an  appropriately aligned credentials to the next level.  ECSF Solution  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  49  Sabine researched the ECSF PROFILE 1 and identified gaps in her knowledge:  Key  knowledge  ✔ Knowledge of cybersecurity and privacy standards, frameworks, policies,  regulations, legislations, certifications and best practices  Understanding of ethical cybersecurity organization requirements  ✔ Knowledge of security controls  Knowledge of cybersecurity maturity models  ✔ Knowledge of cybersecurity tactics, techniques and procedures  Knowledge of resource management  Knowledge of management practices  Knowledge of risk management frameworks  Sabine decided to take her mentor’s advice and attend a local ISACA chapter meeting to see if  it was the right fit. She was immediately impressed by the opportunities it provided. The chapter  warmly welcomed her, introducing her to several key people in the chapter—people who worked  in exactly the type of roles Sabine was seeking and would be excellent mentors or sponsors.  The chapter’s certification chair informed Sabine that the Certified Information Security Manager  (CISM) certification would be a great fit for her, as it demonstrates well-rounded knowledge of  information security as well as strong managerial skills. The certification is for those with five or  more years of experience, so Sabine decided to make an 18-month plan to study and obtain the  certification.  She joined ISACA as a member that night and took full advantage of the resources the  association offered at both the global and local levels. She joined the association’s online  communities, began attending webinars and local chapter meetings offered through  SheLeadsTech, a program offered by ISACA’s One in Tech Foundation. And she attended  nearly every meeting the local chapter offered.  Just six months into her membership, a fellow chapter member approached her about a job as  an information security analyst at their organization.  Result  Sabine has now been a member of ISACA for seven years. She earned her CISM certification  and was soon promoted to information security manager. She is now a director of information  security, with a clear path to a CISO role.  In addition to finding credentials and jobs through ISACA, Sabine also found several resources  that helped her add value to her organization. Before GDPR went into effect, Sabine was able to  leverage the GDPR Resource Hub offered by ISACA to help her understand the situation  thoroughly and learn what the most critical steps to take were in her current role.  The interest and experience she gained in privacy as a result of that project enabled her to  qualify for ISACA’s Certified Data Privacy Solutions Engineer (CDPSE) credential through its  early adopter program.  She has presented at ISACA conferences at the chapter and national levels—honing her  communications skills—and she took on a chapter board position last year. As a director, she  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  50  has had the opportunity to hire for a few positions, and most of her hires have come from the  ISACA chapter—just as she found her first promotion six years ago. Having seen the value of  the CISM certification in her own career, she has begun offering CISM certification prep to her  team through ISACA’s enterprise training offerings.  Sabine’s newest area of focus as she prepares for her CISO role is securing emerging  technologies. Given the increased regulatory focus on AI in Europe, she has directed her efforts  on that area first, recently obtaining an Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals Certificate from  ISACA.  Seven years after walking through the doors of her first ISACA chapter meeting, Sabine has  grown her network by hundreds of professionals locally and thousands globally. She is a  confident leader and speaker, and she is now a mentor to several others who were once in her  position. Among her advice to her mentees is to always be learning—and that ISACA, as a  global learning community, is a great resource.  Sabine has outlined steps to take to get the C-suite and plans to hold a CISO role within five  years. She is confident that her ISACA network and credentials will be a significant advantage  as she pursues her goals.  Career Path:  • SOC Analyst  • Information Security Analyst  • Information Security Manager  • Director of Information Security.  B.7 USE CASE FROM SANS/GIAC  This section includes parts from the use case written by SANS institute and GIAC (Global  Information Assurance Certification)31.  Why Workforce Frameworks and Certifications Matter in Cybersecurity  The Network and Information (NIS) II Directive is an update to the existing mandate for the  European Union. This will help to encourage a common cyber security language across a  broader range of sectors of the economy and will require sharing of information between  member states and cross sectors. Directives like this one have increasing importance in  establishing guardrails for cyber activities. To protect shareholder value, the Security and  Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering a cyber report for publicly traded companies  requiring reporting on how their security teams will manage risk, incidents, and the cyber  expertise of the board of the directors. The security risk mitigation report will tie back to job roles  skill sets.  Frameworks are helping to articulate these job roles. Most job openings until recently were  generic listings seeking cyber security professionals without well-defined tasks, skills, or the  knowledge of what is needed to protect the organizations assets. Workforce frameworks such  as the ECSF European Cybersecurity Skills Framework (ECSF) are starting to standardize the  talent needed for positions as a Cyber Incident Responder, Digital Forensics Investigator, and  Chief Information Security Officer. Standardization enables organizations to identify the right  31 https://www.giac.org/blog/why-workforce-frameworks-certifications-matter-cybersecurity/  https://www.giac.org/blog/why-workforce-frameworks-certifications-matter-cybersecurity/  USER MANUAL  SEPTEMBER 2022  51  talent to handle future threats. This is in-line with other professions. For example, doctors have  specialized areas such as radiologists, pediatricians, and brain surgeons who have the  expertise needed in their area to provide proper treatment.  Certification plays an important part in readying people for specific job roles. Certification  validates the individual by utilizing best practices and guidelines for educational and  psychological testing such as ISO/IEC 17024 International Standards. An example of a  certification considered the global standard is a Certified Public Accountant (CPA). Work  experience can make someone an expert, but the CPA is the well-respected baseline of a  certified professional and can even be a requirement for compliance on specific projects or  audits.  Some examples where workforce frameworks have helped advance the cyber security industry  include:  • Large tech and financial firms often have multiple security teams that are standardizing  their work roles and requirements through the framework to reposition and rotate  workers quickly based on the mission.  • Organizations can map their workforce’s experience and certification to quickly match  staff skills with project requirements. This is especially important for consulting firms,  tech firms, and contractors.  • Frameworks provide a common language in the workforce across industries like  technology, financial, healthcare, retail, and utilities, allowing teams to work together to  protect cyber and physical security threats.  • Frameworks provide a template for academic institutions to bridge the gap between  their educational offerings and the current cyber security skills needed across  industries, preparing their students for jobs.  SANS and GIAC understand the importance of frameworks and have aligned courses and  certifications to these frameworks. Frameworks are a template for organizations to standardize  job requirements even though every organization and mission will need some customization tied  to their specific mission. We have helped design and implement workforce development  programs using frameworks as a template for Fortune 500 companies, government agencies,  and organizations of all sizes.

Information security (IS) audits and self–assessment/ management exercises are the two major enablers  to achieve this objective.  This report presents the steps of an information security audit process for the OES compliance, as well as of a self- assessment/ management framework for the DSP security against the security requirements set by the NIS  Directive. In addition, it provides an analysis of the most relevant information security standards and frameworks  to support OES and DSP in practicing the above exercises in the most tailored and efficient manner.  The report identifies numerous parameters towards the successful conduct of information security audits as well  as self-assessment/management. Specifically it:   Proposes an information security audit methodology that could be utilized to facilitate the audit process for  OES by the NCA and DSP security self-assessments e;   Provides an indicative guideline (set of questions) accompanied by evidence that could be utilized to facilitate  the overall audit process;   Proposes to DSP an indicative list of questions, together with relevant evidence, that could facilitate their self  assessment exercises against the security requirements prescribed in article 16(1) of the NIS Directive;   Presents post-audit actions for the NCA with a view to extract benefit and/or knowledge, following an  information security audit exercise;   Illustrates all the information security lifecycle phases and highlights key issues in each phase (e.g. scoping and  main challenges during the pre-audit/ planning phase); and   Presents a comparison of IS audit and self-assessment/management frameworks and methodologies and their  correlation with relevant IS audit standards.  Overall, this report is a guidance to national competent authorities in supporting the implementation of the  requirements stemming from article 14, 15 and 16 of the Directive.  1 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC&uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  06  1. Introduction  According to the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive2 (EU) 2016/1148, Member States should adopt a  common set of baseline security requirements to ensure a minimum level of harmonized security measures across  EU Member States and enhance the overall level of security of operators providing essential services (OES)3 and  digital service providers (DSP)4 in the EU. The NIS Directive sets (3) three primary objectives:   to improve the national information security capabilities of the Member States;   to build mutual cooperation at EU level; and   to promote a culture of risk management and incident reporting among actors (OES and DSP) of particular  importance for the maintenance of key economic and societal activities in the Union.  This report outlines audit and self-assessment/ management frameworks that can be applied:   by both OES and DSP regarding the NIS Directive5 security requirements;   as the baseline for building an information security program to manage risk and reduce vulnerabilities;   to define and prioritize the tasks required to enhance security into IT-security risk-based environments.  Scope and Objectives  The main objective of this report is to facilitate NCA conducting audits and to assist DSP and OES across all EU  Member States to comply with the requirements of the NIS Directive in the effort to achieve a baseline security  level.  This is achieved by:  a) proposing the information security audit and self-assessment/management frameworks that can be applied by  DSP and OES, with regards to the NISD security requirements6;  b)  mapping those frameworks per domain of applicability (i.e. in DSP, OES business environments or both);  c) presenting recommendations to the NCA on how to handle, manage and process the information collected  during audits performed on OES.  The key outcome of the study is a set of questions and supporting information that NCA can use to assess OES  compliance as well as a set of questions for DSP to perform security self assessments against the NISD security  requirements  2 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC  3 ANNEX II of the NISD. According to the NIS Directive ‘operator of essential services’ means a public or private entity of a type referred in  Annex II of the Directive, which meets the criteria laid down in Article 5(2).  4 ANNEX III of the NIS Directive.  5 The requirements are defined in Articles 15 and 16 of the NIS Directive.  6 This objective derives from the fact that there are numerous frameworks developed for specific industries and sectors, incorporating  different regulatory compliance goals and varying degrees of complexity and scale. Therefore, the mapping of Information Security Audit and  self-assessment/ management Frameworks for DSP and OES should ensure the cultural coverage of both sectorial and cross sectors (e.g. as  energy, transport, drinking water and distribution, banking and financial market infrastructures, healthcare and digital infrastructure as  referred to in the ANNEX II of the NIS Directive;  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  07  EU Policy Context  The compliance assessment performed by national competent authorities (NCA) is mentioned in articles 14, 15 and  16 of the NISD and defines risk assessment and auditing obligations for the OES and DSP respectively.   Article 14: “Member States shall ensure that operators of essential services take appropriate and proportionate  technical and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the security of network and information  systems which they use in their operations. Having regard to the state of the art, those measures shall ensure a  level of security of network and information systems appropriate to the risk posed.”   Article (15):  “Member States shall ensure that the competent authorities have the powers and means to require  operators of essential services to provide (b) evidence of the effective implementation of security policies, such  as the results of a security audit carried out by the competent authority or a qualified auditor and, in the latter  case, to make the results thereof, including the underlying evidence, available to the competent authority.”   Article (16): “Member States shall ensure that digital service providers identify and take appropriate and  proportionate technical and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the security of network and  information systems which they use in the context of offering services referred to in Annex III within the Union.  Having regard to the state of the art, those measures shall ensure a level of security of network and information  systems appropriate to the risk posed, and shall take into account the following elements: a) the security of  systems and facilities, b) incident handling, c) business continuity management, d) monitoring, auditing and  testing, and e) compliance with international standards”.  Methodology  This study is based on: (a) desktop research of (inter)national security standards, IS audit frameworks, legislative  documents and regulations, good practices and common key policies; (b) an online survey circulated within EU  Member States (MS) representatives and experts, including all the identified elements of the desktop research.  Target Audience   Operators of Essential Services (OES), either public or private entities, covering a number of sectors as described  in Annex II of the NIS Directive7.   Digital Service Providers (DSP), any legal entity that provides any digital service, at a distance, by electronic  means and at the individual request as described in Directive (EU) 2015/15358.   National Competent Authorities (NCA) on the security of network and information systems, covering the sectors  and services referred to in Annex II and Annex III of the NIS Directive.  Document Overview  The rest of this report is structured as follows:   Section 2 presents and analyses the forms, the scope, the basic principles, goals, and applicability of Information  security audit frameworks for OES and DSP.   Section 3 provides good practices for NCA and recommendations on performing effective and tailored audits  throughout all phases of the audit lifecycle.   Section 4 provides an overview of relevant information security self-assessment/ management frameworks and  alignment to control frameworks .   Supplementary material regarding the standards and frameworks can be found on Annex A: and Annex B:  alongside with terminology and abbreviations on Annex C:.  7 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN  8 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32015L1535&from=EN  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  08  2. Introduction to Information Security Audits  It is common practice to customise an information security standard or framework (based to IT security controls)  to fit a particular business environment. Several criteria (e.g. adequacy, sufficiency, validity and acceptability) can  be used for this9, 10. The \"modus operandi\" (e.g. form, scope, process, basic principles and goals) of existing  information security standards and frameworks are described11 in the following sub chapters.  Definition of an IS audit  An information systems security audit is an independent review and examination of system records,  activities and related documents. These audits are intended to improve the level of information  security, avoid improper information security designs, and optimize the efficiency of the security  safeguards and security processes12.  For the purposes of this document13 according to articles 14, 15 and 16 of the NIS Directive14, the primary goals of  an IS audit, include (but are not limited to):   the risk assessment, identification and classification of the organization’s information systems and/or assets;  and   the overall evaluation of the organization’s design and operating control effectiveness, in all layers, procedural  and systemic; and   the ultimate compliance of all systems and processes of the organization with:   the existing regulatory framework (e.g. European and national legislation); and   the IT-related policies and standards.  Forms of an IS audit  There are three main forms of IS audit15, depending on the relationship between the auditor and the auditee parties:   First-party audit is defined in each and every internal procedure handled by an internal member or group of  members within an organisation. The purpose of the first-party audit is to ensure that a process, or set of  processes in the quality management system, meets the procedure requirements specified by the enterprise. If  the audit is performed by the owner(s) of the process(es) then the audit process is called a self-assessment,  which is a commonly accepted procedure of the audit preparation. On behalf of the enterprise, the auditor16  acts internally and inspects in depth for problematic areas where processes possibly do not comply, and  identifies opportunities for improvement.  9 http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/image/document/2018- 19/reference_document_security_measures_version_to_be_published_44F171BD-9E21-9945- FB43065BDD852E89_52065.pdf  10 https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/initiative/167285/attachment/090166e5b833a031_en  11 Moeller, Robert R.

In this case, an independent company is required  to perform an audit to verify and validate the conformity and compliance of the organization with the necessary  requirements. These certification bodies conduct audits to compare and verify that the QMS of the enterprise  meets all the criteria and requirements of the standard of interest, and continues to meet the requirements on  an ongoing basis. Once, the QMS meets the requirements, the certification body approves and delivers the  certificate to the organization.  The Directive foresees (article 15 (2b)) that a Competent Authority itself or a qualified auditor might carry out  the audit.  Scope of an IS audit  The scope of an IS audit includes various elements such as the description of the physical locations, the  organizational units, the related activities and processes, as well as the timeline needed for conducting the audit.  Determining the scope of the audit procedure is the most vital element of the overall audit planning; therefore, the  audit scope should be based on, but not limited only to the followings:   risk exposures, regulatory guidelines and focus to high risk areas as they deserve closer attention and a  broader scope to cover all the identified risk factors;   critical components that directly contribute to recovery capability and operations resilience; and   the nature of the business operations and the impact on operations of the audit process.  An audit procedure performed by the National Competent Authorities (NCA) should mainly focus on:   high risk areas based on national criteria derived from a previously conducted assessment; or   areas that are considered critical, depending on the OES and DSP specialization.  It has to be noted that the scoping of an audit in the context of the NIS Directive presents several challenges.  Section 3.1 provides more information as well as relevant good practices.  Process of an IS audit  OES as well as DSP should take appropriate and proportionate technical and organisational measures to manage  the risks posed to the security of network and information systems, which they use in their operations17.  Information security risk assessment is the process commonly used to determine these risks and is an integral part  and a critical step in the information security risk management process. Risk assessment, even though it is part of  the risk management process, is an individual activity (and not a continuous one), initiated when required or at  specified regular intervals.  17 Article 14(1) and 16(1) of the NISD.  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  10  Information security risk management can be either implemented individually or it can be part18 of the overall risk  management process19. The overall process and structure of an Information Security Risk Management process is  depicted in Figure 1.  Figure 1. Information security risk management process20  The main outcome of a risk assessment process is usually a qualitative, quantitative or a semi-quantitative  evaluation of the possible risks that a given system, complex or not, is exposed to, taking into consideration its  context and likely threats21.  Key outcomes of an audit  One of the primary goals of the audit, is to assess the design and operating effectiveness of the implemented controls  on all layers, organizational, procedural and/or technical. An additional key outcome/goal would be the assessment  18 Risk Management refers to the overall management of risks. IS Risk Management refers to the management of  risks derived by IT related risks. Therefore, IS RM can be part of the general RM process.  19 Technical Department of ENISA Section Risk Management.

Finally, the following outcomes, is  expected to be achieved during the IS audit lifecycle 22, 23:   information and evidence about conformity or non-conformity to all the requirements of the legislative  context or/and standards;   performance monitoring, measuring, reporting and reviewing against key performance objectives and targets;   auditee management systems and performance regarding the legal compliance;   review of design and operational effectiveness for all organizational and/or technical controls;   management responsibility for auditee policies;   review links between the normative requirements, policy, performance objectives and targets;   review any applicable legal requirements, responsibilities, competence of personnel; and   review operations, procedures, performance data and internal audit findings and conclusions.  22 https://www.iso.org/iso-31000-risk-management.html  23 https://na.theiia.org/standards-guidance/Public%20Documents/IPPF%202013%20English.pdf  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  12  3. Information Security Audit Lifecycle for NCA  The information security audit lifecycle comprises all the steps of the audit process, beginning from the audit  planning until the closure of the audit as well as other relevant post-execution actions. Figure 2 illustrates these  phases; a description of each is provided in the following paragraphs.  Figure 2. Information security audit lifecycle for National Competent Authorities   Pre-Audit/Planning Phase: Information needed for the execution of the security assessment is gathered during  this phase (e.g. assets to be assessed, main threats against the assets, security controls to be used to mitigate  these threats etc.). The security assessment is comprised of a project management plan, specific goals and  objectives, scope, requirements, team roles and responsibilities, limitations, assumptions, challenges,  timeframe and finally deliverables. All of the above have to be agreed during the planning phase.   Audit Execution/Fieldwork Phase: The execution phase is the main audit phase, during which the intended  assessment methodology and technique should be implemented. Upon completion of the execution phase,  assessors should have identified system, network and organizational process vulnerabilities.   Post-Execution Phase: This following tasks take place during this phase:   analysis of the identified vulnerabilities;   root cause identification is performed;   recommendations for mitigation measures; and   final report drafting.  NCA as well as auditing and certification bodies must focus on all three phases above taking into account the:   practices and policies of the auditee during normal operation (security and monitoring of systems and  facilities);   practices and policies of the auditee during abnormal operation (incident handling and reporting); and   compliance with national, international standards and requirements of the NIS Directive.  Pre-audit/Planning Phase  Prior to the execution of any audit, NCA have to prepare the audit implementation phase, while taking into  account numerous factors including but not limited to:   the nature and scale of the audit;   the arrangement of assigned resources;   the understanding of the audit roadmap; and  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  13   challenges and constraints.  3.1.1 Scoping  As part of the pre-audit process24, a scoping exercise, which ensures compliance with the NIS Directive, must take  place. Scoping involves the determination of significant processes, locations (entities) and IT applications and  systems that will be subject to assessment. To identify the above as well as their relevant assertions, NCA are  required to evaluate25 the qualitative and quantitative risk factors related to the audited organization. The scoping  will have a direct impact on the implementation of controls and the assessment of controls to be performed by the  NCA.  More specifically, the first step in scoping, is to conduct an assessment that will enable the NCA to identify the  essential services and essential information systems of the auditee. The second step is to perform the risk  assessment of the essential services and the underlying infrastructure by taking under consideration numerous  factors such as the following:   the existing processes which support this infrastructure;   the resilience of systems and services;   the existing security architecture;   change and maintenance procedures; and   past incidents.  According to  Annex II of the NIS Directive, there are  organizations whose daily activities are based not only on  traditional Information Technology (IT) environments, but also on Operational Technology (OT) Environments (and  focus on safety e.g. oil, gas, rail sector, ). There are different standards and practices focusing on IT and OT  environments, which sometimes create competing priorities. Furthermore, these two areas in many instances do  not have the required overarching governance with established communication and/ or cooperation schemes. This  separation is evident across many sectors (i.e. transport sector - aviation, maritime, railway), introducing in many  instances pitfalls for the audit process and the auditor.  In addition, there are cases where operations of an organization span more than one NIS Directive sector (cross- border and cross-sector) which makes scoping even more challenging.  3.1.2 Pre-audit issues to consider  A big aspect of the pre-audit planning is the timely identification and mitigation of possible challenges during the  audit fieldwork. Important factors to consider may include:   The organization’s business model that determines the IT functions’ structure and service delivery model (i.e.  geographic distribution of IT resources, decentralised IT operations).   Customization of IT and OT environments increases complexity (architectural diversity) in the risk-assessment  management frameworks, requiring a high degree of subject matter expertise during the audit lifecycle.  Additionally, in the context of the NISD audit requirements, the following should be considered:  24 Although audit is not a requirement for DSP, it is recommended that they take into account similar scoping  considerations as these presented in this section.  25 A top-down, risk based approach is recommended in the scoping decisions in accordance with widely accepted  information security standards and global best practices.  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  14   Clear definition of the audit universe between the legal (i.e. regulatory issues) basis and the actual audit  (compliance): identify the information systems that support the essential service and identify the scope of  the audit.   emerging technology and infrastructure changes: transformation, innovation, disruption;   pressure of limited skilled resources, budgets and controlling costs: identifying, recruiting and maintaining  individuals with the appropriate expertise, managing and controlling costs of the whole procedure;   audit (and certification) of the supply chain elements/ dependencies: legal obligations differ between OES  and DSP, therefore the same audit framework/ security requirements cannot be utilized;   bridging IT and the business: IT should be integrated and aligned with the business and strategic decisions;   good practice indicators may differ for each sector and/ or the types of entities that are in the scope of the  audit: a baseline is required to ensure a unified control list for auditing all different sectors; and   sharing the data collected by the audit: sharing of sensitive data should be managed accordingly.  Audit Execution/Fieldwork Phase  An information Security audit is an assessment of implemented security management controls within an IT system  and/or infrastructure and is applicable to both OES and DSP related business environments26. The  auditing/certification body needs to evaluate (a sample of) the evidence (e.g. computer logs) obtained from the  information and operational technology systems of an organization and determine the operational status of the  organization (i.e. whether there is evidence that the implemented controls are operating effectively in line with the  required level of security assurance). In this context, we suggest three main sources of reference, namely the:   NIS Directive Cooperation Group security measures for OES27;   ENISA report on security measures for DSP28; and   EC implementing act for DSP29.  The following security measures can be also used by the OES or the DSP as a tool to self-assess the maturity of the  practices they follow in combination with well-known capability maturity models (CMM) such as the Capability  Maturity Model (CMM®) and Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI), or the Business Development Capability  Maturity Model (BD-CMM®). In principle, the fundamental concepts of the CMM as a model for optimizing the  overall IT (and OT) security audit process can be applied and scaled to enhance any provider in scope of the NISD.  3.2.1 Audit methodology for OES  In this section, a guidance to the NCA on how to facilitate the IS audit for OES is provided. The guidance follows the  categorization of the security measures as suggested by the Cooperation Group (see Figure 3).  More specifically, the report provides a list of questions categorized per security measure and each question is  accompanied by indicative pieces of evidence, which enable the body that performs the audit (as per article 14), to  assess whether each control is implemented as intended.  26 In the case of DSP it will take the form of an internal audit or security self assessment.  27 http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=53643  28 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/minimum-security-measures-for-digital-service-providers/  29 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2018.026.01.0048.01.ENG  http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=53643 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/minimum-security-measures-for-digital-service-providers/  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  15  Figure 3.

According to Article 16(a) of the NIS Directive and its implementation  act30, the security of DSP network and information systems and of their physical environment shall include the  following elements (Error! Reference source not found.):  a) security of systems and facilities: Meaning the security of network and information systems and of their  physical environment, indicatively including measures such as the systematic management of network and  information systems, the physical and environmental security, the security of suppliers and the access controls  to network and information systems;  b) incident handling: As far as incident handling, the measures taken by the digital service providers shall include:  i. detection processes and procedures maintained and tested;  ii. processes and policies on reporting incidents;  iii. an incident response process in accordance with established procedures; and  iv. an assessment of the incident's severity, as well as collection and analysis of relevant information which  may serve as evidence and support a continuous improvement process.  c) business continuity management: Meaning the capability of an organisation to maintain or as appropriate  restore the delivery of services at acceptable predefined levels following a disruptive incident;  d) monitoring, auditing and testing: Meaning the appropriate measures, including the establishment and  maintenance of policies on:  i. the conducting of a planned sequence of observations to assess whether information systems maintain  functionality as originally intended;  ii. the inspection and verification to check whether a standard or set of guidelines is being followed; and  iii. the process intended to reveal flaws in the security mechanisms of a network and information system  that protect data and maintain functionality as intended.  e) compliance with international standards: Meaning, European or internationally accepted standards and  specifications relevant to the security of network and information systems, including existing national  standards, may also be used.  30 Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/151 of 30 January 2018 laying down rules for application of Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of  the European Parliament and of the Council as regards further specification of the elements to be taken into account by digital service  providers for managing the risks posed to the security of network and information systems and of the parameters for determining whether  an incident has a substantial impact, available at https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2018.026.01.0048.01.ENG.  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  24  Figure 4 NISD security elements for DSP  ENISA has already published a report31 with recommended security measures for DSP. The report categorizes  measures, into security objectives with the aim to cover all information security domains and provides examples of  implementation.  The NIS Directive does not strictly dictate that NCA perform audits of DSP. Furthermore, DSP remain free to take  technical and organisational measures they consider appropriate and proportionate to manage the risk. However, it  is highly recommended that DSP are prepared to provide NCA with the appropriate evidence of the effective  implementation of the required security elements as described above.  To facilitate the audit process, Table 1 below presents a mapping of the five (5) elements dictated by the European  Commission against the relevant (based on the EC Implementing Act) security measures suggested by ENISA. It  also includes a list of questions per security measure and each question is accompanied by indicative pieces of  evidence, which facilitate the NCA performing the audit.

Table 1. Audit Methodology for DSP  Post-audit actions for NCA  The results of the audits can be used by the NCA for assessing the security posture not only of a particular operator  but also of the sector overall or at a national level. This will assist the NCA in shaping general or sector specific  information security policies. Furthermore, the audit output can inform the implementation of the required controls  on operational and/ or technical level.  Based on widely accepted good practices, as well as from input of multiple representatives of EU Member States to  the Cooperation Group, the following set of post-audit actions are recommended to NCA:   correlate information security maturity per operator’s importance: The audit outputs in possession of a NCA,  can be used to facilitate the creation of a benchmarking dashboard, signifying the information security maturity  of OES across the Member State. This dashboard can then be used as a reference point for the assessment of  other organizations to be audited by the same NCA and/ or serve as a mechanism for knowledge sharing across  NCAs in all EU Member States;   provide continual improvement: The output of an information security audit exercise can also be used to create  a baseline required level of security for OES across the jurisdiction of the NCA. The NCA can then use this baseline  in order to draft action plans for organizations to monitor their continual improvement towards achieving the  required information security baseline level;   ensure compliance with information security requirements: by creating a guideline on how to comply with  them;   fine tune identification criteria for OES, in the sense that less ‘secure’ auditees might take higher priority in the  national risk assessment;  As far as the assurance of compliance with information security requirements is concerned, the audit procedure  provided in Section 3.2 assures that the monitoring, auditing and testing includes the establishment and  maintenance of policies on:  (a) conducting of a planned sequence of observations or measurements to assess whether network and  information systems are operating as intended;  (b) inspection and verification to check whether a standard or set of guidelines is being followed, records  are accurate, and efficiency and effectiveness targets are being met; and  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  28  (c) a process intended to reveal flaws in the security mechanisms of a network and information system that  protect data and maintain functionality as intended. Such process shall include technical processes and  personnel involved in the operation flow.  Data gathered in the above context, shows that the protection of DSP and OES, in some EU Member States, is  mainly regulated by specific national acts and methodologies. In some cases though OES and their industry  associations may propose their own industry-specific security standards. Furthermore, specific regulations in  certain business-sectors may define additional regulations on audits (e.g., regulations on Health, Financial, or  Energy sector). The use of the audit output, as derived by the performed analysis, is depicted in the pie chart  (Figure 5).  Figure 5. Audit output utilization  3.3.1 Post-audit issues to consider  Evidence Collection Methodologies of NCA  The collection of evidence is a crucial part of any audit. NCA mainly use four ways to collect evidence (in  descending order of popularity):   follow the guidance of a national/ international standard;   follow the guidance of an underlying framework;   follow the requirements of a national regulation; and   base evidence collection on common methodologies/ good practices.  Implementation of Risk-based Information Security approach by MS in the case of DSP  44%  16%  20%  4%  16%  How the collected  information is used by NCA  ensure compliance with information security requirements  signify information security maturity  fine tune identification criteria  for continual improvement purposes  other  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  29  For DSPs, Member States shall ensure that the level of security of NIS is appropriate to the risk posed by following  national and international standards as well as underlying frameworks, which are selected accordingly in each  case. In certain cases, Member States shall proceed with the utilisation of self-assessment methodologies in the case  of DSP.  Self risk-assessment provisions of NCA for OES and DSP  In the case of self risk-assessment provisions, the operators and providers are allowed to perform these self- assessments that will be subsequently audited against international standards and/ or sector-specific security  standards. National and international standards as well as common methodologies and good practices provide the  main guidance and reference point for the risk-assessment exercises conducted by NCA.  Finally, it is important to point out that the establishment and management of a security supervision framework in  the context of the NIS Directive, involves several challenges, such as the lack of resources and the rapid change of  technology and standards. Nevertheless, the effective utilisation of the audit output is essential to the evaluation of  the implementation of required controls on an operational and/ or technical level.  Implementation Roadmap with corrective actions  The end product of an audit is the report which outlines all observations/ recommendations/ non-conformities  depending on the scope and approach of the conducted audit exercise. The audits conducted by the NCA in the  context of the NIS Directive should also include an implementation roadmap for the auditee, with proposed  corrective actions and an implementation timeframe. The auditee must accept responsibility for the implementation  of the aforementioned corrective actions before the agreed timeframe.  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  30  4. Mapping to Information Security Risk Assessment/Management  Frameworks  Defined OES and DSPs must carefully assess the actual level of preparedness and the related security risks they face  in their effort to:   achieve a minimum, adequate and converged level of security in their networks and information systems  (Article 3 of the NIS Directive); and   implement and establish, monitor, maintain and continuously improve an appropriate level of security.  In the context of auditing, the NCA might decide to follow an already known risk assessment/management  framework to ensure compliance of the OES (and possibly DSP) to the requirements of the NISD. In this chapter we  present and briefly analyse the most commonly used risk assessment/ management frameworks. We map these  against useful criteria for auditing. In Annex A the reader can find more detailed information on these frameworks  (tools, plans and methodologies).  Analysis of Relevant (Self) Risk Assessment/Management Frameworks  Indicative examples of the most widely used and accepted methodologies35 are listed below:   ISO/IEC 27001 framework for an ISMS;   NIST Special Publication 800-30 Rev. 1, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems;   CRAMM risk management methodology;   OCTAVE, suite of tools, techniques and methods;   FAIR, international standards quantitative mode;   IRAM2, end-to-end approach for performing business-focused information risk assessments;   BSI 100-3, methodology for performing risk analyses;   MAGERIT, methodology for Risk Analysis and Management;   MEHARI, information risk analysis assessment and risk management method; and   MONARC, risk management methodology.  These methodologies are the most notable in the field of information security for risk assessment and management.  For the analysis of the risk assessment/ management methodologies, a set of key criteria was selected:   scope/ domain: defines the scope and the domain of applicability of the methodology;   focus (RA/ RM): defines the focus of the methodology, i.e. risk assessment, risk management or both;   control compliance-based: defines whether the risk is determined through a gap-analysis of the control  requirements and the maturity with which they're implemented;   flexibility: refers to the flexibility of the methodology;   controlled Scaling: defines whether the methodology can be scaled to the specific needs of an organization in a  centralized, pre-defined way;   controlled Tailoring: defines whether the methodology allows the replacement of specified controls with  alternate controls in a centralized, pre-defined way;   complexity: refers to the complexity of the methodology;  35 For more information regarding the standards, methodologies and tools, please see Annex A:.  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  31   approach: refers to the approach of the methodology;   assessment Guidance: defines whether the methodology determines the risk through a gap-analysis of the  control requirements and the maturity with which they're implemented;   tool Support: defines whether there is a tool which implements the methodology;   supports Third Party Assurance: defines whether the methodology provides an adequate mechanism for the  sharing of reasonably accurate and consistent risk information amongst organizations;   year released/ last update: refers to the release year and the last update of the methodology; and   target: refers to the sector and/ or the types of entities that are in the scope of the methodology.

The selected audit frameworks, used in different settings and sectors, are aimed at ensuring  that OES and DSPs comply with certain requirements deriving from the NIS Directive.  In this subsection we analyse and categorise the aforementioned standards/ frameworks (Table 4) based on the  criteria defined below:   scope: the scope of the standard/ framework;   software Support: existence of software which implements the standard/ framework;   year released/ last update: dates of release year and the last update of the standard/ framework;   target: refers to the sector and/ or the types of entities that are in the scope of the standard/ framework;   national/ Corporate Level: refers to the level of applicability of the standard/ framework; and   domain of applicability: operators of essential services or digital service providers or both.

Analysis of selected Information Security Control Standards and Frameworks  The criteria40 applied in the above analysis allow to highlight the commonalities and differences of the selected audit  frameworks. The selected criteria are impartial and unquantifiable, making the comparison of the audit frameworks  a straightforward procedure.  As far as the ISO 27001 is concerned, it is an information security standard, not tied to a particular national legislation  and it is very popular among security practitioners worldwide. It allows each organization to implement its guidelines  in a different manner and select a method that suits its needs. To achieve this it must be used in conjunction with a  risk assessment methodology that implements it.  COBIT 5 is a comprehensive framework, which provides a business process-based methodology. It provides a good  way of aligning IT and business goals and bridges the gap between business control models and IT control models.  Additionally, it provides common language for business executives to communicate with each other on objectives,  goals and results.  On the other hand, ISA 62443 is a series of standards, technical reports, and related information that designate  processes for applying security measures to organizations in the industrial sector. More information on these  standards can be found in Annex A.  4.1.4 Mapping Information Security Risk Assessment/Management Frameworks with Information  Security Control frameworks.  Risk assessment/management and information security audit exercises can be directly linked under specific  conditions and/or factors. The outcome of a risk assessment/ management exercise could ideally be utilised by an  OES, a DSP, an external auditor or even a NCA as input for the conduct of an information security audit.  There are a number of factors that may correlate a risk assessment/ management standard to an information  security audit standard (e.g. assessment approach, compliance with International Standards, etc.). This subsection  of the report serves the purpose of enabling all stakeholders to proceed following a self-risk assessment to an audit,  using the appropriate combination of standards that will provide the required added value to the organization.  Table 5 illustrates a mapping between risk assessment/ management methodologies and audit frameworks, based  on specific correlation factors. This mapping indicates risk assessment/ management methodologies, which can  provide the input for facilitating the applicable audit procedures.  The research focused on the structure and functionality of the methodologies, i.e. assets or processes, suggests a  correlation that leads to better capitalization of risk assessment/ management and audit methodologies. The  correlations are indicative and not restrictive.  40 Macedo, Filipe, and Miguel Mira Da Silva. \"Comparative study of information security risk assessment models.\"  Instituto Superior Técnico, UniversidadeTécnica de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal (2012).

This correlation  enables exploiting the  advantages derived from each methodology. For example, if the objective is to perform an ISO/IEC 27001 audit,  then it is suggested to use a self-risk assessment/ methodology based on the same approach, e.g. asset based  approach, or the way of performing the risk assessment or the required detail required for the purposes of the  audit, e.g. qualitative or quantitative risk assessment.  These correlations could be utilized by an OES, a DSP, an external auditor or even a NCA as input to the conduct of  an information security audit. This analysis enables all stakeholders to proceed following a self-risk assessment to  an audit, using the appropriate combination of standards that will provide the required added value to the  organization.  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  36  5. Outlook  In its entirety, this report aims to provide guidance to the NCA in auditing against the security requirements of the  NIS Directive. This report presents the full-fledged set of options for the NCA to meet these provisions. However,  the framework to follow lies on the discretion of the NCA. Moreover, this report raises awareness against the most  important challenges the NCA will face when auditing and provides some recommendations on how to tackle them.  It is expected that the majority of the Member States will implement their own sectorial security measures.  However, we consider this report a common denominator of these approaches as it is based on widely accepted  guidance provided by the NIS Cooperation group as well as the EC implementing acts for DSP. In the same line,  Member States are expected to follow their own methodologies to assess the security measures of OES and DSP.  We consider that the proposed list of questions is a good starting point for the assessment because is based on the  most relevant and applicable information security standards.  In addition, the proposed list of questions is outlined with a preventive mode of investigation in mind. Although, all  these questions are still valid in the case of a post incident audit, the MS should add additional questions, which  address the particularities of the specific incident under investigation.  Each identified framework is different, with its own advantages and disadvantages. The MS has to determine which  framework will apply. The optimal choice depends on many factors including the size and maturity of the sector, the  resources and skills of the government authority and whether or not there are well-functioning industry initiatives.  Finally, it is worthy to note that the assessment of information security is not a static point-in-time task but a  continuous process. The NCA should iterate the evaluation process periodically while taking into account the  challenges faced in the previous iterations, the technological changes, the new business scenarios and the new  essential services offered.  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  37  Annex A: Risk Assessment and Risk Management Documentation  Relevant Information Security Control Standards and Frameworks  A.1.1 ISO 27001  ISO 2700141 is an information security standard (Figure 6. ISO 27001 audit frameworkFigure 6), part of the ISO/IEC  27000 family of standards and derived from BS 7799 Part 2, first published by the British Standards Institute in  1999. ISO/IEC 27001 was revised in 2013, bringing it into line with the other ISO management systems standards. It  is published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical  Commission (IEC) under the joint ISO and IEC subcommittee.  ISO/IEC 27001 defines the development of an audit programme for the information security management system  (ISMS) of the auditee. This programme contains all the relevant information of the audits regarding first-party  audits, audits to be performed by clients and third-party audits, as appropriate. The third-party audit procedure is  performed by using several checklists:   audit checklist/ observation form: contains specific items that are particular to the organizational unit to be  audited;   systemic requirements: contains items relating to the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001:2013 and tailored to the  auditee specifications each time; and   control requirements: contains controls depicted in Appendix A of ISO/IEC 27001:2013 and further described  ISO/IEC 27002:201342.  ISO/IEC 27001 specifies that once the audit procedure has been completed, the following steps should be  taken so as the audit programme is deemed complete:   review and analysis of findings;   consolidation of all findings including grouping and tabulation;   classification of findings;   preparation of recommendation and audit report;   classification of findings; and   preparation of recommendation and audit report.  Whereas the national competent authorities are responsible for identifying non-conformities, OES and DSP are  responsible for resolving non-conformities. ISO 27001 provides a taxonomy of possible controls, whereas ISO  27002 provides recommended practices for the implementation of controls. It should be mentioned that ISO  27001 gives auditors a certain degree of freedom, in order to ensure effective and efficient implementation of an  ISMS according to the specific information security requirements of the organization under question.  Figure 1  below, depicts the overall set-up of ISO 27001 framework.  41 https://www.iso.org/standard/54534.html  42 https://www.iso.org/standard/54533.html  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  38  Figure 6. ISO 27001 audit framework43  A.1.2 COBIT 5  COBIT 5 (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology) 44 is a framework aimed to provide an end-to- end business view of the governance of enterprise IT, developed, maintained and distributed by ISACA -  Information Systems Audit and Control Association.  COBIT 5 (Figure 7) is a comprehensive framework for developing, implementing, monitoring and enhancing  information technology governance and management practices by maintaining an equilibrium between realizing  benefits and optimizing risk levels and resource use. COBIT 5 provides an effective approach of aligning IT and  business goals and bridges the gap between business control models and IT control models while retaining a  common language for business executives to communicate with each other about objectives, goals and results. It  is based on five key principles for governance and management of enterprise IT. By bringing together those five  principles, COBIT 5 enables information and related technology to be governed and managed in a holistic manner  for the whole critical infrastructure, taking in to account the full end-to-end business and functional areas of  responsibility, considering the IT-related interests of internal and external stakeholders.  Additionally, COBIT 5 aligns with the latest relevant standards and frameworks used by organizations, such as  COSO, ISO 31000 and ISO 38500. However, even if COBIT 5 is able to bridge the gap between business control  models and IT asset-based RAs, it comes with the disadvantage of utilizing over-complicated concepts and  structures that make COBIT difficult and time consuming to apply it as a risk assessment tool.  43 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/schemes-for-auditing-security-measures  44 http://www.isaca.org/cobit/pages/default.aspx  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  39  As defined in COBIT 5, each phase in the audit process is subsequently divided into key steps to plan,  define, perform and report the results of the engagement, as shown in Figure 2 below.  Figure 7. COBIT5 Audit Procedure45  A.1.3 ISA/IEC 62443  ISA/IEC 6244346 is a series of standards, technical reports, and related information that designate processes for  applying security measures to industrial zones and is one of the most comprehensive Industrial Automation and  Control System Security Standards. This guidance applies to end-users (i.e. asset owner), system integrators,  security practitioners, and control systems manufacturers responsible for manufacturing, designing, implementing,  or managing industrial automation and control systems. The ISA/IEC-62443 series are organized into four  categories, i.e. General, Policies and Procedures, System, and Component47.  The standards of the ISA/IEC-62443 which are deemed critical for the scope of this research are analysed and  depicted in Figure 3, including but not limited to:   ISA-62443-1-3: System Security Compliance Metrics;   ISA-62443-2-1: Industrial automation and control system security management system;   ISA-62443-3-2: (99.03.02) Security for industrial automation and control systems; and   ISA-62443-3-3: (IEC 62443-3-3) System Security Requirements and Security Assurance Levels.  The ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards propose and introduce the novel concepts of “zones” and “conduits” as a  way to divide and segregate the diverse sub-systems in a control system. A zone is designated as a combination of  physical or logical assets that share common security requirements related to factors such as consequence and  criticality. Additional security measures, such as implementing additional technology or policies, are required if the  security level capability of the equipment is deemed no equal to or higher than the requirement level.  ISA/IEC 62443 also provides a framework for industries to achieve and maintain security improvements through a  life cycle that integrates design, implementation, monitoring and continuous improvement. The frameworks offers  45 https://www.isaca.org/COBIT/Documents/IS-auditing-creating-audit-programs_whp_eng_0316.pdf  46 ISA, Safe and Secure: Multiple Challenges, One Solution, 2014.  47 ANSI/ISA-62443-1-1 (99.01.01)-2007 Security for Industrial Automation and Control Systems Part 1: Terminology,  Concepts, and Models:  https://www.isa.org/store/products/product-detail/?productId=116720, Accessed on  25/05/2018, 2018.  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  40  industrial security solutions and the ability to relevant stakeholders to mitigate information security threats that  arise within the segmenting control networks for zones and conduits.  As of today, no ISA/IEC 62443 (Figure 8) risk assessment/ management or information security certification exists.  ISA is currently working on a modified ISO/IEC 27005 risk assessment/ management process. Furthermore, related  audit and evaluation processes are currently being developed, with the goal to provide a way for organizations to  assess their current information security posture against the ISA/IEC 62443 family of standards. This assessment  will be based on controls mainly deriving from related NIST (e.g. 800-53, 800-60, and 800-70) and FIPS (e.g. 199,  200) publications.  Figure 8. ISA/IEC 62443 Phases  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  41  Related information regarding ISA 62443 is not available, as currently no audit/ certification and/ or RA/RM  process exists. Currently, and until proprietary ISA 62443 audit standard is published, third-party assurance  standards are proposed by ISA. More specifically:  In regards to product assurance    ISO/ IEC 15408;    ISO/ IEC 19790 (Similar to NIST FIPS 140-2);    ISO/ IEC TR/19791.  In regards to Process assurance    ISO/ IEC 21827;    ISO/ IEC 17799;    COBIT5;    Draft ISA S99 standards, including concepts and process guidance.  In regards to environmental assurance    ISO 9000 series.  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Methodologies and Tools  Risk Assessment and Risk Management is the focus of the desktop research.

The ISO/IEC  27001 Standard provides a methodology which can assist OES and DSP to achieve all of their regulatory  compliance objectives concerning the NIS Directive by implementing specific controls. Controls recommended by  ISO/IEC 27001 are not only technological solutions but also cover people and organizational processes. There are  114 controls in Annex A covering the breadth of information security management, including areas such as  physical access control, security staff awareness programmes, procedures for monitoring threats and incident  management processes.  The risk assessment process established by ISO/IEC 27001 follows the below procedure:   establish and maintain certain information security risk criteria;   ensure that repeated risk assessments “produce consistent, valid and comparable results;   identify risks associated with the loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability for information within the  scope of the information security management system;   identify the owners of those risks; and   analyse and evaluate information security risks according to certain criteria.  An ISMS is based on the outcomes of a risk assessment based on the ISO/IEC 27001. OES and DSP will need to  produce a set of controls so as to minimize the identified risks resulting from the aforementioned procedure.  B.1.2 OCTAVE  OCTAVE (Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation) was developed by the Computer  Emergency Response Team within the Software Engineering Institute. The goal of the OCTAVE suite of tools,  techniques and methods is to allow “risk-based information security strategic assessment and planning”49. OCTAVE  gives the opportunity to small teams across business units and IT work together to address the security needs of  the organization and face the security challenges. It moves an organization towards an operational risk-based view  of security and addresses technology in a business context.  The methodology is divided in three explicit methods. The primary OCTAVE method forms the basis for the  OCTAVE foundation of knowledge. OCTAVE-S is intended for small and medium sized organizations. The main  difference with the basic method is that the necessary knowledge is assumed to be known in advance by the  analysis group, so the first step of collecting knowledge is omitted. Lastly, OCTAVE-Allegro offers a faster but more  limited approach that focuses on information assets. This approach covers only four simplified steps: development  of risk measurement criteria, creation of profiles for each critical information asset, identification of threats to  these assets and finally, analysis of resulting risks in order to develop mitigation approaches.  48 https://www.iso.org/standard/54534.html  49 CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team).

CRAMM can be used for all kinds of organizations, but it is especially intended for large organizations, like  government bodies and industry50. It is in use by NATO and corporations working actively on information security.  CRAMM helps in justification of security investments by demonstrating need for action at management level,  based on quantifiable results and countermeasures from organization.  CRAMM attempts a qualitative approach that focuses on assets. It provides 10 specific and predefined asset tables  which classify the assets in categories. Those tables support identification and valuation of assets51. Therefore,  each asset can be classified into a specific category, each with a predefined list of known vulnerabilities and threats  that can exploit them. After the completion of identification and valuation of the assets, the provided dedicated  tool automatically suggests a set of all possible countermeasures. However, the usefulness of the method is largely  dependent on the tool which implements it.  B.1.4 FAIR  FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk)52 is an international standard quantitative model for information security  and operational risk and provides (a) a model for understanding, analysing and quantifying information risk in  financial terms; and (b) a foundation for developing a robust approach to information risk management.  The FAIR framework defines the necessary building blocks for implementing effective risk management programs.  FAIR is an ontology of the factors that contribute to risk and how they affect each other. It is primarily concerned  with establishing accurate probabilities for the frequency and magnitude of data loss events.  B.1.5 IRAM2  IRAM2 (Information Risk Assessment Methodology 2)53 is a complete end-to-end approach for performing  business-focused information risk assessments. IRAM2 provides the following:   simple, practical, yet rigorous risk assessment approach;   focus on the business perspective;   extended coverage of risks; and   engagement with key stakeholders.  IRAM2 is supported by four IRAM2 Assistants, each accompanied by a practitioner guide, that help automate one  or more phases of the methodology.  B.1.6 NIST 800-30  NIST Special Publication 800-3054 is a foundation pillar for developing an effective and adequate risk management  program. NIST 800-30 provides both the definitions and the practical guidance required for assessing and  mitigating risks identified within IT systems. Additionally, it provides information on the selection of practical and  profitable security controls that can be utilized to mitigate risk for the better protection of vital information and  50 European Network and Information Security Agency.

It is composed by well-defined and sequentially steps in order to  achieve the aforementioned goals, as depicted below:   system characterization followed by thread and vulnerability identification;   control analysis and likelihood determination;   impact analysis and risk determination; and   control recommendations and documentation of the results.  Each of the above steps produces an output which in turn feeds the next step of the chain. With respect to the  aforementioned, this methodology moves the organization towards to better managing IT-related risks.  National Self-Risk Assessment/Management Standards and Frameworks  B.2.1 BSI-100-3  BSI 100-355 is a methodology for performing risk analyses to additive an existing IT-Grundschutz security concept.  This methodology indicates the way of using the threats listed in the IT-Grundschutz Catalogues [GSK] to carry out  a bridged analysis of risks for information processing. The methodology is required to be carried out step by step  as follows:   preparing the threat summary: produce a summary of the threats to which the target objects under review are  subject;   determination of additional threats: for the target objects under review there are, in some circumstances,  additional isolated threats over and above those foreseen in the IT-Grundschutz Model that must be taken into  consideration;   threat assessment: check whether the security measures already implemented or at least planned in the  security concept provide adequate protection for each target object and threat;   handling risks: decide on how to deal with the remaining threats;   consolidation of the security concept: check the implemented security measures for each target object using  specific criteria; and   feedback to the security process: Once the security concept has been consolidated, the security process, as  specified in the IT-Grundschutz Methodology, can be resumed.  B.2.2 MAGERIT  MAGERIT56 (Methodology for Information Systems Risk Analysis and Management) is an open methodology for  Risk Analysis and Management, developed by the Spanish Ministry of Public Administrations, offered as a  framework and guide to the Public Administration. Given its open nature it is also used outside the Administration.  MAGERIT was developed in response to the perception that the government and, in general, the whole society  increasingly depends on information technologies, that entail certain risks that must be sensibly managed with  proper measures, for achieving its service objectives.  MAGERIT seeks to achieve the following objectives: (1) increase the security awareness of those responsible for  information systems, (2) offer a systematic and structured method for analysing risks, (3) help in describing and  selecting the appropriate measures and controls for treating the risks and (4) prepare the organization for  55 https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/Publikationen/ITGrundschutzstandards/BSI- Standard_1003.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=1  56 Portuguese Ministry of Public Administration.

MAGERIT method has the  ability to project the risk assessment process at management, operational and technical levels. It is supported by  technical documents describing elements and criteria and provides regulatory compliance and compliance to IT  standards, such as ISO/IEC 27001:2005, ISO/IEC 15408:2005, ISO/IEC 17799:2005 and ISO/IEC 13335:2004.  Furthermore, MAGERIT can be applied as an independent risk assessment method.  B.2.3 MEHARI  MEHARI57 (Method for Harmonized Analysis of Risk) is a free, open-source information risk analysis assessment  and risk management method, developed, maintained and distributed by CLUSIF - Club de la Sécurité de  l’Information Français, the French association of information security professionals. MEHARI method bases its  analysis on formulas and parameters. This means that MEHARI can only be used in conjunction with dedicated  tools. It provides a complete risk management model, description of modular components and processes. It also  provides the means to enable classification of assets, the likelihood of threats and measurement of the  vulnerabilities through audit. Additionally, it analyses a generic set of risk situations and provides seriousness  levels for each risk scenario. Finally, it allows an optimal selection of corrective actions in order to provide risk  treatment and gives additional compliance scoring of the organization to ISO/IEC 27001:2005 controls and the  ISMS process.  There is a given compliance of the product with international regulations and with most of ISO information  security standards. Furthermore, this method provides several indicators (e.g. Efficiency, Resiliency, Continuity  aspects) in order to measure the IS maturity level. However, MEHARI risk assessment and risk management  methods require in any case a good knowledge of the business internals and the handling of risk.  B.2.4 MONARC  MONARC58 uses an iterative method which enables the thorough implementation of risk management. This  approach, as recommended by ISO 27005, enables the focusing on critical issues, followed by successive iterations  to augment the target or further liquidate it to restrict additional risks and therefore to cover more technical  aspects. The advantage of MONARC methodology lies in the capitalisation of risk analyses already performed in  similar business contexts. In order to achieve its goals, MONARC consists of four (4) well-defined phases as defined  below:   context establishment: take stock of the context, challenges and priorities of the company or organization that  wishes to analyse its risks;   context modelling: provision of details and formalisation of to the identified assets in a diagram that displays  their interdependencies.   evaluation and treatment of risks: quantification of threats, vulnerabilities and impacts to assess the risks; and   implementation and monitoring: ongoing management phase with security monitoring and recurring control  of security measures.  57 CLUSIF (Club de la Sécurité de l’Information Français).

Information security (IS) audits and self–assessment/ management exercises are the two major enablers  to achieve this objective.  This report presents the steps of an information security audit process for the OES compliance, as well as of a self- assessment/ management framework for the DSP security against the security requirements set by the NIS  Directive. In addition, it provides an analysis of the most relevant information security standards and frameworks  to support OES and DSP in practicing the above exercises in the most tailored and efficient manner.  The report identifies numerous parameters towards the successful conduct of information security audits as well  as self-assessment/management. Specifically it:   Proposes an information security audit methodology that could be utilized to facilitate the audit process for  OES by the NCA and DSP security self-assessments e;   Provides an indicative guideline (set of questions) accompanied by evidence that could be utilized to facilitate  the overall audit process;   Proposes to DSP an indicative list of questions, together with relevant evidence, that could facilitate their self  assessment exercises against the security requirements prescribed in article 16(1) of the NIS Directive;   Presents post-audit actions for the NCA with a view to extract benefit and/or knowledge, following an  information security audit exercise;   Illustrates all the information security lifecycle phases and highlights key issues in each phase (e.g. scoping and  main challenges during the pre-audit/ planning phase); and   Presents a comparison of IS audit and self-assessment/management frameworks and methodologies and their  correlation with relevant IS audit standards.  Overall, this report is a guidance to national competent authorities in supporting the implementation of the  requirements stemming from article 14, 15 and 16 of the Directive.  1 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC&uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  06  1. Introduction  According to the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive2 (EU) 2016/1148, Member States should adopt a  common set of baseline security requirements to ensure a minimum level of harmonized security measures across  EU Member States and enhance the overall level of security of operators providing essential services (OES)3 and  digital service providers (DSP)4 in the EU. The NIS Directive sets (3) three primary objectives:   to improve the national information security capabilities of the Member States;   to build mutual cooperation at EU level; and   to promote a culture of risk management and incident reporting among actors (OES and DSP) of particular  importance for the maintenance of key economic and societal activities in the Union.  This report outlines audit and self-assessment/ management frameworks that can be applied:   by both OES and DSP regarding the NIS Directive5 security requirements;   as the baseline for building an information security program to manage risk and reduce vulnerabilities;   to define and prioritize the tasks required to enhance security into IT-security risk-based environments.  Scope and Objectives  The main objective of this report is to facilitate NCA conducting audits and to assist DSP and OES across all EU  Member States to comply with the requirements of the NIS Directive in the effort to achieve a baseline security  level.  This is achieved by:  a) proposing the information security audit and self-assessment/management frameworks that can be applied by  DSP and OES, with regards to the NISD security requirements6;  b)  mapping those frameworks per domain of applicability (i.e. in DSP, OES business environments or both);  c) presenting recommendations to the NCA on how to handle, manage and process the information collected  during audits performed on OES.  The key outcome of the study is a set of questions and supporting information that NCA can use to assess OES  compliance as well as a set of questions for DSP to perform security self assessments against the NISD security  requirements  2 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC  3 ANNEX II of the NISD. According to the NIS Directive ‘operator of essential services’ means a public or private entity of a type referred in  Annex II of the Directive, which meets the criteria laid down in Article 5(2).  4 ANNEX III of the NIS Directive.  5 The requirements are defined in Articles 15 and 16 of the NIS Directive.  6 This objective derives from the fact that there are numerous frameworks developed for specific industries and sectors, incorporating  different regulatory compliance goals and varying degrees of complexity and scale. Therefore, the mapping of Information Security Audit and  self-assessment/ management Frameworks for DSP and OES should ensure the cultural coverage of both sectorial and cross sectors (e.g. as  energy, transport, drinking water and distribution, banking and financial market infrastructures, healthcare and digital infrastructure as  referred to in the ANNEX II of the NIS Directive;  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  07  EU Policy Context  The compliance assessment performed by national competent authorities (NCA) is mentioned in articles 14, 15 and  16 of the NISD and defines risk assessment and auditing obligations for the OES and DSP respectively.   Article 14: “Member States shall ensure that operators of essential services take appropriate and proportionate  technical and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the security of network and information  systems which they use in their operations. Having regard to the state of the art, those measures shall ensure a  level of security of network and information systems appropriate to the risk posed.”   Article (15):  “Member States shall ensure that the competent authorities have the powers and means to require  operators of essential services to provide (b) evidence of the effective implementation of security policies, such  as the results of a security audit carried out by the competent authority or a qualified auditor and, in the latter  case, to make the results thereof, including the underlying evidence, available to the competent authority.”   Article (16): “Member States shall ensure that digital service providers identify and take appropriate and  proportionate technical and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the security of network and  information systems which they use in the context of offering services referred to in Annex III within the Union.

Introduction to Information Security Audits  It is common practice to customise an information security standard or framework (based to IT security controls)  to fit a particular business environment. Several criteria (e.g. adequacy, sufficiency, validity and acceptability) can  be used for this9, 10. The \"modus operandi\" (e.g. form, scope, process, basic principles and goals) of existing  information security standards and frameworks are described11 in the following sub chapters.  Definition of an IS audit  An information systems security audit is an independent review and examination of system records,  activities and related documents. These audits are intended to improve the level of information  security, avoid improper information security designs, and optimize the efficiency of the security  safeguards and security processes12.  For the purposes of this document13 according to articles 14, 15 and 16 of the NIS Directive14, the primary goals of  an IS audit, include (but are not limited to):   the risk assessment, identification and classification of the organization’s information systems and/or assets;  and   the overall evaluation of the organization’s design and operating control effectiveness, in all layers, procedural  and systemic; and   the ultimate compliance of all systems and processes of the organization with:   the existing regulatory framework (e.g. European and national legislation); and   the IT-related policies and standards.  Forms of an IS audit  There are three main forms of IS audit15, depending on the relationship between the auditor and the auditee parties:   First-party audit is defined in each and every internal procedure handled by an internal member or group of  members within an organisation. The purpose of the first-party audit is to ensure that a process, or set of  processes in the quality management system, meets the procedure requirements specified by the enterprise. If  the audit is performed by the owner(s) of the process(es) then the audit process is called a self-assessment,  which is a commonly accepted procedure of the audit preparation. On behalf of the enterprise, the auditor16  acts internally and inspects in depth for problematic areas where processes possibly do not comply, and  identifies opportunities for improvement.  9 http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/image/document/2018- 19/reference_document_security_measures_version_to_be_published_44F171BD-9E21-9945- FB43065BDD852E89_52065.pdf  10 https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/initiative/167285/attachment/090166e5b833a031_en  11 Moeller, Robert R.

In this case, an independent company is required  to perform an audit to verify and validate the conformity and compliance of the organization with the necessary  requirements. These certification bodies conduct audits to compare and verify that the QMS of the enterprise  meets all the criteria and requirements of the standard of interest, and continues to meet the requirements on  an ongoing basis. Once, the QMS meets the requirements, the certification body approves and delivers the  certificate to the organization.  The Directive foresees (article 15 (2b)) that a Competent Authority itself or a qualified auditor might carry out  the audit.  Scope of an IS audit  The scope of an IS audit includes various elements such as the description of the physical locations, the  organizational units, the related activities and processes, as well as the timeline needed for conducting the audit.  Determining the scope of the audit procedure is the most vital element of the overall audit planning; therefore, the  audit scope should be based on, but not limited only to the followings:   risk exposures, regulatory guidelines and focus to high risk areas as they deserve closer attention and a  broader scope to cover all the identified risk factors;   critical components that directly contribute to recovery capability and operations resilience; and   the nature of the business operations and the impact on operations of the audit process.  An audit procedure performed by the National Competent Authorities (NCA) should mainly focus on:   high risk areas based on national criteria derived from a previously conducted assessment; or   areas that are considered critical, depending on the OES and DSP specialization.  It has to be noted that the scoping of an audit in the context of the NIS Directive presents several challenges.  Section 3.1 provides more information as well as relevant good practices.  Process of an IS audit  OES as well as DSP should take appropriate and proportionate technical and organisational measures to manage  the risks posed to the security of network and information systems, which they use in their operations17.  Information security risk assessment is the process commonly used to determine these risks and is an integral part  and a critical step in the information security risk management process. Risk assessment, even though it is part of  the risk management process, is an individual activity (and not a continuous one), initiated when required or at  specified regular intervals.  17 Article 14(1) and 16(1) of the NISD.  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  10  Information security risk management can be either implemented individually or it can be part18 of the overall risk  management process19. The overall process and structure of an Information Security Risk Management process is  depicted in Figure 1.  Figure 1. Information security risk management process20  The main outcome of a risk assessment process is usually a qualitative, quantitative or a semi-quantitative  evaluation of the possible risks that a given system, complex or not, is exposed to, taking into consideration its  context and likely threats21.  Key outcomes of an audit  One of the primary goals of the audit, is to assess the design and operating effectiveness of the implemented controls  on all layers, organizational, procedural and/or technical. An additional key outcome/goal would be the assessment  18 Risk Management refers to the overall management of risks. IS Risk Management refers to the management of  risks derived by IT related risks. Therefore, IS RM can be part of the general RM process.  19 Technical Department of ENISA Section Risk Management.

Finally, the following outcomes, is  expected to be achieved during the IS audit lifecycle 22, 23:   information and evidence about conformity or non-conformity to all the requirements of the legislative  context or/and standards;   performance monitoring, measuring, reporting and reviewing against key performance objectives and targets;   auditee management systems and performance regarding the legal compliance;   review of design and operational effectiveness for all organizational and/or technical controls;   management responsibility for auditee policies;   review links between the normative requirements, policy, performance objectives and targets;   review any applicable legal requirements, responsibilities, competence of personnel; and   review operations, procedures, performance data and internal audit findings and conclusions.  22 https://www.iso.org/iso-31000-risk-management.html  23 https://na.theiia.org/standards-guidance/Public%20Documents/IPPF%202013%20English.pdf  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  12  3. Information Security Audit Lifecycle for NCA  The information security audit lifecycle comprises all the steps of the audit process, beginning from the audit  planning until the closure of the audit as well as other relevant post-execution actions. Figure 2 illustrates these  phases; a description of each is provided in the following paragraphs.  Figure 2. Information security audit lifecycle for National Competent Authorities   Pre-Audit/Planning Phase: Information needed for the execution of the security assessment is gathered during  this phase (e.g. assets to be assessed, main threats against the assets, security controls to be used to mitigate  these threats etc.). The security assessment is comprised of a project management plan, specific goals and  objectives, scope, requirements, team roles and responsibilities, limitations, assumptions, challenges,  timeframe and finally deliverables. All of the above have to be agreed during the planning phase.   Audit Execution/Fieldwork Phase: The execution phase is the main audit phase, during which the intended  assessment methodology and technique should be implemented. Upon completion of the execution phase,  assessors should have identified system, network and organizational process vulnerabilities.   Post-Execution Phase: This following tasks take place during this phase:   analysis of the identified vulnerabilities;   root cause identification is performed;   recommendations for mitigation measures; and   final report drafting.  NCA as well as auditing and certification bodies must focus on all three phases above taking into account the:   practices and policies of the auditee during normal operation (security and monitoring of systems and  facilities);   practices and policies of the auditee during abnormal operation (incident handling and reporting); and   compliance with national, international standards and requirements of the NIS Directive.  Pre-audit/Planning Phase  Prior to the execution of any audit, NCA have to prepare the audit implementation phase, while taking into  account numerous factors including but not limited to:   the nature and scale of the audit;   the arrangement of assigned resources;   the understanding of the audit roadmap; and  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  13   challenges and constraints.  3.1.1 Scoping  As part of the pre-audit process24, a scoping exercise, which ensures compliance with the NIS Directive, must take  place. Scoping involves the determination of significant processes, locations (entities) and IT applications and  systems that will be subject to assessment. To identify the above as well as their relevant assertions, NCA are  required to evaluate25 the qualitative and quantitative risk factors related to the audited organization. The scoping  will have a direct impact on the implementation of controls and the assessment of controls to be performed by the  NCA.  More specifically, the first step in scoping, is to conduct an assessment that will enable the NCA to identify the  essential services and essential information systems of the auditee. The second step is to perform the risk  assessment of the essential services and the underlying infrastructure by taking under consideration numerous  factors such as the following:   the existing processes which support this infrastructure;   the resilience of systems and services;   the existing security architecture;   change and maintenance procedures; and   past incidents.  According to  Annex II of the NIS Directive, there are  organizations whose daily activities are based not only on  traditional Information Technology (IT) environments, but also on Operational Technology (OT) Environments (and  focus on safety e.g. oil, gas, rail sector, ). There are different standards and practices focusing on IT and OT  environments, which sometimes create competing priorities. Furthermore, these two areas in many instances do  not have the required overarching governance with established communication and/ or cooperation schemes. This  separation is evident across many sectors (i.e. transport sector - aviation, maritime, railway), introducing in many  instances pitfalls for the audit process and the auditor.  In addition, there are cases where operations of an organization span more than one NIS Directive sector (cross- border and cross-sector) which makes scoping even more challenging.  3.1.2 Pre-audit issues to consider  A big aspect of the pre-audit planning is the timely identification and mitigation of possible challenges during the  audit fieldwork. Important factors to consider may include:   The organization’s business model that determines the IT functions’ structure and service delivery model (i.e.  geographic distribution of IT resources, decentralised IT operations).   Customization of IT and OT environments increases complexity (architectural diversity) in the risk-assessment  management frameworks, requiring a high degree of subject matter expertise during the audit lifecycle.  Additionally, in the context of the NISD audit requirements, the following should be considered:  24 Although audit is not a requirement for DSP, it is recommended that they take into account similar scoping  considerations as these presented in this section.  25 A top-down, risk based approach is recommended in the scoping decisions in accordance with widely accepted  information security standards and global best practices.  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  14   Clear definition of the audit universe between the legal (i.e. regulatory issues) basis and the actual audit  (compliance): identify the information systems that support the essential service and identify the scope of  the audit.   emerging technology and infrastructure changes: transformation, innovation, disruption;   pressure of limited skilled resources, budgets and controlling costs: identifying, recruiting and maintaining  individuals with the appropriate expertise, managing and controlling costs of the whole procedure;   audit (and certification) of the supply chain elements/ dependencies: legal obligations differ between OES  and DSP, therefore the same audit framework/ security requirements cannot be utilized;   bridging IT and the business: IT should be integrated and aligned with the business and strategic decisions;   good practice indicators may differ for each sector and/ or the types of entities that are in the scope of the  audit: a baseline is required to ensure a unified control list for auditing all different sectors; and   sharing the data collected by the audit: sharing of sensitive data should be managed accordingly.  Audit Execution/Fieldwork Phase  An information Security audit is an assessment of implemented security management controls within an IT system  and/or infrastructure and is applicable to both OES and DSP related business environments26. The  auditing/certification body needs to evaluate (a sample of) the evidence (e.g. computer logs) obtained from the  information and operational technology systems of an organization and determine the operational status of the  organization (i.e. whether there is evidence that the implemented controls are operating effectively in line with the  required level of security assurance). In this context, we suggest three main sources of reference, namely the:   NIS Directive Cooperation Group security measures for OES27;   ENISA report on security measures for DSP28; and   EC implementing act for DSP29.  The following security measures can be also used by the OES or the DSP as a tool to self-assess the maturity of the  practices they follow in combination with well-known capability maturity models (CMM) such as the Capability  Maturity Model (CMM®) and Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI), or the Business Development Capability  Maturity Model (BD-CMM®). In principle, the fundamental concepts of the CMM as a model for optimizing the  overall IT (and OT) security audit process can be applied and scaled to enhance any provider in scope of the NISD.  3.2.1 Audit methodology for OES  In this section, a guidance to the NCA on how to facilitate the IS audit for OES is provided. The guidance follows the  categorization of the security measures as suggested by the Cooperation Group (see Figure 3).  More specifically, the report provides a list of questions categorized per security measure and each question is  accompanied by indicative pieces of evidence, which enable the body that performs the audit (as per article 14), to  assess whether each control is implemented as intended.  26 In the case of DSP it will take the form of an internal audit or security self assessment.  27 http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=53643  28 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/minimum-security-measures-for-digital-service-providers/  29 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2018.026.01.0048.01.ENG  http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=53643 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/minimum-security-measures-for-digital-service-providers/  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  15  Figure 3.

Security measures shall ensure a homogenized level of security of network and information systems appropriate to  the risk posed for DSP across the Union. According to Article 16(a) of the NIS Directive and its implementation  act30, the security of DSP network and information systems and of their physical environment shall include the  following elements (Error! Reference source not found.):  a) security of systems and facilities: Meaning the security of network and information systems and of their  physical environment, indicatively including measures such as the systematic management of network and  information systems, the physical and environmental security, the security of suppliers and the access controls  to network and information systems;  b) incident handling: As far as incident handling, the measures taken by the digital service providers shall include:  i. detection processes and procedures maintained and tested;  ii. processes and policies on reporting incidents;  iii. an incident response process in accordance with established procedures; and  iv. an assessment of the incident's severity, as well as collection and analysis of relevant information which  may serve as evidence and support a continuous improvement process.  c) business continuity management: Meaning the capability of an organisation to maintain or as appropriate  restore the delivery of services at acceptable predefined levels following a disruptive incident;  d) monitoring, auditing and testing: Meaning the appropriate measures, including the establishment and  maintenance of policies on:  i. the conducting of a planned sequence of observations to assess whether information systems maintain  functionality as originally intended;  ii. the inspection and verification to check whether a standard or set of guidelines is being followed; and  iii. the process intended to reveal flaws in the security mechanisms of a network and information system  that protect data and maintain functionality as intended.  e) compliance with international standards: Meaning, European or internationally accepted standards and  specifications relevant to the security of network and information systems, including existing national  standards, may also be used.  30 Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/151 of 30 January 2018 laying down rules for application of Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of  the European Parliament and of the Council as regards further specification of the elements to be taken into account by digital service  providers for managing the risks posed to the security of network and information systems and of the parameters for determining whether  an incident has a substantial impact, available at https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2018.026.01.0048.01.ENG.  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  24  Figure 4 NISD security elements for DSP  ENISA has already published a report31 with recommended security measures for DSP. The report categorizes  measures, into security objectives with the aim to cover all information security domains and provides examples of  implementation.  The NIS Directive does not strictly dictate that NCA perform audits of DSP. Furthermore, DSP remain free to take  technical and organisational measures they consider appropriate and proportionate to manage the risk. However, it  is highly recommended that DSP are prepared to provide NCA with the appropriate evidence of the effective  implementation of the required security elements as described above.  To facilitate the audit process, Table 1 below presents a mapping of the five (5) elements dictated by the European  Commission against the relevant (based on the EC Implementing Act) security measures suggested by ENISA. It  also includes a list of questions per security measure and each question is accompanied by indicative pieces of  evidence, which facilitate the NCA performing the audit.

Table 1. Audit Methodology for DSP  Post-audit actions for NCA  The results of the audits can be used by the NCA for assessing the security posture not only of a particular operator  but also of the sector overall or at a national level. This will assist the NCA in shaping general or sector specific  information security policies. Furthermore, the audit output can inform the implementation of the required controls  on operational and/ or technical level.  Based on widely accepted good practices, as well as from input of multiple representatives of EU Member States to  the Cooperation Group, the following set of post-audit actions are recommended to NCA:   correlate information security maturity per operator’s importance: The audit outputs in possession of a NCA,  can be used to facilitate the creation of a benchmarking dashboard, signifying the information security maturity  of OES across the Member State. This dashboard can then be used as a reference point for the assessment of  other organizations to be audited by the same NCA and/ or serve as a mechanism for knowledge sharing across  NCAs in all EU Member States;   provide continual improvement: The output of an information security audit exercise can also be used to create  a baseline required level of security for OES across the jurisdiction of the NCA. The NCA can then use this baseline  in order to draft action plans for organizations to monitor their continual improvement towards achieving the  required information security baseline level;   ensure compliance with information security requirements: by creating a guideline on how to comply with  them;   fine tune identification criteria for OES, in the sense that less ‘secure’ auditees might take higher priority in the  national risk assessment;  As far as the assurance of compliance with information security requirements is concerned, the audit procedure  provided in Section 3.2 assures that the monitoring, auditing and testing includes the establishment and  maintenance of policies on:  (a) conducting of a planned sequence of observations or measurements to assess whether network and  information systems are operating as intended;  (b) inspection and verification to check whether a standard or set of guidelines is being followed, records  are accurate, and efficiency and effectiveness targets are being met; and  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  28  (c) a process intended to reveal flaws in the security mechanisms of a network and information system that  protect data and maintain functionality as intended. Such process shall include technical processes and  personnel involved in the operation flow.  Data gathered in the above context, shows that the protection of DSP and OES, in some EU Member States, is  mainly regulated by specific national acts and methodologies. In some cases though OES and their industry  associations may propose their own industry-specific security standards. Furthermore, specific regulations in  certain business-sectors may define additional regulations on audits (e.g., regulations on Health, Financial, or  Energy sector). The use of the audit output, as derived by the performed analysis, is depicted in the pie chart  (Figure 5).  Figure 5. Audit output utilization  3.3.1 Post-audit issues to consider  Evidence Collection Methodologies of NCA  The collection of evidence is a crucial part of any audit. NCA mainly use four ways to collect evidence (in  descending order of popularity):   follow the guidance of a national/ international standard;   follow the guidance of an underlying framework;   follow the requirements of a national regulation; and   base evidence collection on common methodologies/ good practices.  Implementation of Risk-based Information Security approach by MS in the case of DSP  44%  16%  20%  4%  16%  How the collected  information is used by NCA  ensure compliance with information security requirements  signify information security maturity  fine tune identification criteria  for continual improvement purposes  other  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  29  For DSPs, Member States shall ensure that the level of security of NIS is appropriate to the risk posed by following  national and international standards as well as underlying frameworks, which are selected accordingly in each  case. In certain cases, Member States shall proceed with the utilisation of self-assessment methodologies in the case  of DSP.  Self risk-assessment provisions of NCA for OES and DSP  In the case of self risk-assessment provisions, the operators and providers are allowed to perform these self- assessments that will be subsequently audited against international standards and/ or sector-specific security  standards. National and international standards as well as common methodologies and good practices provide the  main guidance and reference point for the risk-assessment exercises conducted by NCA.  Finally, it is important to point out that the establishment and management of a security supervision framework in  the context of the NIS Directive, involves several challenges, such as the lack of resources and the rapid change of  technology and standards. Nevertheless, the effective utilisation of the audit output is essential to the evaluation of  the implementation of required controls on an operational and/ or technical level.  Implementation Roadmap with corrective actions  The end product of an audit is the report which outlines all observations/ recommendations/ non-conformities  depending on the scope and approach of the conducted audit exercise. The audits conducted by the NCA in the  context of the NIS Directive should also include an implementation roadmap for the auditee, with proposed  corrective actions and an implementation timeframe. The auditee must accept responsibility for the implementation  of the aforementioned corrective actions before the agreed timeframe.  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  30  4. Mapping to Information Security Risk Assessment/Management  Frameworks  Defined OES and DSPs must carefully assess the actual level of preparedness and the related security risks they face  in their effort to:   achieve a minimum, adequate and converged level of security in their networks and information systems  (Article 3 of the NIS Directive); and   implement and establish, monitor, maintain and continuously improve an appropriate level of security.  In the context of auditing, the NCA might decide to follow an already known risk assessment/management  framework to ensure compliance of the OES (and possibly DSP) to the requirements of the NISD. In this chapter we  present and briefly analyse the most commonly used risk assessment/ management frameworks. We map these  against useful criteria for auditing. In Annex A the reader can find more detailed information on these frameworks  (tools, plans and methodologies).  Analysis of Relevant (Self) Risk Assessment/Management Frameworks  Indicative examples of the most widely used and accepted methodologies35 are listed below:   ISO/IEC 27001 framework for an ISMS;   NIST Special Publication 800-30 Rev. 1, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems;   CRAMM risk management methodology;   OCTAVE, suite of tools, techniques and methods;   FAIR, international standards quantitative mode;   IRAM2, end-to-end approach for performing business-focused information risk assessments;   BSI 100-3, methodology for performing risk analyses;   MAGERIT, methodology for Risk Analysis and Management;   MEHARI, information risk analysis assessment and risk management method; and   MONARC, risk management methodology.  These methodologies are the most notable in the field of information security for risk assessment and management.  For the analysis of the risk assessment/ management methodologies, a set of key criteria was selected:   scope/ domain: defines the scope and the domain of applicability of the methodology;   focus (RA/ RM): defines the focus of the methodology, i.e. risk assessment, risk management or both;   control compliance-based: defines whether the risk is determined through a gap-analysis of the control  requirements and the maturity with which they're implemented;   flexibility: refers to the flexibility of the methodology;   controlled Scaling: defines whether the methodology can be scaled to the specific needs of an organization in a  centralized, pre-defined way;   controlled Tailoring: defines whether the methodology allows the replacement of specified controls with  alternate controls in a centralized, pre-defined way;   complexity: refers to the complexity of the methodology;  35 For more information regarding the standards, methodologies and tools, please see Annex A:.  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  31   approach: refers to the approach of the methodology;   assessment Guidance: defines whether the methodology determines the risk through a gap-analysis of the  control requirements and the maturity with which they're implemented;   tool Support: defines whether there is a tool which implements the methodology;   supports Third Party Assurance: defines whether the methodology provides an adequate mechanism for the  sharing of reasonably accurate and consistent risk information amongst organizations;   year released/ last update: refers to the release year and the last update of the methodology; and   target: refers to the sector and/ or the types of entities that are in the scope of the methodology.  In the next sub-sections, the methodologies based of these criteria are analysed and categorised into international  and national self-assessment/management standards and frameworks.  4.1.1 International (Self) Risk Assessment/Management Standards & Frameworks  The analysis of well-known selected international36 self-risk assessment/management standards and frameworks  based on the aforementioned criteria is presented below (Table 2):  S/N CRITERIA ISO 27001 OCTAVE CRAMM FAIR IRAM2 NIST 800-30  1  Scope/  Domain  SMEs and  Large  Organizations/  Covers the  ISMS of an  organization  Large  Organizations/  Covers the  entire  organization  SMEs and  Large  Organizations/  Covers the IT  related risks  of an  organization  SMEs and  Large  Organizations/  Covers the  entire  organization  Large  Organizations/  Covers the  entire  organization  SMEs and Large  Organizations/ Covers  the IT related risks of  an organization  2  Focus (RA/  RM)  RA/ RM RA/ RM RA RA RA/ RM RM  2.1  Control  Compliance- Based  Yes Yes Yes No Yes Yes  3 Flexibility  Relatively  Flexible  Flexible No Flexibility  Relatively  Flexible  Flexible Relatively Flexible  3.1  Controlled  Scaling  Yes Yes No Yes Yes Yes  3.2  Controlled  Tailoring  Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes  4 Complexity  Medium  Complexity  Low  Complexity  High  Complexity  Low  Complexity  Low  Complexity  Low Complexity  5 Approach  Asset and  control based  Risk-based  information  security  strategic  Qualitative,  asset-centric  approach  Quantitative  approach by  filling  questionnaire  tables  Assessment of  risks from a  business  perspective  Risk-based IT-related  risks management  36 For more information regarding the international standards, please see Annex B:.

Criteria for International self-risk assessment/management standards and frameworks  4.1.3 Analysis of Information Security Control Audit Frameworks  The information security control standards and frameworks presented above are the most notable38 in the field of  information security. The selected audit frameworks, used in different settings and sectors, are aimed at ensuring  that OES and DSPs comply with certain requirements deriving from the NIS Directive.  In this subsection we analyse and categorise the aforementioned standards/ frameworks (Table 4) based on the  criteria defined below:   scope: the scope of the standard/ framework;   software Support: existence of software which implements the standard/ framework;   year released/ last update: dates of release year and the last update of the standard/ framework;   target: refers to the sector and/ or the types of entities that are in the scope of the standard/ framework;   national/ Corporate Level: refers to the level of applicability of the standard/ framework; and   domain of applicability: operators of essential services or digital service providers or both.

Analysis of selected Information Security Control Standards and Frameworks  The criteria40 applied in the above analysis allow to highlight the commonalities and differences of the selected audit  frameworks. The selected criteria are impartial and unquantifiable, making the comparison of the audit frameworks  a straightforward procedure.  As far as the ISO 27001 is concerned, it is an information security standard, not tied to a particular national legislation  and it is very popular among security practitioners worldwide. It allows each organization to implement its guidelines  in a different manner and select a method that suits its needs. To achieve this it must be used in conjunction with a  risk assessment methodology that implements it.  COBIT 5 is a comprehensive framework, which provides a business process-based methodology. It provides a good  way of aligning IT and business goals and bridges the gap between business control models and IT control models.  Additionally, it provides common language for business executives to communicate with each other on objectives,  goals and results.  On the other hand, ISA 62443 is a series of standards, technical reports, and related information that designate  processes for applying security measures to organizations in the industrial sector. More information on these  standards can be found in Annex A.  4.1.4 Mapping Information Security Risk Assessment/Management Frameworks with Information  Security Control frameworks.  Risk assessment/management and information security audit exercises can be directly linked under specific  conditions and/or factors. The outcome of a risk assessment/ management exercise could ideally be utilised by an  OES, a DSP, an external auditor or even a NCA as input for the conduct of an information security audit.  There are a number of factors that may correlate a risk assessment/ management standard to an information  security audit standard (e.g. assessment approach, compliance with International Standards, etc.). This subsection  of the report serves the purpose of enabling all stakeholders to proceed following a self-risk assessment to an audit,  using the appropriate combination of standards that will provide the required added value to the organization.  Table 5 illustrates a mapping between risk assessment/ management methodologies and audit frameworks, based  on specific correlation factors. This mapping indicates risk assessment/ management methodologies, which can  provide the input for facilitating the applicable audit procedures.  The research focused on the structure and functionality of the methodologies, i.e. assets or processes, suggests a  correlation that leads to better capitalization of risk assessment/ management and audit methodologies. The  correlations are indicative and not restrictive.  40 Macedo, Filipe, and Miguel Mira Da Silva. \"Comparative study of information security risk assessment models.\"  Instituto Superior Técnico, UniversidadeTécnica de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal (2012).

This correlation  enables exploiting the  advantages derived from each methodology. For example, if the objective is to perform an ISO/IEC 27001 audit,  then it is suggested to use a self-risk assessment/ methodology based on the same approach, e.g. asset based  approach, or the way of performing the risk assessment or the required detail required for the purposes of the  audit, e.g. qualitative or quantitative risk assessment.  These correlations could be utilized by an OES, a DSP, an external auditor or even a NCA as input to the conduct of  an information security audit. This analysis enables all stakeholders to proceed following a self-risk assessment to  an audit, using the appropriate combination of standards that will provide the required added value to the  organization.  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  36  5. Outlook  In its entirety, this report aims to provide guidance to the NCA in auditing against the security requirements of the  NIS Directive. This report presents the full-fledged set of options for the NCA to meet these provisions. However,  the framework to follow lies on the discretion of the NCA. Moreover, this report raises awareness against the most  important challenges the NCA will face when auditing and provides some recommendations on how to tackle them.  It is expected that the majority of the Member States will implement their own sectorial security measures.  However, we consider this report a common denominator of these approaches as it is based on widely accepted  guidance provided by the NIS Cooperation group as well as the EC implementing acts for DSP. In the same line,  Member States are expected to follow their own methodologies to assess the security measures of OES and DSP.  We consider that the proposed list of questions is a good starting point for the assessment because is based on the  most relevant and applicable information security standards.  In addition, the proposed list of questions is outlined with a preventive mode of investigation in mind. Although, all  these questions are still valid in the case of a post incident audit, the MS should add additional questions, which  address the particularities of the specific incident under investigation.  Each identified framework is different, with its own advantages and disadvantages. The MS has to determine which  framework will apply. The optimal choice depends on many factors including the size and maturity of the sector, the  resources and skills of the government authority and whether or not there are well-functioning industry initiatives.  Finally, it is worthy to note that the assessment of information security is not a static point-in-time task but a  continuous process. The NCA should iterate the evaluation process periodically while taking into account the  challenges faced in the previous iterations, the technological changes, the new business scenarios and the new  essential services offered.  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  37  Annex A: Risk Assessment and Risk Management Documentation  Relevant Information Security Control Standards and Frameworks  A.1.1 ISO 27001  ISO 2700141 is an information security standard (Figure 6. ISO 27001 audit frameworkFigure 6), part of the ISO/IEC  27000 family of standards and derived from BS 7799 Part 2, first published by the British Standards Institute in  1999. ISO/IEC 27001 was revised in 2013, bringing it into line with the other ISO management systems standards. It  is published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical  Commission (IEC) under the joint ISO and IEC subcommittee.  ISO/IEC 27001 defines the development of an audit programme for the information security management system  (ISMS) of the auditee. This programme contains all the relevant information of the audits regarding first-party  audits, audits to be performed by clients and third-party audits, as appropriate. The third-party audit procedure is  performed by using several checklists:   audit checklist/ observation form: contains specific items that are particular to the organizational unit to be  audited;   systemic requirements: contains items relating to the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001:2013 and tailored to the  auditee specifications each time; and   control requirements: contains controls depicted in Appendix A of ISO/IEC 27001:2013 and further described  ISO/IEC 27002:201342.  ISO/IEC 27001 specifies that once the audit procedure has been completed, the following steps should be  taken so as the audit programme is deemed complete:   review and analysis of findings;   consolidation of all findings including grouping and tabulation;   classification of findings;   preparation of recommendation and audit report;   classification of findings; and   preparation of recommendation and audit report.  Whereas the national competent authorities are responsible for identifying non-conformities, OES and DSP are  responsible for resolving non-conformities. ISO 27001 provides a taxonomy of possible controls, whereas ISO  27002 provides recommended practices for the implementation of controls. It should be mentioned that ISO  27001 gives auditors a certain degree of freedom, in order to ensure effective and efficient implementation of an  ISMS according to the specific information security requirements of the organization under question.  Figure 1  below, depicts the overall set-up of ISO 27001 framework.  41 https://www.iso.org/standard/54534.html  42 https://www.iso.org/standard/54533.html  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  38  Figure 6. ISO 27001 audit framework43  A.1.2 COBIT 5  COBIT 5 (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology) 44 is a framework aimed to provide an end-to- end business view of the governance of enterprise IT, developed, maintained and distributed by ISACA -  Information Systems Audit and Control Association.  COBIT 5 (Figure 7) is a comprehensive framework for developing, implementing, monitoring and enhancing  information technology governance and management practices by maintaining an equilibrium between realizing  benefits and optimizing risk levels and resource use. COBIT 5 provides an effective approach of aligning IT and  business goals and bridges the gap between business control models and IT control models while retaining a  common language for business executives to communicate with each other about objectives, goals and results. It  is based on five key principles for governance and management of enterprise IT. By bringing together those five  principles, COBIT 5 enables information and related technology to be governed and managed in a holistic manner  for the whole critical infrastructure, taking in to account the full end-to-end business and functional areas of  responsibility, considering the IT-related interests of internal and external stakeholders.  Additionally, COBIT 5 aligns with the latest relevant standards and frameworks used by organizations, such as  COSO, ISO 31000 and ISO 38500. However, even if COBIT 5 is able to bridge the gap between business control  models and IT asset-based RAs, it comes with the disadvantage of utilizing over-complicated concepts and  structures that make COBIT difficult and time consuming to apply it as a risk assessment tool.  43 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/schemes-for-auditing-security-measures  44 http://www.isaca.org/cobit/pages/default.aspx  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  39  As defined in COBIT 5, each phase in the audit process is subsequently divided into key steps to plan,  define, perform and report the results of the engagement, as shown in Figure 2 below.  Figure 7. COBIT5 Audit Procedure45  A.1.3 ISA/IEC 62443  ISA/IEC 6244346 is a series of standards, technical reports, and related information that designate processes for  applying security measures to industrial zones and is one of the most comprehensive Industrial Automation and  Control System Security Standards. This guidance applies to end-users (i.e. asset owner), system integrators,  security practitioners, and control systems manufacturers responsible for manufacturing, designing, implementing,  or managing industrial automation and control systems. The ISA/IEC-62443 series are organized into four  categories, i.e. General, Policies and Procedures, System, and Component47.  The standards of the ISA/IEC-62443 which are deemed critical for the scope of this research are analysed and  depicted in Figure 3, including but not limited to:   ISA-62443-1-3: System Security Compliance Metrics;   ISA-62443-2-1: Industrial automation and control system security management system;   ISA-62443-3-2: (99.03.02) Security for industrial automation and control systems; and   ISA-62443-3-3: (IEC 62443-3-3) System Security Requirements and Security Assurance Levels.  The ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards propose and introduce the novel concepts of “zones” and “conduits” as a  way to divide and segregate the diverse sub-systems in a control system. A zone is designated as a combination of  physical or logical assets that share common security requirements related to factors such as consequence and  criticality. Additional security measures, such as implementing additional technology or policies, are required if the  security level capability of the equipment is deemed no equal to or higher than the requirement level.  ISA/IEC 62443 also provides a framework for industries to achieve and maintain security improvements through a  life cycle that integrates design, implementation, monitoring and continuous improvement. The frameworks offers  45 https://www.isaca.org/COBIT/Documents/IS-auditing-creating-audit-programs_whp_eng_0316.pdf  46 ISA, Safe and Secure: Multiple Challenges, One Solution, 2014.  47 ANSI/ISA-62443-1-1 (99.01.01)-2007 Security for Industrial Automation and Control Systems Part 1: Terminology,  Concepts, and Models:  https://www.isa.org/store/products/product-detail/?productId=116720, Accessed on  25/05/2018, 2018.  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  40  industrial security solutions and the ability to relevant stakeholders to mitigate information security threats that  arise within the segmenting control networks for zones and conduits.  As of today, no ISA/IEC 62443 (Figure 8) risk assessment/ management or information security certification exists.  ISA is currently working on a modified ISO/IEC 27005 risk assessment/ management process. Furthermore, related  audit and evaluation processes are currently being developed, with the goal to provide a way for organizations to  assess their current information security posture against the ISA/IEC 62443 family of standards. This assessment  will be based on controls mainly deriving from related NIST (e.g. 800-53, 800-60, and 800-70) and FIPS (e.g. 199,  200) publications.  Figure 8. ISA/IEC 62443 Phases  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  41  Related information regarding ISA 62443 is not available, as currently no audit/ certification and/ or RA/RM  process exists. Currently, and until proprietary ISA 62443 audit standard is published, third-party assurance  standards are proposed by ISA. More specifically:  In regards to product assurance    ISO/ IEC 15408;    ISO/ IEC 19790 (Similar to NIST FIPS 140-2);    ISO/ IEC TR/19791.  In regards to Process assurance    ISO/ IEC 21827;    ISO/ IEC 17799;    COBIT5;    Draft ISA S99 standards, including concepts and process guidance.  In regards to environmental assurance    ISO 9000 series.  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Methodologies and Tools  Risk Assessment and Risk Management is the focus of the desktop research.

The ISO/IEC  27001 Standard provides a methodology which can assist OES and DSP to achieve all of their regulatory  compliance objectives concerning the NIS Directive by implementing specific controls. Controls recommended by  ISO/IEC 27001 are not only technological solutions but also cover people and organizational processes. There are  114 controls in Annex A covering the breadth of information security management, including areas such as  physical access control, security staff awareness programmes, procedures for monitoring threats and incident  management processes.  The risk assessment process established by ISO/IEC 27001 follows the below procedure:   establish and maintain certain information security risk criteria;   ensure that repeated risk assessments “produce consistent, valid and comparable results;   identify risks associated with the loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability for information within the  scope of the information security management system;   identify the owners of those risks; and   analyse and evaluate information security risks according to certain criteria.  An ISMS is based on the outcomes of a risk assessment based on the ISO/IEC 27001. OES and DSP will need to  produce a set of controls so as to minimize the identified risks resulting from the aforementioned procedure.  B.1.2 OCTAVE  OCTAVE (Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation) was developed by the Computer  Emergency Response Team within the Software Engineering Institute. The goal of the OCTAVE suite of tools,  techniques and methods is to allow “risk-based information security strategic assessment and planning”49. OCTAVE  gives the opportunity to small teams across business units and IT work together to address the security needs of  the organization and face the security challenges. It moves an organization towards an operational risk-based view  of security and addresses technology in a business context.  The methodology is divided in three explicit methods. The primary OCTAVE method forms the basis for the  OCTAVE foundation of knowledge. OCTAVE-S is intended for small and medium sized organizations. The main  difference with the basic method is that the necessary knowledge is assumed to be known in advance by the  analysis group, so the first step of collecting knowledge is omitted. Lastly, OCTAVE-Allegro offers a faster but more  limited approach that focuses on information assets. This approach covers only four simplified steps: development  of risk measurement criteria, creation of profiles for each critical information asset, identification of threats to  these assets and finally, analysis of resulting risks in order to develop mitigation approaches.  48 https://www.iso.org/standard/54534.html  49 CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team). OCTAVE® (Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability  Evaluation). http://www.cert.org/resilience/products-services/octave/index.cfm  Guidelines on assessing DSP and OES compliance to the NISD security requirements  NOVEMBER 2018  55  B.1.3 CRAMM  CRAMM (CCTA Risk Analysis and Management Method) was developed in 1987 by a British government  organization, the Central Communication and Telecommunication Agency (CCTA), now renamed into Cabinet  Office. CRAMM can be used for all kinds of organizations, but it is especially intended for large organizations, like  government bodies and industry50. It is in use by NATO and corporations working actively on information security.  CRAMM helps in justification of security investments by demonstrating need for action at management level,  based on quantifiable results and countermeasures from organization.  CRAMM attempts a qualitative approach that focuses on assets. It provides 10 specific and predefined asset tables  which classify the assets in categories. Those tables support identification and valuation of assets51. Therefore,  each asset can be classified into a specific category, each with a predefined list of known vulnerabilities and threats  that can exploit them. After the completion of identification and valuation of the assets, the provided dedicated  tool automatically suggests a set of all possible countermeasures. However, the usefulness of the method is largely  dependent on the tool which implements it.  B.1.4 FAIR  FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk)52 is an international standard quantitative model for information security  and operational risk and provides (a) a model for understanding, analysing and quantifying information risk in  financial terms; and (b) a foundation for developing a robust approach to information risk management.  The FAIR framework defines the necessary building blocks for implementing effective risk management programs.  FAIR is an ontology of the factors that contribute to risk and how they affect each other. It is primarily concerned  with establishing accurate probabilities for the frequency and magnitude of data loss events.  B.1.5 IRAM2  IRAM2 (Information Risk Assessment Methodology 2)53 is a complete end-to-end approach for performing  business-focused information risk assessments. IRAM2 provides the following:   simple, practical, yet rigorous risk assessment approach;   focus on the business perspective;   extended coverage of risks; and   engagement with key stakeholders.  IRAM2 is supported by four IRAM2 Assistants, each accompanied by a practitioner guide, that help automate one  or more phases of the methodology.  B.1.6 NIST 800-30  NIST Special Publication 800-3054 is a foundation pillar for developing an effective and adequate risk management  program. NIST 800-30 provides both the definitions and the practical guidance required for assessing and  mitigating risks identified within IT systems. Additionally, it provides information on the selection of practical and  profitable security controls that can be utilized to mitigate risk for the better protection of vital information and  50 European Network and Information Security Agency.

It is composed by well-defined and sequentially steps in order to  achieve the aforementioned goals, as depicted below:   system characterization followed by thread and vulnerability identification;   control analysis and likelihood determination;   impact analysis and risk determination; and   control recommendations and documentation of the results.  Each of the above steps produces an output which in turn feeds the next step of the chain. With respect to the  aforementioned, this methodology moves the organization towards to better managing IT-related risks.  National Self-Risk Assessment/Management Standards and Frameworks  B.2.1 BSI-100-3  BSI 100-355 is a methodology for performing risk analyses to additive an existing IT-Grundschutz security concept.  This methodology indicates the way of using the threats listed in the IT-Grundschutz Catalogues [GSK] to carry out  a bridged analysis of risks for information processing. The methodology is required to be carried out step by step  as follows:   preparing the threat summary: produce a summary of the threats to which the target objects under review are  subject;   determination of additional threats: for the target objects under review there are, in some circumstances,  additional isolated threats over and above those foreseen in the IT-Grundschutz Model that must be taken into  consideration;   threat assessment: check whether the security measures already implemented or at least planned in the  security concept provide adequate protection for each target object and threat;   handling risks: decide on how to deal with the remaining threats;   consolidation of the security concept: check the implemented security measures for each target object using  specific criteria; and   feedback to the security process: Once the security concept has been consolidated, the security process, as  specified in the IT-Grundschutz Methodology, can be resumed.  B.2.2 MAGERIT  MAGERIT56 (Methodology for Information Systems Risk Analysis and Management) is an open methodology for  Risk Analysis and Management, developed by the Spanish Ministry of Public Administrations, offered as a  framework and guide to the Public Administration. Given its open nature it is also used outside the Administration.  MAGERIT was developed in response to the perception that the government and, in general, the whole society  increasingly depends on information technologies, that entail certain risks that must be sensibly managed with  proper measures, for achieving its service objectives.  MAGERIT seeks to achieve the following objectives: (1) increase the security awareness of those responsible for  information systems, (2) offer a systematic and structured method for analysing risks, (3) help in describing and  selecting the appropriate measures and controls for treating the risks and (4) prepare the organization for  55 https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/Publikationen/ITGrundschutzstandards/BSI- Standard_1003.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=1  56 Portuguese Ministry of Public Administration.

MAGERIT method has the  ability to project the risk assessment process at management, operational and technical levels. It is supported by  technical documents describing elements and criteria and provides regulatory compliance and compliance to IT  standards, such as ISO/IEC 27001:2005, ISO/IEC 15408:2005, ISO/IEC 17799:2005 and ISO/IEC 13335:2004.  Furthermore, MAGERIT can be applied as an independent risk assessment method.  B.2.3 MEHARI  MEHARI57 (Method for Harmonized Analysis of Risk) is a free, open-source information risk analysis assessment  and risk management method, developed, maintained and distributed by CLUSIF - Club de la Sécurité de  l’Information Français, the French association of information security professionals. MEHARI method bases its  analysis on formulas and parameters. This means that MEHARI can only be used in conjunction with dedicated  tools. It provides a complete risk management model, description of modular components and processes. It also  provides the means to enable classification of assets, the likelihood of threats and measurement of the  vulnerabilities through audit. Additionally, it analyses a generic set of risk situations and provides seriousness  levels for each risk scenario. Finally, it allows an optimal selection of corrective actions in order to provide risk  treatment and gives additional compliance scoring of the organization to ISO/IEC 27001:2005 controls and the  ISMS process.  There is a given compliance of the product with international regulations and with most of ISO information  security standards. Furthermore, this method provides several indicators (e.g. Efficiency, Resiliency, Continuity  aspects) in order to measure the IS maturity level. However, MEHARI risk assessment and risk management  methods require in any case a good knowledge of the business internals and the handling of risk.  B.2.4 MONARC  MONARC58 uses an iterative method which enables the thorough implementation of risk management. This  approach, as recommended by ISO 27005, enables the focusing on critical issues, followed by successive iterations  to augment the target or further liquidate it to restrict additional risks and therefore to cover more technical  aspects. The advantage of MONARC methodology lies in the capitalisation of risk analyses already performed in  similar business contexts. In order to achieve its goals, MONARC consists of four (4) well-defined phases as defined  below:   context establishment: take stock of the context, challenges and priorities of the company or organization that  wishes to analyse its risks;   context modelling: provision of details and formalisation of to the identified assets in a diagram that displays  their interdependencies.   evaluation and treatment of risks: quantification of threats, vulnerabilities and impacts to assess the risks; and   implementation and monitoring: ongoing management phase with security monitoring and recurring control  of security measures.  57 CLUSIF (Club de la Sécurité de l’Information Français).

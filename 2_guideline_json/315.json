The global Covid-19 pandemic witnessed in 2020 sent all these technologies  into the limelight like never before and forced millions around the world to work from home and  rely on remote connections to professional networks during the lockdown.  Vital sectors had to ensure continuity of service during this lasting global crisis despite  increased exposure to cyber threats over this long-lasting global crisis. The growing use of  remote IT networks by a large part of the population working remotely opened new digital attack  surfaces to criminals who were quick to exploit such vulnerabilities. Cyberattacks rose sharply  since March 2020, as confirmed by a number of cybersecurity experts and law enforcement  agencies such as Interpol. They specifically noted a rise in malware, phishing and Trojan horse  attacks worldwide1.  Both the Energy and the Air Transport sectors face considerable threats with potentially  disastrous financial and societal consequences, requiring solid Incident Response Capabilities  (IRC).  Both sectors come with large supply chains and a multiplicity of stakeholders (Public authorities,  Regulators, Professional associations, large industries, SMEs, etc.). They have, in recent years,  taken steps to structure and strengthen their ability to face cyber threats and to respond to  cyber incidents. The creation of ISACs2 to foster information-sharing at sectoral level is an  excellent illustration of this evolution.  This study provides a continuation of work on Sectoral IRC at European level following  the publication of the 2019 “EU Member States incident response development status  report”3. The report focuses on trends in Energy and Air Transport Incident Response  (IR) Capabilities, procedures, processes and tools. It also offers insights on current  challenges and gaps facing IR communities.  The analysis aimed to focus on:   Current IRC of Air Transport and Energy sectors,   The recent changes in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic,   The upcoming revision of the NIS Directive,   To draw practical recommendations for the IR community.  1 https://www.interpol.int/en/News-and-Events/News/2020/INTERPOL-report-shows-alarming-rate-of-cyberattacks-during- COVID-19  2 For example Energy ISAC https://www.ee-isac.eu/ and Aviation ISAC https://www.a-isac.com/  3 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-report  Cyberattacks  have risen  sharply since the  beginning of the  COVID-19  pandemic, in  particular in  critical sectors  such as  transport, health  or finance.  https://www.interpol.int/en/News-and-Events/News/2020/INTERPOL-report-shows-alarming-rate-of-cyberattacks-during-COVID-19 https://www.interpol.int/en/News-and-Events/News/2020/INTERPOL-report-shows-alarming-rate-of-cyberattacks-during-COVID-19 https://www.ee-isac.eu/ https://www.a-isac.com/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-report  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  5  KEY FINDINGS  The research highlighted the following eight key findings:  Key Finding #1 A large majority of EU countries tend to have dedicated sectoral specialists  and experts within their National/governmental CSIRTs rather than one  dedicated sectoral entity at national level. Sectoral CSIRTs are not yet the  norm in the EU.  Key Finding #2 The EU countries which decided to create a dedicated sectoral CSIRT for  the Energy or Air Transport sector were driven by organisational and  functional needs rather than technical ones.  Key Finding #3 Energy and air transport sectoral CSIRTs tend to provide their constituency  with sector-specific expertise in addition to the generic services provided  by national CSIRTs.  Key Finding #4 The tools and processes used by sectoral CSIRTs to deliver their services  are similar to those used by national CSIRTs.  Key Finding #5 Although IR stakeholders did not request specific guidance when  developing their capabilities, they tended to use dedicated tools made  available by EU authorities, regulators and national CSIRTs.  Key Finding #6 Sectoral CSIRTs in both air transport and energy sectors are facing similar  challenges, such as legislations overlapping, or the growing time spent on  compliance issues.  Key Finding #7 Sectoral CSIRTs in both the air transport and energy sectors face the  common challenge of formally and rapidly sharing ex-ante information in a  particularly tense context.  Key Finding #8 On-going programmes and information sharing initiatives successfully  supported IRC developments in both sectors. However, a strong demand  remains for more framework, guidance and know-how in relation to the  impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  6  1. OVERVIEW AND  SCOPE OF THE STUDY  1.1 CONTEXT  Since its creation, ENISA has been actively working to assist the European Commission,  European Union Member States (EU MS) and the overall cybersecurity community to  enhance their capabilities and expertise. The Agency engaged in an in-depth research on  Incident Response Capabilities (IRC) to that end. As a result ENISA was able to produce a  state-of-the-art overview of the CSIRT landscape and of its development in Europe. This  study aims to complement this work by continuing to update ENISA’s recommendations for  the CSIRT capability development and to disseminate the latest trends and evolutions in this  domain.  ENISA’s public website features a European CSIRT inventory. The interactive map it  includes gives an overview of the current CSIRT teams active in Europe. A study on the  CSIRT landscape and an overview of the IR capabilities in 2025 Europe are also available.  These features serve the purpose to present a comprehensive picture of existing CSIRTs’  incident handling and response capabilities (IRC), with initial facts and figures about sectoral  CSIRTs.  2020 has been impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic in many ways but in addition to  an unprecedented financial impact, it has resulted in a massive increase in the use of digital  tools and services. As a result, cybersecurity and Incident Response Capabilities in particular  have become more crucial than ever. It is therefore fundamental that ENISA continues to  closely monitor capability development, particularly in light of the upcoming revision of the  NIS Directive.  This revision is a great opportunity to take stock of the recent evolutions of the Incident  Response Landscape across the EU. The revision will be an occasion to build on the lessons  learnt by the IR community across the EU Member States (MS) in addressing the challenges  the  implementation of the NISD has given rise to.  Following the publication of the 2019 “EU Member States incident response development  status report”4, ENISA is eager to take a closer look at the IRC development of sectoral  CSIRTs, more specifically in the energy and air transport sectors.  1.2 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY  This study aims to further ENISA’s understanding and knowledge of IRC development and  draw conclusions about the development of IR capabilities particularly in the energy and air  transport sectors.  It constitutes an extensive analysis of IRC in the energy and air transport sectors and  presents potential gaps, overlaps and challenges in the services offered as well as  in the  procedures, processes and tools used by sectoral IRCs.  4 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-report  Incident  Response  Capabilities have  never been so  crucial for  sectoral  stakeholders  who rely heavily  on digital tools.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-report  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  7  The specific objectives of this study are:   To collect and aggregate comprehensive data on the current IRC in the air transport  and energy sectors;   To analyse and measure the evolution and development in sectoral CSIRTs  services, capabilities, processes, tools and cooperation mechanisms;   To identify potential gaps, overlaps and challenges in national IR procedures,  processes and tools.  To this end, research was divided into three parallel activities, namely:   A desktop research of open sources,   A survey of EU national and sectoral CSIRTs (responses received from 13 Member  States and a European sectoral CSIRTs),   Complementary interviews with sectoral IRC experts and national CSIRTs.  An overview of the methodology and an assessment and presentation of the data collected  can be found in chapters 3 and 4.  1.3 SCOPE OF THE WORK AND DEFINITIONS  This study provides data and analysis on the recent changes and evolutions of IR capabilities  (IRC) within Air Transport and Energy sectors in Member States.  The study focuses on:   Capabilities of sectoral CSIRTs;   Operational preparedness of sectoral CSIRTs or other IR entities;   IR services actually provided to constituency;   IR processes and procedures;   IR tools (used by sectoral CSIRTs or other IR entities) standalone and/or in contrast  with national CSIRT(s);   Awareness of ENISA maturity assessment and/or (Self) assessment framework for  CSIRTs;   Examples and/or lessons learnt of sectoral incidents;   Cooperation mechanisms used nationally and internationally;   Current levels of maturity and requirements for development.  It was therefore important to agree on the definition of the key structuring concepts and  elements of the study.  The scope and key concepts of the research were defined as follows:  Incident response (IR): The protection of an organisation's information by developing and  implementing an IR process (e.g. plans, defined roles, training, communications,  management oversight) in order to quickly discover an attack and effectively contain the  damage, eradicate the attacker's presence, and restore the integrity of the network and  systems.5  5 Strategies for Incident Response and Cyber Crisis Cooperation, ENISA, August 2016.  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  8  Incident response capabilities (IRC): The processes (e.g. plans, defined roles, training,  communications, management oversight), procedures and tools (log analysis, Intrusion  Detection Systems, Vulnerability scanners, Data Capture & Incident Response Forensics  Tools, Patch management systems, etc.) used to identify, respond to and mitigate the impact  of an attack, and to restore continuity of service.6  Incident response models: the survey used a typology of four Incident Response models:   Centralised: the national CSIRT is in charge of handling incidents across the  different sectors; it provides a centralised point for incident reporting and analysis,  decision-making, response coordination, and dissemination of information.   Distributed: the national CSIRT has core responsibilities to handle incidents and  works with a competent authority for each sector (e.g. national ministries or public  agencies); the role of these actors may be to facilitate incident notification and  dissemination of information.   Hybrid: a national CSIRT and the sectoral CSIRTs share the IR responsibilities and  operations, which may depend on the sector(s) impacted or the scale of the incident  for instance.   Decentralised: a sectoral CSIRT is in charge of handling incidents in a given sector  from incident detection to response coordination and decision-making, including  coordinating with other stakeholders.  National/Government (N/g) CSIRTs: Teams that serve a country’s government by helping  to protect its critical information infrastructure. N/g CSIRTs play a key role in coordinating  incident management with the relevant stakeholders at national level. They also bear  responsibility for cooperation with other countries’ national and governmental teams.7  National Sectoral CSIRTs: Entities responding to computer security or cybersecurity  incidents affecting a specific sector at national level. N/ Sectoral CSIRTs are usually  established in NISD sectors such as Healthcare, Energy, and the Transport Sector. Unlike  the N/G CSIRT who serves the public sector, the national Sectoral CSIRTs provides services  to constituents from a single sector in one country (in the context of this study, the national  Sectoral CSIRTs and sectors mentioned are mainly Air Transport and Energy sectors).  Sectoral CSIRT of international organisation: Entities or teams within an international  organisation or company responding to computer security or cybersecurity incidents affecting  the organisation and providing services to constituents from a single sector at regional (EU)  or international level.  OES CSIRT/IRTs: Entities or teams responding to computer security or cybersecurity  incidents affecting an Operator of Essential Services within a sector.  Operators of Essential Services (OES): Operators of essential services are private or  public sector entities who play an important role in providing healthcare, transport, energy,  banking and financial market infrastructure, digital infrastructure and water supply. According  to the NIS Directive, Member States should be responsible for determining which entities  meet the criteria of the definition of operator of essential services8.  6 Ibid.  7 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-capabilities/baseline-capabilities  8 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-capabilities/baseline-capabilities https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  9  Digital Service Provider (DSP): A digital service provider is an entity providing one or more  of the three types of digital service, such as:   Cloud computing services: digital services enabling access to a scalable and  elastic pool of shareable computing resources.   Online marketplaces: digital services allowing consumers to conclude online sales  or service contracts with traders online using computing services provided by the  online marketplace.   Online search engines: means a digital service that allows users to perform  searches of, in principle, all websites or websites in a particular language on the  basis of a query on any subject in the form of a keyword, phrase or other input, and  returns links in which information related to the requested content can be found.  NIS Directive: The Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NISD) was  adopted by the European Parliament on 6 July 2016 and entered into force in August 2016.  The NISD provides legal measures to boost the overall level of cybersecurity in the EU.9  NISD sectors: Critical sectors for the European Union’s society and economy are heavily  dependent on ICT. Member States have been requested to identify operators of essential  services (OES) for the seven sectors listed in the NIS Directive (NISD sectors). These seven  sectors – and related subsectors – listed in the Directive10 are:   Energy (electricity, oil, gas);   Transport (air, rail, water, road);   Banking;   Financial market infrastructures;   Health sector;   Drinking water supply and distribution;   Digital Infrastructures.  9 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/network-and-information-security-nis-directive  10 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/network-and-information-security-nis-directive https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  10  Figure 1: NISD sectors  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  11  2. METHODOLOGY AND  DATA COLLECTION  2.1 OVERVIEW OF THE METHODOLOGY  The methodology to identify, collect and analyse data on Incident Response set-up and  capabilities within the air transport and energy sector is illustrated below. The series of steps  the methodology consists of is presented in this chapter.  2.2 A SEVEN-STEP APPROACH  2.2.1 Step 1 – Definition of the research focus for the data collection  The research focus of the study was defined in close cooperation with the ENISA team. To  that purpose an analysis grid setting criteria and theme was created to classify the  information collected on energy and air transport Sectoral IRC  The list of criteria was defined pertaining to the specific data sought in the context of this  study (e.g. cooperation aspects, recently created entities, etc.).  2.2.2 Step 2 – Desktop research in open source on air transport and  energy Sectors IRC  This step consisted in conducting a literature review and open source research in order to  collect data on sectoral IRC and recent trends in the field of air transport and energy IRC.  This research was performed within the 27 Member States and a selection of 13  neighbouring countries11.  During a preliminary data collection phase, a first team of analysts gathered the relevant data  in the data classification grid. A second team of analysts validated and further enriched the  preliminary data. An overview of the collected data is detailed in chapter 5.1.  2.2.3 Step 3 – Designing and validating the survey  Publicly available information on air transport and energy Sectoral IRC procedures and tools  was, as anticipated, not detailed enough to provide insightful input (see chapter 5.1).  11 Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Georgia, Iceland, Kosovo, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Ukraine, the  United Kingdom, Serbia and Switzerland.  Figure 2: Overview of the methodology  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  12  Therefore, a survey to collect comprehensive data from relevant parties had been planned  early on.  Once the objective of the survey was defined, two categories of organisations were identified  to participate in the survey:   27 Member States’ national CSIRTs;   Additional public, private (IRC of Operator of essential services (OES)) and  European sectoral CSIRTs from the 27 MS.  Further information on data collected can be found in A Annex – Presentation of the raw data  (p. 44).  Together with ENISA, the project team then drafted the survey to be sent to both audiences  considering aspects such as data protection, privacy and legal aspects, language, size and  format, and structure.  The final version of the survey validated by ENISA is available in B Annex: Survey –  questionnaire (p. 48)  2.2.4 Step 4 – Conducting the survey and complementary interviews  The survey was sent by ENISA to the 27 national CSIRTs and additional sectoral CSIRTs  through the CSIRTs Network12. To maximise participation the survey included a presentation  of the study and its context.  Targeted e-mails were sent to relevant contacts and followed up on, to ensure a high  response rate from Member States and sectors.  Following the survey, additional interviews took place to complement and further enrich the  data collected with the survey and desktop research with both:   Sectoral Cybersecurity experts;   Members of the Informal Expert Group on Incident response Capabilities;  A list of entities was drafted for each group with an interview rationale validated by ENISA.  Once agreed, participants were able to fill-in the survey, using the EU survey tool, or  scheduling a phone interview to provide their answers.  An overview of the raw data collected through the survey is detailed in A Annex –  Presentation of the raw data (p. 44).  2.2.5 Step 5 – Collation of raw data  The raw data collected from the desktop research, the survey and the interviews, was  aggregated in structured tables in a collaborative tool.  The collaborative tool allowed the aggregation of all raw data, the generation of statistics and  the identification of key input.  2.2.6 Step 6 – Analysis and identification of trends  The methodology used in this step was a qualitative use of the Delphi Method. This method  ensures that the data collection team and the data analysis team benefit from and build on  12 https://csirtsnetwork.eu/  https://csirtsnetwork.eu/  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  13  each other’s expertise, and that the final analysis addresses all aspects of the request  presented in a concise, coherent and comprehensive way.  The data collection team and the data analysis team performed a first analysis of the raw  data to develop a draft set of key findings. With analysis methods applied, the teams drafted  a first version of the key findings of the study and submitted it to ENISA for validation and  further discussion.  At a later stage, a virtual workshop held via videoconference was organised with members of  the ENISA Informal Expert Group on Sectoral Incident Response Capabilities13.  After the virtual workshop and once all final comments were received, a preliminary version  of the final report was drafted and submitted to ENISA for validation and further discussion.  2.2.7 Step 7 – Final report  This final step consisted in further developing findings and in drafting the final report of the  study in collaboration with the member of the IEG.  Close interactions and exchanges with ENISA ensured that the final recommendations of the  study were in line with the Agency’s needs and expectations.  2.3 OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF THE DATA & INFORMATION  AVAILABILITY  The identification of reliable and qualitative data was crucial throughout the study. For each  of the three activities conducted during the study, namely the desktop research phase, the  survey and the complementary interviews, an overall assessment the data and information  availability was conducted, and several assumptions were made. A detailed overview of the  raw data is presented in A Annex – Presentation of the raw data (p. 44).  For both the desktop research and survey data collection phases, research identified all  CSIRTs relevant to the energy and transport sectors about which information was publicly  available, regardless of size or maturity. As described in the key findings, whether these two  sectors are covered by sectoral or by national CSIRTs varies from country to country. The  information is summarised p. 16.  2.3.1 Desktop research – Data collection assessment  During the open-source desktop research phase, information on IR layout and set-up was  collected for 19 out of 27 Member States and a few elements were collected for the  remaining 8 MS.   The clarity and level of information available on national IR approach in NISD  sectors was very different from one Member States to another;   Information on procedures, processes and tools used by Sectoral IR teams were  rarely, if ever, detailed in publicly available documents;   Publicly available information about cooperation models or cross-border procedures  was not detailed;   Qualitative information on information exchange communities and fora were rarely,  if ever, detailed in publicly available documents.  13 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirt-cert-services/reactive-services/informal-expert-group-on-eu-ms-incident- response-development/  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirt-cert-services/reactive-services/informal-expert-group-on-eu-ms-incident-response-development/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirt-cert-services/reactive-services/informal-expert-group-on-eu-ms-incident-response-development/  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  14  2.3.2 Survey – data collection assessment  The survey collected answers from 20 respondents from 13 Member States and 1 regional  air transport organisation:   10 National CSIRTs;   4 Regulatory organisation, body or Ministry;   2 Sectoral CSIRT (1 national and 1 European);   4 Energy and Air Transport OES IRT.  Further information is presented in A Annex – Presentation of the raw data (p. 44). Specific  information about the breakdown of respondents by type and sector can be found p.46.  2.3.3 Interviews – data collection assessment  And additional two interviews were conducted with sectoral experts in each of the two  targeted sectors (Air Transport and Energy) along with extra interviews conducted with  members of the Informal Expert Group on Incident Response Capabilities.  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  15  3. KEY FINDINGS  3.1 KEY FINDING #1- IRC SET-UP AND LANDSCAPE  A large majority of EU countries tend to have dedicated sectoral specialists and experts  within their National/governmental CSIRTs rather than a dedicated sectoral entity at  national level. Sectoral CSIRTs are not yet the norm in the EU.  Our research, which covered the 27 EU Member States, identified National sectoral CSIRT  capabilities in 19 Member States14:   65% (12 out 19 MS) have no Sectoral CSIRTs, 9 haven’t planned to create one in the near  future, but 3 are discussing the possibility of creating one some at national level in the  future, should the need arise;   1 MS is currently setting up both an Energy and Air Transport CSIRT at national level;   4 MS have no Energy or Air transport CSIRT at national level yet but do have other  Sectoral CSIRTs (Finance, Health or Water, etc.);   1 MS has an Energy Sectoral CSIRT at national level and 1 MS has an Air Transport  Sectoral CSIRT at national level;  To this date, the general approach towards IR set-up in both the Energy and Air Transport  sectors in the EU is to have the National CSIRT acting as the competent authority for IR and  OES in charge of conducting incident response at operational level, with a dedicated unit or  sectoral expert to that purpose.  Table 1: Overview of all MS’ basic IR set-up in sectors (with available data collected)  Countries Summary of national approach toward IR in the Energy & Air Transport sectors  Austria  The Federal Chancellery is the Strategic NIS authority and CERT.at, the national CSIRT, is the  primary contact point for IT-security in a national context. CERT.at coordinates other CSIRTs  operating in the area of critical or communication infrastructure provides basic IT-security  information to SMEs. In case of significant online attacks against Austrian infrastructures,  CERT.at will coordinate the response by the targeted operators and local security teams.  The Austrian Energy CERT (AEC) is the single contact point for incidents in the Energy sector.  There is no dedicated entity for the Air Transport sector.  Belgium  The Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium (CCB) acts as the national coordination authority, and acts  as national CSIRT in the CSIRTs Network. In support of the national CSIRT, each sectoral  authority may choose to develop a sectoral CSIRT, subject to compliance with the obligations set  out in Annex I of the transposition of the NIS Directive. The CCB acts as coordinator for all  sectoral CSIRT at national level. Belgium is currently discussing the creation of a sectoral CSIRT  for Oil.  Bulgaria  CERT Bulgaria (English), is the National Computer Security Incident Response Team. Its  mission is to provide information and assistance to its constituencies in implementing proactive  measures to reduce the risks of computer security incidents as well as responding to such  incidents when they occur. Bulgaria is currently creating sectoral CSIRTs to facilitate the  implementation of the requirements of the NIS Directive.  14 Our desktop research delivered a general overview of Incident Response Set-up in the 27 Member States. In 8 Member  States (Croatia, Denmark, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Malta, Slovenia), no formal confirmation of the existence of  sectoral CSIRTs at national level could be found at the time of the production of the present report.  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  16  Countries Summary of national approach toward IR in the Energy & Air Transport sectors  Croatia  National CSIRT (CERT.hr) is a department within the Croatian Academic and Research  Network – CARNET established in accordance with the Information Security Act of the Republic  of Croatia.  According to this Act, CERT.hr is a national body for the prevention of cyber threats and the  protection of the security of public information systems in the Republic of Croatia. The  department’s main task is to handlecomputer security incidents to preserve the security of  information systems in Croatia. Furthermore, according to the Act on cybersecurity of operators  of essential services and digital service providers CERT.hr workswith the Information Systems  Security Bureau (ISSB) of the Republic of Croatia on the coordination of prevention and  response to computer threats to information systems security.  The Information Systems Security Bureau (ISSB) is the central state authority responsible for  technical areas of information security of the Republic of Croatia state bodies, which includes  standards of information security, security accreditation of information security, managing crypto  material used in the exchange of classified information, and coordination of prevention and  response to computer threats to information system security. ISSB, is a CSIRT for most of NIS  sectors, including energy and transport.  Cyprus  The Office of the Commissioner of Electronic Communications and Postal Regulation (OCECPR)  is an independent regulatory authority of the Republic of Cyprus in matters of electronic  communications and postal services, with additional responsibilities in the areas of terminal  equipment, network and information security and protection of critical information infrastructures.  It was selected as the body responsible for coordinating the implementation of the National  Cybersecurity Strategy of the Republic of Cyprus, in relation tothe pillars of network and  information security (cybersecurity), cybercrime, cyber defence and related external affairs.  OCECPR is responsible for the creation and coordination of a body or bodies for response to  incidents related to Network and Information Security in Cyprus. It also supervises and regulates  the activity of the above CSIRT entities. CSIRT-CY handles reported cyber incidents, proactively  identifying potential threats and coordinating with relevant government agencies nationally,  regionally and globally to reduce the impact of the cyberattacks.  Czech  Republic  The Czech Republic has two response teams: 1) a Government Computer Emergency  Response Team (GovCERT.CZ) and 2) a national Computer Security Incident Response Team  (CSIRT.CZ).  The Government CSIRT (GovCERT.CZ), https://www.govcert.cz/ (Czech);  https://www.govcert.cz/en/ (English), is based in Brno. Its main task is to collect reports of cyber  incidents from specified entities, analyse them and provide assistance.  Denmark  The principle of sectoral responsibility is the rule. It implies that the authority responsible for a  given function on a day-to-day basis is also the responsible authority when a serious incident  occurs. This responsibility also includes planning how to maintain and continue to supply  functions in the event of an extraordinary incident. Consequently, responsibility for cyber and  information security, and thus the task of protecting critical infrastructure, is divided between the  authorities responsible for the critical sectors, i.e. the transport sector, the healthcare sector and  the financial sector.  The 2018-2023 Defence Agreement significantly enhances the ability of the Danish Centre for  Cyber Security (CFCS) to assist central government authorities responsible for the various  sectors.  Estonia  Estonia has opted fora centralised coordination and supervision of the sectoral IT security within  the framework of the NIS directive's implementation. The activities falling within the scope of the  NIS directive go to different units within the RIA. In addition to the operation centre, which also  houses the CERT-EE, there is a standardisation and review unit whose task is to ensure  compliance with the CSA (Cyber Security Act) and, in the long run, the NIS Directive. RIA CERT- EE plays the role of government CSIRT, which gives the authority good knowledge of the  systems.  Finland  The National Cyber Security Centre Finland (Kyberturvallisuuskeskus, also referred to as NCSC- FI; previously CERT-FI) is responsible for the supervision of all Finnish CSIRTs. Its mandate  includes incident response, preparedness, training, regulation and control. Sector-specific  authorities have competence for supervision, namely the Energy Authority, the Centre for  Economic Development, Transport and the Environment and the Finnish Transport and  Communications Agency.  France  CERT-FR is the Computer Emergency Response Team of the French national cyber security  authority. Its mission is to coordinate and investigate IT security incident response for the French  government, critical national infrastructure operators and operators of essential services as  defined by the French law. The primary constituency is composed of French territories and  covers all ministries, administrations and state services; critical national infrastructure operators  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  17  Countries Summary of national approach toward IR in the Energy & Air Transport sectors  and operators of essential services as defined by the French law and other key players in  sensitive sectors.  CERT-FR was created in 1999 as a governmental CSIRT and afterwards became the National  CSIRT. There are CSIRTs specific to companies, such as EDF in the energy sector, but the  creation of sectoral CSIRTs is currently under discussion, although not in the air transport sector.  Germany  The Federal Office for Information Security, BSI, has gained expanded powers with the entry into  force of the NISD, in addition to being the supervisory authority for all sectors, CSIRT and  national contact points. BSI was previously primarily responsible for the security of critical  infrastructures, but with the adoption of the NIS directive, the mandate has been extended to  include network and information security.  Greece  GR-CSIRT was established in 2018. It is a National CSIRT. The GR - CSIRT is in charge of  handling incidents (cyber attacks) affecting Operators of Essential Services (OES), is responsible  for incident detection, incident response coordination and decision-making, including  coordination with other national stakeholders..  Hungary  The core operational cyber security capabilities and cyber incident management are centralised  in the governmental computer emergency response team in Hungary, GovCERT-Hungary, which  is part of the National Cyber Defence Institute and supervised by the Ministry of Interior.  GovCERT-Hungary provides services for the entire Hungarian governmental administration –  especially for the government backbone system, for critical infrastructures and municipalities.  Sectoral CSIRTs are being established: beyond the existing CIIP CERT (operating under the  National Directorate General for Disaster Management), another two are being set up, one for  defence within the Military National Security Service, and another one for civilian intelligence  within the Information Office.  Ireland  CSIRT-IE is the body within the NCSC providing assistance to constituents in responding to  cybersecurity incidents at national level for Ireland. The team has a strictly defined constituency  consisting mainly of Government bodies and Critical National Infrastructure providers.  CSIRT-IE provides incident response services to Government bodies and Critical National  Infrastructure providers across Ireland. CSIRT-IE also acts as a national point of contact for  international partners who wish to inform Irish-based entities of cybersecurity matters, which may  affect them.  The Irish Reporting & Information Security Service (IRISS) is an independent not for profit CSIRT  dedicated to the broader public rather than companies or government and entities.  Italy  Computer Security Incident Response Team - Italia sits within the Department of Security  Information (DIS). Its missions consist in:  - monitoring incidents at national level;  - warning interested parties of potential/ongoing attacks;  - intervening in case of incidents;  - performing dynamic analysis of risks and incidents;  And includes situational awareness; participation to CSIRT networks.  Computer Security Incident Response Team - Italia cooperates with the private sector and  promotes the use of common practices and standards in risk management and incident- response, as well as classification of incidents, risks and information.  Latvia  The Latvian Computer Emergency Response Team - CERT.LV (Latvian: https://cert.lv/lv;  English: cert.lv/en) is responsible for monitoring and analysing developments in cyberspace,  reacting to incidents and coordinating incident prevention. It also carries out research, organises  educational events and training, and supervises the implementation of obligations defined in the  Law on Security Information.  CERT.LV is expected to develop resources with the public and private sectors for collecting  intelligence on incidents for analysis and evaluation.  Lithuania  The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) at the Ministry of National Defence is the main  Lithuanian cyber security institution responsible for unified management of cyber incidents,  monitoring and control of the implementation of cybersecurity requirements, accreditation of  information resources. It was established after the entry into force of the Law on Cybersecurity in  January 2015.  The NCSC’s mission is to be the centre of cyber security expertise for effective cyber security  incidents and a strong cyber security prevention system in the country.  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  18  Countries Summary of national approach toward IR in the Energy & Air Transport sectors  Luxembourg  The Institut Luxembourgeois de Régulation (ILR) ensures regulation and supervises the following  economic sectors: network and communication, electricity, natural gas, postal services,  transport (rail and air), radio frequencies. CIRCL is the CSIRT for the private sector,  municipalities and non-governmental entities in Luxembourg.  Luxembourg’s government CSIRT (govcert.lu) covers incidents targeting government and public  or private OES.  Malta  CSIRTMalta is responsible for coordinating incident response measures for entities engaged with  Maltese critical infrastructure.  The Information Security & Governance Department’s Security Engineering Team covers  government IT security.  Netherlands  (The)  The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC.NL) (Dutch, English) was established in 2012 and  incorporates the Dutch Computer Emergency Response Team for the Dutch central government.  NCSC.NL is responsible for the coordination of incident response measures for Dutch  government institutions, as well as entities engaged with critical infrastructure.  The NCSC covers multiple functions, such as managing the reporting of cybersecurity incidents  with a multi-channel reporting structure to log said incidents. The Centre is also responsible for  maintaining a national detection response network for the governmental sector and entities  engaged in the event of a cybersecurity incident. The centre also actively participates in the work  of the Information Sharing and Analysis Centres (ISACs) for sectors involved with critical  infrastructure.  Poland  In Poland, entities involved in handling and responding to computer incidents at national level are  the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT GOV), the Ministry of Defence  Computer Emergency Response System (CSIRT MON) and the National Cybersecurity Centre  (NC Cyber or CSIRT NASK). Their mission is to counter cross-sectoral and cross-border  cyberthreats, to coordinate the handling of major, substantial and critical incidents, and to  provide information about incidents, both within the network of government organisations related  to cybersecurity and to the general public.  Portugal  The National Cybersecurity Centre (Centro Nacional de Cibersegurança) is the Portuguese  cybersecurity national authority. It has regulatory, supervisory, enforcement and sanctioning  functions and the power to issue cybersecurity instructions. It defines the national level of  cybersecurity alert. In addition, a National Computer Security Incident Response Team  (CERT.PT) operates within the National Cybersecurity Centre and its main competence is  to: (i)  Implement operational coordination in response to incidents, in particular in liaison with existing  sectoral IT security incident response teams.  Romania  CERT-RO is the competent national authority for the implementation of the NIS Directive. CER- RO’s missions are to prevent, analyse, identify and respond to cybersecurity incidents related to  Romanian cyberspace. CERT-RO acts as National contact point for cybersecurity incidents with  similar structures within or outside Romania. CERT-AV-RO, which runs within Romania Civil  Aviation Authority (RO-CAA, acts as the Romanian civil aviation sectoral CSIRT and there are  plans for setting up other sectoral CSIRTs in the near future.  Slovakia  Created in 2016, the National Cyber Security Authority SK-CERT provides national and strategic  activities in the field of cyber security management, threat analysis as well as coordination of  national security incident resolution. The National Cyber Security Centre also supports  governance, development, management and support of cybersecurity competence centres,  including training, educational activities, and research.  Slovenia  The Slovenian Information Security Administration (Uprava RS za informacijsko varnost - ZlnfV)  acts as a National CSIRT, the national response centre primarily responsible for examining  security incidents. The ZInfV also provides for the establishment of state administration  authorities’ CSIRT. The Slovenian Information Security Administration operates under the  authority of the Ministry of Government Administration. The Slovenian Information Security  Administration began operating on 1 January 2020.  Spain  The CCN-CERT is responsible for the management of cyber-incidents affecting public or private  sector organisations. In the case of critical public sector operators, the management of cyber- incidents is carried out by the CCN-CERT in coordination with the Centro Nacional de Protección  de Infraestructuras y Ciberseguridad (CNPIC).  Sweden  CERT-SE is the National CSIRT of Sweden. Its constituency consists of Swedish society,  including but not limited to, governmental authorities, regional authorities, municipalities, and  companies. In addition, CERT-SE is also Sweden’s governmental CSIRT.  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  19  As illustrated in the table above, the sectoral Incident Response layout and set-up at  European level in both the Air Transport and Energy sector is still recent and evolving. The  ecosystem is organised around the following elements:  At national level, Incident response set-up is structured around:   Generic IR services provided by the national/governmental CSIRT in each EU  Member State for all sectors, including Energy and Air Transport. This is  particularly relevant in countries with a centralised IR model;  These national/governmental CSIRTs either have specific experts and specialists  within their organisation for these two sectors or a dedicated unit. In these Member  States, Energy and Air Transport OES are also developing their own internal  CSIRTs or are externalising this activity to certified Digital Service Providers  (DSPs);   For two Member States, dedicated Sectoral CSIRTs coordinate incident  response at national level, supervised by the national CSIRT.  At European level, the landscape also includes international organisations’ sectoral CSIRTs  intended to develop requirements and regulations and to provide a forum for sector  stakeholders.  Both sectoral IRC/OES IRT at national level and Sectoral CSIRT of international  organisations tend to be recent (less than 5 years old) and are still in the development phase  of their capabilities.   Summary: All Member States recognise the need for specific IR expertise for NISD  sectors at national level to support OES and sectoral actors. This specific IR expertise can  either be mutualised within the National CSIRT or organised as a separate and dedicated  sectoral entity. This expertise is essential as IR capabilities must be aligned with the risk  management process specific to each sector.  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  20  3.2 KEY FINDING #2 – CREATION OF SECTORAL CSIRTS  The EU countries which decided to create a dedicated sectoral CSIRT for the Energy  or Air Transport sector were driven by organisational and functional needs rather than  technical ones.  A closer look reveals that for those two Member States who decided to create a dedicated  sectoral CSIRT for Energy or Air Transport at national level, the main drivers were  organisational and functional needs rather than technical ones.  Both the Energy Sectoral CSIRT and the Air Transport Sectoral CSIRT created at national  level responded to a need and a specific demand from sector stakeholders to organise  Incident Response nationally.  “[there is a] need for facilitating oversight and compliance” (Air Transport Sectoral CSIRT)  Table 2: Case Study – Creation of the Austrian Energy CERT  Case study  Austrian Energy CERT (AEC)  Background and context of creation  The Austrian energy sector regulator (E-Control Austria), the sector association (Oesterreichs Energie)  and the most important energy companies in the electricity, oil and gas subsectors worked together on  an analysis and evaluation of security of supply in 2015. This work intended to identify the risks arising  from the use of ICT infrastructure and to examine them in detail. This resulted in a successful joint  initiative in the form of a public-private partnership (PPP).  This partnership further enhanced mutual understanding and trust. It also increased awareness and  acceptance of preventative measures to boost resilience.  One of these measures was the creation and operation of a computer emergency response team  (CERT) for the Austrian electricity and gas sectors.  Sources  https://www.energy-cert.at/en/about-us/  http://www.aec.arge.or.at/index.php/en/about-us.html  https://www.geode-eu.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/3-4-Selhofer-Armin.pdf  Although not a member of the European Union, Norway is also an interesting case to  mention among the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries. KraftCERT  (Norwegian energy sector CSIRT) is the result of a joint initiative from NorCERT and the  Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE). The Sectoral CSIRT aims to  support the entire power industry at national level in the prevention and handling of security  incidents15.  As illustrated below, the creation of sector-specific IR Capacities was not the result of  the lack  of sector-specific knowledge of the National CSIRT, nor the inability to manage cybersecurity  incidents in the sectors at national level.  15 https://smart-lighting.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/SectorialimplementationoftheNISDirectiveintheEnergysectorpdf.pdf  https://www.energy-cert.at/en/about-us/ http://www.aec.arge.or.at/index.php/en/about-us.html https://www.geode-eu.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/3-4-Selhofer-Armin.pdf https://smart-lighting.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/SectorialimplementationoftheNISDirectiveintheEnergysectorpdf.pdf  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  21  Figure 3: Drivers to create sector-specific IR Capacities  NB: Five respondents decided not to answer this question as they do not have a national  sectoral CSIRT and for the moment do not intend to create one in the near future.  According to 50% of respondents, the need to facilitate the implementation of the NIS Directive  is one of the most important drivers behind the creation of such sector specific IR capacities. It  shows that European legislation has an important and positive impact in pushing actors to  develop sectoral capacities16.  The need to be prepared and to facilitate the implementation of the requirements of the NIS  Directive is shared by those two Member States currently preparing or discussing the creation of  sectoral CSIRTs and by sectoral private operators who decided to create an internal IR  capacity.  Both Denmark and Belgium are currently discussing the creation of an energy CSIRT at national  level. According to Denmark’s sectoral strategy17, « it is considered that such a sector CERT  with sector-specific competences is relevant to the energy sector to act on the cyber threats ».  Danish authorities will explore how a sectoral CSIRT could be established and whether there is  a basis for establishing a common CSIRT with specialist competence in cybersecurity in the  energy sector. Depending on its structure, a sectoral CSIRT will be able to contribute specific  knowledge and experience-based competencies such as advising and training. In Belgium, the  creation of an oil-sector CSIRT is currently under discussion18.  16 https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=62799  17 https://fmn.dk/eng/news/Pages/New-sectoral-strategie-stop-repare-society-for-cyberattacks.aspx  18 https://www.energy-community.org/dam/jcr:23cf8d77-32dd-4152-b040-51e3a17bd19c/FPS Economy, Cybersecurity  in the oil sector.pdf  https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=62799 https://fmn.dk/eng/news/Pages/New-sectoral-strategie-stop-repare-society-for-cyberattacks.aspx  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  22  Table 3: Case Study - Bulgarian Cybersecurity Strategy  Case study  Bulgaria  Background and context of the will to create Sectoral CSIRTs  In October 2018, the Bulgarian Parliament approved a new Cybersecurity Act, which is the transposition  of the NIS Directive into national law.  The Cyber Security Act determines the overall organisation, management and control of cybersecurity at  national level and establishes new authorities and their responsibilities.  According to the Act, the “Electronic Governance” State Agency (or the “E-Governance Agency”) is the  national competent authority and is thus empowered to establish a national Computer Security Incident  Response Team (CSIRT). Currently, a Bulgarian CSIRT Centre exists (https://govcert.bg), which assists  in reducing the risks of information security incidents and resolving such incidents if they have already  occurred. The Act states that Computer Security Incident Response Teams are to be established  within competent local authorities in various sectors (i.e. energy, transport, banking, financial  market infrastructures, health, and digital) and will coordinate their activities with the national CSIRT.  Sources  https://www.cms-lawnow.com/ealerts/2018/11/bulgaria-adopts-new-cyber-security-act  http://www.aec.arge.or.at/index.php/en/about-us.html  The response of a private electricity provider from a large member state, which decided to  create its own CSIRT in January 2019 is an illustration of this trend.  “There was a growing awareness of the need to create an internal capacity to handle incident  response in the organisation. The Chief Information Officer was aware of the lack of  preparedness and had the will to invest to be prepared for the upcoming changes (GDPR,  NIS Directive implementation, upcoming status of OES). We wanted to anticipate the future  taking into account the growing number of attacks targeting other actors.”  Another point to reflect on is that both Energy and Air Transport Sector deal with cross-  border aspects. There is, therefore, a need for cross-border communication between entities,  which could be facilitated by the creation of sectoral CSIRTs.   Summary: The creation of sectoral entities tends to facilitate the functioning of IR at  national level, the implementation of cybersecurity regulations and cross-border cooperation  for sectoral actors.  http://www.aec.arge.or.at/index.php/en/about-us.html  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  23  3.3 KEY FINDING #3 – SECTORAL CSIRTS SERVICES  National energy and air transport sectoral CSIRTs tend to provide their constituency  with very sector-specific expertise in addition to the generic services provided by  national CSIRTs.  As illustrated in chapter 3.1, a majority of EU countries tends to either rely on the generic  services of their national CSIRT or to support the development of Incident Response  capabilities of operators of essential services in the energy and air transport sectors. The  focus of the study was therefore to analyse the differences between specific services  provided by National Sectoral CSIRTs as opposed to those provided by National CSIRTs.  According to survey responses, and as confirmed by additional desktop research, Sectoral  CSIRTs at national level tend to provide very sector-specific expertise and maintain closer  relationships with their constituents.  Additional services provided by Sectoral CSIRTs at national level differing from those of  National CSIRTs include:   Specific information and in-depth knowledge in their sector;   Sector-specific network of contacts;   Closer relationships with vendors of the sector;   Expertise on sector-specific hardware and systems;   Sector-specific conferences, workshops, and training;   The creation of uniform frameworks for audit documentation at sectoral level;   Faster sectoral communication channel, as their constituency base is smaller than the one  of a National CSIRT;   Sector-specific recommendations.  “It [the Sectoral CSIRT] could provide more in-depth knowledge of the sector’s specificities &  challenges” (National CSIRT)  In addition to those services, Sectoral CSIRTs would be an important player to organise  sectoral exercises as they have good communication channels and closer relationships with  the main sectoral stakeholders at national level.  In Romania, the creation of a dedicated sectoral CSIRT for Air Transport at national level  was driven by the following key needs:   The need for a real-time and integrated response capability;   The need for a continuous and up-to-date situational awareness;   The need to facilitate oversight and compliance;  CERT-AV-RO was created as a consequence within the Romanian Civil Aviation Authority to  facilitate the monitoring, detection and coordination of the response to correlated incidents,  as well as cooperation and hierarchical reporting. The services provided by CERT-AV-RO  compared with those of the National CSIRT are presented below.  “A Sectoral  CSIRT at national  level could  provide a more  in-depth  knowledge of the  sector’s  specificities &  challenges.”  (National CSIRT)  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  24  Table 4: Case Study - CERT-AV-RO - Specific mandate and services compared with those  the National CSIRT  Case study  Romania  National CSIRT’s mandate (CERT-RO)  Sectoral Aviation CSIRT’s mandate (CERT-AV- RO)  CERT-RO is the competent national authority for  the implementation of NIS Directive. Its mandate  includes:  –  the prevention, analysis, identification and  response to cyber security incidents related to  Romanian cyberspace.  –  a national contact point for cybersecurity  incidents for similar structures within or outside  Romania.  –  the development of national IT security policies  and strategies along with other Romanian public  authorities and the proposition of regulations  regarding the national cybersecurity strategy.  –  the official advisor of the national public  authorities for the cyber-protection of critical  infrastructure.  CERT-AV-RO is responsible for integrated incident  management for the entire civil aviation sector.  Each civil aviation entity has full responsibility for  the management of cybersecurity incidents in their  organisations. CERT-AV-RO and RO CAA’s  responsibility is limited to integrated and correlated  monitoring and detection of cybersecurity events  and incidents, as well as to the coordination of  incident response when an incident impacts more  than one organisation.

According to survey responses, both National and Sectoral CSIRTs’ main services and  functions relate to Information Security Incident Management and Vulnerability Management,  among others.  Sectoral CSIRTs tend to be recent and therefore dedicate their resources to these two  services and focus less on knowledge transfer activities.   Summary: Sectoral CSIRTs play an important role in facilitating operational collaboration  and information sharing at Sectoral level.  19 https://www.first.org/standards/frameworks/csirts/csirt_services_framework_v2.1  FIRST CSIRT  SERVICES  FRAMEWORK  The FIRST CSIRT  Services Framework  seeks to assist  CSIRT teams by  identifying and  defining core  categories of services  and their sub-  components.  https://www.first.org/standards/frameworks/csirts/csirt_services_framework_v2.1  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  26  3.4 KEY FINDING #4 – SECTORAL IR PROCESSES AND TOOLS  The tools and processes used by sectoral CSIRTs to deliver their services are similar  to of national CSIRTs.

Those teams are still testing or selecting tools and therefore are still  preparing associated procedures and SOPs.  Despite varying maturity levels, most CSIRTs tend to have very organised procedures in place  to handle incidents.  According to ENISA CSIRT Maturity assessment20 Model, CSIRTs can self-assess their team’s  maturity based on a list of 44 parameters over 4 categories: O (Organisational), H (Human), T  (Tools) and P (Processes).  Each main category includes a diverse range of parameters such  as those defined for Organisational parameters, which analyse the mandate, constituency,  authority, responsibility, or services of the CSIRT.  The ENISA CSIRT Assessment model defines a list of key parameters to analyse a CSIRT Tool  maturity including the following:   An IT Resource List;   An Information Sources List;   A Consolidated E-mail System;   An Incident Tracking System;   A resilient Phone, email and Internet Access;   An Incident Prevention, Detection and Resolution Toolset.  20 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-capabilities/csirt-maturity/csirt-maturity-self-assessment-survey  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-capabilities/csirt-maturity/csirt-maturity-self-assessment-survey  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  28  The evaluation of the presence, existence of guidelines/procedures and effective use of the  elements listed above are an excellent method to assess the maturity of CSIRT tools. There are  several methods available for maturity assessment in addition to the one proposed by ENISA.  The analysis of the CSIRTs through the survey (National CSIRTs in charge of IR in energy and  Air Transport Sectors; Sectoral CSIRTs at national level, OES IRTs), gave the following results:   70% of respondents have formal SOPs that OES teams should follow in case of an  incident. Among the remaining 30%, some are in the process of developing such  guidelines and two participants did not provide an answer to this question.   82% of respondents use a formal incident notification template and those who do not  have an SOP yet are in the process of establishing one.  Figure 4: Specific information exchange tools for notification of incidents   100% of respondents have specific information exchange tools (commercial or  dedicated) to enable the notification of incidents. Among these tools, the most  commonly used is secure e-mail.  France is an interesting case study in terms of good practices. The Member State has various  procedures in place at national level according to the nature of the actor targeted by a  cyberattack.

According to the survey, a majority of CSIRTs, whether national CSIRTs, national sectoral  CSIRTs or OES CSIRTs, did not seek any specific support or guidance from external  stakeholders to design and implement sectoral IR capacities.  Figure 5: Specific information exchange tools used for notification  Even if they don’t directly ask for support, they all tend to leverage the guidelines, tools and  know-how made available by EU authorities, regulators or other national CSIRTs.  As an example, 60% of respondents use specific CSIRT maturity assessment methodologies  to support the development of IR Capabilities in their sector. 70% out of these use both the  ENISA CSIRT Maturity assessment22 and SIM323. Both methodologies are seen as valuable  tools to enhance the maturation of CSIRTs.  22 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-capabilities/csirt-maturity/csirt-maturity-self-assessment-survey  23 http://opencsirt.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/SIM3-mkXVIIIc.pdf  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-capabilities/csirt-maturity/csirt-maturity-self-assessment-survey http://opencsirt.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/SIM3-mkXVIIIc.pdf  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  32  Figure 6: CSIRT maturity Assessment methodology used  Together with National CSIRTs, regulators and professional associations are key enablers  for capability development for the Energy and Air Transport Sectoral CSIRTs as well as OES  CSIRTs. Several initiatives were recently implemented at sectoral level to foster these  capacities, some by sectoral operators themselves.  A noteworthy initiative in the energy sector is the 2019 launch of a cyber range dedicated to  electricity operators. The German energy company Innogy opened its “CyberRange-e”  training centre. The cyber range “allows up to 12 network and IT specialists at a time to  practice how to manage cyberattacks under real-life electricity grid conditions, including war-  game methods, pitching the participants against real hackers”24. According to Professor  Andreas Pinkwart, Minister for Economic Affairs, Digitisation, Innovation and Energy of the  State of North Rhine-Westphalia, this facility addresses the need to better protect and  safeguard data, procedures and processes in the energy industry.  At European level, sectoral regulators are also developing initiatives to enhance sectoral  stakeholders’ incident response capabilities. As an example, the Council of European Energy  Regulators offered a dedicated training on cybersecurity and the protection of the European  energy sector25 back in 2016.  At national level, many ministries, National Cybersecurity Agencies or National CSIRTs  provide different support tools and initiatives to sectoral actors.  24 https://www.energylivenews.com/2019/07/02/german-power-grid-operators-steel-themselves-for-cyber-attacks/  25 https://www.ceer.eu/training/training_courses_2016/cyber_security_sept_2016#  https://www.energylivenews.com/2019/07/02/german-power-grid-operators-steel-themselves-for-cyber-attacks/ https://www.ceer.eu/training/training_courses_2016/cyber_security_sept_2016  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  33  Figure 7: Resources in place to support IRC development  The NIS Cooperation Group identified multiple examples in their “Sectorial implementation of  the NIS Directive in the Energy sector” report26 as illustrated below:  Table 8: Case Study - 9 Member States initiatives to support Energy Sector operators with their  cybersecurity capacity-building27  Member State Initiative  Austria  The Austrian Energy CERT organises frequent meetings with technical personnel as  well as frequent meetings with senior management in the energy sector with a focus  on their performance and development.

Some sectoral CSIRTs also look for support from non-EU actors and tend to reach out to  national cybersecurity and sectoral authorities from third countries. As an example, the  Romanian Civil Aeronautical Authority (RO CAA) CSIRT (CERT-AV-RO) used:   MITRE Corporation28;   The NIST Cybersecurity Framework29;   The Australian Cyber Security Centre;   The United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority and the UK National Cyber Security  Centre (NCSC);   The Centre for Internet Security (CIS) Best Practices based on “CIS Controls” and “CIS  Benchmarks”30.   Summary: ENISA and other EU institutions and stakeholders should continue their efforts to  support capacity development across the European IR community by facilitating open access to  resources and tools for operational stakeholders.  28 US NGO: https://www.mitre.org/capabilities/cybersecurity/cyber-threat-intelligence  29 https://www.nist.gov/topics/cybersecurity  30 https://www.cisecurity.org/cybersecurity-best-practices/  https://www.mitre.org/capabilities/cybersecurity/cyber-threat-intelligence https://www.nist.gov/topics/cybersecurity https://www.cisecurity.org/cybersecurity-best-practices/  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  35  3.6 KEY FINDING #6 – SECTORAL CSIRTS CHALLENGES AND GAPS 1/2  Sectoral CSIRTs in both air transport and energy sectors face a similar challenge, i.e.  the overlap of multiple legislations and increasing time spent on compliance issues.  Both Air Transport and Energy operators share common specificities and similar challenges  when it comes to incident response. Both sectors are considered to be the backbones of  societies to such extent that any disruption could have a major impact on populations and  economies. Shared specificities are:   Complex ecosystems with large supply chains: both sectors count a wide variety  of public and private-sector actors, ranging from government, regulators and  professional associations to large industries, critical SMEs and digital service  providers;   Infrastructure interdependencies: both sectors have infrastructures strongly  interconnected to others across the European Union and beyond. This can  potentially lead to a cascading effect, and could result, in case of one system  targeted, in all others being compromised. As an example, a gas pipeline can run  through several countries, and an airport infrastructure is a commercial hub for  essential products in a country.   Legacy systems and lack of security-by-design: both sectors are composed of  basic infrastructure elements (e.g.: transformers and generators in the Energy  sector), all  designed and built much before cybersecurity became an issue, and of  more recent equipment used for automation and control, and increasingly  dependent on ICT.   Real-time requirements and 24h coverage: In both the Energy sector and Air  Transport, several cybersecurity measures would be challenging to implement in  real-time such as 24/7 monitoring coverage or systems shut down. This is  particularly true for infrastructures that cannot be easily shut down given the  prohibitive operational costs (financial and for users) associated with such a  measure.  Because of these specificities, sectoral incident response stakeholders in both the Air  transport and Energy sectors face common challenges.  One of the most common challenges raised by sectoral stakeholders, and common to all  sectors and impacting the entire cybersecurity community, is how to deal and comply with the  multiplication of requirements from national/EU authorities and sectoral actors (professional  association and regulators).  “There is a high need for sync[hronisation] between EU regulatory bodies, regarding the  harmonisation between the general cybersecurity regulation (i.e. NIS Directive) and the  special/ specific cybersecurity requirements of each of the industries. Some of the industrial  entities (which are defined specifically as under the NIS Directive jurisdiction, e.g. OES)  refuse to respect the NIS Directive and the transposed national legislation, motivating that  they are only under the jurisdiction of the special legislation. NIS Directive and special  legislation shall complement each other, creating a framework of common base [and]  complementary regulatory provisions.” (Air Transport Sectoral CSIRT)  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  36  The European Banking Federation points to an interesting example of competing cyber-  incident reporting schemes to be applied in the European Union.  Figure 8: Main Incident Reporting Schemes in the EU (Source: EBF)31  As illustrated, for specific cyber-incidents involving a data breach, both Energy and Air  Transport stakeholders could apply at least three common EU cross-industry regulations  (namely the NIS Directive, the GDPR, the e-IDAS Regulation) along with the National reporting  regulation in place in their countries.  In Air Transport sector, several actors lead different activities related to cybersecurity.  EUROCONTROL is currently the only one receiving direct information on incidents in ATM  systems, leaving other activities focusing more in collaboration. An effort towards a coordinated  common vision is required.  The multiplication of security and reporting requirements pushes operational actors to spend  time updating their procedures to stay compliant. While costly for all, this can be particularly  tough for smaller entities with less resources available to ensure compliance.  “The efforts that we consume for the justification of the cybersecurity realities in front of the  financial control authorities’ overpass, often, the efforts for the actual development and  implementation of the domain. This is a critical issue, keeping the entire development process to  the ground.” (Sectoral CSIRT).  Sectoral stakeholders have called for a harmonisation of security regulation as a mitigation  action meant to leverage revision processes. DG ENER, for instance, created a stream for  private actors in the NIS revision process. At the same time, Air Transport stakeholders are  continuously exchanging with regulators to share their operational requirements and input.   Summary: The upcoming revisions of the NIS Directive and GDPR could be an opportunity  to harmonise legislation by considering sectoral stakeholders’ feedback.  31 EBF position on Cyber incident reporting, EBF, October 2019 source: https://www.ebf.eu/wp- content/uploads/2019/10/EBF-position-paper-on-cyber-incident-reporting.pdf  https://www.ebf.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EBF-position-paper-on-cyber-incident-reporting.pdf https://www.ebf.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EBF-position-paper-on-cyber-incident-reporting.pdf  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  37  3.7 KEY FINDING #7 – SECTORAL CSIRTS CHALLENGES AND  GAPS 2/2  Sectoral CSIRTs in both the air transport and energy sectors face a common challenge  in formally and rapidly share ex-ante information in a particularly tense context  Energy and Air Transport stakeholders are well aware of the need to enhance information-  sharing at sectoral level, yet they share a common difficulty in rapidly sharing ex-ante  information. According to sectoral stakeholders, incident response community fora are useful  to promote discussion among stakeholders but are rarely used to exchange real-time  technical information about vulnerabilities and threats.  “There should be a wider dissemination of both technical and non-technical information  related to incidents across the EU.” (OES CSIRT)  All survey respondents use various international, European, national and sectoral groups and  fora (ENISA CSIRTs Network, the FIRST Community, National inter-CSIRTs Network, etc.)  to exchange information and best practices. Yet they tend to rely on mastered tools, such as  private MISP instances, or mass communication tools tweaked for a specific use, such as  WhatsApp, to exchange operational or real-time information with peers in an informal way.  Both Energy and Air transport sectors include a multiplicity of actors and have a very wide  surface of exposure to attacks. Incident response is therefore even more challenging and  requires in-depth expertise and important capabilities to successfully ensure 24/7 coverage  and rapidly share information about cyber threats.  “[There is a need for] setting up fast channels of information exchange on cybersecurity  threats” (Sectoral Ministry)  A recurrent explanation is that stakeholders prefer to share ex-post rather than ex-ante  information to avoid reputational and commercial damages.  To mitigate this, stakeholders confirm that dedicated sectoral fora are beneficial for  information-sharing. Within those fora, information is sector-focused, up-to-date and  exchanges are often made real time. Participants are more encouraged to share information  with peers from the same sector as they use the same tools. They also rely on similar  infrastructure and face similar threats.  Several sectoral initiatives can provide interesting good practices and lessons learnt, such as  the Energy ISAC32, the Health ISAC33, the Aviation ISAC34 or the Energy Community of  Users that the European Cybersecurity Community is currently developing.  Sectoral ISACs are seen a “useful mechanism” and a trusted place to share operational  information with peers. As such, they should be better recognised. Certain tools such as  MISP or automated solutions could be explored to enhance information-sharing.   Summary: Sectoral communities of users constitute a key tool to enhance operational  information-sharing. Besides, the use of automation should be explored.  32 https://www.ee-isac.eu/  33 https://h-isac.org/  34 https://www.a-isac.com/  “There is a need  for setting up fast  channels of  information  exchange on  cybersecurity  threats.”  (Sectoral Ministry)  https://www.ee-isac.eu/ https://h-isac.org/ https://www.a-isac.com/  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  38  3.8 KEY FINDING #8 – SECTORAL CSIRTS LESSONS LEARNT  Though ongoing programmes and information-sharing initiatives have successfully  supported IRC developments in both sectors, there is still a strong demand for more  frameworks, guidance and know-how  Existing capacity-building initiatives implemented at both national and European level are  very useful for Incident Response stakeholders. Such initiatives help IR stakeholders to  foster CSIRT development in both the Energy and Air Transport sectors.  Stakeholders who participated in the survey pointed to several successful initiatives such as:   the CEF programme,   ENISA guidelines,   the CSIRTs Network,   EU ISACs,   National CSIRTs tools,   Regulators and European Sectoral CSIRTs Guidelines, etc.  According to a National CSIRT, its ultimate objective is for sectoral operators “to be  autonomous in incident response”. As a result, it focuses on anticipation and prevention on  the one hand and building resilience of its constituency on the other, by training personnel,  providing robust tools and certifying DSPs. This goal is shared by several National and  Sectoral CSIRTs all keen to foster their effort to support capacity-building at sectoral level.  A number of these initiatives are public, and therefore highly dependent on public budgets,  whether national or European. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the dramatic economic  crisis in its wake massively impact public budgets and the resources available for such  initiatives.  The Air Transport sector continues to suffer from the impact of the pandemic, with air traffic  drastically reduced and offices closing all over the world. Contingency planning does not  always feature cybersecurity to the extent it should, increasing the threat to millions working  remotely, using less secure networks and thus increasing their exposure to cyber threats.  For many Air Transport and Energy sectoral operators, the pandemic has led to temporary  and permanent job and wage cuts and staff reallocation. This in turn challenges the upkeep  of organisations’ security cultures and incident response capabilities. Even if they are critical,  cybersecurity teams have also suffered from job cuts and tense environments. This could  have severe consequences on cybersecurity in the long run, making the strengthening of IR  capabilities even more important than ever.  Several measures could be taken by European institutions to keep up their ongoing efforts35  to enhance Sectoral IR capacity-building:   Measures to foster cross-sector and cross-border cooperation for incident  management;   IR sector-specific knowledge for public stakeholders as they face competition with  the private sector;   Additional guidelines and reviews on new tools and equipment to assist IR teams  in selecting appropriate IR tools;  35 For example Connecting Europe Facility  https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility/cef-telecom  https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility/cef-telecom  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  39   More training and drills.   Summary No-one doubts that the support provided by European institutions and  professional associations is beneficial to the whole sectoral IR community in a particularly  tense context fuelled by the COVID-19 pandemic.  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  40  4. RECOMMENDATIONS  This study is intended as a snapshot of the current situation. The data collected indicates that  it is still too soon to formulate sector specific recommendations. As a result, the following  recommendations are general rather than sector specific.  R#1_Capabilites:  Sectoral actors should encourage the sharing of lessons learnt on the use of open-  access or commercial tools, especially those automated within their sector to better  benefit from each other’s experience and accelerate the maturation of newly created  IR entities.  R#2_Regulations:  Sectoral actors should continue to identify overlaps, systematically raise awareness  of challenges in cybersecurity regulations36 and cooperate with policy makers to  address these issues by being involved in their revision processes.  R#3_Collaboration:  Sectoral actors should continue their efforts to make use of existing reporting  schemes such as NISD repostign and build trusted sectoral communities of users37  where they could securely exchange both ex-ante and ex-post incident information  leveraging existing tools and automated solutions.  36 For example information on Electricity network codes and guidelines  https://ec.europa.eu/energy/topics/markets-and- consumers/wholesale-energy-market/electricity-network-codes_en?redir=1  37 For example Empowering Information Sharing Analysis Centres https://www.isacs.eu/  https://ec.europa.eu/energy/topics/markets-and-consumers/wholesale-energy-market/electricity-network-codes_en?redir=1 https://ec.europa.eu/energy/topics/markets-and-consumers/wholesale-energy-market/electricity-network-codes_en?redir=1 https://www.isacs.eu/  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  41  5.

This comprehensive analysis also focused on the distribution of responsibilities to present  draft hypotheses on the emergence of new actors following the publication of the NIS  Directive.  Data structuring and classification criteria  The raw data gathered during the study was consolidated in an Excel table. It was first  organised by Member States.  In addition to Member State classification, it was decided tthat the the scope of the research  would be extended to sectoral IR Capabilities in non-EU countries to provide insight into  approaches of neighbouring countries, namely Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Georgia,  Iceland, Kosovo, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Ukraine, the United  Kingdom, Serbia and Switzerland.  For each country, the following information was initially provided (where available):   Summary of national approach to IR in the NISD sectors   Incident Response general set-up  o NISD Sectors  o Competent authorities;  o Existing/newly created CSIRT or IR entities;  o Role and list of OES;  o Role of DSP.   Cooperation set-up & processes  o Cross-border IR aspects.   Development of capabilities and other initiatives  o Operational preparedness and capacities;  o Tools;  o Initiatives, communities, etc.  Then, the list of existing and newly created CSIRT and IR entities was extracted to build a  separate consolidated table.  For each entity, the following information was provided (where available):   CSIRT/IR entity name   Sector (energy /air transport / cross-sector national CSIRT)   Country  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  45   Type (public/private)   Description & mandate   Status (existing / to be created)   Cooperation set-up & processes  o Cross-border IR aspects.   Development of capabilities and other initiatives  o Operational Preparedness and capacities;  o Tools;  o Initiatives, communities, etc.  OVERVIEW OF THE SECTORAL IR SET-UP IN THE 27 MEMBER  STATES AND A SELECTION OF NON-EU COUNTRIES  Desktop research – key figures  Table 9: Desktop research – Data collection overview  Nature of information collected Data collection  Summary of national approach toward IR in the  NISD sectors  Identified in 14 MS and 8 non-EU countries  Competent authorities for the two targeted  sectors  Identified for the 27 MS and 10 non-EU  countries, partial data for 1 non-EU country  Existing/newly created or planned CSIRT or IR  entities  68 existing/newly created identified  2 planned identified  Role of OES Identified for 24 MS  Role of DSP Identified for 22 MS  Cross-border IR aspects Minimal data in 5 MS and 4 non-EU countries  Operational preparedness and capacities Minimal data for 5 MS and 10 non-EU countries  Tools Minimal data for 2 MS and 1 non-EU country  Initiatives, communities, etc.  Minimal data for 9 MS and for 9 non-EU  countries  SURVEY AND INTERVIEWS – IR APPROACH AND SECTORAL  CAPABILITIES  The objective of the survey and of the complementary interviews was to bridge information  gaps in the desktop research and gain deeper insight into IR set-up in the 27 Member States.  These activities also focused on the recent changes and evolutions of Sectoral IRC. They  were designed to also improve the knowledge on sectoral CSIRTs processes, procedures  and tools following the publication of the NIS Directive.  SURVEY - DATA STRUCTURING AND CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA  The raw data gathered from the survey was consolidated in an Excel table.  The table was structured around the answers of each respondent according to the questions  of the survey (see B Annex Survey – questionnaire (p. 48)).

The global Covid-19 pandemic witnessed in 2020 sent all these technologies  into the limelight like never before and forced millions around the world to work from home and  rely on remote connections to professional networks during the lockdown.  Vital sectors had to ensure continuity of service during this lasting global crisis despite  increased exposure to cyber threats over this long-lasting global crisis. The growing use of  remote IT networks by a large part of the population working remotely opened new digital attack  surfaces to criminals who were quick to exploit such vulnerabilities. Cyberattacks rose sharply  since March 2020, as confirmed by a number of cybersecurity experts and law enforcement  agencies such as Interpol. They specifically noted a rise in malware, phishing and Trojan horse  attacks worldwide1.  Both the Energy and the Air Transport sectors face considerable threats with potentially  disastrous financial and societal consequences, requiring solid Incident Response Capabilities  (IRC).  Both sectors come with large supply chains and a multiplicity of stakeholders (Public authorities,  Regulators, Professional associations, large industries, SMEs, etc.). They have, in recent years,  taken steps to structure and strengthen their ability to face cyber threats and to respond to  cyber incidents. The creation of ISACs2 to foster information-sharing at sectoral level is an  excellent illustration of this evolution.  This study provides a continuation of work on Sectoral IRC at European level following  the publication of the 2019 “EU Member States incident response development status  report”3. The report focuses on trends in Energy and Air Transport Incident Response  (IR) Capabilities, procedures, processes and tools. It also offers insights on current  challenges and gaps facing IR communities.  The analysis aimed to focus on:   Current IRC of Air Transport and Energy sectors,   The recent changes in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic,   The upcoming revision of the NIS Directive,   To draw practical recommendations for the IR community.  1 https://www.interpol.int/en/News-and-Events/News/2020/INTERPOL-report-shows-alarming-rate-of-cyberattacks-during- COVID-19  2 For example Energy ISAC https://www.ee-isac.eu/ and Aviation ISAC https://www.a-isac.com/  3 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-report  Cyberattacks  have risen  sharply since the  beginning of the  COVID-19  pandemic, in  particular in  critical sectors  such as  transport, health  or finance.  https://www.interpol.int/en/News-and-Events/News/2020/INTERPOL-report-shows-alarming-rate-of-cyberattacks-during-COVID-19 https://www.interpol.int/en/News-and-Events/News/2020/INTERPOL-report-shows-alarming-rate-of-cyberattacks-during-COVID-19 https://www.ee-isac.eu/ https://www.a-isac.com/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-report  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  5  KEY FINDINGS  The research highlighted the following eight key findings:  Key Finding #1 A large majority of EU countries tend to have dedicated sectoral specialists  and experts within their National/governmental CSIRTs rather than one  dedicated sectoral entity at national level. Sectoral CSIRTs are not yet the  norm in the EU.  Key Finding #2 The EU countries which decided to create a dedicated sectoral CSIRT for  the Energy or Air Transport sector were driven by organisational and  functional needs rather than technical ones.  Key Finding #3 Energy and air transport sectoral CSIRTs tend to provide their constituency  with sector-specific expertise in addition to the generic services provided  by national CSIRTs.  Key Finding #4 The tools and processes used by sectoral CSIRTs to deliver their services  are similar to those used by national CSIRTs.  Key Finding #5 Although IR stakeholders did not request specific guidance when  developing their capabilities, they tended to use dedicated tools made  available by EU authorities, regulators and national CSIRTs.  Key Finding #6 Sectoral CSIRTs in both air transport and energy sectors are facing similar  challenges, such as legislations overlapping, or the growing time spent on  compliance issues.  Key Finding #7 Sectoral CSIRTs in both the air transport and energy sectors face the  common challenge of formally and rapidly sharing ex-ante information in a  particularly tense context.  Key Finding #8 On-going programmes and information sharing initiatives successfully  supported IRC developments in both sectors. However, a strong demand  remains for more framework, guidance and know-how in relation to the  impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  6  1. OVERVIEW AND  SCOPE OF THE STUDY  1.1 CONTEXT  Since its creation, ENISA has been actively working to assist the European Commission,  European Union Member States (EU MS) and the overall cybersecurity community to  enhance their capabilities and expertise. The Agency engaged in an in-depth research on  Incident Response Capabilities (IRC) to that end. As a result ENISA was able to produce a  state-of-the-art overview of the CSIRT landscape and of its development in Europe. This  study aims to complement this work by continuing to update ENISA’s recommendations for  the CSIRT capability development and to disseminate the latest trends and evolutions in this  domain.  ENISA’s public website features a European CSIRT inventory. The interactive map it  includes gives an overview of the current CSIRT teams active in Europe. A study on the  CSIRT landscape and an overview of the IR capabilities in 2025 Europe are also available.  These features serve the purpose to present a comprehensive picture of existing CSIRTs’  incident handling and response capabilities (IRC), with initial facts and figures about sectoral  CSIRTs.  2020 has been impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic in many ways but in addition to  an unprecedented financial impact, it has resulted in a massive increase in the use of digital  tools and services. As a result, cybersecurity and Incident Response Capabilities in particular  have become more crucial than ever. It is therefore fundamental that ENISA continues to  closely monitor capability development, particularly in light of the upcoming revision of the  NIS Directive.  This revision is a great opportunity to take stock of the recent evolutions of the Incident  Response Landscape across the EU. The revision will be an occasion to build on the lessons  learnt by the IR community across the EU Member States (MS) in addressing the challenges  the  implementation of the NISD has given rise to.  Following the publication of the 2019 “EU Member States incident response development  status report”4, ENISA is eager to take a closer look at the IRC development of sectoral  CSIRTs, more specifically in the energy and air transport sectors.  1.2 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY  This study aims to further ENISA’s understanding and knowledge of IRC development and  draw conclusions about the development of IR capabilities particularly in the energy and air  transport sectors.  It constitutes an extensive analysis of IRC in the energy and air transport sectors and  presents potential gaps, overlaps and challenges in the services offered as well as  in the  procedures, processes and tools used by sectoral IRCs.  4 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-report  Incident  Response  Capabilities have  never been so  crucial for  sectoral  stakeholders  who rely heavily  on digital tools.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-report  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  7  The specific objectives of this study are:   To collect and aggregate comprehensive data on the current IRC in the air transport  and energy sectors;   To analyse and measure the evolution and development in sectoral CSIRTs  services, capabilities, processes, tools and cooperation mechanisms;   To identify potential gaps, overlaps and challenges in national IR procedures,  processes and tools.  To this end, research was divided into three parallel activities, namely:   A desktop research of open sources,   A survey of EU national and sectoral CSIRTs (responses received from 13 Member  States and a European sectoral CSIRTs),   Complementary interviews with sectoral IRC experts and national CSIRTs.  An overview of the methodology and an assessment and presentation of the data collected  can be found in chapters 3 and 4.  1.3 SCOPE OF THE WORK AND DEFINITIONS  This study provides data and analysis on the recent changes and evolutions of IR capabilities  (IRC) within Air Transport and Energy sectors in Member States.  The study focuses on:   Capabilities of sectoral CSIRTs;   Operational preparedness of sectoral CSIRTs or other IR entities;   IR services actually provided to constituency;   IR processes and procedures;   IR tools (used by sectoral CSIRTs or other IR entities) standalone and/or in contrast  with national CSIRT(s);   Awareness of ENISA maturity assessment and/or (Self) assessment framework for  CSIRTs;   Examples and/or lessons learnt of sectoral incidents;   Cooperation mechanisms used nationally and internationally;   Current levels of maturity and requirements for development.  It was therefore important to agree on the definition of the key structuring concepts and  elements of the study.  The scope and key concepts of the research were defined as follows:  Incident response (IR): The protection of an organisation's information by developing and  implementing an IR process (e.g. plans, defined roles, training, communications,  management oversight) in order to quickly discover an attack and effectively contain the  damage, eradicate the attacker's presence, and restore the integrity of the network and  systems.5  5 Strategies for Incident Response and Cyber Crisis Cooperation, ENISA, August 2016.  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  8  Incident response capabilities (IRC): The processes (e.g. plans, defined roles, training,  communications, management oversight), procedures and tools (log analysis, Intrusion  Detection Systems, Vulnerability scanners, Data Capture & Incident Response Forensics  Tools, Patch management systems, etc.) used to identify, respond to and mitigate the impact  of an attack, and to restore continuity of service.6  Incident response models: the survey used a typology of four Incident Response models:   Centralised: the national CSIRT is in charge of handling incidents across the  different sectors; it provides a centralised point for incident reporting and analysis,  decision-making, response coordination, and dissemination of information.   Distributed: the national CSIRT has core responsibilities to handle incidents and  works with a competent authority for each sector (e.g. national ministries or public  agencies); the role of these actors may be to facilitate incident notification and  dissemination of information.   Hybrid: a national CSIRT and the sectoral CSIRTs share the IR responsibilities and  operations, which may depend on the sector(s) impacted or the scale of the incident  for instance.   Decentralised: a sectoral CSIRT is in charge of handling incidents in a given sector  from incident detection to response coordination and decision-making, including  coordinating with other stakeholders.  National/Government (N/g) CSIRTs: Teams that serve a country’s government by helping  to protect its critical information infrastructure. N/g CSIRTs play a key role in coordinating  incident management with the relevant stakeholders at national level. They also bear  responsibility for cooperation with other countries’ national and governmental teams.7  National Sectoral CSIRTs: Entities responding to computer security or cybersecurity  incidents affecting a specific sector at national level. N/ Sectoral CSIRTs are usually  established in NISD sectors such as Healthcare, Energy, and the Transport Sector. Unlike  the N/G CSIRT who serves the public sector, the national Sectoral CSIRTs provides services  to constituents from a single sector in one country (in the context of this study, the national  Sectoral CSIRTs and sectors mentioned are mainly Air Transport and Energy sectors).  Sectoral CSIRT of international organisation: Entities or teams within an international  organisation or company responding to computer security or cybersecurity incidents affecting  the organisation and providing services to constituents from a single sector at regional (EU)  or international level.  OES CSIRT/IRTs: Entities or teams responding to computer security or cybersecurity  incidents affecting an Operator of Essential Services within a sector.  Operators of Essential Services (OES): Operators of essential services are private or  public sector entities who play an important role in providing healthcare, transport, energy,  banking and financial market infrastructure, digital infrastructure and water supply. According  to the NIS Directive, Member States should be responsible for determining which entities  meet the criteria of the definition of operator of essential services8.  6 Ibid.  7 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-capabilities/baseline-capabilities  8 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-capabilities/baseline-capabilities https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  9  Digital Service Provider (DSP): A digital service provider is an entity providing one or more  of the three types of digital service, such as:   Cloud computing services: digital services enabling access to a scalable and  elastic pool of shareable computing resources.   Online marketplaces: digital services allowing consumers to conclude online sales  or service contracts with traders online using computing services provided by the  online marketplace.   Online search engines: means a digital service that allows users to perform  searches of, in principle, all websites or websites in a particular language on the  basis of a query on any subject in the form of a keyword, phrase or other input, and  returns links in which information related to the requested content can be found.  NIS Directive: The Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NISD) was  adopted by the European Parliament on 6 July 2016 and entered into force in August 2016.  The NISD provides legal measures to boost the overall level of cybersecurity in the EU.9  NISD sectors: Critical sectors for the European Union’s society and economy are heavily  dependent on ICT. Member States have been requested to identify operators of essential  services (OES) for the seven sectors listed in the NIS Directive (NISD sectors). These seven  sectors – and related subsectors – listed in the Directive10 are:   Energy (electricity, oil, gas);   Transport (air, rail, water, road);   Banking;   Financial market infrastructures;   Health sector;   Drinking water supply and distribution;   Digital Infrastructures.  9 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/network-and-information-security-nis-directive  10 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/network-and-information-security-nis-directive https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  10  Figure 1: NISD sectors  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  11  2. METHODOLOGY AND  DATA COLLECTION  2.1 OVERVIEW OF THE METHODOLOGY  The methodology to identify, collect and analyse data on Incident Response set-up and  capabilities within the air transport and energy sector is illustrated below. The series of steps  the methodology consists of is presented in this chapter.  2.2 A SEVEN-STEP APPROACH  2.2.1 Step 1 – Definition of the research focus for the data collection  The research focus of the study was defined in close cooperation with the ENISA team. To  that purpose an analysis grid setting criteria and theme was created to classify the  information collected on energy and air transport Sectoral IRC  The list of criteria was defined pertaining to the specific data sought in the context of this  study (e.g. cooperation aspects, recently created entities, etc.).  2.2.2 Step 2 – Desktop research in open source on air transport and  energy Sectors IRC  This step consisted in conducting a literature review and open source research in order to  collect data on sectoral IRC and recent trends in the field of air transport and energy IRC.  This research was performed within the 27 Member States and a selection of 13  neighbouring countries11.  During a preliminary data collection phase, a first team of analysts gathered the relevant data  in the data classification grid. A second team of analysts validated and further enriched the  preliminary data. An overview of the collected data is detailed in chapter 5.1.  2.2.3 Step 3 – Designing and validating the survey  Publicly available information on air transport and energy Sectoral IRC procedures and tools  was, as anticipated, not detailed enough to provide insightful input (see chapter 5.1).  11 Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Georgia, Iceland, Kosovo, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Ukraine, the  United Kingdom, Serbia and Switzerland.  Figure 2: Overview of the methodology  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  12  Therefore, a survey to collect comprehensive data from relevant parties had been planned  early on.  Once the objective of the survey was defined, two categories of organisations were identified  to participate in the survey:   27 Member States’ national CSIRTs;   Additional public, private (IRC of Operator of essential services (OES)) and  European sectoral CSIRTs from the 27 MS.  Further information on data collected can be found in A Annex – Presentation of the raw data  (p. 44).  Together with ENISA, the project team then drafted the survey to be sent to both audiences  considering aspects such as data protection, privacy and legal aspects, language, size and  format, and structure.  The final version of the survey validated by ENISA is available in B Annex: Survey –  questionnaire (p. 48)  2.2.4 Step 4 – Conducting the survey and complementary interviews  The survey was sent by ENISA to the 27 national CSIRTs and additional sectoral CSIRTs  through the CSIRTs Network12. To maximise participation the survey included a presentation  of the study and its context.  Targeted e-mails were sent to relevant contacts and followed up on, to ensure a high  response rate from Member States and sectors.  Following the survey, additional interviews took place to complement and further enrich the  data collected with the survey and desktop research with both:   Sectoral Cybersecurity experts;   Members of the Informal Expert Group on Incident response Capabilities;  A list of entities was drafted for each group with an interview rationale validated by ENISA.  Once agreed, participants were able to fill-in the survey, using the EU survey tool, or  scheduling a phone interview to provide their answers.  An overview of the raw data collected through the survey is detailed in A Annex –  Presentation of the raw data (p. 44).  2.2.5 Step 5 – Collation of raw data  The raw data collected from the desktop research, the survey and the interviews, was  aggregated in structured tables in a collaborative tool.  The collaborative tool allowed the aggregation of all raw data, the generation of statistics and  the identification of key input.  2.2.6 Step 6 – Analysis and identification of trends  The methodology used in this step was a qualitative use of the Delphi Method. This method  ensures that the data collection team and the data analysis team benefit from and build on  12 https://csirtsnetwork.eu/  https://csirtsnetwork.eu/  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  13  each other’s expertise, and that the final analysis addresses all aspects of the request  presented in a concise, coherent and comprehensive way.  The data collection team and the data analysis team performed a first analysis of the raw  data to develop a draft set of key findings. With analysis methods applied, the teams drafted  a first version of the key findings of the study and submitted it to ENISA for validation and  further discussion.  At a later stage, a virtual workshop held via videoconference was organised with members of  the ENISA Informal Expert Group on Sectoral Incident Response Capabilities13.  After the virtual workshop and once all final comments were received, a preliminary version  of the final report was drafted and submitted to ENISA for validation and further discussion.  2.2.7 Step 7 – Final report  This final step consisted in further developing findings and in drafting the final report of the  study in collaboration with the member of the IEG.  Close interactions and exchanges with ENISA ensured that the final recommendations of the  study were in line with the Agency’s needs and expectations.  2.3 OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF THE DATA & INFORMATION  AVAILABILITY  The identification of reliable and qualitative data was crucial throughout the study. For each  of the three activities conducted during the study, namely the desktop research phase, the  survey and the complementary interviews, an overall assessment the data and information  availability was conducted, and several assumptions were made. A detailed overview of the  raw data is presented in A Annex – Presentation of the raw data (p. 44).  For both the desktop research and survey data collection phases, research identified all  CSIRTs relevant to the energy and transport sectors about which information was publicly  available, regardless of size or maturity. As described in the key findings, whether these two  sectors are covered by sectoral or by national CSIRTs varies from country to country. The  information is summarised p. 16.  2.3.1 Desktop research – Data collection assessment  During the open-source desktop research phase, information on IR layout and set-up was  collected for 19 out of 27 Member States and a few elements were collected for the  remaining 8 MS.   The clarity and level of information available on national IR approach in NISD  sectors was very different from one Member States to another;   Information on procedures, processes and tools used by Sectoral IR teams were  rarely, if ever, detailed in publicly available documents;   Publicly available information about cooperation models or cross-border procedures  was not detailed;   Qualitative information on information exchange communities and fora were rarely,  if ever, detailed in publicly available documents.  13 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirt-cert-services/reactive-services/informal-expert-group-on-eu-ms-incident- response-development/  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirt-cert-services/reactive-services/informal-expert-group-on-eu-ms-incident-response-development/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirt-cert-services/reactive-services/informal-expert-group-on-eu-ms-incident-response-development/  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  14  2.3.2 Survey – data collection assessment  The survey collected answers from 20 respondents from 13 Member States and 1 regional  air transport organisation:   10 National CSIRTs;   4 Regulatory organisation, body or Ministry;   2 Sectoral CSIRT (1 national and 1 European);   4 Energy and Air Transport OES IRT.  Further information is presented in A Annex – Presentation of the raw data (p. 44). Specific  information about the breakdown of respondents by type and sector can be found p.46.  2.3.3 Interviews – data collection assessment  And additional two interviews were conducted with sectoral experts in each of the two  targeted sectors (Air Transport and Energy) along with extra interviews conducted with  members of the Informal Expert Group on Incident Response Capabilities.  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  15  3. KEY FINDINGS  3.1 KEY FINDING #1- IRC SET-UP AND LANDSCAPE  A large majority of EU countries tend to have dedicated sectoral specialists and experts  within their National/governmental CSIRTs rather than a dedicated sectoral entity at  national level. Sectoral CSIRTs are not yet the norm in the EU.  Our research, which covered the 27 EU Member States, identified National sectoral CSIRT  capabilities in 19 Member States14:   65% (12 out 19 MS) have no Sectoral CSIRTs, 9 haven’t planned to create one in the near  future, but 3 are discussing the possibility of creating one some at national level in the  future, should the need arise;   1 MS is currently setting up both an Energy and Air Transport CSIRT at national level;   4 MS have no Energy or Air transport CSIRT at national level yet but do have other  Sectoral CSIRTs (Finance, Health or Water, etc.);   1 MS has an Energy Sectoral CSIRT at national level and 1 MS has an Air Transport  Sectoral CSIRT at national level;  To this date, the general approach towards IR set-up in both the Energy and Air Transport  sectors in the EU is to have the National CSIRT acting as the competent authority for IR and  OES in charge of conducting incident response at operational level, with a dedicated unit or  sectoral expert to that purpose.  Table 1: Overview of all MS’ basic IR set-up in sectors (with available data collected)  Countries Summary of national approach toward IR in the Energy & Air Transport sectors  Austria  The Federal Chancellery is the Strategic NIS authority and CERT.at, the national CSIRT, is the  primary contact point for IT-security in a national context. CERT.at coordinates other CSIRTs  operating in the area of critical or communication infrastructure provides basic IT-security  information to SMEs. In case of significant online attacks against Austrian infrastructures,  CERT.at will coordinate the response by the targeted operators and local security teams.  The Austrian Energy CERT (AEC) is the single contact point for incidents in the Energy sector.  There is no dedicated entity for the Air Transport sector.  Belgium  The Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium (CCB) acts as the national coordination authority, and acts  as national CSIRT in the CSIRTs Network. In support of the national CSIRT, each sectoral  authority may choose to develop a sectoral CSIRT, subject to compliance with the obligations set  out in Annex I of the transposition of the NIS Directive. The CCB acts as coordinator for all  sectoral CSIRT at national level. Belgium is currently discussing the creation of a sectoral CSIRT  for Oil.  Bulgaria  CERT Bulgaria (English), is the National Computer Security Incident Response Team. Its  mission is to provide information and assistance to its constituencies in implementing proactive  measures to reduce the risks of computer security incidents as well as responding to such  incidents when they occur. Bulgaria is currently creating sectoral CSIRTs to facilitate the  implementation of the requirements of the NIS Directive.  14 Our desktop research delivered a general overview of Incident Response Set-up in the 27 Member States. In 8 Member  States (Croatia, Denmark, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Malta, Slovenia), no formal confirmation of the existence of  sectoral CSIRTs at national level could be found at the time of the production of the present report.  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  16  Countries Summary of national approach toward IR in the Energy & Air Transport sectors  Croatia  National CSIRT (CERT.hr) is a department within the Croatian Academic and Research  Network – CARNET established in accordance with the Information Security Act of the Republic  of Croatia.  According to this Act, CERT.hr is a national body for the prevention of cyber threats and the  protection of the security of public information systems in the Republic of Croatia. The  department’s main task is to handlecomputer security incidents to preserve the security of  information systems in Croatia. Furthermore, according to the Act on cybersecurity of operators  of essential services and digital service providers CERT.hr workswith the Information Systems  Security Bureau (ISSB) of the Republic of Croatia on the coordination of prevention and  response to computer threats to information systems security.  The Information Systems Security Bureau (ISSB) is the central state authority responsible for  technical areas of information security of the Republic of Croatia state bodies, which includes  standards of information security, security accreditation of information security, managing crypto  material used in the exchange of classified information, and coordination of prevention and  response to computer threats to information system security. ISSB, is a CSIRT for most of NIS  sectors, including energy and transport.  Cyprus  The Office of the Commissioner of Electronic Communications and Postal Regulation (OCECPR)  is an independent regulatory authority of the Republic of Cyprus in matters of electronic  communications and postal services, with additional responsibilities in the areas of terminal  equipment, network and information security and protection of critical information infrastructures.  It was selected as the body responsible for coordinating the implementation of the National  Cybersecurity Strategy of the Republic of Cyprus, in relation tothe pillars of network and  information security (cybersecurity), cybercrime, cyber defence and related external affairs.  OCECPR is responsible for the creation and coordination of a body or bodies for response to  incidents related to Network and Information Security in Cyprus. It also supervises and regulates  the activity of the above CSIRT entities. CSIRT-CY handles reported cyber incidents, proactively  identifying potential threats and coordinating with relevant government agencies nationally,  regionally and globally to reduce the impact of the cyberattacks.  Czech  Republic  The Czech Republic has two response teams: 1) a Government Computer Emergency  Response Team (GovCERT.CZ) and 2) a national Computer Security Incident Response Team  (CSIRT.CZ).  The Government CSIRT (GovCERT.CZ), https://www.govcert.cz/ (Czech);  https://www.govcert.cz/en/ (English), is based in Brno. Its main task is to collect reports of cyber  incidents from specified entities, analyse them and provide assistance.  Denmark  The principle of sectoral responsibility is the rule. It implies that the authority responsible for a  given function on a day-to-day basis is also the responsible authority when a serious incident  occurs. This responsibility also includes planning how to maintain and continue to supply  functions in the event of an extraordinary incident. Consequently, responsibility for cyber and  information security, and thus the task of protecting critical infrastructure, is divided between the  authorities responsible for the critical sectors, i.e. the transport sector, the healthcare sector and  the financial sector.  The 2018-2023 Defence Agreement significantly enhances the ability of the Danish Centre for  Cyber Security (CFCS) to assist central government authorities responsible for the various  sectors.  Estonia  Estonia has opted fora centralised coordination and supervision of the sectoral IT security within  the framework of the NIS directive's implementation. The activities falling within the scope of the  NIS directive go to different units within the RIA. In addition to the operation centre, which also  houses the CERT-EE, there is a standardisation and review unit whose task is to ensure  compliance with the CSA (Cyber Security Act) and, in the long run, the NIS Directive. RIA CERT- EE plays the role of government CSIRT, which gives the authority good knowledge of the  systems.  Finland  The National Cyber Security Centre Finland (Kyberturvallisuuskeskus, also referred to as NCSC- FI; previously CERT-FI) is responsible for the supervision of all Finnish CSIRTs. Its mandate  includes incident response, preparedness, training, regulation and control. Sector-specific  authorities have competence for supervision, namely the Energy Authority, the Centre for  Economic Development, Transport and the Environment and the Finnish Transport and  Communications Agency.  France  CERT-FR is the Computer Emergency Response Team of the French national cyber security  authority. Its mission is to coordinate and investigate IT security incident response for the French  government, critical national infrastructure operators and operators of essential services as  defined by the French law. The primary constituency is composed of French territories and  covers all ministries, administrations and state services; critical national infrastructure operators  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  17  Countries Summary of national approach toward IR in the Energy & Air Transport sectors  and operators of essential services as defined by the French law and other key players in  sensitive sectors.  CERT-FR was created in 1999 as a governmental CSIRT and afterwards became the National  CSIRT. There are CSIRTs specific to companies, such as EDF in the energy sector, but the  creation of sectoral CSIRTs is currently under discussion, although not in the air transport sector.  Germany  The Federal Office for Information Security, BSI, has gained expanded powers with the entry into  force of the NISD, in addition to being the supervisory authority for all sectors, CSIRT and  national contact points. BSI was previously primarily responsible for the security of critical  infrastructures, but with the adoption of the NIS directive, the mandate has been extended to  include network and information security.  Greece  GR-CSIRT was established in 2018. It is a National CSIRT. The GR - CSIRT is in charge of  handling incidents (cyber attacks) affecting Operators of Essential Services (OES), is responsible  for incident detection, incident response coordination and decision-making, including  coordination with other national stakeholders..  Hungary  The core operational cyber security capabilities and cyber incident management are centralised  in the governmental computer emergency response team in Hungary, GovCERT-Hungary, which  is part of the National Cyber Defence Institute and supervised by the Ministry of Interior.  GovCERT-Hungary provides services for the entire Hungarian governmental administration –  especially for the government backbone system, for critical infrastructures and municipalities.  Sectoral CSIRTs are being established: beyond the existing CIIP CERT (operating under the  National Directorate General for Disaster Management), another two are being set up, one for  defence within the Military National Security Service, and another one for civilian intelligence  within the Information Office.  Ireland  CSIRT-IE is the body within the NCSC providing assistance to constituents in responding to  cybersecurity incidents at national level for Ireland. The team has a strictly defined constituency  consisting mainly of Government bodies and Critical National Infrastructure providers.  CSIRT-IE provides incident response services to Government bodies and Critical National  Infrastructure providers across Ireland. CSIRT-IE also acts as a national point of contact for  international partners who wish to inform Irish-based entities of cybersecurity matters, which may  affect them.  The Irish Reporting & Information Security Service (IRISS) is an independent not for profit CSIRT  dedicated to the broader public rather than companies or government and entities.  Italy  Computer Security Incident Response Team - Italia sits within the Department of Security  Information (DIS). Its missions consist in:  - monitoring incidents at national level;  - warning interested parties of potential/ongoing attacks;  - intervening in case of incidents;  - performing dynamic analysis of risks and incidents;  And includes situational awareness; participation to CSIRT networks.  Computer Security Incident Response Team - Italia cooperates with the private sector and  promotes the use of common practices and standards in risk management and incident- response, as well as classification of incidents, risks and information.  Latvia  The Latvian Computer Emergency Response Team - CERT.LV (Latvian: https://cert.lv/lv;  English: cert.lv/en) is responsible for monitoring and analysing developments in cyberspace,  reacting to incidents and coordinating incident prevention. It also carries out research, organises  educational events and training, and supervises the implementation of obligations defined in the  Law on Security Information.  CERT.LV is expected to develop resources with the public and private sectors for collecting  intelligence on incidents for analysis and evaluation.  Lithuania  The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) at the Ministry of National Defence is the main  Lithuanian cyber security institution responsible for unified management of cyber incidents,  monitoring and control of the implementation of cybersecurity requirements, accreditation of  information resources. It was established after the entry into force of the Law on Cybersecurity in  January 2015.  The NCSC’s mission is to be the centre of cyber security expertise for effective cyber security  incidents and a strong cyber security prevention system in the country.  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  18  Countries Summary of national approach toward IR in the Energy & Air Transport sectors  Luxembourg  The Institut Luxembourgeois de Régulation (ILR) ensures regulation and supervises the following  economic sectors: network and communication, electricity, natural gas, postal services,  transport (rail and air), radio frequencies. CIRCL is the CSIRT for the private sector,  municipalities and non-governmental entities in Luxembourg.  Luxembourg’s government CSIRT (govcert.lu) covers incidents targeting government and public  or private OES.  Malta  CSIRTMalta is responsible for coordinating incident response measures for entities engaged with  Maltese critical infrastructure.  The Information Security & Governance Department’s Security Engineering Team covers  government IT security.  Netherlands  (The)  The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC.NL) (Dutch, English) was established in 2012 and  incorporates the Dutch Computer Emergency Response Team for the Dutch central government.  NCSC.NL is responsible for the coordination of incident response measures for Dutch  government institutions, as well as entities engaged with critical infrastructure.  The NCSC covers multiple functions, such as managing the reporting of cybersecurity incidents  with a multi-channel reporting structure to log said incidents. The Centre is also responsible for  maintaining a national detection response network for the governmental sector and entities  engaged in the event of a cybersecurity incident. The centre also actively participates in the work  of the Information Sharing and Analysis Centres (ISACs) for sectors involved with critical  infrastructure.  Poland  In Poland, entities involved in handling and responding to computer incidents at national level are  the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT GOV), the Ministry of Defence  Computer Emergency Response System (CSIRT MON) and the National Cybersecurity Centre  (NC Cyber or CSIRT NASK). Their mission is to counter cross-sectoral and cross-border  cyberthreats, to coordinate the handling of major, substantial and critical incidents, and to  provide information about incidents, both within the network of government organisations related  to cybersecurity and to the general public.  Portugal  The National Cybersecurity Centre (Centro Nacional de Cibersegurança) is the Portuguese  cybersecurity national authority. It has regulatory, supervisory, enforcement and sanctioning  functions and the power to issue cybersecurity instructions. It defines the national level of  cybersecurity alert. In addition, a National Computer Security Incident Response Team  (CERT.PT) operates within the National Cybersecurity Centre and its main competence is  to: (i)  Implement operational coordination in response to incidents, in particular in liaison with existing  sectoral IT security incident response teams.  Romania  CERT-RO is the competent national authority for the implementation of the NIS Directive. CER- RO’s missions are to prevent, analyse, identify and respond to cybersecurity incidents related to  Romanian cyberspace. CERT-RO acts as National contact point for cybersecurity incidents with  similar structures within or outside Romania. CERT-AV-RO, which runs within Romania Civil  Aviation Authority (RO-CAA, acts as the Romanian civil aviation sectoral CSIRT and there are  plans for setting up other sectoral CSIRTs in the near future.  Slovakia  Created in 2016, the National Cyber Security Authority SK-CERT provides national and strategic  activities in the field of cyber security management, threat analysis as well as coordination of  national security incident resolution. The National Cyber Security Centre also supports  governance, development, management and support of cybersecurity competence centres,  including training, educational activities, and research.  Slovenia  The Slovenian Information Security Administration (Uprava RS za informacijsko varnost - ZlnfV)  acts as a National CSIRT, the national response centre primarily responsible for examining  security incidents. The ZInfV also provides for the establishment of state administration  authorities’ CSIRT. The Slovenian Information Security Administration operates under the  authority of the Ministry of Government Administration. The Slovenian Information Security  Administration began operating on 1 January 2020.  Spain  The CCN-CERT is responsible for the management of cyber-incidents affecting public or private  sector organisations. In the case of critical public sector operators, the management of cyber- incidents is carried out by the CCN-CERT in coordination with the Centro Nacional de Protección  de Infraestructuras y Ciberseguridad (CNPIC).  Sweden  CERT-SE is the National CSIRT of Sweden. Its constituency consists of Swedish society,  including but not limited to, governmental authorities, regional authorities, municipalities, and  companies. In addition, CERT-SE is also Sweden’s governmental CSIRT.  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  19  As illustrated in the table above, the sectoral Incident Response layout and set-up at  European level in both the Air Transport and Energy sector is still recent and evolving. The  ecosystem is organised around the following elements:  At national level, Incident response set-up is structured around:   Generic IR services provided by the national/governmental CSIRT in each EU  Member State for all sectors, including Energy and Air Transport. This is  particularly relevant in countries with a centralised IR model;  These national/governmental CSIRTs either have specific experts and specialists  within their organisation for these two sectors or a dedicated unit. In these Member  States, Energy and Air Transport OES are also developing their own internal  CSIRTs or are externalising this activity to certified Digital Service Providers  (DSPs);   For two Member States, dedicated Sectoral CSIRTs coordinate incident  response at national level, supervised by the national CSIRT.  At European level, the landscape also includes international organisations’ sectoral CSIRTs  intended to develop requirements and regulations and to provide a forum for sector  stakeholders.  Both sectoral IRC/OES IRT at national level and Sectoral CSIRT of international  organisations tend to be recent (less than 5 years old) and are still in the development phase  of their capabilities.   Summary: All Member States recognise the need for specific IR expertise for NISD  sectors at national level to support OES and sectoral actors. This specific IR expertise can  either be mutualised within the National CSIRT or organised as a separate and dedicated  sectoral entity. This expertise is essential as IR capabilities must be aligned with the risk  management process specific to each sector.  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  20  3.2 KEY FINDING #2 – CREATION OF SECTORAL CSIRTS  The EU countries which decided to create a dedicated sectoral CSIRT for the Energy  or Air Transport sector were driven by organisational and functional needs rather than  technical ones.  A closer look reveals that for those two Member States who decided to create a dedicated  sectoral CSIRT for Energy or Air Transport at national level, the main drivers were  organisational and functional needs rather than technical ones.  Both the Energy Sectoral CSIRT and the Air Transport Sectoral CSIRT created at national  level responded to a need and a specific demand from sector stakeholders to organise  Incident Response nationally.  “[there is a] need for facilitating oversight and compliance” (Air Transport Sectoral CSIRT)  Table 2: Case Study – Creation of the Austrian Energy CERT  Case study  Austrian Energy CERT (AEC)  Background and context of creation  The Austrian energy sector regulator (E-Control Austria), the sector association (Oesterreichs Energie)  and the most important energy companies in the electricity, oil and gas subsectors worked together on  an analysis and evaluation of security of supply in 2015. This work intended to identify the risks arising  from the use of ICT infrastructure and to examine them in detail. This resulted in a successful joint  initiative in the form of a public-private partnership (PPP).  This partnership further enhanced mutual understanding and trust. It also increased awareness and  acceptance of preventative measures to boost resilience.  One of these measures was the creation and operation of a computer emergency response team  (CERT) for the Austrian electricity and gas sectors.

KraftCERT  (Norwegian energy sector CSIRT) is the result of a joint initiative from NorCERT and the  Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE). The Sectoral CSIRT aims to  support the entire power industry at national level in the prevention and handling of security  incidents15.  As illustrated below, the creation of sector-specific IR Capacities was not the result of  the lack  of sector-specific knowledge of the National CSIRT, nor the inability to manage cybersecurity  incidents in the sectors at national level.  15 https://smart-lighting.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/SectorialimplementationoftheNISDirectiveintheEnergysectorpdf.pdf  https://www.energy-cert.at/en/about-us/ http://www.aec.arge.or.at/index.php/en/about-us.html https://www.geode-eu.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/3-4-Selhofer-Armin.pdf https://smart-lighting.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/SectorialimplementationoftheNISDirectiveintheEnergysectorpdf.pdf  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  21  Figure 3: Drivers to create sector-specific IR Capacities  NB: Five respondents decided not to answer this question as they do not have a national  sectoral CSIRT and for the moment do not intend to create one in the near future.  According to 50% of respondents, the need to facilitate the implementation of the NIS Directive  is one of the most important drivers behind the creation of such sector specific IR capacities. It  shows that European legislation has an important and positive impact in pushing actors to  develop sectoral capacities16.  The need to be prepared and to facilitate the implementation of the requirements of the NIS  Directive is shared by those two Member States currently preparing or discussing the creation of  sectoral CSIRTs and by sectoral private operators who decided to create an internal IR  capacity.  Both Denmark and Belgium are currently discussing the creation of an energy CSIRT at national  level. According to Denmark’s sectoral strategy17, « it is considered that such a sector CERT  with sector-specific competences is relevant to the energy sector to act on the cyber threats ».  Danish authorities will explore how a sectoral CSIRT could be established and whether there is  a basis for establishing a common CSIRT with specialist competence in cybersecurity in the  energy sector. Depending on its structure, a sectoral CSIRT will be able to contribute specific  knowledge and experience-based competencies such as advising and training. In Belgium, the  creation of an oil-sector CSIRT is currently under discussion18.  16 https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=62799  17 https://fmn.dk/eng/news/Pages/New-sectoral-strategie-stop-repare-society-for-cyberattacks.aspx  18 https://www.energy-community.org/dam/jcr:23cf8d77-32dd-4152-b040-51e3a17bd19c/FPS Economy, Cybersecurity  in the oil sector.pdf  https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=62799 https://fmn.dk/eng/news/Pages/New-sectoral-strategie-stop-repare-society-for-cyberattacks.aspx  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  22  Table 3: Case Study - Bulgarian Cybersecurity Strategy  Case study  Bulgaria  Background and context of the will to create Sectoral CSIRTs  In October 2018, the Bulgarian Parliament approved a new Cybersecurity Act, which is the transposition  of the NIS Directive into national law.  The Cyber Security Act determines the overall organisation, management and control of cybersecurity at  national level and establishes new authorities and their responsibilities.  According to the Act, the “Electronic Governance” State Agency (or the “E-Governance Agency”) is the  national competent authority and is thus empowered to establish a national Computer Security Incident  Response Team (CSIRT). Currently, a Bulgarian CSIRT Centre exists (https://govcert.bg), which assists  in reducing the risks of information security incidents and resolving such incidents if they have already  occurred. The Act states that Computer Security Incident Response Teams are to be established  within competent local authorities in various sectors (i.e. energy, transport, banking, financial  market infrastructures, health, and digital) and will coordinate their activities with the national CSIRT.  Sources  https://www.cms-lawnow.com/ealerts/2018/11/bulgaria-adopts-new-cyber-security-act  http://www.aec.arge.or.at/index.php/en/about-us.html  The response of a private electricity provider from a large member state, which decided to  create its own CSIRT in January 2019 is an illustration of this trend.  “There was a growing awareness of the need to create an internal capacity to handle incident  response in the organisation. The Chief Information Officer was aware of the lack of  preparedness and had the will to invest to be prepared for the upcoming changes (GDPR,  NIS Directive implementation, upcoming status of OES). We wanted to anticipate the future  taking into account the growing number of attacks targeting other actors.”  Another point to reflect on is that both Energy and Air Transport Sector deal with cross-  border aspects. There is, therefore, a need for cross-border communication between entities,  which could be facilitated by the creation of sectoral CSIRTs.   Summary: The creation of sectoral entities tends to facilitate the functioning of IR at  national level, the implementation of cybersecurity regulations and cross-border cooperation  for sectoral actors.  http://www.aec.arge.or.at/index.php/en/about-us.html  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  23  3.3 KEY FINDING #3 – SECTORAL CSIRTS SERVICES  National energy and air transport sectoral CSIRTs tend to provide their constituency  with very sector-specific expertise in addition to the generic services provided by  national CSIRTs.  As illustrated in chapter 3.1, a majority of EU countries tends to either rely on the generic  services of their national CSIRT or to support the development of Incident Response  capabilities of operators of essential services in the energy and air transport sectors. The  focus of the study was therefore to analyse the differences between specific services  provided by National Sectoral CSIRTs as opposed to those provided by National CSIRTs.  According to survey responses, and as confirmed by additional desktop research, Sectoral  CSIRTs at national level tend to provide very sector-specific expertise and maintain closer  relationships with their constituents.  Additional services provided by Sectoral CSIRTs at national level differing from those of  National CSIRTs include:   Specific information and in-depth knowledge in their sector;   Sector-specific network of contacts;   Closer relationships with vendors of the sector;   Expertise on sector-specific hardware and systems;   Sector-specific conferences, workshops, and training;   The creation of uniform frameworks for audit documentation at sectoral level;   Faster sectoral communication channel, as their constituency base is smaller than the one  of a National CSIRT;   Sector-specific recommendations.  “It [the Sectoral CSIRT] could provide more in-depth knowledge of the sector’s specificities &  challenges” (National CSIRT)  In addition to those services, Sectoral CSIRTs would be an important player to organise  sectoral exercises as they have good communication channels and closer relationships with  the main sectoral stakeholders at national level.  In Romania, the creation of a dedicated sectoral CSIRT for Air Transport at national level  was driven by the following key needs:   The need for a real-time and integrated response capability;   The need for a continuous and up-to-date situational awareness;   The need to facilitate oversight and compliance;  CERT-AV-RO was created as a consequence within the Romanian Civil Aviation Authority to  facilitate the monitoring, detection and coordination of the response to correlated incidents,  as well as cooperation and hierarchical reporting. The services provided by CERT-AV-RO  compared with those of the National CSIRT are presented below.  “A Sectoral  CSIRT at national  level could  provide a more  in-depth  knowledge of the  sector’s  specificities &  challenges.”  (National CSIRT)  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  24  Table 4: Case Study - CERT-AV-RO - Specific mandate and services compared with those  the National CSIRT  Case study  Romania  National CSIRT’s mandate (CERT-RO)  Sectoral Aviation CSIRT’s mandate (CERT-AV- RO)  CERT-RO is the competent national authority for  the implementation of NIS Directive. Its mandate  includes:  –  the prevention, analysis, identification and  response to cyber security incidents related to  Romanian cyberspace.  –  a national contact point for cybersecurity  incidents for similar structures within or outside  Romania.  –  the development of national IT security policies  and strategies along with other Romanian public  authorities and the proposition of regulations  regarding the national cybersecurity strategy.  –  the official advisor of the national public  authorities for the cyber-protection of critical  infrastructure.  CERT-AV-RO is responsible for integrated incident  management for the entire civil aviation sector.  Each civil aviation entity has full responsibility for  the management of cybersecurity incidents in their  organisations. CERT-AV-RO and RO CAA’s  responsibility is limited to integrated and correlated  monitoring and detection of cybersecurity events  and incidents, as well as to the coordination of  incident response when an incident impacts more  than one organisation.

According to survey responses, both National and Sectoral CSIRTs’ main services and  functions relate to Information Security Incident Management and Vulnerability Management,  among others.  Sectoral CSIRTs tend to be recent and therefore dedicate their resources to these two  services and focus less on knowledge transfer activities.   Summary: Sectoral CSIRTs play an important role in facilitating operational collaboration  and information sharing at Sectoral level.  19 https://www.first.org/standards/frameworks/csirts/csirt_services_framework_v2.1  FIRST CSIRT  SERVICES  FRAMEWORK  The FIRST CSIRT  Services Framework  seeks to assist  CSIRT teams by  identifying and  defining core  categories of services  and their sub-  components.  https://www.first.org/standards/frameworks/csirts/csirt_services_framework_v2.1  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  26  3.4 KEY FINDING #4 – SECTORAL IR PROCESSES AND TOOLS  The tools and processes used by sectoral CSIRTs to deliver their services are similar  to of national CSIRTs.  The main IR tools in service in both National and Sectoral CSIRTs are a combination of  open-source, commercial and internally developed tools which are mostly in service in  mature CSIRTs.  Recently created entities, in particular recently created OES CSIRTs, are  still testing open-source or commercial tools.

Those teams are still testing or selecting tools and therefore are still  preparing associated procedures and SOPs.  Despite varying maturity levels, most CSIRTs tend to have very organised procedures in place  to handle incidents.  According to ENISA CSIRT Maturity assessment20 Model, CSIRTs can self-assess their team’s  maturity based on a list of 44 parameters over 4 categories: O (Organisational), H (Human), T  (Tools) and P (Processes).  Each main category includes a diverse range of parameters such  as those defined for Organisational parameters, which analyse the mandate, constituency,  authority, responsibility, or services of the CSIRT.  The ENISA CSIRT Assessment model defines a list of key parameters to analyse a CSIRT Tool  maturity including the following:   An IT Resource List;   An Information Sources List;   A Consolidated E-mail System;   An Incident Tracking System;   A resilient Phone, email and Internet Access;   An Incident Prevention, Detection and Resolution Toolset.  20 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-capabilities/csirt-maturity/csirt-maturity-self-assessment-survey  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-capabilities/csirt-maturity/csirt-maturity-self-assessment-survey  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  28  The evaluation of the presence, existence of guidelines/procedures and effective use of the  elements listed above are an excellent method to assess the maturity of CSIRT tools. There are  several methods available for maturity assessment in addition to the one proposed by ENISA.  The analysis of the CSIRTs through the survey (National CSIRTs in charge of IR in energy and  Air Transport Sectors; Sectoral CSIRTs at national level, OES IRTs), gave the following results:   70% of respondents have formal SOPs that OES teams should follow in case of an  incident. Among the remaining 30%, some are in the process of developing such  guidelines and two participants did not provide an answer to this question.   82% of respondents use a formal incident notification template and those who do not  have an SOP yet are in the process of establishing one.  Figure 4: Specific information exchange tools for notification of incidents   100% of respondents have specific information exchange tools (commercial or  dedicated) to enable the notification of incidents. Among these tools, the most  commonly used is secure e-mail.  France is an interesting case study in terms of good practices. The Member State has various  procedures in place at national level according to the nature of the actor targeted by a  cyberattack.

According to the survey, a majority of CSIRTs, whether national CSIRTs, national sectoral  CSIRTs or OES CSIRTs, did not seek any specific support or guidance from external  stakeholders to design and implement sectoral IR capacities.  Figure 5: Specific information exchange tools used for notification  Even if they don’t directly ask for support, they all tend to leverage the guidelines, tools and  know-how made available by EU authorities, regulators or other national CSIRTs.  As an example, 60% of respondents use specific CSIRT maturity assessment methodologies  to support the development of IR Capabilities in their sector. 70% out of these use both the  ENISA CSIRT Maturity assessment22 and SIM323. Both methodologies are seen as valuable  tools to enhance the maturation of CSIRTs.  22 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-capabilities/csirt-maturity/csirt-maturity-self-assessment-survey  23 http://opencsirt.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/SIM3-mkXVIIIc.pdf  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-capabilities/csirt-maturity/csirt-maturity-self-assessment-survey http://opencsirt.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/SIM3-mkXVIIIc.pdf  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  32  Figure 6: CSIRT maturity Assessment methodology used  Together with National CSIRTs, regulators and professional associations are key enablers  for capability development for the Energy and Air Transport Sectoral CSIRTs as well as OES  CSIRTs. Several initiatives were recently implemented at sectoral level to foster these  capacities, some by sectoral operators themselves.  A noteworthy initiative in the energy sector is the 2019 launch of a cyber range dedicated to  electricity operators. The German energy company Innogy opened its “CyberRange-e”  training centre. The cyber range “allows up to 12 network and IT specialists at a time to  practice how to manage cyberattacks under real-life electricity grid conditions, including war-  game methods, pitching the participants against real hackers”24. According to Professor  Andreas Pinkwart, Minister for Economic Affairs, Digitisation, Innovation and Energy of the  State of North Rhine-Westphalia, this facility addresses the need to better protect and  safeguard data, procedures and processes in the energy industry.  At European level, sectoral regulators are also developing initiatives to enhance sectoral  stakeholders’ incident response capabilities. As an example, the Council of European Energy  Regulators offered a dedicated training on cybersecurity and the protection of the European  energy sector25 back in 2016.  At national level, many ministries, National Cybersecurity Agencies or National CSIRTs  provide different support tools and initiatives to sectoral actors.  24 https://www.energylivenews.com/2019/07/02/german-power-grid-operators-steel-themselves-for-cyber-attacks/  25 https://www.ceer.eu/training/training_courses_2016/cyber_security_sept_2016#  https://www.energylivenews.com/2019/07/02/german-power-grid-operators-steel-themselves-for-cyber-attacks/ https://www.ceer.eu/training/training_courses_2016/cyber_security_sept_2016  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  33  Figure 7: Resources in place to support IRC development  The NIS Cooperation Group identified multiple examples in their “Sectorial implementation of  the NIS Directive in the Energy sector” report26 as illustrated below:  Table 8: Case Study - 9 Member States initiatives to support Energy Sector operators with their  cybersecurity capacity-building27  Member State Initiative  Austria  The Austrian Energy CERT organises frequent meetings with technical personnel as  well as frequent meetings with senior management in the energy sector with a focus  on their performance and development.

Some sectoral CSIRTs also look for support from non-EU actors and tend to reach out to  national cybersecurity and sectoral authorities from third countries. As an example, the  Romanian Civil Aeronautical Authority (RO CAA) CSIRT (CERT-AV-RO) used:   MITRE Corporation28;   The NIST Cybersecurity Framework29;   The Australian Cyber Security Centre;   The United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority and the UK National Cyber Security  Centre (NCSC);   The Centre for Internet Security (CIS) Best Practices based on “CIS Controls” and “CIS  Benchmarks”30.   Summary: ENISA and other EU institutions and stakeholders should continue their efforts to  support capacity development across the European IR community by facilitating open access to  resources and tools for operational stakeholders.  28 US NGO: https://www.mitre.org/capabilities/cybersecurity/cyber-threat-intelligence  29 https://www.nist.gov/topics/cybersecurity  30 https://www.cisecurity.org/cybersecurity-best-practices/  https://www.mitre.org/capabilities/cybersecurity/cyber-threat-intelligence https://www.nist.gov/topics/cybersecurity https://www.cisecurity.org/cybersecurity-best-practices/  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  35  3.6 KEY FINDING #6 – SECTORAL CSIRTS CHALLENGES AND GAPS 1/2  Sectoral CSIRTs in both air transport and energy sectors face a similar challenge, i.e.  the overlap of multiple legislations and increasing time spent on compliance issues.  Both Air Transport and Energy operators share common specificities and similar challenges  when it comes to incident response. Both sectors are considered to be the backbones of  societies to such extent that any disruption could have a major impact on populations and  economies. Shared specificities are:   Complex ecosystems with large supply chains: both sectors count a wide variety  of public and private-sector actors, ranging from government, regulators and  professional associations to large industries, critical SMEs and digital service  providers;   Infrastructure interdependencies: both sectors have infrastructures strongly  interconnected to others across the European Union and beyond. This can  potentially lead to a cascading effect, and could result, in case of one system  targeted, in all others being compromised. As an example, a gas pipeline can run  through several countries, and an airport infrastructure is a commercial hub for  essential products in a country.   Legacy systems and lack of security-by-design: both sectors are composed of  basic infrastructure elements (e.g.: transformers and generators in the Energy  sector), all  designed and built much before cybersecurity became an issue, and of  more recent equipment used for automation and control, and increasingly  dependent on ICT.   Real-time requirements and 24h coverage: In both the Energy sector and Air  Transport, several cybersecurity measures would be challenging to implement in  real-time such as 24/7 monitoring coverage or systems shut down. This is  particularly true for infrastructures that cannot be easily shut down given the  prohibitive operational costs (financial and for users) associated with such a  measure.  Because of these specificities, sectoral incident response stakeholders in both the Air  transport and Energy sectors face common challenges.  One of the most common challenges raised by sectoral stakeholders, and common to all  sectors and impacting the entire cybersecurity community, is how to deal and comply with the  multiplication of requirements from national/EU authorities and sectoral actors (professional  association and regulators).  “There is a high need for sync[hronisation] between EU regulatory bodies, regarding the  harmonisation between the general cybersecurity regulation (i.e. NIS Directive) and the  special/ specific cybersecurity requirements of each of the industries. Some of the industrial  entities (which are defined specifically as under the NIS Directive jurisdiction, e.g. OES)  refuse to respect the NIS Directive and the transposed national legislation, motivating that  they are only under the jurisdiction of the special legislation. NIS Directive and special  legislation shall complement each other, creating a framework of common base [and]  complementary regulatory provisions.” (Air Transport Sectoral CSIRT)  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  36  The European Banking Federation points to an interesting example of competing cyber-  incident reporting schemes to be applied in the European Union.  Figure 8: Main Incident Reporting Schemes in the EU (Source: EBF)31  As illustrated, for specific cyber-incidents involving a data breach, both Energy and Air  Transport stakeholders could apply at least three common EU cross-industry regulations  (namely the NIS Directive, the GDPR, the e-IDAS Regulation) along with the National reporting  regulation in place in their countries.  In Air Transport sector, several actors lead different activities related to cybersecurity.  EUROCONTROL is currently the only one receiving direct information on incidents in ATM  systems, leaving other activities focusing more in collaboration. An effort towards a coordinated  common vision is required.  The multiplication of security and reporting requirements pushes operational actors to spend  time updating their procedures to stay compliant. While costly for all, this can be particularly  tough for smaller entities with less resources available to ensure compliance.  “The efforts that we consume for the justification of the cybersecurity realities in front of the  financial control authorities’ overpass, often, the efforts for the actual development and  implementation of the domain. This is a critical issue, keeping the entire development process to  the ground.” (Sectoral CSIRT).  Sectoral stakeholders have called for a harmonisation of security regulation as a mitigation  action meant to leverage revision processes. DG ENER, for instance, created a stream for  private actors in the NIS revision process. At the same time, Air Transport stakeholders are  continuously exchanging with regulators to share their operational requirements and input.   Summary: The upcoming revisions of the NIS Directive and GDPR could be an opportunity  to harmonise legislation by considering sectoral stakeholders’ feedback.  31 EBF position on Cyber incident reporting, EBF, October 2019 source: https://www.ebf.eu/wp- content/uploads/2019/10/EBF-position-paper-on-cyber-incident-reporting.pdf  https://www.ebf.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EBF-position-paper-on-cyber-incident-reporting.pdf https://www.ebf.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EBF-position-paper-on-cyber-incident-reporting.pdf  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  37  3.7 KEY FINDING #7 – SECTORAL CSIRTS CHALLENGES AND  GAPS 2/2  Sectoral CSIRTs in both the air transport and energy sectors face a common challenge  in formally and rapidly share ex-ante information in a particularly tense context  Energy and Air Transport stakeholders are well aware of the need to enhance information-  sharing at sectoral level, yet they share a common difficulty in rapidly sharing ex-ante  information. According to sectoral stakeholders, incident response community fora are useful  to promote discussion among stakeholders but are rarely used to exchange real-time  technical information about vulnerabilities and threats.  “There should be a wider dissemination of both technical and non-technical information  related to incidents across the EU.” (OES CSIRT)  All survey respondents use various international, European, national and sectoral groups and  fora (ENISA CSIRTs Network, the FIRST Community, National inter-CSIRTs Network, etc.)  to exchange information and best practices. Yet they tend to rely on mastered tools, such as  private MISP instances, or mass communication tools tweaked for a specific use, such as  WhatsApp, to exchange operational or real-time information with peers in an informal way.  Both Energy and Air transport sectors include a multiplicity of actors and have a very wide  surface of exposure to attacks. Incident response is therefore even more challenging and  requires in-depth expertise and important capabilities to successfully ensure 24/7 coverage  and rapidly share information about cyber threats.  “[There is a need for] setting up fast channels of information exchange on cybersecurity  threats” (Sectoral Ministry)  A recurrent explanation is that stakeholders prefer to share ex-post rather than ex-ante  information to avoid reputational and commercial damages.  To mitigate this, stakeholders confirm that dedicated sectoral fora are beneficial for  information-sharing. Within those fora, information is sector-focused, up-to-date and  exchanges are often made real time. Participants are more encouraged to share information  with peers from the same sector as they use the same tools. They also rely on similar  infrastructure and face similar threats.  Several sectoral initiatives can provide interesting good practices and lessons learnt, such as  the Energy ISAC32, the Health ISAC33, the Aviation ISAC34 or the Energy Community of  Users that the European Cybersecurity Community is currently developing.  Sectoral ISACs are seen a “useful mechanism” and a trusted place to share operational  information with peers. As such, they should be better recognised. Certain tools such as  MISP or automated solutions could be explored to enhance information-sharing.   Summary: Sectoral communities of users constitute a key tool to enhance operational  information-sharing. Besides, the use of automation should be explored.  32 https://www.ee-isac.eu/  33 https://h-isac.org/  34 https://www.a-isac.com/  “There is a need  for setting up fast  channels of  information  exchange on  cybersecurity  threats.”  (Sectoral Ministry)  https://www.ee-isac.eu/ https://h-isac.org/ https://www.a-isac.com/  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  38  3.8 KEY FINDING #8 – SECTORAL CSIRTS LESSONS LEARNT  Though ongoing programmes and information-sharing initiatives have successfully  supported IRC developments in both sectors, there is still a strong demand for more  frameworks, guidance and know-how  Existing capacity-building initiatives implemented at both national and European level are  very useful for Incident Response stakeholders. Such initiatives help IR stakeholders to  foster CSIRT development in both the Energy and Air Transport sectors.  Stakeholders who participated in the survey pointed to several successful initiatives such as:   the CEF programme,   ENISA guidelines,   the CSIRTs Network,   EU ISACs,   National CSIRTs tools,   Regulators and European Sectoral CSIRTs Guidelines, etc.  According to a National CSIRT, its ultimate objective is for sectoral operators “to be  autonomous in incident response”. As a result, it focuses on anticipation and prevention on  the one hand and building resilience of its constituency on the other, by training personnel,  providing robust tools and certifying DSPs. This goal is shared by several National and  Sectoral CSIRTs all keen to foster their effort to support capacity-building at sectoral level.  A number of these initiatives are public, and therefore highly dependent on public budgets,  whether national or European. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the dramatic economic  crisis in its wake massively impact public budgets and the resources available for such  initiatives.  The Air Transport sector continues to suffer from the impact of the pandemic, with air traffic  drastically reduced and offices closing all over the world. Contingency planning does not  always feature cybersecurity to the extent it should, increasing the threat to millions working  remotely, using less secure networks and thus increasing their exposure to cyber threats.  For many Air Transport and Energy sectoral operators, the pandemic has led to temporary  and permanent job and wage cuts and staff reallocation. This in turn challenges the upkeep  of organisations’ security cultures and incident response capabilities. Even if they are critical,  cybersecurity teams have also suffered from job cuts and tense environments. This could  have severe consequences on cybersecurity in the long run, making the strengthening of IR  capabilities even more important than ever.  Several measures could be taken by European institutions to keep up their ongoing efforts35  to enhance Sectoral IR capacity-building:   Measures to foster cross-sector and cross-border cooperation for incident  management;   IR sector-specific knowledge for public stakeholders as they face competition with  the private sector;   Additional guidelines and reviews on new tools and equipment to assist IR teams  in selecting appropriate IR tools;  35 For example Connecting Europe Facility  https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility/cef-telecom  https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility/cef-telecom  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  39   More training and drills.   Summary No-one doubts that the support provided by European institutions and  professional associations is beneficial to the whole sectoral IR community in a particularly  tense context fuelled by the COVID-19 pandemic.  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  40  4. RECOMMENDATIONS  This study is intended as a snapshot of the current situation. The data collected indicates that  it is still too soon to formulate sector specific recommendations. As a result, the following  recommendations are general rather than sector specific.  R#1_Capabilites:  Sectoral actors should encourage the sharing of lessons learnt on the use of open-  access or commercial tools, especially those automated within their sector to better  benefit from each other’s experience and accelerate the maturation of newly created  IR entities.  R#2_Regulations:  Sectoral actors should continue to identify overlaps, systematically raise awareness  of challenges in cybersecurity regulations36 and cooperate with policy makers to  address these issues by being involved in their revision processes.  R#3_Collaboration:  Sectoral actors should continue their efforts to make use of existing reporting  schemes such as NISD repostign and build trusted sectoral communities of users37  where they could securely exchange both ex-ante and ex-post incident information  leveraging existing tools and automated solutions.  36 For example information on Electricity network codes and guidelines  https://ec.europa.eu/energy/topics/markets-and- consumers/wholesale-energy-market/electricity-network-codes_en?redir=1  37 For example Empowering Information Sharing Analysis Centres https://www.isacs.eu/  https://ec.europa.eu/energy/topics/markets-and-consumers/wholesale-energy-market/electricity-network-codes_en?redir=1 https://ec.europa.eu/energy/topics/markets-and-consumers/wholesale-energy-market/electricity-network-codes_en?redir=1 https://www.isacs.eu/  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  41  5.

This comprehensive analysis also focused on the distribution of responsibilities to present  draft hypotheses on the emergence of new actors following the publication of the NIS  Directive.  Data structuring and classification criteria  The raw data gathered during the study was consolidated in an Excel table. It was first  organised by Member States.  In addition to Member State classification, it was decided tthat the the scope of the research  would be extended to sectoral IR Capabilities in non-EU countries to provide insight into  approaches of neighbouring countries, namely Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Georgia,  Iceland, Kosovo, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Ukraine, the United  Kingdom, Serbia and Switzerland.  For each country, the following information was initially provided (where available):   Summary of national approach to IR in the NISD sectors   Incident Response general set-up  o NISD Sectors  o Competent authorities;  o Existing/newly created CSIRT or IR entities;  o Role and list of OES;  o Role of DSP.   Cooperation set-up & processes  o Cross-border IR aspects.   Development of capabilities and other initiatives  o Operational preparedness and capacities;  o Tools;  o Initiatives, communities, etc.  Then, the list of existing and newly created CSIRT and IR entities was extracted to build a  separate consolidated table.  For each entity, the following information was provided (where available):   CSIRT/IR entity name   Sector (energy /air transport / cross-sector national CSIRT)   Country  SECTORAL CSIRT CAPABILITIES  December 2020  45   Type (public/private)   Description & mandate   Status (existing / to be created)   Cooperation set-up & processes  o Cross-border IR aspects.   Development of capabilities and other initiatives  o Operational Preparedness and capacities;  o Tools;  o Initiatives, communities, etc.  OVERVIEW OF THE SECTORAL IR SET-UP IN THE 27 MEMBER  STATES AND A SELECTION OF NON-EU COUNTRIES  Desktop research – key figures  Table 9: Desktop research – Data collection overview  Nature of information collected Data collection  Summary of national approach toward IR in the  NISD sectors  Identified in 14 MS and 8 non-EU countries  Competent authorities for the two targeted  sectors  Identified for the 27 MS and 10 non-EU  countries, partial data for 1 non-EU country  Existing/newly created or planned CSIRT or IR  entities  68 existing/newly created identified  2 planned identified  Role of OES Identified for 24 MS  Role of DSP Identified for 22 MS  Cross-border IR aspects Minimal data in 5 MS and 4 non-EU countries  Operational preparedness and capacities Minimal data for 5 MS and 10 non-EU countries  Tools Minimal data for 2 MS and 1 non-EU country  Initiatives, communities, etc.  Minimal data for 9 MS and for 9 non-EU  countries  SURVEY AND INTERVIEWS – IR APPROACH AND SECTORAL  CAPABILITIES  The objective of the survey and of the complementary interviews was to bridge information  gaps in the desktop research and gain deeper insight into IR set-up in the 27 Member States.  These activities also focused on the recent changes and evolutions of Sectoral IRC. They  were designed to also improve the knowledge on sectoral CSIRTs processes, procedures  and tools following the publication of the NIS Directive.

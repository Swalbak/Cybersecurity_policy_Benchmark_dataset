It was an advertising campaign for a new product  from the company he worked for, the Digital Equipment Corporation. For  those first 393 spammed people it was as annoying as it would be today,  regardless of the novelty of the idea.1 Receiving spam is an  inconvenience, but it may also create an opportunity for a malicious  actor to steal personal information or install malware. 2 Spam consists of  sending unsolicited messages in bulk. It is considered a cybersecurity  threat when used as an attack vector to distribute or enable other  threats.  Another noteworthy aspect is how spam may sometimes be confused or  misclassified as a phishing campaign. The main difference between the  two is the fact that phishing is a targeted action using social engineering  tactics, actively aiming to steal users’ data. In contrast spam is a tactic for  sending unsolicited e-mails to a bulk list. Phishing campaigns can use  spam tactics to distribute messages while spam can link the user to a  compromised website to install malware and steal personal data.  Spam campaigns, during these last 41 years have taken advantage of  many popular global social and sports events such as UEFA Europa  League Final, US Open, among others.

However, once again  in the reporting period, new target groups, new means and new spoils  appeared in spamming campaigns. For instance, in August 2019, spam e-  mails targeted multiple accounts encouraging their owners to share not  only a scan of their identity but also a selfie so that they would ‘win’ a free  smartphone device. In another spam campaign, users were asked to send  a personal photo. The spammers’ target group was then expanded to  include the e-mail address used by the user, to activate paid TV or live  broadcast services. Those accounts were spammed with fake licence  expiry or renewal messages. The users were asked to reply and enter their  bank account details and personal information to renew their registration. 2  _Old head on young shoulders  _Spamming to serve malware,  ransomware and remote access trojans  In August 2019, spam e-mails containing malicious ISO disk image files  were used to spread the LokiBot malware and to drop the remote access  trojan (RAT) FlawedAmmyy. Spamming was also used to spread the  TrickBot trojan, the Negasteal (also known as Agent Tesla) trojanspy, the  Ave Maria (also known as Warzone) RAT and the notorious, since 2018,  Pawload macro malware. Several ransomware families were also spread  by spam messages, such as Dharma, Crysis and Ryuk, all of which were  reported to be highly active in the reporting year. 15,21  7  This year a SMS spam operation was carried out exposing more than 80  million users’ personal data. A large number of phone numbers received  messages containing certain phrases such as ‘free money’ or ’for real’ and  links to fake sites. From that point onwards, anyone that followed the link  would be called on to sign up, giving away sensitive information. It was  proved that the database used by the spammers was owned by the  ApexSMScompany, the legitimacy of which is still unknown. Although  security researchers accessed the database and tried to retrieve as much  information as possible fearing that the operation would stop  unexpectedly, it is still not known who and for what reason may access  and use this data as it is still available. 4  _Spam SMS  Spammers manipulated feedback forms on the websites of large  companies used to ask questions, express wishes or subscribe to  newsletters. However, in this reporting year, instead of spamming the  company’s linked mailboxes, the spammers exploited low levels of website  security, bypassed any reCAPTCHA tests and registered multiple accounts  with valid e-mail information. As a result, victims received a legitimate  reply from the company, including the spammer’s message. 2 In this way,  even Google Forms was manipulated to retrieve user data and send  commercial spam. A more aggressive case was the spam attack targeting  company accounts, requesting that money be transferred to the attacker.  To convince the victim, the spammers claimed to be able to send abusive  messages in the victim’s e-mail to more than 9 million e-mail addresses,  blacklisting the company’s e-mail address. 3  _Forms were the means  Various campaigns in 2019 used the same botnet system to distribute  spam messages, although they used random headers and templates to  format the content. For that reason, security researchers started studying  these campaigns as one group under the alias ‘Chameleon spam’. 5  Chameleon spam messages originated from various countries and  included fake links to fake job postings or job offers, airline ticket booking  sites, special offers on purchasing products or even simple well-known  services. These spam messages used a template similar to those used by  valid companies such as Google, Qatar Airways, FedEx, LinkedIn or  Microsoft so that the recipient would not notice the difference. 2  _ Chameleon spam  8  Description  In October 2019, e-mails using templates in English, German, Italian and  Polish with the common subject ‘Payment Remittance Advice’ were widely  distributed. These messages included an attached document containing a  macro and recipients were asked to enable it upon opening the document.  Once enabled, the macro could start the infection process by attempting  to download the Emotet trojan. 13  The Necurs spam botnet was very active during this period after a long  time of little activity. The Gamut botnet was the third most active spam  botnet in 2019. Gamut messages are mostly related to suggestions for  dating or meeting people, offers of pharmaceutical products and job  opportunities. 1  _ As tough as old bots  9  _Number of botnets C2s associated with  malware families  Source: Spamhaus 14  4,075  2,650  1,159  739  734  728  529  501  379  282  4,331  Lokibot  AZORult  NanoCore  Pony  TrickBot  Gozi  Emotet  RemocsRAT  Predator Stealer  Adwind/Jbfrost  Others  0 1,000 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000  Soon after the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, phishing websites and  malicious files delivered by e-mail appeared, using the terms coronavirus  or COVID-19.

The Gamut botnet was the third most active spam  botnet in 2019. Gamut messages are mostly related to suggestions for  dating or meeting people, offers of pharmaceutical products and job  opportunities. 1  _ As tough as old bots  9  _Number of botnets C2s associated with  malware families  Source: Spamhaus 14  4,075  2,650  1,159  739  734  728  529  501  379  282  4,331  Lokibot  AZORult  NanoCore  Pony  TrickBot  Gozi  Emotet  RemocsRAT  Predator Stealer  Adwind/Jbfrost  Others  0 1,000 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000  Soon after the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, phishing websites and  malicious files delivered by e-mail appeared, using the terms coronavirus  or COVID-19. A COVID-19 spamming campaign was reported to be  spreading the Eeskiri-COVID.chm19, a disguised keyloggerfile. The name of  the file may suggest that the campaign originated in Estonia (i.e.  eeskirimeans ‘rule’ in Estonian). 11  In mid-February 2020 only a few hundred  COVID-19 attacks per day were recorded, but by March 2020 more than  2.500 attacks were taking place every day, promising a hard year spam-  wise. 12  _ COVID-19 opened new doors  10  Description  Spam email  65.7%  Malware  26.8%  BEC  Trojan  Threats leveraging from COVID-19 .

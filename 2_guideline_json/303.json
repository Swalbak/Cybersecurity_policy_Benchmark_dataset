INTRODUCTION  The finance sector is a heavily regulated sector, and cybersecurity provisions are already  included in multiple EU policies and legislations (e.g. PSD 21, MIFID II2). EU institutions,  agencies, bodies, regulators and other groups of stakeholders run several initiatives dedicated  to improving the cybersecurity of financial entities. This brief document outlines such European  cybersecurity initiatives in the sector and it is a first depiction of the complex landscape of  initiatives related to cybersecurity at an EU level.  1.1 SCOPE, TARGET AUDIENCE AND OBJECTIVES  In this document, we have included initiatives of European scope, i.e. ones that are  implemented in at least two EU Member states. This document focusses on financial entities,  EU institutions, bodies and agencies of the Finance sector, as well as the finance community at  large.  The document was created in an effort to shed light on the initiatives and to guide  interested parties in engaging with them and benefit from their produced results. Furthermore, it  aims to make cooperation between the initiatives and their different groups work more  seamless. The document may facilitate future assessments on the complementarity, overlaps  and gaps of the respective initiatives and identify synergies.  ENISA’s references in different sections reflect what ENISA is already doing in that particular  area, as well as the mandate that the Agency has received through the Cybersecurity Act.  1.2  METHODOLOGY  The initiatives were collected during 2020 based on various sources, namely:  1. Desktop research conducted by ENISA,  2. Information gathered via a survey conducted in 2020 targeted to financial stakeholders,  3. Feedback during the validation of this report by relevant entities such as the European  Commission (EC), European Banking Authority (EBA), European Central Bank (ECB),  and ENISA’s Expert Group on Finance (EGFI), as well as the other entities who  contributed to the survey.  The selected topics are organised on the articles of the cybersecurity act3 and are the following:   Policy development and implementation (article 5)   Information sharing and capacity building (articles 6, 9)   Cyber crisis management and operational cooperation (article 7, 12)   Awareness raising (article 10)   Standardization and certification (article 8)   Research and Innovation (article 11)  The list of initiatives included is not exhaustive and will be updated further as more initiatives  develop or come to the attention of ENISA. This is a living document and will be updated  regularly by ENISA to reflect the developments in the sector and to allow for changes or  updates on current or new initiatives.

EU CYBER INITIATIVES IN  THE FINANCE SECTOR  2.1 DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICY  The European Commission plays an active role in developing the EU's overall strategy and in  designing and implementing EU policies for the financial sector. It evaluates and reports on  these policies on a regular basis. These initiatives fall under the responsibility of the European  Commission.  The European Commission issued the Fintech action plan4 in 2018, which purpose is to  achieve stronger cyber resilience. It does this by:   Facilitating information sharing on cyber threats among market participants;   Promoting higher supervisory convergence and enforcement of IT risk management;   Increasing EU coordination in cyber threat testing using a common threat-intelligence  lead method, such as TIBER-EU.  In 2020, the digital finance strategy5 sets out general lines on how Europe can support the  digital transformation of finance in the coming years, while regulating its risks. The strategy sets  out four main priorities:   removing fragmentation in the Digital Single Market,   adapting the EU regulatory framework to facilitate digital innovation,   promoting data-driven finance,   addressing the challenges and risks with digital transformation, including enhancing  the digital operational resilience of the financial system.  The EC recently published its legislative proposal on Digital Operational Resilience Act  ('DORA')6. The ever-increasing dependency of the financial sector on software and digital  processes means that information communication technologies (ICT) risks are inherent in  finance.  The Commission, therefore, proposes that all financial entities ensure they can withstand all  types of ICT-related disruptions and threats. Credit institutions, payment and e-money  institutions, insurance companies and other financial entities will have to respect strict  standards to prevent and limit the impact of ICT-related incidents. The EC also sets an  oversight framework on service providers (such as Big Techs) which provide critical ICT  services to financial entities.  The main task of the European Banking Authority (EBA)7 is to contribute to the creation of the  European Single Rulebook8, aiming at providing a single set of harmonised prudential rules  for financial institutions throughout the EU. On ICT/cyber-related topics, the EBA has produced  a number of regulatory documents including guidelines, recommendations, opinions and other  4 COM/2018/0109, FinTech Action plan https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018DC0109  5 COM(2020) 591, Digital Finance Strategy for the EU https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52020DC0591  6 Financial services – improving resilience against cyberattacks (new rules) https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better- regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12090-Digital-Operational-Resilience-of-Financial-Services-DORFS-Act  7 EBA Mission and Tasks https://eba.europa.eu/about-us/missions-and-tasks  8 EBA Single Rulebook https://www.eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/single-rulebook  POLICY  DEVELOPMENT  AND  IMPLEMENTATION  Drafting, revising and  issuing or advising in  the drafting of  policies and  legislations  Monitor, audit,  assess and monitor  the implementation of  policies and  legislations related to  or including  cybersecurity  provisions  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018DC0109 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52020DC0591 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52020DC0591 https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12090-Digital-Operational-Resilience-of-Financial-Services-DORFS-Act https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12090-Digital-Operational-Resilience-of-Financial-Services-DORFS-Act https://eba.europa.eu/about-us/missions-and-tasks https://www.eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/single-rulebook  EU CYBERSECURITY INITIATIVES IN THE FINANCE SECTOR  March 2021  5  non-regulatory public statements. The EBA develops technical standards, guidelines,  opinions and other legal instruments aimed at enhancing the cyber resilience of credit  institutions, payment institutions, investment firms, and electronic money institutions.  The EBA has established two relevant structures, which are working on cyber-related matters.  The first is the Sub-Committee on Payment Services, which is working on PSD2 related  aspects and involves experts from the competent authorities. The second structure is the Task  Force on IT Supervision (TFIT). TFIT involves ICT experts from Member States who are  assisting in areas related to convergence of supervisory practices for supervision of IT and IT  related risks. Additionally, it helps in developing a consistent and effective framework for the  assessment of IT risks and other prudential risks, which may arise from the use of innovative  technologies (FinTech) in supervised institutions  The EBA Guidelines on ICT and security risk management9 establish requirements for credit  institutions, investment firms, payment institutions and electronic money institutions in the  EU/EEA on the mitigation and management of their information and communication technology  (ICT) risks and aim to ensure a consistent and robust approach across the Single Market. In  November 2019, the EBA published Guidelines on ICT and security risk management  (EBA/GL/2019/04), which require management and mitigation of ICT and security risks through  the establishment of sound internal governance and the use of an internal control framework  setting clear responsibilities for financial institutions’ staff, including for the management bodies.  The EU Delegated Regulation on strong customer authentication10 is based on the EBA's  Regulatory Technical Standards on strong customer authentication and secure communication  and is applicable to credit institutions, payment institutions, and electronic money institutions.  The requirements cover a range of security measures, which aim at enhancing customer  protection, increase the security of electronic payments and decreasing the risk of fraud. The  requirements also cover standards for secure communication between third party providers and  account servicing payment service providers established in the EU/EEA in the process of  provision of payment initiation services or account information services. The Regulation was  developed by the EBA in close cooperation with the ECB.  The EBA Guidelines on incident reporting under PSD211 set out the criteria, thresholds and  methodology to be used by credit institutions, payment institutions, and electronic money  institutions in the EU/EEA. The guidelines determine whether an operational or security incident  related to the provision of payment services, should be considered major and, therefore, be  notified to the competent authority in the home Member State. The guidelines were developed  by the EBA in close cooperation with the ECB.  EBA Guidelines on the reporting of retail payment fraud under PSD212. The Guidelines  aimed at contributing to the objective of PSD2 of enhancing the security of retail payments in  the EU by requiring credit institutions, payment institutions and electronic money institutions to  collect and report data on payment transactions and fraudulent payment transactions.  The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) 13 undertakes  initiatives to make regulation for both insurance and pensions sectors. EIOPA focuses on the  impact of new technology enabled business models and the use of new technologies for  9 EBA/GL/2019/04, https://eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/internal-governance/guidelines-on-ict-and-security-risk-management  10 OJ L 69, 13.3.2018, RTS on strong customer authentication and common and secure open standards of communication  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32018R0389.  11 For further info, see: https://eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/payment-services-and-electronic-money/guidelines-on- major-incidents-reporting-under-psd2  12 For further info, see: https://eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/payment-services-and-electronic-money/guidelines-on- fraud-reporting-under-psd2  13 EIOPA https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/  https://eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/internal-governance/guidelines-on-ict-and-security-risk-management https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32018R0389 https://eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/payment-services-and-electronic-money/guidelines-on-major-incidents-reporting-under-psd2 https://eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/payment-services-and-electronic-money/guidelines-on-major-incidents-reporting-under-psd2 https://eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/payment-services-and-electronic-money/guidelines-on-fraud-reporting-under-psd2 https://eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/payment-services-and-electronic-money/guidelines-on-fraud-reporting-under-psd2 https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/  EU CYBERSECURITY INITIATIVES IN THE FINANCE SECTOR  March 2021  6  supervisory purposes. The Agency also contributes to the establishment of a common  European approach towards technological innovation and promotes the exchange of  information on cybersecurity and cyber-attacks.  EIOPA recently published a strategy on cyber underwriting14. It takes into account the  acceptance of cyber risks and the following possibilities:   The losses that might come out of cyber-attacks;   The responses and recovery from a cyber-attack;   Sharing good practices in cyber risk management;   Encourage investment in risk reduction premiums.  The importance of outsourcing functions to cloud service providers has increased rapidly in  many industries, especially in the finance sector. In fact, the EBA, EIOPA and ESMA have all  issued outsourcing guidelines.  The EBA has issued a report on outsourcing arrangements15, which have integrated the  EBA recommendations on outsourcing to cloud service providers (December 2017). The  recommendations aimed at overcoming the high level of uncertainty regarding supervisory  expectations on outsourcing to cloud service providers and at removing the barriers that this  uncertainty caused for institutions proceeding with using cloud services. The recommendations  have been now integrated in the EBA Guidelines on outsourcing arrangements.  EIOPA has also issued outsourcing guidelines16. These guidelines apply to the different  Cloud services being offered. The purpose of these guidelines is provide clarification and  transparency to market participants avoiding potential regulatory arbitrages. Additionally, they  aim to foster supervisory convergence regarding the expectations and processes applicable in  relation to cloud outsourcing.  Similarly, ESMA has published outsourcing guidelines17, which are addressing specifically  Cloud providers. These guidelines refer to the risks assessment that should be performed by  the entities when engaging with Cloud service providers. In addition, requirements are included  in relation to how the governance, organisational and control structure should look like, as well  as the possible exit clauses. Additionally, the contractual obligations are defined in the  notification mechanism for getting into a contractual agreement with Cloud service providers.  The competent authorities in their supervision of cloud outsourcing arrangements could also  use the guidelines.  The Euro Cyber Resilience Board for pan-European Financial Infrastructures (ECRB)18 is  a forum for strategic discussions between financial market infrastructures. Its objectives are to:   Raise awareness of the topic of cyber resilience;   Catalyse joint initiatives to develop effective solutions for the market;   Provide a place to share best practices and foster trust and collaboration.  The ECRB is composed of representatives of pan-European financial market infrastructures and  of their critical service providers. Additionally, several national central banks, as well ECB are  14 Cyber underwriting strategy https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/content/cyber-underwriting-strategy_en  15 EBA Guidelines on outsourcing arrangements, EBA/GL/2019/02, 25 February 2019  https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/documents/10180/2551996/38c80601-f5d7-4855-8ba3- 702423665479/EBA%20revised%20Guidelines%20on%20outsourcing%20arrangements.pdf?retry=1  16 Guidelines on outsourcing to cloud service providers, EIOPA-BoS-20-002,  https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/content/guidelines-outsourcing-cloud-service-providers_en  17 Guidelines on outsourcing to cloud service providers (CSPs), ESMA50-157-2403, https://www.esma.europa.eu/press- news/esma-news/esma-publishes-cloud-outsourcing-guidelines  18 Euro Cyber Resilience Board for pan-European Financial Infrastructures https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/groups/euro- cyber-board/html/index.en.html  https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/content/cyber-underwriting-strategy_en https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/documents/10180/2551996/38c80601-f5d7-4855-8ba3-702423665479/EBA%20revised%20Guidelines%20on%20outsourcing%20arrangements.pdf?retry=1 https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/documents/10180/2551996/38c80601-f5d7-4855-8ba3-702423665479/EBA%20revised%20Guidelines%20on%20outsourcing%20arrangements.pdf?retry=1 https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/content/guidelines-outsourcing-cloud-service-providers_en https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-publishes-cloud-outsourcing-guidelines https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-publishes-cloud-outsourcing-guidelines https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/groups/euro-cyber-board/html/index.en.html https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/groups/euro-cyber-board/html/index.en.html  EU CYBERSECURITY INITIATIVES IN THE FINANCE SECTOR  March 2021  7  active participants, without taking a position for final decisions. Furthermore, the EC, ENISA,  EBA, Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), ESMA, and Europol are participating as observers.  ENISA supports policy development and implementation by carrying out a regularly updated  stocktaking of ongoing and future EU policy initiatives with cybersecurity implications and make  this information available to the European Commission and national cybersecurity competent  authorities. It focuses in particular on policies related to the sectorial dimension of the NIS  Directive, which includes the Finance sector, and on policies dedicated to cybersecurity (e.g.  DSM, security certification, crisis cooperation, education and training, information hub). ENISA  offers cybersecurity expert advice to the European Commission and other relevant EU  institutions on policy developments.  ENISA also supports the cooperation between national competent authorities in order to work  together towards the implementation of already agreed EU policies (legislation). It thus  allows  the sharing of national views and experience, and helps build upon those to draw and agree on  recommendations. ENISA focuses on the NISD (in particular on requirements for operators of  essential services e.g. identification, security requirements, incident reporting) and on the eIDAS  Regulation as well as on NIS aspects of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (and  more generally data protection) and the draft ePrivacy Regulation. Additionally, ENISA  participates in the working groups of Forum on the Security of Retail Payments (SecuRe  Pay)19, by providing advice and recommendations for harmonization of the policy  implementation.  2.2 INFORMATION SHARING AND CAPACITY BUILDING  TIBER-EU20 is the European framework for threat intelligence-based ethical red teaming. It is  the first EU-wide guide on how authorities, financial entities, threat intelligence and red-team  providers should work together to test and improve the cyber resilience of entities by carrying  out a controlled cyberattack. The TIBER-EU foresees the possibility for cooperation not only  among different regulators from different sectors, but also among regulators from different  countries. This is one of the first initiatives to foresee such capability.  The ECRB launched the Cyber Information and Intelligence Sharing Initiative (CIISI-EU)21  on 27 February 2020. CIISI-EU brings together a community of public and private entities with  the aim of sharing intelligence and exchanging best practices. The core objectives of CIISI-EU  are to:   Protect the financial system by preventing, detecting and responding to cyberattacks;   Facilitate the sharing of information, intelligence and best practices between financial  infrastructures; and   Raise awareness of cybersecurity threats.  The CIISI-EU community is a market-driven initiative. It consists of pan-European financial  infrastructures, central banks (in their operational capacity), critical service providers, ENISA  and EUROPOL, as represented in the ECRB. Authorities in their capacity as regulators,  overseers and/or supervisors are not part of the CIISI-EU Community. Regulatory reporting on  cyber incidents and data breaches are outside the scope of information and intelligence sharing  within the CIISI-EU Community22.  19 Forum on the Security of Retail Payments – SecuRe Pay https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/pol/forum/html/index.en.html  20 TIBER-EU framework https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/cyber-resilience/tiber-eu/html/index.en.html  21 Major European financial infrastructures join forces against cyber threats  https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ecb.pr200227_1~062992656b.en.html  22 More information on the initiative is available at: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/groups/euro-cyber- board/shared/pdf/ciisi-eu_practical_example.pdf  INFORMATION  SHARING AND  CAPACITY  BUILDING  Exchange of  information regarding  threats,  vulnerabilities,  incidents, trends,  good practices.

This group is chaired by the United Kingdom and the United States. The  objectives of the CEG are to identify the main cybersecurity risks in the financial sector and to  propose actions to be taken in this area.  The CEG also works on other topics such as the identification of vulnerabilities, penetration  testing, the risks of contagion resulting from relations with third parties, and cooperation  between the public and private sectors.  The Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME)24  is actively engaged in  coordinating the effort to support a safe, secure, resilient information infrastructure within the  financial sector, which provides security and privacy of customer information and efficient,  reliable execution of transactions. AFME continually works with industry and government  leaders to identify and communicate cybersecurity best practices and capabilities to educate the  industry on evolving threats and appropriate responses. Cybersecurity being cross-border in  nature, AFME is pro-actively engaged through the GFMA (Global Financial Markets  Association25), with sister trade organisations (SIFMA26 and ASIFMA27) on cybersecurity related  issues.  On November 7 2019, SIFMA held a global cyber exercise 'Quantum Dawn V' (QDV)28. QDV  brought together key participants from the global financial community, attracting public and  private sector institutions from many jurisdictions and professionals representing a broad range  of roles and responsibilities. The exercise helped identify the roles and responsibilities of key  participants in managing global crises with cross-border impacts. The exercise scenario  emphasized cross-jurisdiction communication and coordination between member firms and  regulatory agencies in North America, Europe, and Asia.  The Pan European Insurance Forum (PEIF) 29 is involved in the promotion of greater  transparency of cyber-related incidents to make a solid base of data available to the cyber  insurance underwriting community. Greater transparency is intended both in quantitative terms  (i.e., increasing the amount of information currently produced and exchanged within the  European market, and giving access to these information to a wider group of economic agents)  and in qualitative terms (i.e., the development of a common language and a standard set of  data points to be collected and shared).  Additionally, the following structures also contribute to information sharing and cooperation:   The European Savings and Retail Banking Group30 (ESBG) is involved in monitoring  policy development, organising exchanges with policymakers and sharing best  practices.   The European Payments Council (EPC)31, through its Payment Scheme Fraud  Prevention Working Group (PSFPWG) focuses on fraud data collection and analysis,  information sharing and prevention measures.   The European Association for Secure Transactions32 (EAST) uses its membership  platforms to provide country and European updates on payments and terminal fraud  (fraud types, fraud origins and due diligence), for the gathering, collation and  23 Role of the G7 https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/farming/international-cooperation/international- organisations/g7_en  24 https://www.afme.eu/  25 https://www.gfma.org/  26 https://www.sifma.org/  27 https://www.asifma.org/  28 https://www.sifma.org/resources/general/cybersecurity-exercise-quantum-dawn-v/  29 https://www.peif.eu/  30 https://www.wsbi-esbg.org/  31 https://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/  32 https://www.association-secure-transactions.eu/  https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/farming/international-cooperation/international-organisations/g7_en https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/farming/international-cooperation/international-organisations/g7_en https://www.afme.eu/ https://www.gfma.org/ https://www.sifma.org/ https://www.asifma.org/ https://www.sifma.org/resources/general/cybersecurity-exercise-quantum-dawn-v/ https://www.peif.eu/ https://www.wsbi-esbg.org/ https://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/ https://www.association-secure-transactions.eu/  EU CYBERSECURITY INITIATIVES IN THE FINANCE SECTOR  March 2021  9  dissemination of related information, trends and general statistics across all  geographies.  Sharing also includes fraud definitions and preventive measures. At the  international level, EAST maintains an active global Public-Private Partnership Network  that includes Europol, GCCPOL, ASEANAPOL, US Secret Service and INTERPOL.  EAST is developing a network of Global Members (entities that operate across two or  more regions) and has country representation from America, Africa, Eastern Europe  and Pacific Asia.   The Nordic Financial CERT33 runs continuous information sharing in the member  community and participates actively in information sharing and cooperation with  government, police and international information-sharing organizations.  At the international level, the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center  (FS-ISAC) 34 focuses on safe and effective information sharing among financial institutions. The  particular initiative has members from across the globe, which includes many European  members as well. The FS-ISAC online sharing platform provides a way to share information  without attribution. The ISAC also offers secure chat rooms, email lists, communities of interest  and other efforts to encourage sharing. It also maintains an active Public-Private Partnership  Network that includes Europol, National cybersecurity centres in the Netherlands and the United  Kingdom. The ISAC offers guidelines and recommendations, Info sharing (IOCs, TTPs, etc.),  Threat Intelligence, Industry papers, Opinion Papers, Playbooks and preparedness  benchmarking.  ENISA contributes to the initiatives by supporting the establishment of information sharing and  analysis centres (ISACs) in various sectors by providing information on best practice and  guidance on available tools and procedures, as well as by appropriately addressing regulatory  issues related to information sharing. ENISA is part of the established European ISAC in  Finance. The European Financial Institutes – Information Sharing and Analysis Centre (FI-  SAC)35 is an independent organisation that was founded in 2008. Membership consists of  country representatives coming from the financial sector, national CERT's (GovCerts) and Law  Enforcement Agencies (LEAs). Other organisations represented are ENISA, Europol, the  European Central Bank (ECB), the European Payments Council (EPC) and the European  Commission. ENISA actively supports European FI-ISAC.  This information exchange helps each member and the banks in its member state, to raise  awareness on potentials risks, and provides an early warning on new threats and MO's. The  mission of the European FI-ISAC is information exchange on electronic and mobile channel,  credit/debit cards, central systems and all ICT related topics including:   Cyber-criminal activity affecting the financial community   Vulnerabilities, technology trends and threats   Incidents and case-studies  The members share information via meetings (biannually, hosted by members, in different  European cities), via forwarding continuously relevant information to the EU FI-ISAC list server  and via direct individual communication between member organizations/individuals. Trusted  relationships are key to successful co-operation and exchange between members. Members  represent their country and should actively participate in the information exchange. The  European FI-ISAC has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Europol EC3, which is a  step to improve cooperation between the European banking community and European Law  Enforcement Agencies.  33 https://www.nfcert.org/  34 https://www.fsisac.com/  35 European Financial Institutes – Information Sharing and Analysis Centre, A Public-Private Partnership  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cross-cooperation-for-csirts/finance/european-fi-isac-a-public-private-partnership  https://www.nfcert.org/ https://www.fsisac.com/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cross-cooperation-for-csirts/finance/european-fi-isac-a-public-private-partnership  EU CYBERSECURITY INITIATIVES IN THE FINANCE SECTOR  March 2021  10  2.3 CYBER CRISIS MANAGEMENT  ENISA plays an active role in the EU coordinated response to cybersecurity incidents  crises, assisting the European Commission whenever required, notably in the framework of the  Integrated Political Crisis Response (IPCR) arrangements.  ENISA works closely with the Member States to develop EU-level cyber crisis management  procedures to improve situational awareness in the event of cross-border cyber incidents, to  assist both national level and EU-level decision-makers in taking the right decisions. ENISA also  runs several crisis simulations36 and exercises and offers numerous trainings37 on this topic.  Additionally, ENISA manages the programme of pan-European exercises named Cyber  Europe38 and offers the cyber exercises platform39, which is a tool for managing complex  exercises.  The following structures also contribute to the overall cyber crisis management:   The European Association for Secure Transactions (EAST) performs incident  identification and qualified response actions taken in different locations.   The Nordic Financial CERT supports and assists members in incident handling,  response and recovery.   The European Payments Council, via its Payment Scheme Fraud Prevention Working  Group (PSFPWG), facilitates the collaboration between Payment Service Providers on  operational payment fraud prevention including cybersecurity incidents affecting the  SEPA payment40 schemes.   FS-ISAC provides industry-wide crisis response and coordination calls, crisis  communications channels and support staff.  2.4 AWARENESS RAISING AND TRAINING  The European Banking Authority (EBA) develops awareness for cyber resilience through its  policy work and through supervisory convergence activities. These involve workshops and  training for supervisors and regulators across the EU and some non-EU jurisdictions. On the  supervisory side, the EBA raises awareness also by incorporating specific details on ICT and  cybersecurity into supervision. As part of its mandate to assess risks and vulnerabilities in the  EU banking sector, the EBA publishes regular risk assessment reports41 with ICT and  cybersecurity risks included on a regular basis. Similarly, the joint committee of the ESAs risks  reports also include regularly aspects of cybersecurity. The EBA cooperates too with external  stakeholders, including consultations, roundtables and workshops.  Under the umbrella of the EBA’s FinTech Knowledge Hub, the EBA also provides training to  competent authorities on the topics of ICT and security supervision, fostering common  understanding, knowledge exchange and guidance on the application of policy products in day-  to-day supervisory activities. In addition, the EBA develops workshops and training on cyber  risks and other risks for national authorities responsible for the supervision of credit institutions,  payment institutions and other legal entities. These include physical seminars and online  training or webinars.

The European Banking Federation (EBF) plans and implements activities to raise awareness  on cybersecurity issues and to enhance cybersecurity skills for bank employees and customers.  Through its Cybersecurity Working Group, the EBF is actively working on cyber risk  awareness-raising campaigns and initiatives in order to enhance cybersecurity skills for both the  workforce and EU citizens. In 2014, the EBF signed a MoU with EUROPOL’s European  Cybercrime Center (EC3) 42 on three levels, including awareness-raising. Since then, it has  leveraged the network of its banking community throughout 32 countries to raise awareness on  the latest cyber threats and solutions to mitigate the risks within the sector (employees,  customers and board level). The EBF has jointly created with EC3 the Cyber scams43  campaign and supports also the European Money Mulling Action44 and NoMoreRansom45.  Moreover, the EBF organizes annually the EBF Cybersecurity Conference, an annual event in  Brussels on cybersecurity in the financial sector and the EBF Innovation & Cyber Thursdays,  covering an array of topics in the domain of digital innovation, including a day dedicated to  cybersecurity and resilience, which explores the rapidly evolving trends and challenges for  banks. Both events take place in October, in the framework of the European Cybersecurity  Month (ECSM), which the EBF actively supports.  Additionally, these stakeholders also participate in the awareness-raising actions at EU level:   European Savings and Retail Banking Group (ESBG) through advocacy in the field of  cybersecurity, targeting members and stakeholders.   European Payments Council through its Payment Security Support Group (PSSG)  provides advice and guidance on security issues affecting payments or payment-  related services within the framework of the EPC’s activities.   ESBG through position papers, organisation of public events and seminars.   FI-ISAC shares information on new threats and attacks among its constituency.   EAST shares information on Payment Alerts, Fraud Alerts, Physical Attack Alerts, best  practice and guidance information, and conducts Private and Public training activities  At the international level, the FS-ISAC engages in awareness-raising through conference  speaking engagements, good practice briefings to stakeholder groups (e.g. industry  federations). Awareness mostly focuses on network and cybercrime threats. These include daily  alerts, metrics reporting, threat calls, briefs and other activities. The task of the Global  Intelligence Office, based out of London, is to help financial institutions understand the threat  landscape through research and analysis. The FS ISAC offers Intelligence training, support for  workforce diversity through academic scholarships. They also offer cyber range exercises and  hands-on training.  ENISA reinforces links between EU institutions and general awareness-raising campaigns  through active engagement of EU institutions in the European Cybersecurity Month  (ECSM)46. The ECSM carries out regular stocktaking of national awareness-raising initiatives. It  also builds upon this stocktaking and analyses and provides recommendations and advice on  best practice in awareness-raising, in particular about communication activities.  42 https://www.europol.europa.eu/about-europol/european-cybercrime-centre-ec3  43 Take control of your digital life https://www.ebf.eu/ebf-media-centre/cyberscams/  44  Global crackdown on money laundering https://www.ebf.eu/ebf-media-centre/422-arrested-and-4-031-money-mules- identified-in-global-crackdown-on-money-laundering/  45 No More Ransom campaign https://www.ebf.eu/cybersecurity/nomoreransom/  46 The European Cybersecurity Month, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity-education/european-cyber- security-month  AWARENESS  RAISING  Ensure cybersecurity  is a common  responsibility by  promoting cyber  hygiene and making  relevant stakeholders  aware of the relevant  risks, threats, good  practices and own  role detect and  actively protecting  themselves against  attacks.

The CROE defines Euro-system’s  regulator expectations in terms of cyber resilience, based on existing global guidance. It  provides clear steps for the FMIs on how to comply with the guidelines.  The Cyber Risk Institute48 (CRI) is engaged in the protection of the global economy. It does  soby enhancing cybersecurity and resiliency through standardization. As a not-for-profit  coalition of financial institutions and trade associations, CRI houses and maintains the  Financial Services Cybersecurity Profile (“the Profile”) 49— the benchmark for cybersecurity  and resiliency in the financial services industry. This ever-evolving and concise list of  assessment questions is drawn based on the intersection of global regulations and cyber  standards, such as the standards of ISO and NIST. The Profile also aims to create a common  supervisory tool designed to improve the ability of authorities to benchmark firm practices.  The EBA published two regulatory technical standards under the Payment Services  Directive II. The two technical standards are:   Regulatory technical standard-setting technical requirements on development,  operation and maintenance of the electronic central register and on access to the  information contained therein, under Article 15(4) of PSD2   Implementing technical standards on the details and structure of the information  entered by competent authorities in their public registers and notified to the EBA under  Article 15(5) of PSD2  The Financial Stability Board50 (FSB) developed a Cyber Lexicon51, which sets the  terminology to be used in cybersecurity and cyber resilience in the financial sector. It supports  the public and private sector in properly understanding each other when describing cyber-  related terminology. It also promotes a common language and facilitates cross-jurisdictional  communication on cyber risk.  The Payment card industry (PCI) standards Council52’s mission is to enhance global  payment account data security by developing standards and supporting services driving  education, awareness, and effective implementation by stakeholders. The PCI Security  Standards are developed specifically to protect payment account data throughout the payment  lifecycle and to enable technology solutions that devalue this data and remove the incentive for  criminals to steal it. They include standards for merchants, service providers, and financial  institutions on security practices technologies and processes, and standards for developers and  vendors for creating secure payment products and solutions. The council produced 15 PCI  Security Standards, which are to be used in different parts of the payment process.  The Regulation (EU) 2019/881 (Cybersecurity Act)53, establishes a European cybersecurity  certification framework for ICT products, services and processes. ENISA participates in this new  framework, by preparing candidate certification schemes on the request of the European  Commission or the European Cybersecurity Coordination Group (representation of Member  47 Cyber resilience oversight expectations for financial market infrastructures  https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/pdf/cons/cyberresilience/Cyber_resilience_oversight_expectations_for_financial_market_i nfrastructures.pdf  48 The Cyber Risk Institute https://cyberriskinstitute.org/  49 The Profile is the benchmark for cyber risk assessment, https://cyberriskinstitute.org/the-profile/  50 The Financial Stability Board (FSB) is an international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global  financial system https://www.fsb.org/  51 FSB Cyber Lexicon, https://www.fsb.org/2018/11/cyber-lexicon/  52 The PCI Security Standards, https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/  53 REGULATION (EU) 2019/881 Cybersecurity Act, OJ L 151, 7.6.2019 http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/881/oj  STANDARDIZATION  & CERTIFICATION  Development of  cybersecurity  certification schemes,  in the certification of  products, services and  processes based on  existing cybersecurity  certification schemes.

INTRODUCTION  The finance sector is a heavily regulated sector, and cybersecurity provisions are already  included in multiple EU policies and legislations (e.g. PSD 21, MIFID II2). EU institutions,  agencies, bodies, regulators and other groups of stakeholders run several initiatives dedicated  to improving the cybersecurity of financial entities. This brief document outlines such European  cybersecurity initiatives in the sector and it is a first depiction of the complex landscape of  initiatives related to cybersecurity at an EU level.  1.1 SCOPE, TARGET AUDIENCE AND OBJECTIVES  In this document, we have included initiatives of European scope, i.e. ones that are  implemented in at least two EU Member states. This document focusses on financial entities,  EU institutions, bodies and agencies of the Finance sector, as well as the finance community at  large.  The document was created in an effort to shed light on the initiatives and to guide  interested parties in engaging with them and benefit from their produced results. Furthermore, it  aims to make cooperation between the initiatives and their different groups work more  seamless. The document may facilitate future assessments on the complementarity, overlaps  and gaps of the respective initiatives and identify synergies.  ENISA’s references in different sections reflect what ENISA is already doing in that particular  area, as well as the mandate that the Agency has received through the Cybersecurity Act.  1.2  METHODOLOGY  The initiatives were collected during 2020 based on various sources, namely:  1. Desktop research conducted by ENISA,  2. Information gathered via a survey conducted in 2020 targeted to financial stakeholders,  3. Feedback during the validation of this report by relevant entities such as the European  Commission (EC), European Banking Authority (EBA), European Central Bank (ECB),  and ENISA’s Expert Group on Finance (EGFI), as well as the other entities who  contributed to the survey.  The selected topics are organised on the articles of the cybersecurity act3 and are the following:   Policy development and implementation (article 5)   Information sharing and capacity building (articles 6, 9)   Cyber crisis management and operational cooperation (article 7, 12)   Awareness raising (article 10)   Standardization and certification (article 8)   Research and Innovation (article 11)  The list of initiatives included is not exhaustive and will be updated further as more initiatives  develop or come to the attention of ENISA. This is a living document and will be updated  regularly by ENISA to reflect the developments in the sector and to allow for changes or  updates on current or new initiatives.

EU CYBER INITIATIVES IN  THE FINANCE SECTOR  2.1 DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICY  The European Commission plays an active role in developing the EU's overall strategy and in  designing and implementing EU policies for the financial sector. It evaluates and reports on  these policies on a regular basis. These initiatives fall under the responsibility of the European  Commission.  The European Commission issued the Fintech action plan4 in 2018, which purpose is to  achieve stronger cyber resilience. It does this by:   Facilitating information sharing on cyber threats among market participants;   Promoting higher supervisory convergence and enforcement of IT risk management;   Increasing EU coordination in cyber threat testing using a common threat-intelligence  lead method, such as TIBER-EU.  In 2020, the digital finance strategy5 sets out general lines on how Europe can support the  digital transformation of finance in the coming years, while regulating its risks. The strategy sets  out four main priorities:   removing fragmentation in the Digital Single Market,   adapting the EU regulatory framework to facilitate digital innovation,   promoting data-driven finance,   addressing the challenges and risks with digital transformation, including enhancing  the digital operational resilience of the financial system.  The EC recently published its legislative proposal on Digital Operational Resilience Act  ('DORA')6. The ever-increasing dependency of the financial sector on software and digital  processes means that information communication technologies (ICT) risks are inherent in  finance.  The Commission, therefore, proposes that all financial entities ensure they can withstand all  types of ICT-related disruptions and threats. Credit institutions, payment and e-money  institutions, insurance companies and other financial entities will have to respect strict  standards to prevent and limit the impact of ICT-related incidents. The EC also sets an  oversight framework on service providers (such as Big Techs) which provide critical ICT  services to financial entities.  The main task of the European Banking Authority (EBA)7 is to contribute to the creation of the  European Single Rulebook8, aiming at providing a single set of harmonised prudential rules  for financial institutions throughout the EU. On ICT/cyber-related topics, the EBA has produced  a number of regulatory documents including guidelines, recommendations, opinions and other  4 COM/2018/0109, FinTech Action plan https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018DC0109  5 COM(2020) 591, Digital Finance Strategy for the EU https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52020DC0591  6 Financial services – improving resilience against cyberattacks (new rules) https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better- regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12090-Digital-Operational-Resilience-of-Financial-Services-DORFS-Act  7 EBA Mission and Tasks https://eba.europa.eu/about-us/missions-and-tasks  8 EBA Single Rulebook https://www.eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/single-rulebook  POLICY  DEVELOPMENT  AND  IMPLEMENTATION  Drafting, revising and  issuing or advising in  the drafting of  policies and  legislations  Monitor, audit,  assess and monitor  the implementation of  policies and  legislations related to  or including  cybersecurity  provisions  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018DC0109 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52020DC0591 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52020DC0591 https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12090-Digital-Operational-Resilience-of-Financial-Services-DORFS-Act https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12090-Digital-Operational-Resilience-of-Financial-Services-DORFS-Act https://eba.europa.eu/about-us/missions-and-tasks https://www.eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/single-rulebook  EU CYBERSECURITY INITIATIVES IN THE FINANCE SECTOR  March 2021  5  non-regulatory public statements. The EBA develops technical standards, guidelines,  opinions and other legal instruments aimed at enhancing the cyber resilience of credit  institutions, payment institutions, investment firms, and electronic money institutions.  The EBA has established two relevant structures, which are working on cyber-related matters.  The first is the Sub-Committee on Payment Services, which is working on PSD2 related  aspects and involves experts from the competent authorities. The second structure is the Task  Force on IT Supervision (TFIT). TFIT involves ICT experts from Member States who are  assisting in areas related to convergence of supervisory practices for supervision of IT and IT  related risks. Additionally, it helps in developing a consistent and effective framework for the  assessment of IT risks and other prudential risks, which may arise from the use of innovative  technologies (FinTech) in supervised institutions  The EBA Guidelines on ICT and security risk management9 establish requirements for credit  institutions, investment firms, payment institutions and electronic money institutions in the  EU/EEA on the mitigation and management of their information and communication technology  (ICT) risks and aim to ensure a consistent and robust approach across the Single Market. In  November 2019, the EBA published Guidelines on ICT and security risk management  (EBA/GL/2019/04), which require management and mitigation of ICT and security risks through  the establishment of sound internal governance and the use of an internal control framework  setting clear responsibilities for financial institutions’ staff, including for the management bodies.  The EU Delegated Regulation on strong customer authentication10 is based on the EBA's  Regulatory Technical Standards on strong customer authentication and secure communication  and is applicable to credit institutions, payment institutions, and electronic money institutions.  The requirements cover a range of security measures, which aim at enhancing customer  protection, increase the security of electronic payments and decreasing the risk of fraud. The  requirements also cover standards for secure communication between third party providers and  account servicing payment service providers established in the EU/EEA in the process of  provision of payment initiation services or account information services. The Regulation was  developed by the EBA in close cooperation with the ECB.  The EBA Guidelines on incident reporting under PSD211 set out the criteria, thresholds and  methodology to be used by credit institutions, payment institutions, and electronic money  institutions in the EU/EEA. The guidelines determine whether an operational or security incident  related to the provision of payment services, should be considered major and, therefore, be  notified to the competent authority in the home Member State. The guidelines were developed  by the EBA in close cooperation with the ECB.  EBA Guidelines on the reporting of retail payment fraud under PSD212. The Guidelines  aimed at contributing to the objective of PSD2 of enhancing the security of retail payments in  the EU by requiring credit institutions, payment institutions and electronic money institutions to  collect and report data on payment transactions and fraudulent payment transactions.  The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) 13 undertakes  initiatives to make regulation for both insurance and pensions sectors. EIOPA focuses on the  impact of new technology enabled business models and the use of new technologies for  9 EBA/GL/2019/04, https://eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/internal-governance/guidelines-on-ict-and-security-risk-management  10 OJ L 69, 13.3.2018, RTS on strong customer authentication and common and secure open standards of communication  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32018R0389.  11 For further info, see: https://eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/payment-services-and-electronic-money/guidelines-on- major-incidents-reporting-under-psd2  12 For further info, see: https://eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/payment-services-and-electronic-money/guidelines-on- fraud-reporting-under-psd2  13 EIOPA https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/  https://eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/internal-governance/guidelines-on-ict-and-security-risk-management https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32018R0389 https://eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/payment-services-and-electronic-money/guidelines-on-major-incidents-reporting-under-psd2 https://eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/payment-services-and-electronic-money/guidelines-on-major-incidents-reporting-under-psd2 https://eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/payment-services-and-electronic-money/guidelines-on-fraud-reporting-under-psd2 https://eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/payment-services-and-electronic-money/guidelines-on-fraud-reporting-under-psd2 https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/  EU CYBERSECURITY INITIATIVES IN THE FINANCE SECTOR  March 2021  6  supervisory purposes. The Agency also contributes to the establishment of a common  European approach towards technological innovation and promotes the exchange of  information on cybersecurity and cyber-attacks.  EIOPA recently published a strategy on cyber underwriting14. It takes into account the  acceptance of cyber risks and the following possibilities:   The losses that might come out of cyber-attacks;   The responses and recovery from a cyber-attack;   Sharing good practices in cyber risk management;   Encourage investment in risk reduction premiums.  The importance of outsourcing functions to cloud service providers has increased rapidly in  many industries, especially in the finance sector. In fact, the EBA, EIOPA and ESMA have all  issued outsourcing guidelines.  The EBA has issued a report on outsourcing arrangements15, which have integrated the  EBA recommendations on outsourcing to cloud service providers (December 2017). The  recommendations aimed at overcoming the high level of uncertainty regarding supervisory  expectations on outsourcing to cloud service providers and at removing the barriers that this  uncertainty caused for institutions proceeding with using cloud services. The recommendations  have been now integrated in the EBA Guidelines on outsourcing arrangements.  EIOPA has also issued outsourcing guidelines16. These guidelines apply to the different  Cloud services being offered. The purpose of these guidelines is provide clarification and  transparency to market participants avoiding potential regulatory arbitrages. Additionally, they  aim to foster supervisory convergence regarding the expectations and processes applicable in  relation to cloud outsourcing.  Similarly, ESMA has published outsourcing guidelines17, which are addressing specifically  Cloud providers. These guidelines refer to the risks assessment that should be performed by  the entities when engaging with Cloud service providers. In addition, requirements are included  in relation to how the governance, organisational and control structure should look like, as well  as the possible exit clauses. Additionally, the contractual obligations are defined in the  notification mechanism for getting into a contractual agreement with Cloud service providers.  The competent authorities in their supervision of cloud outsourcing arrangements could also  use the guidelines.  The Euro Cyber Resilience Board for pan-European Financial Infrastructures (ECRB)18 is  a forum for strategic discussions between financial market infrastructures. Its objectives are to:   Raise awareness of the topic of cyber resilience;   Catalyse joint initiatives to develop effective solutions for the market;   Provide a place to share best practices and foster trust and collaboration.  The ECRB is composed of representatives of pan-European financial market infrastructures and  of their critical service providers.

Furthermore, the EC, ENISA,  EBA, Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), ESMA, and Europol are participating as observers.  ENISA supports policy development and implementation by carrying out a regularly updated  stocktaking of ongoing and future EU policy initiatives with cybersecurity implications and make  this information available to the European Commission and national cybersecurity competent  authorities. It focuses in particular on policies related to the sectorial dimension of the NIS  Directive, which includes the Finance sector, and on policies dedicated to cybersecurity (e.g.  DSM, security certification, crisis cooperation, education and training, information hub). ENISA  offers cybersecurity expert advice to the European Commission and other relevant EU  institutions on policy developments.  ENISA also supports the cooperation between national competent authorities in order to work  together towards the implementation of already agreed EU policies (legislation). It thus  allows  the sharing of national views and experience, and helps build upon those to draw and agree on  recommendations. ENISA focuses on the NISD (in particular on requirements for operators of  essential services e.g. identification, security requirements, incident reporting) and on the eIDAS  Regulation as well as on NIS aspects of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (and  more generally data protection) and the draft ePrivacy Regulation. Additionally, ENISA  participates in the working groups of Forum on the Security of Retail Payments (SecuRe  Pay)19, by providing advice and recommendations for harmonization of the policy  implementation.  2.2 INFORMATION SHARING AND CAPACITY BUILDING  TIBER-EU20 is the European framework for threat intelligence-based ethical red teaming. It is  the first EU-wide guide on how authorities, financial entities, threat intelligence and red-team  providers should work together to test and improve the cyber resilience of entities by carrying  out a controlled cyberattack. The TIBER-EU foresees the possibility for cooperation not only  among different regulators from different sectors, but also among regulators from different  countries. This is one of the first initiatives to foresee such capability.  The ECRB launched the Cyber Information and Intelligence Sharing Initiative (CIISI-EU)21  on 27 February 2020. CIISI-EU brings together a community of public and private entities with  the aim of sharing intelligence and exchanging best practices. The core objectives of CIISI-EU  are to:   Protect the financial system by preventing, detecting and responding to cyberattacks;   Facilitate the sharing of information, intelligence and best practices between financial  infrastructures; and   Raise awareness of cybersecurity threats.  The CIISI-EU community is a market-driven initiative. It consists of pan-European financial  infrastructures, central banks (in their operational capacity), critical service providers, ENISA  and EUROPOL, as represented in the ECRB. Authorities in their capacity as regulators,  overseers and/or supervisors are not part of the CIISI-EU Community. Regulatory reporting on  cyber incidents and data breaches are outside the scope of information and intelligence sharing  within the CIISI-EU Community22.  19 Forum on the Security of Retail Payments – SecuRe Pay https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/pol/forum/html/index.en.html  20 TIBER-EU framework https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/cyber-resilience/tiber-eu/html/index.en.html  21 Major European financial infrastructures join forces against cyber threats  https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ecb.pr200227_1~062992656b.en.html  22 More information on the initiative is available at: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/groups/euro-cyber- board/shared/pdf/ciisi-eu_practical_example.pdf  INFORMATION  SHARING AND  CAPACITY  BUILDING  Exchange of  information regarding  threats,  vulnerabilities,  incidents, trends,  good practices.

This group is chaired by the United Kingdom and the United States. The  objectives of the CEG are to identify the main cybersecurity risks in the financial sector and to  propose actions to be taken in this area.  The CEG also works on other topics such as the identification of vulnerabilities, penetration  testing, the risks of contagion resulting from relations with third parties, and cooperation  between the public and private sectors.  The Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME)24  is actively engaged in  coordinating the effort to support a safe, secure, resilient information infrastructure within the  financial sector, which provides security and privacy of customer information and efficient,  reliable execution of transactions. AFME continually works with industry and government  leaders to identify and communicate cybersecurity best practices and capabilities to educate the  industry on evolving threats and appropriate responses. Cybersecurity being cross-border in  nature, AFME is pro-actively engaged through the GFMA (Global Financial Markets  Association25), with sister trade organisations (SIFMA26 and ASIFMA27) on cybersecurity related  issues.  On November 7 2019, SIFMA held a global cyber exercise 'Quantum Dawn V' (QDV)28. QDV  brought together key participants from the global financial community, attracting public and  private sector institutions from many jurisdictions and professionals representing a broad range  of roles and responsibilities. The exercise helped identify the roles and responsibilities of key  participants in managing global crises with cross-border impacts. The exercise scenario  emphasized cross-jurisdiction communication and coordination between member firms and  regulatory agencies in North America, Europe, and Asia.  The Pan European Insurance Forum (PEIF) 29 is involved in the promotion of greater  transparency of cyber-related incidents to make a solid base of data available to the cyber  insurance underwriting community. Greater transparency is intended both in quantitative terms  (i.e., increasing the amount of information currently produced and exchanged within the  European market, and giving access to these information to a wider group of economic agents)  and in qualitative terms (i.e., the development of a common language and a standard set of  data points to be collected and shared).  Additionally, the following structures also contribute to information sharing and cooperation:   The European Savings and Retail Banking Group30 (ESBG) is involved in monitoring  policy development, organising exchanges with policymakers and sharing best  practices.   The European Payments Council (EPC)31, through its Payment Scheme Fraud  Prevention Working Group (PSFPWG) focuses on fraud data collection and analysis,  information sharing and prevention measures.   The European Association for Secure Transactions32 (EAST) uses its membership  platforms to provide country and European updates on payments and terminal fraud  (fraud types, fraud origins and due diligence), for the gathering, collation and  23 Role of the G7 https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/farming/international-cooperation/international- organisations/g7_en  24 https://www.afme.eu/  25 https://www.gfma.org/  26 https://www.sifma.org/  27 https://www.asifma.org/  28 https://www.sifma.org/resources/general/cybersecurity-exercise-quantum-dawn-v/  29 https://www.peif.eu/  30 https://www.wsbi-esbg.org/  31 https://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/  32 https://www.association-secure-transactions.eu/  https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/farming/international-cooperation/international-organisations/g7_en https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/farming/international-cooperation/international-organisations/g7_en https://www.afme.eu/ https://www.gfma.org/ https://www.sifma.org/ https://www.asifma.org/ https://www.sifma.org/resources/general/cybersecurity-exercise-quantum-dawn-v/ https://www.peif.eu/ https://www.wsbi-esbg.org/ https://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/ https://www.association-secure-transactions.eu/  EU CYBERSECURITY INITIATIVES IN THE FINANCE SECTOR  March 2021  9  dissemination of related information, trends and general statistics across all  geographies.  Sharing also includes fraud definitions and preventive measures. At the  international level, EAST maintains an active global Public-Private Partnership Network  that includes Europol, GCCPOL, ASEANAPOL, US Secret Service and INTERPOL.  EAST is developing a network of Global Members (entities that operate across two or  more regions) and has country representation from America, Africa, Eastern Europe  and Pacific Asia.   The Nordic Financial CERT33 runs continuous information sharing in the member  community and participates actively in information sharing and cooperation with  government, police and international information-sharing organizations.  At the international level, the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center  (FS-ISAC) 34 focuses on safe and effective information sharing among financial institutions. The  particular initiative has members from across the globe, which includes many European  members as well. The FS-ISAC online sharing platform provides a way to share information  without attribution. The ISAC also offers secure chat rooms, email lists, communities of interest  and other efforts to encourage sharing. It also maintains an active Public-Private Partnership  Network that includes Europol, National cybersecurity centres in the Netherlands and the United  Kingdom. The ISAC offers guidelines and recommendations, Info sharing (IOCs, TTPs, etc.),  Threat Intelligence, Industry papers, Opinion Papers, Playbooks and preparedness  benchmarking.  ENISA contributes to the initiatives by supporting the establishment of information sharing and  analysis centres (ISACs) in various sectors by providing information on best practice and  guidance on available tools and procedures, as well as by appropriately addressing regulatory  issues related to information sharing. ENISA is part of the established European ISAC in  Finance. The European Financial Institutes – Information Sharing and Analysis Centre (FI-  SAC)35 is an independent organisation that was founded in 2008. Membership consists of  country representatives coming from the financial sector, national CERT's (GovCerts) and Law  Enforcement Agencies (LEAs). Other organisations represented are ENISA, Europol, the  European Central Bank (ECB), the European Payments Council (EPC) and the European  Commission. ENISA actively supports European FI-ISAC.  This information exchange helps each member and the banks in its member state, to raise  awareness on potentials risks, and provides an early warning on new threats and MO's. The  mission of the European FI-ISAC is information exchange on electronic and mobile channel,  credit/debit cards, central systems and all ICT related topics including:   Cyber-criminal activity affecting the financial community   Vulnerabilities, technology trends and threats   Incidents and case-studies  The members share information via meetings (biannually, hosted by members, in different  European cities), via forwarding continuously relevant information to the EU FI-ISAC list server  and via direct individual communication between member organizations/individuals. Trusted  relationships are key to successful co-operation and exchange between members. Members  represent their country and should actively participate in the information exchange. The  European FI-ISAC has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Europol EC3, which is a  step to improve cooperation between the European banking community and European Law  Enforcement Agencies.  33 https://www.nfcert.org/  34 https://www.fsisac.com/  35 European Financial Institutes – Information Sharing and Analysis Centre, A Public-Private Partnership  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cross-cooperation-for-csirts/finance/european-fi-isac-a-public-private-partnership  https://www.nfcert.org/ https://www.fsisac.com/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cross-cooperation-for-csirts/finance/european-fi-isac-a-public-private-partnership  EU CYBERSECURITY INITIATIVES IN THE FINANCE SECTOR  March 2021  10  2.3 CYBER CRISIS MANAGEMENT  ENISA plays an active role in the EU coordinated response to cybersecurity incidents  crises, assisting the European Commission whenever required, notably in the framework of the  Integrated Political Crisis Response (IPCR) arrangements.  ENISA works closely with the Member States to develop EU-level cyber crisis management  procedures to improve situational awareness in the event of cross-border cyber incidents, to  assist both national level and EU-level decision-makers in taking the right decisions. ENISA also  runs several crisis simulations36 and exercises and offers numerous trainings37 on this topic.  Additionally, ENISA manages the programme of pan-European exercises named Cyber  Europe38 and offers the cyber exercises platform39, which is a tool for managing complex  exercises.  The following structures also contribute to the overall cyber crisis management:   The European Association for Secure Transactions (EAST) performs incident  identification and qualified response actions taken in different locations.   The Nordic Financial CERT supports and assists members in incident handling,  response and recovery.   The European Payments Council, via its Payment Scheme Fraud Prevention Working  Group (PSFPWG), facilitates the collaboration between Payment Service Providers on  operational payment fraud prevention including cybersecurity incidents affecting the  SEPA payment40 schemes.   FS-ISAC provides industry-wide crisis response and coordination calls, crisis  communications channels and support staff.  2.4 AWARENESS RAISING AND TRAINING  The European Banking Authority (EBA) develops awareness for cyber resilience through its  policy work and through supervisory convergence activities. These involve workshops and  training for supervisors and regulators across the EU and some non-EU jurisdictions. On the  supervisory side, the EBA raises awareness also by incorporating specific details on ICT and  cybersecurity into supervision. As part of its mandate to assess risks and vulnerabilities in the  EU banking sector, the EBA publishes regular risk assessment reports41 with ICT and  cybersecurity risks included on a regular basis. Similarly, the joint committee of the ESAs risks  reports also include regularly aspects of cybersecurity. The EBA cooperates too with external  stakeholders, including consultations, roundtables and workshops.  Under the umbrella of the EBA’s FinTech Knowledge Hub, the EBA also provides training to  competent authorities on the topics of ICT and security supervision, fostering common  understanding, knowledge exchange and guidance on the application of policy products in day-  to-day supervisory activities. In addition, the EBA develops workshops and training on cyber  risks and other risks for national authorities responsible for the supervision of credit institutions,  payment institutions and other legal entities. These include physical seminars and online  training or webinars.  Within the mandate of the FinTech Knowledge Hub, the EBA also  36 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cyber-exercises  37 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cyber-crisis-management/trainings  38 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cyber-exercises/cyber-europe-programme  39 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cyber-exercises/cyber-exercises-platform  40 Single euro payments area (SEPA) https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/consumer- finance-and-payments/payment-services/single-euro-payments-area-sepa_bg  41 The Risk Assessment Reports provide an annual update on risks and vulnerabilities in the EU banking sector  https://eba.europa.eu/risk-analysis-and-data/risk-assessment-reports  CYBER CRISIS  MANAGEMENT  Participation or  having a specific  assigned role in the  coordinated  operational response  at Union and Member  State level to a large-  scale cyber incident.

The European Banking Federation (EBF) plans and implements activities to raise awareness  on cybersecurity issues and to enhance cybersecurity skills for bank employees and customers.  Through its Cybersecurity Working Group, the EBF is actively working on cyber risk  awareness-raising campaigns and initiatives in order to enhance cybersecurity skills for both the  workforce and EU citizens. In 2014, the EBF signed a MoU with EUROPOL’s European  Cybercrime Center (EC3) 42 on three levels, including awareness-raising. Since then, it has  leveraged the network of its banking community throughout 32 countries to raise awareness on  the latest cyber threats and solutions to mitigate the risks within the sector (employees,  customers and board level). The EBF has jointly created with EC3 the Cyber scams43  campaign and supports also the European Money Mulling Action44 and NoMoreRansom45.  Moreover, the EBF organizes annually the EBF Cybersecurity Conference, an annual event in  Brussels on cybersecurity in the financial sector and the EBF Innovation & Cyber Thursdays,  covering an array of topics in the domain of digital innovation, including a day dedicated to  cybersecurity and resilience, which explores the rapidly evolving trends and challenges for  banks. Both events take place in October, in the framework of the European Cybersecurity  Month (ECSM), which the EBF actively supports.  Additionally, these stakeholders also participate in the awareness-raising actions at EU level:   European Savings and Retail Banking Group (ESBG) through advocacy in the field of  cybersecurity, targeting members and stakeholders.   European Payments Council through its Payment Security Support Group (PSSG)  provides advice and guidance on security issues affecting payments or payment-  related services within the framework of the EPC’s activities.   ESBG through position papers, organisation of public events and seminars.   FI-ISAC shares information on new threats and attacks among its constituency.   EAST shares information on Payment Alerts, Fraud Alerts, Physical Attack Alerts, best  practice and guidance information, and conducts Private and Public training activities  At the international level, the FS-ISAC engages in awareness-raising through conference  speaking engagements, good practice briefings to stakeholder groups (e.g. industry  federations). Awareness mostly focuses on network and cybercrime threats. These include daily  alerts, metrics reporting, threat calls, briefs and other activities. The task of the Global  Intelligence Office, based out of London, is to help financial institutions understand the threat  landscape through research and analysis. The FS ISAC offers Intelligence training, support for  workforce diversity through academic scholarships. They also offer cyber range exercises and  hands-on training.  ENISA reinforces links between EU institutions and general awareness-raising campaigns  through active engagement of EU institutions in the European Cybersecurity Month  (ECSM)46. The ECSM carries out regular stocktaking of national awareness-raising initiatives. It  also builds upon this stocktaking and analyses and provides recommendations and advice on  best practice in awareness-raising, in particular about communication activities.  42 https://www.europol.europa.eu/about-europol/european-cybercrime-centre-ec3  43 Take control of your digital life https://www.ebf.eu/ebf-media-centre/cyberscams/  44  Global crackdown on money laundering https://www.ebf.eu/ebf-media-centre/422-arrested-and-4-031-money-mules- identified-in-global-crackdown-on-money-laundering/  45 No More Ransom campaign https://www.ebf.eu/cybersecurity/nomoreransom/  46 The European Cybersecurity Month, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity-education/european-cyber- security-month  AWARENESS  RAISING  Ensure cybersecurity  is a common  responsibility by  promoting cyber  hygiene and making  relevant stakeholders  aware of the relevant  risks, threats, good  practices and own  role detect and  actively protecting  themselves against  attacks.

The CROE defines Euro-system’s  regulator expectations in terms of cyber resilience, based on existing global guidance. It  provides clear steps for the FMIs on how to comply with the guidelines.  The Cyber Risk Institute48 (CRI) is engaged in the protection of the global economy. It does  soby enhancing cybersecurity and resiliency through standardization. As a not-for-profit  coalition of financial institutions and trade associations, CRI houses and maintains the  Financial Services Cybersecurity Profile (“the Profile”) 49— the benchmark for cybersecurity  and resiliency in the financial services industry. This ever-evolving and concise list of  assessment questions is drawn based on the intersection of global regulations and cyber  standards, such as the standards of ISO and NIST. The Profile also aims to create a common  supervisory tool designed to improve the ability of authorities to benchmark firm practices.  The EBA published two regulatory technical standards under the Payment Services  Directive II. The two technical standards are:   Regulatory technical standard-setting technical requirements on development,  operation and maintenance of the electronic central register and on access to the  information contained therein, under Article 15(4) of PSD2   Implementing technical standards on the details and structure of the information  entered by competent authorities in their public registers and notified to the EBA under  Article 15(5) of PSD2  The Financial Stability Board50 (FSB) developed a Cyber Lexicon51, which sets the  terminology to be used in cybersecurity and cyber resilience in the financial sector. It supports  the public and private sector in properly understanding each other when describing cyber-  related terminology. It also promotes a common language and facilitates cross-jurisdictional  communication on cyber risk.  The Payment card industry (PCI) standards Council52’s mission is to enhance global  payment account data security by developing standards and supporting services driving  education, awareness, and effective implementation by stakeholders. The PCI Security  Standards are developed specifically to protect payment account data throughout the payment  lifecycle and to enable technology solutions that devalue this data and remove the incentive for  criminals to steal it. They include standards for merchants, service providers, and financial  institutions on security practices technologies and processes, and standards for developers and  vendors for creating secure payment products and solutions. The council produced 15 PCI  Security Standards, which are to be used in different parts of the payment process.  The Regulation (EU) 2019/881 (Cybersecurity Act)53, establishes a European cybersecurity  certification framework for ICT products, services and processes. ENISA participates in this new  framework, by preparing candidate certification schemes on the request of the European  Commission or the European Cybersecurity Coordination Group (representation of Member  47 Cyber resilience oversight expectations for financial market infrastructures  https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/pdf/cons/cyberresilience/Cyber_resilience_oversight_expectations_for_financial_market_i nfrastructures.pdf  48 The Cyber Risk Institute https://cyberriskinstitute.org/  49 The Profile is the benchmark for cyber risk assessment, https://cyberriskinstitute.org/the-profile/  50 The Financial Stability Board (FSB) is an international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global  financial system https://www.fsb.org/  51 FSB Cyber Lexicon, https://www.fsb.org/2018/11/cyber-lexicon/  52 The PCI Security Standards, https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/  53 REGULATION (EU) 2019/881 Cybersecurity Act, OJ L 151, 7.6.2019 http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/881/oj  STANDARDIZATION  & CERTIFICATION  Development of  cybersecurity  certification schemes,  in the certification of  products, services and  processes based on  existing cybersecurity  certification schemes.

    "abstract": "The finance sector is a heavily regulated sector, and cybersecurity provisions are already included in multiple EU policies and legislations (e.g. PSD 2 , MIFID II ). EU institutions, agencies, bodies, regulators and other groups of stakeholders run several initiatives dedicated to improving the cybersecurity of financial entities. This brief document outlines such European cybersecurity initiatives in the sector and it is a first depiction of the complex landscape of initiatives related to cybersecurity at an EU level."

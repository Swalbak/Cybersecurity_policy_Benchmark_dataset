In order to properly fulfill this role, ENISA must have  a better insight at what makes or breaks a community – trust. This report takes a first informal look at  how communities build and maintain trust, by looking at four different operational communities. We  highlight commonalities and differences, and give a first set of recommendations to enhance trust in  a community.

As such, participation in trust building activities is one of ENISA’s recurrent recommendations [2]. This  document takes an informal look at existing operational communities that single out trust building as  being one of their goals. Its purpose is to get preliminary insight before going into further details in  the scope of a future Work Programme.  The communities we look at are not only CERT-related, as the problem of trust building goes beyond  the world of CERTs and can be applied to any community made either of individuals or teams that  need to collaborate occasionally.  2 Defining Trust  Trust can be defined in terms of  a set of expectations [3]. Previous work by ENISA [4] shows that  CERTs that meet the following expectations are more likely to be trusted by other CERTs:   Technical expertise   Active membership in CERT initiatives   Ability to respond quickly and act on security threats   Stability of the team   Maturity level of the team  In other words, a trusted CERT is mature team that acts on shared information and shares back.  It should be noted that even with this kind of definition, trust is established gradually: first, people  trust people, then people trust teams, and finally teams trust teams.  3 A look at operational communities  3.1 FIRST  The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST1) was founded in 1990 as a worldwide  network of individual computer security incident response teams that cooperate voluntarily to im- prove their abilities to deal with and prevent computer security problems. FIRST is a membership or- ganisation that is governed by an operational framework, and each member must designate a primary  and alternate representative to FIRST. Participants in FIRST are part of a network of teams that volun- tarily work together in order to deal with response to computer security problems and their preven- tion.  FIRST’s approach to trust is twofold:  1. Control the entrance of new members  2. Provide activities that foster trust  3.1.1 Membership Process  FIRST members are mostly teams, though individuals can apply. Teams willing to become members  need to provide basic information about how to contact them and their policies. New candidates must  also have two existing teams supporting their membership (“sponsors”). Usually, a representative of  one of the sponsors performs a site visit to meet the new team and their management, and assess its  1 http://www.first.org/  http://www.first.org/  Scalable and Accepted Methods for Trust Building in Operational Communities  Version 1.0  Page  2  level of maturity – funding, security policies and other operational factors. The visiting sponsor then  reports to the membership committee that decides on new memberships.  It should be noted that membership is for life. Once a team has been admitted, there is no re-evalua- tion (this makes the FIRST model different from the TF-CSIRT/TI model for example).  3.1.2 Activities  FIRST provides activities and structure for information sharing:   Mailing lists for discussion: in principle, these lists can be used to discuss any subject with  the whole community. However, given the large number of participants and the uncertainty  of who will receive the mails, these lists are seldom used for sensitive information.   Workshops (Technical Colloquium, Special Interest Groups, Symposium, etc.): these activities  gather members in small to medium groups that have similar interests or are geographically  close, and are focused on technical issues. One or several team representatives present their  projects, or ask for feedback, or train others. It is at this level that most trust is established,  as groups are small and closed enough to foster the sharing of information.   Conference: the annual conference gathers representatives of teams from all over the  world, but membership is not a requirement to register. The information shared in sessions  is thus seldom of sensitive nature, but the numerous side activities leave room for personal  contact.  3.2 TF-CSIRT/Trusted Introducer  TF-CSIRT2 provides a forum where members of the CSIRT community can exchange experiences and  knowledge in a trusted environment in order to improve cooperation and coordination. It maintains  a system for registering and accrediting CSIRTs, as well as certifying service standards.  TF-CSIRT’s approach to trust is similar to that of FIRST, but goes a bit further:  1. Control the entrance of new members  2. Provide activities that foster trust  3. Provide an additional maturity level  3.2.1 Membership Process  As with FIRST, members are mostly teams. Individuals are only admitted by invitation of the commu- nity. The cornerstone of TF-CSIRT membership is the “Trusted Introducer”3. This service serves as a  neutral and trusted third party that introduces new teams to the community. The first step for a team  to join the community is to acquire “Listed” status with Trusted Introducer. This requires two sponsors  (already accredited teams) that can testify that the candidate team is a CERT in good standing, and  very basic contact information. Full membership additionally requires full contact information, as well  as summaries of key policies like the Information Sharing policy. By and large, the information gath- ered is closely mapped to RFC2350 [5], augmented by statements regarding the team’s support for a  number of good practices.  Certification is the next level of maturity for member teams. By getting certified, a team demonstrates  that it meets certain criteria as evaluated by a neutral third party.  2 http://www.terena.org/activities/tf-csirt/  3 http://www.trusted-introducer.org/  http://www.terena.org/activities/tf-csirt/ http://www.trusted-introducer.org/  Scalable and Accepted Methods for Trust Building in Operational Communities  Version 1.0  Page  3  The biggest difference with FIRST is that all levels of participation must be regularly confirmed in order  to maintain the privileges that are associated with them:   Listed teams need to confirm their contact information once a year,   Full Members need to update the whole of their information every four months, and   Certification is only valid for three years, after which the whole certification process must be  renewed.  3.2.2 Activities  The activities are similar to FIRST, so we will focus on the differences that can have an influence on  trust:   Closed meetings. The closed meetings are reserved for full members, and the focus is on  sharing information that is not public.   Use of the Traffic Light Protocol. Use of the TLP is institutionalised during meetings, and  teams are encouraged to share Amber and Red level information during the closed meeting.   Encrypted mailing lists. There are mailing lists that encrypt any message for each recipient  individually. This allows to share more sensitive information. They are not often used,  though.   Out of Band Alerting System. Teams can use an alerting system that reaches all other teams  through text messages in case of major emergencies.  3.3 NSP-Security  NSP-Security4 is a low profile community of volunteer incident responders. It revolves around a mail- ing-list, and individuals willing to participate must satisfy a number of requirements:  1. Work for a corporation that is in position to actively handle incidents (ISP, vendor …), and  use a corporate email address.  2. Action is mandatory, contribution is encouraged. All members are encouraged to share in-  formation on the mailing list, and acknowledge actions. Those prevented by laws or policies  from doing so are required to take action whenever it is in their purview.  3. Reposting information outside the mailing list is forbidden.  It should be noted that the last two requirements can be at odds with each other, as acting on infor- mation might require notifying others. Also, the mailing list is not encrypted.  On top of the above requirements, side activities are organised during various security conferences to  allow members to meet each other in person.  3.4 EU FI-ISAC  The EU FI-ISAC is the Information Sharing and Analysis Centre for the European Financial Institutions.  It gathers together individual representatives from Financial Institutions (banks, central banks …),  CERTs, and Law Enforcement. Its purpose is information sharing about incidents, threats, trends, vul- nerabilities, etc., in the financial sector.  The approach of the EU FI-ISAC to trust is as follows:  1. Mandatory use of the TLP. Participants are encouraged to share Amber or Red information.  4 https://puck.nether.net/mailman/listinfo/nsp-security  https://puck.nether.net/mailman/listinfo/nsp-security  Scalable and Accepted Methods for Trust Building in Operational Communities  Version 1.0  Page  4  2. Participants sign an NDA before each meeting.  3. Mandatory contribution. Contribution is taken in the largest sense possible, but systematic  silence is not tolerated.  4. Continuity. As much as possible, people in the group should remain the same over time.  4 Discussion  In this section we discuss how each community fares with regard to the criteria listed in Section Error!  eference source not found..  4.1 FIRST  FIRST is a CERT initiative, so its very existence is a trust building mechanism for its members. However,  its size and the single level of maturity (membership) means that just being a fellow member will not  automatically make a team trustworthy to another one. The size of FIRST also makes its mailing list  almost devoid of sensitive information, because teams do not know who else is subscribed.  This is where the other activities play an important role: participation in the conference, symposia,  and other face-to-face meetings allow teams to meet each other. Those who actually present their  experiences or tools during these activities will get extra credit, because they will show expertise and  a sharing mind-set. However, speaking slots are limited, and experience shows that the same teams  or even the same persons present their results, while the rest passively absorbs the information.  With regards to the ability to act on information, FIRST as an organisation can do little: they have no  control on what data a team will receive, and how they will actually act on it.  4.2 TF-CSIRT  Since TF-CSIRT shares a similar organisational form to that of FIRST, it’s no surprise that the trust situ- ation is similar in some aspects. The mailing list is seldom used for sensitive information sharing, and  during meetings the same teams and people are presenting, and are thus more easily trusted. Like- wise, TF-CSIRT has little control on the way a team treats information it receives.  The difference lies in the tiered membership. It gives a lot more credit to certified teams. The distinc- tion between closed and open meetings, with TLP Amber or Red information being shared only in the  closed meeting, allows for a closer-knit community. Also, the number of accredited teams is still small  enough that being a fellow member can be enough for a basic trust relationship.  4.3 NSP-Security  Contrary to FIRST and TF-CSIRT, NSP-Security is made up of individuals. The need for vetting new  members and the mandatory taking of action makes for a high level of trust between members. The  downside of only having individual members is that there is no automatic way for the trust relationship  to be transferred to the members’ organisation or company.  4.4 EU FI-ISAC  As for NSP-Security, members are vetted, and participation is mandatory. The biggest difference is  that a neutral trusted third party is vetting the participants. The EU FI-ISAC is also organised around  regular physical meetings. This provides the framework for a high level of trust between participants  – over time. The downside is scalability: speaking slots are limited during face to face meetings, and  Scalable and Accepted Methods for Trust Building in Operational Communities  Version 1.0  Page  5  there is only so many persons one can talk to during an informal social event that usually accompanies  the meetings.  5 Conclusions  We considered four operational communities whose goals include fostering trust between their  members. All of them are successful in a certain way, though some scale better than others.  An important observation is that all consider human contact important – even the one based solely  on a mailing list, NSP-Security. This leads to a first recommendation that organisations need to  dedicate time and resources to the participation of face to face meetings.  Sharing and personal contact is one of the most important factors in establishing trust. Formal  presentations during meetings are one of the most obvious ways of providing opportunities for  sharing. However, as the number of members in a community grows, the number of speaking slots  limits scalability. This situation can be improved in several ways:   Encourage speaker rotation   Vary the format of meetings by providing space for active discussion   Propose side activities that allows personal contact  ENISA should keep investigating ways of improving trust building in operational communities in the  future, with a more rigorous approach.  6 References  [1]  ENISA, “Baseline Capabilities of National/Governmental CERTs - Update Recommendations  2012,” 2012.

All of them are successful in a certain way, though some scale better than others.  An important observation is that all consider human contact important – even the one based solely  on a mailing list, NSP-Security. This leads to a first recommendation that organisations need to  dedicate time and resources to the participation of face to face meetings.  Sharing and personal contact is one of the most important factors in establishing trust. Formal  presentations during meetings are one of the most obvious ways of providing opportunities for  sharing. However, as the number of members in a community grows, the number of speaking slots  limits scalability. This situation can be improved in several ways:   Encourage speaker rotation   Vary the format of meetings by providing space for active discussion   Propose side activities that allows personal contact  ENISA should keep investigating ways of improving trust building in operational communities in the  future, with a more rigorous approach.  6 References  [1]  ENISA, “Baseline Capabilities of National/Governmental CERTs - Update Recommendations  2012,” 2012.

    "abstract": "One of ENISA’s role is that of community builder. In order to properly fulfill this role, ENISA must have a better insight at what makes or breaks a community – trust. This report takes a first informal look at how communities build and maintain trust, by looking at four different operational communities. This report highlights commonalities and differences, and gives a first set of recommendations to enhance trust in a community."

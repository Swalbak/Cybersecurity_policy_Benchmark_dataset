One of the three pillars of the  NIS Directive is the implementation of risk management and reporting obligations for Operators  of Essential Services (OES) and Digital Service Providers (DSP).  Four years after the NIS Directive entered into force and two years after the transposition by  Member States into their national laws, this report presents the findings of a survey of 251  organisations across five EU Member States (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Poland) with  regards to NIS investments. The report depicts and analyses how OES and DSPs spend their  information security budget and provides indications as to how this spending has been  influenced by the introduction of the NIS Directive. The results of this NIS survey were  correlated with Gartner security data and insights observed globally and in the EU in order to  better understand the current NIS Directive adoption dynamics and impact on related  investments.  This report provides comprehensive data and insights regarding the NIS Directive  adoption and the effects on the information security budget, staffing, solutions adoption  and security posture of organisations within its scope.  Overall, 82% of surveyed organisations acknowledge a positive impact of the NIS  Directive on their information security.  Regarding the NIS Directive implementation, the collected data revealed the following:   More than 80% of surveyed organisations declared that their NIS Directive  implementation program is either completed or in progress. The average NIS  implementation program is between 14 and 18 months   The average budget for NIS Directive implementation projects is approximately 175  K€, with 42.7% of affected organisations allocating between 100 and 250 K€. A little  under 50% of surveyed organisations had to hire additional security matter experts  (both internally and through staff augmentation), in the majority of cases hiring up to 4  FTEs   Surveyed organisations prioritised the following security domains: Governance, Risk  and Compliance (GRC), Network Security, Business Continuity Management (BCM)  and Vulnerability Management (VM).   When implementing the NIS Directive, 64% of surveyed organisations procured  security incident & event log collection solutions, as well as security awareness &  training services.   “Unclear expectations” and “Limited support from the national authority” are among the  top challenges faced by surveyed organisations when implementing the NIS Directive.   81% of the surveyed organisations have established a mechanism to report  information security incidents to their national authority, with the majority of surveyed  organisations allocating up to 4 people for incident reporting.   Nearly 60% of surveyed organisations reported major information security incidents.   43% of surveyed organisations experienced information security incidents with a direct  financial impact up to 500 k€.  82% of surveyed  organisations  acknowledge a  positive impact  of the NIS  Directive on their  information  security  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  5  1. INTRODUCTION  The Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NIS Directive)1 represents  the first EU-wide legislation on cybersecurity, with the objective to achieve a high common level  of cybersecurity for all EU Member States. One of the three pillars of the NIS Directive is the  implementation of risk management and reporting obligations for Operators of Essential  Services (OES) and Digital Service Providers (DSP). Annex II and Annex III of the NIS Directive  identify the following categories of operators / sectors as OES and DSPs respectively:  Table 1: Categories of OES and DSPs as defined in the NIS Directive  Categories of OES and DSPs  OES DSPs   Energy (electricity, oil and gas)   Transport (air, rail, water and road)   Banking   Financial market infrastructures   Health   Drinking water supply and distribution   Digital infrastructure   Online marketplace   Online search engine   Cloud computing service  The objective of this report is to document how operators in these sectors invest in  cybersecurity and how the implementation of the NIS Directive has influenced this investment.  NIS investment data for this report was collected from two sources:   High-level insights on the EU cybersecurity market were drawn from Gartner’s  Research databases, combined with additional analysis of the current market  dynamics and latest forecasts.   To collect specific data on the NIS Directive, an ad hoc survey was conducted on  250+ European organisations identified as OES or DSPs  Surveyed organisations originated from five Member States chosen due to the size of their  information security market as well as the number of OES and DSPs declared: Germany,  France, Italy, Spain and Poland. Additional information on the methodology, rationale for  selecting these 5 MS and additional survey demographics is available in Annex A.  The target audience of this report are EU and National policy makers. As a secondary  audience, this report may provide useful information to OES and DSPs as well.  1 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  6  2. INFORMATION SECURITY  DYNAMICS AND OUTLOOK  This chapter aims to provide a high-level view of the global information security trends and  outlook. It leverages data provided by Gartner, uncorrelated to the dedicated survey specifically  for NIS investments related to the implementation of the NIS Directive. The specific sources of  data for the following analysis include:   Gartner's IT Score for Security Management 2020 survey   Gartner IT Key Metrics Data 2020   Gartner forecast: IT security and Risk Management, Worldwide  It should be noted that the source of the data provided in chapter 2 (Gartner databases) is  different to the source of the data for chapter 3 (survey). Specifically:   The definitions of the industries in chapter 2 is not the same as the definitions of the  OES used in chapter 3. Moreover, data in chapter 2 also covers sectors that are not in  the NIS Directive.   The source of data in chapter 2 cover a broad EU Member State (MS) and  international scope, whereas data in chapter 3 was collected from OES in 5 MS  A detailed description of the relevant definitions is available in Annex B.  The reason this dataset is presented before the detailed data related to the NIS Directive  implementation is to provide a high level overview of the global market, including EU MS, in  terms of information security investments and highlight a few key statistics and trends. This  broader view serves as an introduction to the more focused analysis presented in  chapter 3 for OES and DSPs in the aforementioned EU Member States.  2.1 SECURITY BUDGETS  Data shows that the tracking and associated allocation of IT security budgets is still growing  within most organisations. Indeed, it is observed that 38% of surveyed organisations still do not  have a distinct security budget and 62% of organisations do not effectively communicate costs  associated to information security to business units and process owners.  Figure 1: Overview of budget issues  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  7  When looking at the ownership of Information security budgets and the lines of reporting, it can  be observed that information security is widely recognised as an IT discipline.  Figure 2: Ownership of Information security budgets and the lines of reporting  Data shows that organisations allocate a rather stable share of their IT budget to information  security, with a relevant portion of around 6% since 2016.  The decline in IT Security spend Vs Overall IT Budget actually reflects an accelerated growth of  Overall IT Budget vs IT Security spend resulting in a ‘negative’ proportional trend.  Organisations  allocate a rather  stable share  around 6% of  their IT budget to  information  security  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  8  Figure 3: Global IT security spending as a share of total IT budget  When comparing organisations from the EU to organisations from the United States of America,  data shows that EU organisations allocate on average 41% less to information security than  their American counterparts.  Figure 4: IT security spending as a share of total IT budget by geography  The below breakdown analysis per industry highlights major discrepancies between different  sectors. The three industries with the highest Information Security (IS) spend as a percentage of  their overall IT budgets are Banking, Financial Services and Pharmaceuticals organisations,  with a ratio higher than 5%. Transportation, Education and Retail are the sectors with the lowest  such ratios, all below 2,5%.2  2 As previously stated, the definition of the industries is not directly related to the definition of the sectors in the NIS  Directive used in chapter 3 of this report. The relevant definitions are available in Annex B.  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  9  Figure 5: IT security spending as a share of total IT budget by industry  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  10  2.2 INFORMATION SECURITY SPEND DISTRIBUTION  The analysis of the information security budget distribution across various information security  domains (see appendix for the definition of the information security domains) gives further  insights to the type of investment organisations are making3.  In summary:   Vulnerability management and security analytics investments focus on proactive  capabilities for minimising the impact of any breaches once they have occurred.   Application security is how the application was designed and developed, how it’s  operated, and how the application and its supporting elements (network, OS, database  etc.) are configured and deployed to ensure security.   Governance, risk, and compliance management (GRC) focuses on how organisations  deal with their unique set of risks by developing strategies, policies, standards and  awareness that underpin security services. GRC ensures that risk is managed openly  and effectively, that legal and regulatory compliance requirements are met and that  information security is embedded throughout the organisation   Network security, Identity and Access Management (IAM), endpoint security and data  security are part of the operational infrastructure security, which focuses on protecting  the network, hosts and data and on ensuring secure access to systems for authorised  users.  Data indicates that the top 3 domains in terms of spending are:   Vulnerability Management and Security Analytics with a share of 20%   Governance, Risks and Compliance (GRC) with a share of 18%   Network Security with a share of 17%  This distribution between the different functional areas has been quite stable over the last four  years, but, although quite similar when comparing organisations in the EU and US, varies  greatly between industries.  Figure 6: IT security spending distribution by functional area  3 Annex B provides detailed definitions for the security domains referenced in chapter 2.  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  11  In terms of asset class, it is observed that the main area of spending for information security is  Personnel (37%), followed by Software (27%) and Hardware (21%). The share of external  services such as advisory, outsourcing or cloud services is only 15%.  Figure 7: IT security spending distribution by asset class  8%  10%  11%  11%  16%  17%  18%  19%  19%  19%  22%  22%  22%  22%  25%  25%  28%  35%  39%  9%  5%  14%  23%  28%  11%  27%  18%  19%  19%  14%  19%  17%  19%  14%  20%  20%  25%  35%  20%  38%  28%  17%  11%  24%  10%  17%  17%  15%  20%  13%  15%  14%  10%  20%  24%  12%  3%  16%  10%  18%  26%  16%  11%  12%  13%  16%  16%  17%  14%  16%  13%  27%  5%  10%  5%  14%  14%  8%  9%  6%  11%  8%  15%  13%  9%  9%  6%  13%  12%  8%  6%  5%  6%  7%  3%  17%  23%  9%  10%  12%  18%  11%  12%  12%  15%  5%  11%  10%  14%  11%  20%  6%  12%  3%  16%  8%  12%  7%  7%  11%  7%  8%  9%  7%  16%  8%  8%  11%  7%  5%  6%  4%  3%  Electronics  Food and Beverage Processing  Government  Retail  Education  Utilities  Energy  Cross industry US avg  Cross industry EU avg  Manufacturing  Transportation  Banking & Financial Services  Professional Services  Resources  Government  CPG  Insurance  Pharmaceuticals  Software Publishing and Internet Services  Vulnerability  management  Governance,  Risks & Compliance  Network  Security  Application  Security  Identity &  access  management  Endpoint  Security  Data  Security  Source: Gartner ITKMD 2020 data, Scope: EU countries + UK and US for reference  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  12  2.3 INFORMATION SECURITY STAFFING  The demand for information security trained resources is very high and still growing. Many  organisations are facing real issues in hiring resources with the required skillset & experience.  As such, it is foreseen that the number of unfilled information security positions will reach 3.5  million globally by 2022, going up from 1 million in 2016.  Figure 8: Information Security Staffing  Even though the demand for security resources is already high and growing, due to the ongoing  scarcity of these resources in the market, the share of information security resources within the  overall IT staff does not increase.  As of 2020, information security staff represents 5,6% of total IT staff, measured in terms of  FTEs. (Information security personnel includes in-house and contract full-time equivalents  supporting the IT security domains).  Figure 9: Information Security FTEs as a share of total IT staff  On top of the overall lack of security resources, there is also a change in the security skills that  are in demand. This change directly reflects the increasing use of automation in information  security.  Skills that were in high demand in the previous years such as Manual Penetration Testing, Tier  1/2 SOC Analysis or Technology Management are now decreasing in value and are being  replaced by skills in Risk Management, Service Management, Incident Response, Threat  Intelligence, Data Science and Analysis or Coding.  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  13  Figure 10: Change the security skills demand  2.4 INFORMATION SECURITY MARKET OUTLOOK  Forecasted growth rates for 2020 through 2024 have recently been substantially revised in  alignment with the revised outlook driven by post-COVID-19 IT spending. Figure below shows  the overall information security and risk management spending and the compound annual  growth rate (CAGR) for 2019 through 2024.

Network Detection and Response  Cloud Access Security Brokers  Source: Gartner Forecast: IT security and Risk Management, Worldwide, 2019 - 2024, 3Q20 Update  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  14  The fastest growing security segment is Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASB), albeit being  one of the smallest security segments listed. The reason cloud security continues to grow, even  in these difficult economic times, is largely because of its role in digital transformation,  protecting data and user access to Software as a Service (SaaS) services. As organisations  look to support remote workers and continue to move business services to the cloud, CASB is a  key part of that security strategy.  Another security segment that is continuing to grow despite the current economic situation is the  Identity and Access Management segment, including four sub-segments: Access Management  (AM), Identity Governance and Administration (IGA), Privileged Access Management (PAM),  and User Authentication. Indeed, organisations need to provide secure access to their remote  workforce users, including IT users with privileged access. The use of cloud technologies has  also shifted the need from a perimeter-based approach to an identity and context-based  approach.  2.5 TRENDS ON SECURITY INCIDENTS LIABILITY  It is forecasted by Gartner that by 2024 liability for cyber physical systems (CPS)  incidents (impacting human safety or the environment) will break through the corporate  protective barrier to personal liability for 75% of CEOs.  Regulators and governments around the world are expected to strengthen laws and regulations  for CPS as they are viewed as critical systems where incidents can result in physical harm to  people, destruction of property or environmental disasters.  This trend may result CEOs no longer being able to hide behind complex corporate  organisational hierarchies, a potential ‘lack of knowledge’, processes, or insurance policies. This  will be the case particularly in asset-intensive, critical infrastructure and clinical healthcare  environments that extensively use CPS, or for organizations that sell CPS to others.  An example of this trend is the Corporate Executive Accountability Act introduced in the U.S.  Senate in 20194. This development would render CEOs liable for their companies' failure to  implement basic security measures that would have prevented a fatal CPS incident.  If not through a legal action, CEOs may find themselves responsible in front of the  shareholders. There already exists several recent examples: The Yahoo breach settlement5  opened the doors to company officers being directly sued by shareholders. The judge in the  legal proceedings following the Equifax breach refused to dismiss a suit against the former  company CEO6; a suit against the company Chegg and its CEO claiming they failed to disclose  a lack of security measures has been filed7; and Marriott International shareholders filed a  similar suit against that company’s officers8.  4 https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1010  5 https://www.natlawreview.com/article/court-approves-class-action-settlement-re-yahoo-inc-customer-data-security-breach  6 https://www.reuters.com/article/otc-equifax-frankel-idUSKCN1PN2TJ  7 https://in.reuters.com/article/dataprivacy-chegg/chegg-data-breach-lawsuit-heads-to-arbitration-idUSL2N2CG2JU  8 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-marriott-dataprotection-idUSKCN25F0S2  https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1010 https://www.natlawreview.com/article/court-approves-class-action-settlement-re-yahoo-inc-customer-data-security-breach https://www.reuters.com/article/otc-equifax-frankel-idUSKCN1PN2TJ https://in.reuters.com/article/dataprivacy-chegg/chegg-data-breach-lawsuit-heads-to-arbitration-idUSL2N2CG2JU https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-marriott-dataprotection-idUSKCN25F0S2  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  15  3. INFORMATION SECURITY  INVESTMENTS FOR THE NIS  DIRECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION  3.1 INFORMATION SECURITY SPEND IN THE NIS DIRECTIVE SECTORS  The surveyed organisations represent a large range of information technology budgets, ranging  from SMEs devoting less than 5 M€ to IT, to multinational corporations with more than one  billion euros of IT spending, reflecting the diversity of actors identified as OES and DSPs by  national authorities.

NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  18  3.2 NIS DIRECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION  3.2.1 Current state  As of November 2020, more than 80% of surveyed organisations declared that their NIS  Directive implementation program is either completed or in progress and 8% of surveyed  organisations plan to implement the NIS Directive but have not started yet.  For the 10% remaining that do not intend to launch a dedicated program or projects, less than  1% actually do not plan to implement the NIS Directive at all, while the rest will leverage some  of its key requirements to improve and guide their information security practices.  Figure 17: Current state of NIS Directive implementation among surveyed organisations  Minor differences can be observed when comparing the NIS Directive implementation status  between operators in different MS. An interesting find is that 10% of all surveyed organisations  are not following an NIS Directive implementation program but are using the NIS Directive as  best practice.  Figure 18: Current state of NIS Directive implementation per country  France 2,0% 7,8% 5,9% 17,6% 66,7%  Germany 0,0% 3,9% 5,9% 19,6% 70,6%  Italy 0,0% 8,0% 8,0% 20,0% 64,0%  Poland 0,0% 16,3% 10,2% 30,6% 42,9%  Spain 0,0% 14,0% 10,0% 28,0% 48,0%  Overall 0,4% 10,0% 8,0% 23,1% 58,6%  Not planned Leveraged as  best practices Planned  Work in  progress Completed  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  19  The analysis also shows additional differentiation between sectors as regards the  implementation of the NIS Directive. For instance, more than three quarters of surveyed  organisations in the Banking and Energy sectors have fully implemented the Directive, well  above the cross-sector average (58.8%).  Furthermore the percentage of surveyed organisations that declared they will not directly  implement the NIS Directive, but will instead leverage its principles as best practices, varies  substantially across the different sectors.

With 16,4% of organisations having started the implementation in 2020, there  remains an 8% of organisations that will implement the NIS Directive in the future, from 2021  onwards. Furthermore, the analysis shows that implementation projects of the NIS Directive  typically last between 14 and 18 months, with little differentiation between countries or sectors.  Over 75% of  surveyed  organisations in  the Banking and  Energy sectors  have fully  implemented the  Directive, well  above the cross-  sector average  (58.8%)  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  20  Figure 20: Duration of NIS Directive implementation program among surveyed organisations (in  months)  Figure 21: Start year of NIS Directive implementation program among surveyed organisations  Variance between countries in terms of project initiation start dates can be explained by timeline  differences in the transposition of the NIS Directive into national laws, including the publication  of detailed requirements9.  9 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive/nis-visualtool  12,4% (28)  18,7% (42)  35,1% (79)  25,8% (58)  8% (18)  0% (0)  Less than 12  12 - 14  14 - 16  16 - 18  18-20  More than 20  n = 225  Q: What are the start date and estimated duration of the NIS program or projects?

Such amounts typically  represent a low share of the organisations’ overall Information Security budgets.

Scope: Organizations with existing or planned NIS program  Disclaimer: for the following financial figures, it is important to bear in mind  the following limitations.   While low levels of investments cannot be sustained without adverse  impact on the information security readiness, higher spending does  not necessarily correlate with an associated improved maturity   Certain cybersecurity expenditures are not accurately captured  such as secure-by-design ICT products and services, that elevate the  overall security level of an organisation, but do not fall under  specialised security-related budgets  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  23  Figure 25: Dedicated NIS Directive budget per country  Outside of the 100-250 K€ central budget range, Energy OES seem to allocate larger sums to  NIS Directive programs compared to other sectors: nearly half of these OES allocate more than  250 K€, vs. less than 25% on the overall average of affected organisations.

Among those that did, ~29% filled that need by hiring  new staff, while the remainder had recourse to external contractors (20.4% of total  respondents).  Amongst organisations that employed additional staff to implement the NIS Directive, the  large majority recruited up to 4 people.  Figure 28: NIS Directive-related hires amongst surveyed organisations  This observation is valid across the EU MS in scope of the survey. Poland is the country where  the NIS Directive was mostly implemented with internal resources. On the other side,  organisations in Italy and France resorted more to new hires, while organisations in Germany  and Spain made a more intensive use of external contractors.

Conversely, organisations in the Cloud computing, Transport and Online marketplace sectors  appear to have relied the least on additional staff.

Irrespective of organisations’ current implementation state, the  challenges that were most cited were the following:   The prioritisation of other regulations e.g. GDPR.   The existence of stronger local regulations e.g. France’s “Loi de Programmation  Militaire” (LPM).   The lack of clarity of the NIS Directive expectations after transposition into national law.  However, as regards the organisations that do not have a dedicated NIS Directive  implementation project, then internal challenges rise to prominence: the lack of resources  (34.6% of such respondents), lack of skills (30.8%) or lack of collaboration (30.8%).  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  30  Figure 38: Main challenges in implementing the NIS Directive amongst surveyed organisations  For all countries in scope of the survey, the prioritisation of other regulations is the most  frequently cited challenge to implement the NIS Directive, with the exception of France, for  which organisations cited the existence of stronger regulations, such as the LPM.  The lack of clarity in the expectations of national competent authorities is also a relatively  common denominator in all countries, with around 30% of organisations on average citing it as  a challenge to implement the NIS Directive.

Note: Totals do not add up to 100% since multiple answers could be selected by survey respondents  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  31  For the large majority of sectors, other regulations pose the main challenge faced when  implementing the NIS Directive, whether due to their prioritisation or the existence of stronger  local rules / regulatory requirements.  A sizeable share of Digital infrastructure, Financial Market Infrastructure and to a lesser extent  Online Marketplace organisations state the scarcity of resources devoted to the NIS Directive as  challenge to its implementation.  Finally, the implications of the NIS Directive seem well grasped by Cloud computing  organisations, as less than one in ten cite it as a challenge to set up the Directive, compared to  nearly a third of all NIS affected organisations across the rest of the sectors.

This widespread adoption can be at least partly explained by the  relative low number of personnel involved: more than 70% of affected organisations allocate up  to 4 people to this task.

This  positive assessment can be found irrespective of the EU MS or the sector concerned.

CONCLUSIONS  The data collected and processed for this report produced a number of interesting findings  leading to some conclusions on the nature of NIS investments across different sectors and  countries, as well as how the relevant spend among EU OES and DSPs has been influenced  over the last few years by the NIS Directive. A summary of the main conclusions is presented  below.  When analysing information security spending in a global, cross-industry scale (section 2.1), it  can be observed that organisations average around 6% of their overall IT budget to  information security, a percentage that has remained fairly stable since 2016. Discrepancies  do exist when comparing organisations in different countries with EU organisations allocating  on average 41% less to information security than their American counterparts.  Discrepancies in information security spending are even more apparent between different  sectors with certain sectors investing in information security a percentage of their IT budget up  to 5-6 times higher than that invested by sectors with the lower information security spending  profiles.  Section 2.2 illustrates how the information security budgets are spent and reveals that the  average spending profile of EU and US organisations is very similar though spending can  significantly vary across different sectors. Solutions related to Vulnerability Management  and Analytics were found to comprise from 8% up to 35% of the organisations' overall  information security budget when comparing different sectors. Smaller variations of the relevant  percentage across sectors can be observed when looking at other information security products  and services, such as Identity and Access Management (7% - 15%) and Network Security (11%  - 28%). Section 2.4 presents the outlook of the information security market and identifies Cloud  Access Security Brokers (CASB) as the fastest growing security segment is, reflecting the  increased adoption of cloud in all sectors. Another key growing domain is Identity and Access  Management, including Access Management (AM), Identity Governance and Administration  (IGA), Privileged Access Management (PAM), and User Authentication. Indeed, organisations  need to provide secure access to their remote workforce users, including IT users with  privileged access, a requirement that has been further emphasised with the new modus  operandi resulting from the on-going pandemic.  Figure 7 shows that the main area of spending for information security is Personnel (37%),  followed by Software (27%) and Hardware (21%). In terms of personnel, as of 2020,  information security staff represents 5,6% of total IT staff, measured in terms of FTEs  (information security personnel includes in-house and contract full-time equivalents supporting  the IT security domains), as further detailed in section 2.3. While this percentage has remained  relatively stable over the past 5 years there has been a change in the security skills that are  in demand. Skills that were in high demand in previous years such as Manual Penetration  Testing, Tier 1/2 SOC Analysis or Technology Management are now decreasing in value and  are being replaced by skills in Risk Management, Service Management, Incident Response,  Threat Intelligence, Data Science and Analysis or Coding.  The EU organisations surveyed (OES and DSPs) declared a broad range of information security  budgets, ranging from less than 100 K€ to above 100 M€, with the highest percentage of  information security budget range among the surveyed organisations being 10 – 25 M€.  There is a strong correlation between overall IT budget and Information Security budget,  as organisations with a higher IT budget will also spend more in information security (section  3.1).  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  37  Section 3.2 presents additional information related to the NIS Directive implementation and  shows that, as of November 2020, more than 80% of surveyed organisations declared that  their NIS Directive implementation program is either completed or in progress and 8% of  surveyed organisations plan to implement the NIS Directive but have not started yet. When  comparing across the different sectors of the NIS Directive, some sectors appear to be more  relatively ahead in terms of its implementation. Furthermore the percentage of surveyed  organisations that declared they will not directly implement the NIS Directive, but will instead  leverage its principles as best practices, varies substantially across the different sectors. An  interesting find is that 10% of all surveyed organisations are not following an NIS Directive  implementation program but are using the NIS Directive as best practice. The start year of  the NIS Directive implementation program varies between the MS in scope of the survey, a fact  that can be attributed to different timelines in the transposition of the NIS Directive into national  laws. However, implementation projects of the NIS Directive typically last between 14 and  18 months, with little discrepancies between countries or sectors.  The average budget for NIS Directive implementation projects is approximately 175 K€,  with 42.7% of affected organisations allocating between 100 and 250 K€, representing a  relatively low share of the organisations' overall information security budgets (section 3.3.1).  This budget remains similar when examining across different MS but varies slightly when  comparing different sectors. The majority of organisations did not require additional staff to  implement the NIS Directive (50.7%). Among those that did, ~29% filled that need by hiring  new internal staff with the large majority recruiting up to 4 people. Discrepancies can be  observed both across different MS, as well as across sectors (section 3.3.2).  Data presented in section 3.4 shows that the most frequently cited domains impacted by the  NIS Directive implementation are Governance, Risks and Compliance (64.5%), Network  Security (48.6%) and Business Continuity Management (33.1%). NIS Directive investments  did not seem to focus on new technologies. The services most cited in the survey as NIS  investment targets were Security incident & event log collection (64%) and Security Awareness  & training (63.6%).  Section 3.5 indicates that almost all OES and DSPs surveyed reported having faced at least  one serious challenge while implementing the NIS Directive. Irrespective of organisations’  current implementation state, the challenges that were most cited were the prioritisation of  other regulations, the existence of stronger local regulations and the lack of clarity of the  NIS Directive expectations after transposition into national law. However, for organisations that  do not have a dedicated NIS Directive implementation project internal challenges such as the  lack of resources (34.6% of such respondents), lack of skills (30.8%) and lack of  collaboration (30.8%) appear to be most important. Overall, 82% of surveyed organisations  acknowledge a positive impact of the NIS Directive on their security program.  Finally, section 3.6 presents data collected on information security incidents. According to the  data, 81% of the surveyed organisations have established a mechanism to report  information security incidents to their national authority, with the majority of surveyed  organisations allocating up to 4 resources for incident reporting. Nearly 60% of surveyed  organisations reported major information security incidents with 43% of them having  experienced information security incidents with a direct financial impact up to 500 k€.  The data and accompanying analysis presented in this report offers some insights on NIS  investments among EU OES and DSPs and how these investments have been influenced by  the NIS Directive. Hopefully, this data will prove useful to policy makers at an EU and National  level to better understand the impact of the NIS Directive and its implementation and reflect  upon it to identify and focus future policy initiatives.  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  38  A ANNEX:  SURVEY DEMOGRAPHICS  This Annex present additional information on the demographics of the survey used to collect the  data presented in Chapter 3.  A.1 SELECTION OF MEMBER STATES TO FOCUS SURVEY  In order to secure a representative size of sample per country and respect the timeline  associated with this report, the survey was performed on five Member States (Germany,  France, Italy, Spain and Poland) selected based on the following criteria:   National GDP.   Estimated Information Security market size.   Number of declared organizations in the scope of the NIS Directive (see figure below).   Inclusion of one country representative of more recent Member States.

A.3 LOCATION OF SURVEYED ORGANISATIONS  Five Member States were selected for this survey: Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Poland.  They were selected with regards to the size of their information security market as well as the  number of OES and DSPs identified. The selection of surveyed organisations was designed to  respect a balanced geographical distribution between the selected countries.  Figure 50: Distribution of surveyed organisations by country of origin  A.4 SECTORS OF SURVEYED ORGANISATIONS  The selection criteria for surveyed organisation were designed to align as closely as possible  with the sectors in scope of the NIS Directive, namely:   Online Search Engine   Financial market infrastructures (trading venues, central counterparties)   Drinking water supply and distribution   Cloud computing   Digital infrastructures (internet exchange points, domain name system service  providers, top level domain name registries)   Online Marketplace   Energy (electricity, oil and gas)   Transport (air, rail, water and road)   Healthcare   Banking  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  40  Figure 51: Distribution of surveyed organisations per sector  A.5 STAFFING AND REVENUE OF SURVEYED ORGANISATIONS  No specific quotas were set as to the size or revenues of the surveyed organisations as long as  they were considered in scope of the NIS Directive.

Consequently, most of the individuals that were qualified to take part in the survey have direct  or indirect links with Information Security departments.  It should be noted that the prevalence of COO (Chief Operating Officer) among respondents  can be explained by the fact that in many organisations Information Technology falls under their  responsibility.

NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  47  B.3 SECURITY DOMAINS   Identity and Access Management is the discipline that enables the right individuals to  access the right resources at the right times and for the right reasons. It comprises a  set of practices, processes and technology responsible for the management of digital  identities and their associated access to resources. Specific IAM related activities are:  user account provisioning, password management, user access administration (e.g.,  changes in roles, position or status (JML)), directory integration, single sign-on (SSO),  Active Directory, remote access services, strong or multi factor authentication / two-  factor (2FA) / three-factor (3FA), hard and soft token based authentication services,  Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Federation type services, privileged user  management (PUM), Identity and access governance (IAG) (inclusive of the processes  for user access certification / re-certification, attestation, application access audits  etc.), and cloud based identity services (e.g., IDaaS).   Network Security comprises measures taken to protect a communication pathway  from unauthorized access to, and accidental or wilful interference with, regular  operations, and hence involves protecting computers and computer networks from  attack and infiltration. Network security provides network protection through the  restricting of network traffic, based on a set of policy defined rules. Network security  provides protection at key ingress and egress points in the form of perimeters,  segments and zones, typically defined and enforced by firewalls/NGFWs/firewall  administration, Wireless Access Firewalls (WAF)s / RASP, Network Intrusion Detection  & Prevention (NIDS and NIPS), Virtual Private Networking (VPN) concentrators,  Hardware Security Modules (HSMs), Proxy Servers, Secure Email and/or Web  Gateways, Unified Threat Management (UTM) appliances, Network Access Control  (NAC) services, and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection and prevention  services.   End Point Security is a set of capabilities and services provisioned across devices  and platforms to provide the required and expected level of protection against potential  compromise resulting from inappropriate configuration, use or attack(s). It covers the  security services, capabilities and associated management and support thereof used in  the protection of all end point devices such as desktops, servers, laptops and mobile  devices which users leverage to access corporate data and information. Specific  examples would typically include antivirus/anti-spyware/anti-malware software on PCs  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  48  and servers, mobile device management (MDM), device encryption and management,  Host Intrusion Detection & Prevention (HIPS), hardware-based protection (e.g.,  personal firewalls), advanced anti-malware and threat detection software and also any  physical security control in place for these assets (e.g., locks.)   Data Security ensures confidence in the ability of users, systems and business  processes to provide the required and expected level of protection from data  compromise or loss of data fidelity resulting from system compromise or failure, or  inappropriate user behaviour with regard to data in whatever stage of its lifecycle. It  focuses on confidentiality (to protect against unauthorized or inappropriate access),  integrity (to ensure data is not improperly changed or deleted), availability (to ensure  appropriate access to data for the right parties) and privacy (to assure personal  information is only used for the specific business purpose for which it was collected).  Typical data security protection capabilities include: data discovery & classification,  encryption/decryption of data \"at rest,” \"in motion\" or \"in use\" (incl. endpoint & bulk  storage data encryption/decryption), digital certificate lifecycle management for digital  signature based services, privacy enforcement techniques (data masking), database  audit and protection (DAP) techniques, data loss prevention (DLP) services and data  destruction, removal and erasure type services.   Vulnerability Management is the process cycle for finding, assessing, remediating  and mitigating security weaknesses. It comprises the policy and scope definition,  proactive identification, remediation, mitigation and ongoing monitoring of security  vulnerabilities via dedicated vulnerability assessment and management products and  services. These services typically scan enterprise networks (IP ranges) and establish a  baseline and trending of vulnerability status of devices, applications and databases;  identify and report on the security configuration of IT assets; discover unmanaged  assets; support specific compliance reporting and control frameworks; support risk  assessment and remediation prioritization; and support remediation by IT operations  groups which involves scanning (through resident agents on network-attached devices)  of all internal and external facing target applications or devices for vulnerabilities, to  determine if they are at latest available historic patch level. Service typically also  includes periodic penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, asset auto discovery,  generation of patch and vulnerability status compliance reports, vulnerability  monitoring, and ticket raising.   Security Analytics comprises the ability of the security program via technologies,  processes and people to identify, define, react and remediate against potential or  current or active attacks and the associated threat actors, that may result in system or  service compromise, breaches or data loss events. It is essentially a set of services  delivered by a Security Operations Centre (SOC) or equivalent capability consisting of  a centralized focal point of security specialists where enterprise information systems  (websites, applications, databases, data centres and servers, networks, desktops and  other endpoints) are monitored, assessed, and defended, and action plans devised to  counter any undesirable events detected. Typical security analytics services include  security incident and event log collection, monitoring and management (SIEM),  managed log retention & analysis, user behaviour analytics (UBA), threat intelligence  services, fraud detection and response services, digital forensics and cyber incident  response services.   Application Security describes the use of software, hardware, staff and process  methods to provide through life application protection from threats. It therefore  comprises a set of measures built into the application development process to prevent  the unauthorized access, theft, modification of or erasure of sensitive data through the  exploitation of applications. Specific examples include: the identification of security  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  49  flaws in application design, development, deployment, upgrade, or maintenance  through code assurance techniques such as black box analysis and testing, health  checks, the use of static & dynamic application testing techniques (SAST/DAST/IAST)  and application security frameworks, and/or via data obfuscation, filtering & masking,  secure coding practices and software composition analysis (SCA) etc.   Governance, Risk, and Compliance Management (GRC) in general comprises the  set of practices and processes, supported by a risk-aware culture and enabling  technologies, that improves decision-making and performance through an integrated  view of how well an organization manages its unique set of risks.  – Security Governance is thus defined as a number of \"cross-functional\" security  activities which include the development and maintenance of security policies,  standards & procedures, the communication of business values, culture &  principles, security strategy & organization, training & awareness, documentation  & guidance, communication plans, security service metrics, audit and compliance  oversight, financial management of security services, security vendor  management, security PMO etc. obligations. Governance costs and staffing  include the strategic leadership of security standards, policies and practices, as  typically represented by the Chief IT security Officer (CISO) or equivalent, and his  immediate office.  – Risk Management is defined as the function dedicated to ensuring that adequate  controls are designed and implemented to mitigate the various risks associated  with IT assets (including data), infrastructure, and processes. It includes activities  such as periodic and annual IT audits (non-regulatory), risk assessment /  monitoring, issue management & action tracking, and the development and  execution of remediation plans.  – Compliance Management is the process of identifying, managing and reporting  compliance activities related to organizational, commercial and regulatory  compliance obligations. Compliance requirements can be derived from internal  directives, procedures and requirements, or from external laws, regulations,  standards and contractual agreements.  B.4 SECURITY ASSET TYPES   Hardware is defined as:  – All dedicated hardware assets utilized in support of the Security operations, for  each category indicated (i.e., Network Security, Endpoint Security etc.).  – Examples include firewalls, security gateways, security appliances, security toolset  platforms and ID tokens, etc.  – Include only annual asset costs that are directly or recognizably related to the  defined in-scope security functions. Do not include costs of hardware assets  whose prime purpose is not security. For example, there may be routers deployed  that have firewall, encryption or NIPS capabilities, but you must not include any  apportionment of their annual costs unless you can identify a cost to specifically  enable a security function - such as a firewall \"add-on\" enabler cost of extra router  hardware or software.  – Hosting / facilities / occupancy costs for space dedicated to in-scope security  hardware such as the apportioned annual costs of hosting security-related  devices, storage arrays and appliances in the data center, including power/heat  management and raised floor. It also includes the annual cost of any consumables  related to the security activities.  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  50   Software is defined as:  – Annual license and maintenance as well as costs associated with new purchases  and upgrades for all software dedicated to operating or managing the security  systems applications for each category of security expenditure.  – Examples include endpoint security suites, identity and access management,  security information and event management, content filtering, etc.  – Only software license costs that are directly or recognizably related to the defined  in-scope security functions are included. Costs of software whose prime purpose  is NOT security are excluded.  – For example, there may be enterprise licenses for OS, productivity suite software  or enterprise packages that have security capabilities (e.g., BitLocker encryption in  WinOS). No apportionment of their annual costs are included unless a cost to  specifically enable a security function can be identified. An example would be an  \"add-on\" software charge for a security capability, or a specific module license  charge for security functionality (e.g., Oracle Identity Manager)   Outsourcing is defined as:  – Outsourcing is the use of external service providers to effectively deliver IT-  enabled business process, application service and infrastructure solutions for  business outcomes. Outsourcing, which also includes utility services, and cloud-  enabled outsourcing, helps clients to develop the right sourcing strategies and  vision, select the right IT service providers, structure the best possible contracts,  and govern deals for sustainable win-win relationships with external providers.  Outsourcing can enable enterprises to reduce costs, accelerate time to market,  and take advantage of external expertise, assets and/or intellectual property.

One of the three pillars of the  NIS Directive is the implementation of risk management and reporting obligations for Operators  of Essential Services (OES) and Digital Service Providers (DSP).  Four years after the NIS Directive entered into force and two years after the transposition by  Member States into their national laws, this report presents the findings of a survey of 251  organisations across five EU Member States (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Poland) with  regards to NIS investments. The report depicts and analyses how OES and DSPs spend their  information security budget and provides indications as to how this spending has been  influenced by the introduction of the NIS Directive. The results of this NIS survey were  correlated with Gartner security data and insights observed globally and in the EU in order to  better understand the current NIS Directive adoption dynamics and impact on related  investments.  This report provides comprehensive data and insights regarding the NIS Directive  adoption and the effects on the information security budget, staffing, solutions adoption  and security posture of organisations within its scope.  Overall, 82% of surveyed organisations acknowledge a positive impact of the NIS  Directive on their information security.  Regarding the NIS Directive implementation, the collected data revealed the following:   More than 80% of surveyed organisations declared that their NIS Directive  implementation program is either completed or in progress. The average NIS  implementation program is between 14 and 18 months   The average budget for NIS Directive implementation projects is approximately 175  K€, with 42.7% of affected organisations allocating between 100 and 250 K€. A little  under 50% of surveyed organisations had to hire additional security matter experts  (both internally and through staff augmentation), in the majority of cases hiring up to 4  FTEs   Surveyed organisations prioritised the following security domains: Governance, Risk  and Compliance (GRC), Network Security, Business Continuity Management (BCM)  and Vulnerability Management (VM).   When implementing the NIS Directive, 64% of surveyed organisations procured  security incident & event log collection solutions, as well as security awareness &  training services.   “Unclear expectations” and “Limited support from the national authority” are among the  top challenges faced by surveyed organisations when implementing the NIS Directive.   81% of the surveyed organisations have established a mechanism to report  information security incidents to their national authority, with the majority of surveyed  organisations allocating up to 4 people for incident reporting.   Nearly 60% of surveyed organisations reported major information security incidents.   43% of surveyed organisations experienced information security incidents with a direct  financial impact up to 500 k€.  82% of surveyed  organisations  acknowledge a  positive impact  of the NIS  Directive on their  information  security  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  5  1. INTRODUCTION  The Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NIS Directive)1 represents  the first EU-wide legislation on cybersecurity, with the objective to achieve a high common level  of cybersecurity for all EU Member States. One of the three pillars of the NIS Directive is the  implementation of risk management and reporting obligations for Operators of Essential  Services (OES) and Digital Service Providers (DSP). Annex II and Annex III of the NIS Directive  identify the following categories of operators / sectors as OES and DSPs respectively:  Table 1: Categories of OES and DSPs as defined in the NIS Directive  Categories of OES and DSPs  OES DSPs   Energy (electricity, oil and gas)   Transport (air, rail, water and road)   Banking   Financial market infrastructures   Health   Drinking water supply and distribution   Digital infrastructure   Online marketplace   Online search engine   Cloud computing service  The objective of this report is to document how operators in these sectors invest in  cybersecurity and how the implementation of the NIS Directive has influenced this investment.  NIS investment data for this report was collected from two sources:   High-level insights on the EU cybersecurity market were drawn from Gartner’s  Research databases, combined with additional analysis of the current market  dynamics and latest forecasts.   To collect specific data on the NIS Directive, an ad hoc survey was conducted on  250+ European organisations identified as OES or DSPs  Surveyed organisations originated from five Member States chosen due to the size of their  information security market as well as the number of OES and DSPs declared: Germany,  France, Italy, Spain and Poland. Additional information on the methodology, rationale for  selecting these 5 MS and additional survey demographics is available in Annex A.  The target audience of this report are EU and National policy makers. As a secondary  audience, this report may provide useful information to OES and DSPs as well.  1 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  6  2. INFORMATION SECURITY  DYNAMICS AND OUTLOOK  This chapter aims to provide a high-level view of the global information security trends and  outlook. It leverages data provided by Gartner, uncorrelated to the dedicated survey specifically  for NIS investments related to the implementation of the NIS Directive. The specific sources of  data for the following analysis include:   Gartner's IT Score for Security Management 2020 survey   Gartner IT Key Metrics Data 2020   Gartner forecast: IT security and Risk Management, Worldwide  It should be noted that the source of the data provided in chapter 2 (Gartner databases) is  different to the source of the data for chapter 3 (survey). Specifically:   The definitions of the industries in chapter 2 is not the same as the definitions of the  OES used in chapter 3. Moreover, data in chapter 2 also covers sectors that are not in  the NIS Directive.   The source of data in chapter 2 cover a broad EU Member State (MS) and  international scope, whereas data in chapter 3 was collected from OES in 5 MS  A detailed description of the relevant definitions is available in Annex B.  The reason this dataset is presented before the detailed data related to the NIS Directive  implementation is to provide a high level overview of the global market, including EU MS, in  terms of information security investments and highlight a few key statistics and trends. This  broader view serves as an introduction to the more focused analysis presented in  chapter 3 for OES and DSPs in the aforementioned EU Member States.  2.1 SECURITY BUDGETS  Data shows that the tracking and associated allocation of IT security budgets is still growing  within most organisations. Indeed, it is observed that 38% of surveyed organisations still do not  have a distinct security budget and 62% of organisations do not effectively communicate costs  associated to information security to business units and process owners.  Figure 1: Overview of budget issues  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  7  When looking at the ownership of Information security budgets and the lines of reporting, it can  be observed that information security is widely recognised as an IT discipline.  Figure 2: Ownership of Information security budgets and the lines of reporting  Data shows that organisations allocate a rather stable share of their IT budget to information  security, with a relevant portion of around 6% since 2016.  The decline in IT Security spend Vs Overall IT Budget actually reflects an accelerated growth of  Overall IT Budget vs IT Security spend resulting in a ‘negative’ proportional trend.  Organisations  allocate a rather  stable share  around 6% of  their IT budget to  information  security  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  8  Figure 3: Global IT security spending as a share of total IT budget  When comparing organisations from the EU to organisations from the United States of America,  data shows that EU organisations allocate on average 41% less to information security than  their American counterparts.  Figure 4: IT security spending as a share of total IT budget by geography  The below breakdown analysis per industry highlights major discrepancies between different  sectors. The three industries with the highest Information Security (IS) spend as a percentage of  their overall IT budgets are Banking, Financial Services and Pharmaceuticals organisations,  with a ratio higher than 5%. Transportation, Education and Retail are the sectors with the lowest  such ratios, all below 2,5%.2  2 As previously stated, the definition of the industries is not directly related to the definition of the sectors in the NIS  Directive used in chapter 3 of this report. The relevant definitions are available in Annex B.  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  9  Figure 5: IT security spending as a share of total IT budget by industry  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  10  2.2 INFORMATION SECURITY SPEND DISTRIBUTION  The analysis of the information security budget distribution across various information security  domains (see appendix for the definition of the information security domains) gives further  insights to the type of investment organisations are making3.  In summary:   Vulnerability management and security analytics investments focus on proactive  capabilities for minimising the impact of any breaches once they have occurred.   Application security is how the application was designed and developed, how it’s  operated, and how the application and its supporting elements (network, OS, database  etc.) are configured and deployed to ensure security.   Governance, risk, and compliance management (GRC) focuses on how organisations  deal with their unique set of risks by developing strategies, policies, standards and  awareness that underpin security services. GRC ensures that risk is managed openly  and effectively, that legal and regulatory compliance requirements are met and that  information security is embedded throughout the organisation   Network security, Identity and Access Management (IAM), endpoint security and data  security are part of the operational infrastructure security, which focuses on protecting  the network, hosts and data and on ensuring secure access to systems for authorised  users.  Data indicates that the top 3 domains in terms of spending are:   Vulnerability Management and Security Analytics with a share of 20%   Governance, Risks and Compliance (GRC) with a share of 18%   Network Security with a share of 17%  This distribution between the different functional areas has been quite stable over the last four  years, but, although quite similar when comparing organisations in the EU and US, varies  greatly between industries.  Figure 6: IT security spending distribution by functional area  3 Annex B provides detailed definitions for the security domains referenced in chapter 2.  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  11  In terms of asset class, it is observed that the main area of spending for information security is  Personnel (37%), followed by Software (27%) and Hardware (21%). The share of external  services such as advisory, outsourcing or cloud services is only 15%.  Figure 7: IT security spending distribution by asset class  8%  10%  11%  11%  16%  17%  18%  19%  19%  19%  22%  22%  22%  22%  25%  25%  28%  35%  39%  9%  5%  14%  23%  28%  11%  27%  18%  19%  19%  14%  19%  17%  19%  14%  20%  20%  25%  35%  20%  38%  28%  17%  11%  24%  10%  17%  17%  15%  20%  13%  15%  14%  10%  20%  24%  12%  3%  16%  10%  18%  26%  16%  11%  12%  13%  16%  16%  17%  14%  16%  13%  27%  5%  10%  5%  14%  14%  8%  9%  6%  11%  8%  15%  13%  9%  9%  6%  13%  12%  8%  6%  5%  6%  7%  3%  17%  23%  9%  10%  12%  18%  11%  12%  12%  15%  5%  11%  10%  14%  11%  20%  6%  12%  3%  16%  8%  12%  7%  7%  11%  7%  8%  9%  7%  16%  8%  8%  11%  7%  5%  6%  4%  3%  Electronics  Food and Beverage Processing  Government  Retail  Education  Utilities  Energy  Cross industry US avg  Cross industry EU avg  Manufacturing  Transportation  Banking & Financial Services  Professional Services  Resources  Government  CPG  Insurance  Pharmaceuticals  Software Publishing and Internet Services  Vulnerability  management  Governance,  Risks & Compliance  Network  Security  Application  Security  Identity &  access  management  Endpoint  Security  Data  Security  Source: Gartner ITKMD 2020 data, Scope: EU countries + UK and US for reference  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  12  2.3 INFORMATION SECURITY STAFFING  The demand for information security trained resources is very high and still growing. Many  organisations are facing real issues in hiring resources with the required skillset & experience.  As such, it is foreseen that the number of unfilled information security positions will reach 3.5  million globally by 2022, going up from 1 million in 2016.  Figure 8: Information Security Staffing  Even though the demand for security resources is already high and growing, due to the ongoing  scarcity of these resources in the market, the share of information security resources within the  overall IT staff does not increase.  As of 2020, information security staff represents 5,6% of total IT staff, measured in terms of  FTEs. (Information security personnel includes in-house and contract full-time equivalents  supporting the IT security domains).  Figure 9: Information Security FTEs as a share of total IT staff  On top of the overall lack of security resources, there is also a change in the security skills that  are in demand. This change directly reflects the increasing use of automation in information  security.  Skills that were in high demand in the previous years such as Manual Penetration Testing, Tier  1/2 SOC Analysis or Technology Management are now decreasing in value and are being  replaced by skills in Risk Management, Service Management, Incident Response, Threat  Intelligence, Data Science and Analysis or Coding.  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  13  Figure 10: Change the security skills demand  2.4 INFORMATION SECURITY MARKET OUTLOOK  Forecasted growth rates for 2020 through 2024 have recently been substantially revised in  alignment with the revised outlook driven by post-COVID-19 IT spending. Figure below shows  the overall information security and risk management spending and the compound annual  growth rate (CAGR) for 2019 through 2024.

Network Detection and Response  Cloud Access Security Brokers  Source: Gartner Forecast: IT security and Risk Management, Worldwide, 2019 - 2024, 3Q20 Update  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  14  The fastest growing security segment is Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASB), albeit being  one of the smallest security segments listed. The reason cloud security continues to grow, even  in these difficult economic times, is largely because of its role in digital transformation,  protecting data and user access to Software as a Service (SaaS) services. As organisations  look to support remote workers and continue to move business services to the cloud, CASB is a  key part of that security strategy.  Another security segment that is continuing to grow despite the current economic situation is the  Identity and Access Management segment, including four sub-segments: Access Management  (AM), Identity Governance and Administration (IGA), Privileged Access Management (PAM),  and User Authentication. Indeed, organisations need to provide secure access to their remote  workforce users, including IT users with privileged access. The use of cloud technologies has  also shifted the need from a perimeter-based approach to an identity and context-based  approach.  2.5 TRENDS ON SECURITY INCIDENTS LIABILITY  It is forecasted by Gartner that by 2024 liability for cyber physical systems (CPS)  incidents (impacting human safety or the environment) will break through the corporate  protective barrier to personal liability for 75% of CEOs.  Regulators and governments around the world are expected to strengthen laws and regulations  for CPS as they are viewed as critical systems where incidents can result in physical harm to  people, destruction of property or environmental disasters.  This trend may result CEOs no longer being able to hide behind complex corporate  organisational hierarchies, a potential ‘lack of knowledge’, processes, or insurance policies. This  will be the case particularly in asset-intensive, critical infrastructure and clinical healthcare  environments that extensively use CPS, or for organizations that sell CPS to others.  An example of this trend is the Corporate Executive Accountability Act introduced in the U.S.  Senate in 20194. This development would render CEOs liable for their companies' failure to  implement basic security measures that would have prevented a fatal CPS incident.  If not through a legal action, CEOs may find themselves responsible in front of the  shareholders. There already exists several recent examples: The Yahoo breach settlement5  opened the doors to company officers being directly sued by shareholders. The judge in the  legal proceedings following the Equifax breach refused to dismiss a suit against the former  company CEO6; a suit against the company Chegg and its CEO claiming they failed to disclose  a lack of security measures has been filed7; and Marriott International shareholders filed a  similar suit against that company’s officers8.  4 https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1010  5 https://www.natlawreview.com/article/court-approves-class-action-settlement-re-yahoo-inc-customer-data-security-breach  6 https://www.reuters.com/article/otc-equifax-frankel-idUSKCN1PN2TJ  7 https://in.reuters.com/article/dataprivacy-chegg/chegg-data-breach-lawsuit-heads-to-arbitration-idUSL2N2CG2JU  8 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-marriott-dataprotection-idUSKCN25F0S2  https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1010 https://www.natlawreview.com/article/court-approves-class-action-settlement-re-yahoo-inc-customer-data-security-breach https://www.reuters.com/article/otc-equifax-frankel-idUSKCN1PN2TJ https://in.reuters.com/article/dataprivacy-chegg/chegg-data-breach-lawsuit-heads-to-arbitration-idUSL2N2CG2JU https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-marriott-dataprotection-idUSKCN25F0S2  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  15  3. INFORMATION SECURITY  INVESTMENTS FOR THE NIS  DIRECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION  3.1 INFORMATION SECURITY SPEND IN THE NIS DIRECTIVE SECTORS  The surveyed organisations represent a large range of information technology budgets, ranging  from SMEs devoting less than 5 M€ to IT, to multinational corporations with more than one  billion euros of IT spending, reflecting the diversity of actors identified as OES and DSPs by  national authorities.

NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  18  3.2 NIS DIRECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION  3.2.1 Current state  As of November 2020, more than 80% of surveyed organisations declared that their NIS  Directive implementation program is either completed or in progress and 8% of surveyed  organisations plan to implement the NIS Directive but have not started yet.  For the 10% remaining that do not intend to launch a dedicated program or projects, less than  1% actually do not plan to implement the NIS Directive at all, while the rest will leverage some  of its key requirements to improve and guide their information security practices.  Figure 17: Current state of NIS Directive implementation among surveyed organisations  Minor differences can be observed when comparing the NIS Directive implementation status  between operators in different MS. An interesting find is that 10% of all surveyed organisations  are not following an NIS Directive implementation program but are using the NIS Directive as  best practice.  Figure 18: Current state of NIS Directive implementation per country  France 2,0% 7,8% 5,9% 17,6% 66,7%  Germany 0,0% 3,9% 5,9% 19,6% 70,6%  Italy 0,0% 8,0% 8,0% 20,0% 64,0%  Poland 0,0% 16,3% 10,2% 30,6% 42,9%  Spain 0,0% 14,0% 10,0% 28,0% 48,0%  Overall 0,4% 10,0% 8,0% 23,1% 58,6%  Not planned Leveraged as  best practices Planned  Work in  progress Completed  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  19  The analysis also shows additional differentiation between sectors as regards the  implementation of the NIS Directive. For instance, more than three quarters of surveyed  organisations in the Banking and Energy sectors have fully implemented the Directive, well  above the cross-sector average (58.8%).  Furthermore the percentage of surveyed organisations that declared they will not directly  implement the NIS Directive, but will instead leverage its principles as best practices, varies  substantially across the different sectors.

With 16,4% of organisations having started the implementation in 2020, there  remains an 8% of organisations that will implement the NIS Directive in the future, from 2021  onwards. Furthermore, the analysis shows that implementation projects of the NIS Directive  typically last between 14 and 18 months, with little differentiation between countries or sectors.  Over 75% of  surveyed  organisations in  the Banking and  Energy sectors  have fully  implemented the  Directive, well  above the cross-  sector average  (58.8%)  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  20  Figure 20: Duration of NIS Directive implementation program among surveyed organisations (in  months)  Figure 21: Start year of NIS Directive implementation program among surveyed organisations  Variance between countries in terms of project initiation start dates can be explained by timeline  differences in the transposition of the NIS Directive into national laws, including the publication  of detailed requirements9.  9 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive/nis-visualtool  12,4% (28)  18,7% (42)  35,1% (79)  25,8% (58)  8% (18)  0% (0)  Less than 12  12 - 14  14 - 16  16 - 18  18-20  More than 20  n = 225  Q: What are the start date and estimated duration of the NIS program or projects?

Such amounts typically  represent a low share of the organisations’ overall Information Security budgets.

Scope: Organizations with existing or planned NIS program  Disclaimer: for the following financial figures, it is important to bear in mind  the following limitations.   While low levels of investments cannot be sustained without adverse  impact on the information security readiness, higher spending does  not necessarily correlate with an associated improved maturity   Certain cybersecurity expenditures are not accurately captured  such as secure-by-design ICT products and services, that elevate the  overall security level of an organisation, but do not fall under  specialised security-related budgets  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  23  Figure 25: Dedicated NIS Directive budget per country  Outside of the 100-250 K€ central budget range, Energy OES seem to allocate larger sums to  NIS Directive programs compared to other sectors: nearly half of these OES allocate more than  250 K€, vs. less than 25% on the overall average of affected organisations.

Among those that did, ~29% filled that need by hiring  new staff, while the remainder had recourse to external contractors (20.4% of total  respondents).  Amongst organisations that employed additional staff to implement the NIS Directive, the  large majority recruited up to 4 people.  Figure 28: NIS Directive-related hires amongst surveyed organisations  This observation is valid across the EU MS in scope of the survey. Poland is the country where  the NIS Directive was mostly implemented with internal resources. On the other side,  organisations in Italy and France resorted more to new hires, while organisations in Germany  and Spain made a more intensive use of external contractors.

Conversely, organisations in the Cloud computing, Transport and Online marketplace sectors  appear to have relied the least on additional staff.

Irrespective of organisations’ current implementation state, the  challenges that were most cited were the following:   The prioritisation of other regulations e.g. GDPR.   The existence of stronger local regulations e.g. France’s “Loi de Programmation  Militaire” (LPM).   The lack of clarity of the NIS Directive expectations after transposition into national law.  However, as regards the organisations that do not have a dedicated NIS Directive  implementation project, then internal challenges rise to prominence: the lack of resources  (34.6% of such respondents), lack of skills (30.8%) or lack of collaboration (30.8%).  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  30  Figure 38: Main challenges in implementing the NIS Directive amongst surveyed organisations  For all countries in scope of the survey, the prioritisation of other regulations is the most  frequently cited challenge to implement the NIS Directive, with the exception of France, for  which organisations cited the existence of stronger regulations, such as the LPM.  The lack of clarity in the expectations of national competent authorities is also a relatively  common denominator in all countries, with around 30% of organisations on average citing it as  a challenge to implement the NIS Directive.

Note: Totals do not add up to 100% since multiple answers could be selected by survey respondents  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  31  For the large majority of sectors, other regulations pose the main challenge faced when  implementing the NIS Directive, whether due to their prioritisation or the existence of stronger  local rules / regulatory requirements.  A sizeable share of Digital infrastructure, Financial Market Infrastructure and to a lesser extent  Online Marketplace organisations state the scarcity of resources devoted to the NIS Directive as  challenge to its implementation.  Finally, the implications of the NIS Directive seem well grasped by Cloud computing  organisations, as less than one in ten cite it as a challenge to set up the Directive, compared to  nearly a third of all NIS affected organisations across the rest of the sectors.

This widespread adoption can be at least partly explained by the  relative low number of personnel involved: more than 70% of affected organisations allocate up  to 4 people to this task.

This  positive assessment can be found irrespective of the EU MS or the sector concerned.

CONCLUSIONS  The data collected and processed for this report produced a number of interesting findings  leading to some conclusions on the nature of NIS investments across different sectors and  countries, as well as how the relevant spend among EU OES and DSPs has been influenced  over the last few years by the NIS Directive. A summary of the main conclusions is presented  below.  When analysing information security spending in a global, cross-industry scale (section 2.1), it  can be observed that organisations average around 6% of their overall IT budget to  information security, a percentage that has remained fairly stable since 2016. Discrepancies  do exist when comparing organisations in different countries with EU organisations allocating  on average 41% less to information security than their American counterparts.  Discrepancies in information security spending are even more apparent between different  sectors with certain sectors investing in information security a percentage of their IT budget up  to 5-6 times higher than that invested by sectors with the lower information security spending  profiles.  Section 2.2 illustrates how the information security budgets are spent and reveals that the  average spending profile of EU and US organisations is very similar though spending can  significantly vary across different sectors. Solutions related to Vulnerability Management  and Analytics were found to comprise from 8% up to 35% of the organisations' overall  information security budget when comparing different sectors. Smaller variations of the relevant  percentage across sectors can be observed when looking at other information security products  and services, such as Identity and Access Management (7% - 15%) and Network Security (11%  - 28%). Section 2.4 presents the outlook of the information security market and identifies Cloud  Access Security Brokers (CASB) as the fastest growing security segment is, reflecting the  increased adoption of cloud in all sectors. Another key growing domain is Identity and Access  Management, including Access Management (AM), Identity Governance and Administration  (IGA), Privileged Access Management (PAM), and User Authentication. Indeed, organisations  need to provide secure access to their remote workforce users, including IT users with  privileged access, a requirement that has been further emphasised with the new modus  operandi resulting from the on-going pandemic.  Figure 7 shows that the main area of spending for information security is Personnel (37%),  followed by Software (27%) and Hardware (21%). In terms of personnel, as of 2020,  information security staff represents 5,6% of total IT staff, measured in terms of FTEs  (information security personnel includes in-house and contract full-time equivalents supporting  the IT security domains), as further detailed in section 2.3. While this percentage has remained  relatively stable over the past 5 years there has been a change in the security skills that are  in demand. Skills that were in high demand in previous years such as Manual Penetration  Testing, Tier 1/2 SOC Analysis or Technology Management are now decreasing in value and  are being replaced by skills in Risk Management, Service Management, Incident Response,  Threat Intelligence, Data Science and Analysis or Coding.  The EU organisations surveyed (OES and DSPs) declared a broad range of information security  budgets, ranging from less than 100 K€ to above 100 M€, with the highest percentage of  information security budget range among the surveyed organisations being 10 – 25 M€.  There is a strong correlation between overall IT budget and Information Security budget,  as organisations with a higher IT budget will also spend more in information security (section  3.1).  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  37  Section 3.2 presents additional information related to the NIS Directive implementation and  shows that, as of November 2020, more than 80% of surveyed organisations declared that  their NIS Directive implementation program is either completed or in progress and 8% of  surveyed organisations plan to implement the NIS Directive but have not started yet. When  comparing across the different sectors of the NIS Directive, some sectors appear to be more  relatively ahead in terms of its implementation. Furthermore the percentage of surveyed  organisations that declared they will not directly implement the NIS Directive, but will instead  leverage its principles as best practices, varies substantially across the different sectors. An  interesting find is that 10% of all surveyed organisations are not following an NIS Directive  implementation program but are using the NIS Directive as best practice. The start year of  the NIS Directive implementation program varies between the MS in scope of the survey, a fact  that can be attributed to different timelines in the transposition of the NIS Directive into national  laws. However, implementation projects of the NIS Directive typically last between 14 and  18 months, with little discrepancies between countries or sectors.  The average budget for NIS Directive implementation projects is approximately 175 K€,  with 42.7% of affected organisations allocating between 100 and 250 K€, representing a  relatively low share of the organisations' overall information security budgets (section 3.3.1).  This budget remains similar when examining across different MS but varies slightly when  comparing different sectors. The majority of organisations did not require additional staff to  implement the NIS Directive (50.7%). Among those that did, ~29% filled that need by hiring  new internal staff with the large majority recruiting up to 4 people. Discrepancies can be  observed both across different MS, as well as across sectors (section 3.3.2).  Data presented in section 3.4 shows that the most frequently cited domains impacted by the  NIS Directive implementation are Governance, Risks and Compliance (64.5%), Network  Security (48.6%) and Business Continuity Management (33.1%). NIS Directive investments  did not seem to focus on new technologies. The services most cited in the survey as NIS  investment targets were Security incident & event log collection (64%) and Security Awareness  & training (63.6%).  Section 3.5 indicates that almost all OES and DSPs surveyed reported having faced at least  one serious challenge while implementing the NIS Directive. Irrespective of organisations’  current implementation state, the challenges that were most cited were the prioritisation of  other regulations, the existence of stronger local regulations and the lack of clarity of the  NIS Directive expectations after transposition into national law. However, for organisations that  do not have a dedicated NIS Directive implementation project internal challenges such as the  lack of resources (34.6% of such respondents), lack of skills (30.8%) and lack of  collaboration (30.8%) appear to be most important. Overall, 82% of surveyed organisations  acknowledge a positive impact of the NIS Directive on their security program.  Finally, section 3.6 presents data collected on information security incidents. According to the  data, 81% of the surveyed organisations have established a mechanism to report  information security incidents to their national authority, with the majority of surveyed  organisations allocating up to 4 resources for incident reporting. Nearly 60% of surveyed  organisations reported major information security incidents with 43% of them having  experienced information security incidents with a direct financial impact up to 500 k€.  The data and accompanying analysis presented in this report offers some insights on NIS  investments among EU OES and DSPs and how these investments have been influenced by  the NIS Directive. Hopefully, this data will prove useful to policy makers at an EU and National  level to better understand the impact of the NIS Directive and its implementation and reflect  upon it to identify and focus future policy initiatives.  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  38  A ANNEX:  SURVEY DEMOGRAPHICS  This Annex present additional information on the demographics of the survey used to collect the  data presented in Chapter 3.  A.1 SELECTION OF MEMBER STATES TO FOCUS SURVEY  In order to secure a representative size of sample per country and respect the timeline  associated with this report, the survey was performed on five Member States (Germany,  France, Italy, Spain and Poland) selected based on the following criteria:   National GDP.   Estimated Information Security market size.   Number of declared organizations in the scope of the NIS Directive (see figure below).   Inclusion of one country representative of more recent Member States.

A.3 LOCATION OF SURVEYED ORGANISATIONS  Five Member States were selected for this survey: Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Poland.  They were selected with regards to the size of their information security market as well as the  number of OES and DSPs identified. The selection of surveyed organisations was designed to  respect a balanced geographical distribution between the selected countries.  Figure 50: Distribution of surveyed organisations by country of origin  A.4 SECTORS OF SURVEYED ORGANISATIONS  The selection criteria for surveyed organisation were designed to align as closely as possible  with the sectors in scope of the NIS Directive, namely:   Online Search Engine   Financial market infrastructures (trading venues, central counterparties)   Drinking water supply and distribution   Cloud computing   Digital infrastructures (internet exchange points, domain name system service  providers, top level domain name registries)   Online Marketplace   Energy (electricity, oil and gas)   Transport (air, rail, water and road)   Healthcare   Banking  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  40  Figure 51: Distribution of surveyed organisations per sector  A.5 STAFFING AND REVENUE OF SURVEYED ORGANISATIONS  No specific quotas were set as to the size or revenues of the surveyed organisations as long as  they were considered in scope of the NIS Directive.

Consequently, most of the individuals that were qualified to take part in the survey have direct  or indirect links with Information Security departments.  It should be noted that the prevalence of COO (Chief Operating Officer) among respondents  can be explained by the fact that in many organisations Information Technology falls under their  responsibility.

NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  47  B.3 SECURITY DOMAINS   Identity and Access Management is the discipline that enables the right individuals to  access the right resources at the right times and for the right reasons. It comprises a  set of practices, processes and technology responsible for the management of digital  identities and their associated access to resources. Specific IAM related activities are:  user account provisioning, password management, user access administration (e.g.,  changes in roles, position or status (JML)), directory integration, single sign-on (SSO),  Active Directory, remote access services, strong or multi factor authentication / two-  factor (2FA) / three-factor (3FA), hard and soft token based authentication services,  Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Federation type services, privileged user  management (PUM), Identity and access governance (IAG) (inclusive of the processes  for user access certification / re-certification, attestation, application access audits  etc.), and cloud based identity services (e.g., IDaaS).   Network Security comprises measures taken to protect a communication pathway  from unauthorized access to, and accidental or wilful interference with, regular  operations, and hence involves protecting computers and computer networks from  attack and infiltration. Network security provides network protection through the  restricting of network traffic, based on a set of policy defined rules. Network security  provides protection at key ingress and egress points in the form of perimeters,  segments and zones, typically defined and enforced by firewalls/NGFWs/firewall  administration, Wireless Access Firewalls (WAF)s / RASP, Network Intrusion Detection  & Prevention (NIDS and NIPS), Virtual Private Networking (VPN) concentrators,  Hardware Security Modules (HSMs), Proxy Servers, Secure Email and/or Web  Gateways, Unified Threat Management (UTM) appliances, Network Access Control  (NAC) services, and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection and prevention  services.   End Point Security is a set of capabilities and services provisioned across devices  and platforms to provide the required and expected level of protection against potential  compromise resulting from inappropriate configuration, use or attack(s). It covers the  security services, capabilities and associated management and support thereof used in  the protection of all end point devices such as desktops, servers, laptops and mobile  devices which users leverage to access corporate data and information. Specific  examples would typically include antivirus/anti-spyware/anti-malware software on PCs  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  48  and servers, mobile device management (MDM), device encryption and management,  Host Intrusion Detection & Prevention (HIPS), hardware-based protection (e.g.,  personal firewalls), advanced anti-malware and threat detection software and also any  physical security control in place for these assets (e.g., locks.)   Data Security ensures confidence in the ability of users, systems and business  processes to provide the required and expected level of protection from data  compromise or loss of data fidelity resulting from system compromise or failure, or  inappropriate user behaviour with regard to data in whatever stage of its lifecycle. It  focuses on confidentiality (to protect against unauthorized or inappropriate access),  integrity (to ensure data is not improperly changed or deleted), availability (to ensure  appropriate access to data for the right parties) and privacy (to assure personal  information is only used for the specific business purpose for which it was collected).  Typical data security protection capabilities include: data discovery & classification,  encryption/decryption of data \"at rest,” \"in motion\" or \"in use\" (incl. endpoint & bulk  storage data encryption/decryption), digital certificate lifecycle management for digital  signature based services, privacy enforcement techniques (data masking), database  audit and protection (DAP) techniques, data loss prevention (DLP) services and data  destruction, removal and erasure type services.   Vulnerability Management is the process cycle for finding, assessing, remediating  and mitigating security weaknesses. It comprises the policy and scope definition,  proactive identification, remediation, mitigation and ongoing monitoring of security  vulnerabilities via dedicated vulnerability assessment and management products and  services. These services typically scan enterprise networks (IP ranges) and establish a  baseline and trending of vulnerability status of devices, applications and databases;  identify and report on the security configuration of IT assets; discover unmanaged  assets; support specific compliance reporting and control frameworks; support risk  assessment and remediation prioritization; and support remediation by IT operations  groups which involves scanning (through resident agents on network-attached devices)  of all internal and external facing target applications or devices for vulnerabilities, to  determine if they are at latest available historic patch level. Service typically also  includes periodic penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, asset auto discovery,  generation of patch and vulnerability status compliance reports, vulnerability  monitoring, and ticket raising.   Security Analytics comprises the ability of the security program via technologies,  processes and people to identify, define, react and remediate against potential or  current or active attacks and the associated threat actors, that may result in system or  service compromise, breaches or data loss events. It is essentially a set of services  delivered by a Security Operations Centre (SOC) or equivalent capability consisting of  a centralized focal point of security specialists where enterprise information systems  (websites, applications, databases, data centres and servers, networks, desktops and  other endpoints) are monitored, assessed, and defended, and action plans devised to  counter any undesirable events detected. Typical security analytics services include  security incident and event log collection, monitoring and management (SIEM),  managed log retention & analysis, user behaviour analytics (UBA), threat intelligence  services, fraud detection and response services, digital forensics and cyber incident  response services.   Application Security describes the use of software, hardware, staff and process  methods to provide through life application protection from threats. It therefore  comprises a set of measures built into the application development process to prevent  the unauthorized access, theft, modification of or erasure of sensitive data through the  exploitation of applications. Specific examples include: the identification of security  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  49  flaws in application design, development, deployment, upgrade, or maintenance  through code assurance techniques such as black box analysis and testing, health  checks, the use of static & dynamic application testing techniques (SAST/DAST/IAST)  and application security frameworks, and/or via data obfuscation, filtering & masking,  secure coding practices and software composition analysis (SCA) etc.   Governance, Risk, and Compliance Management (GRC) in general comprises the  set of practices and processes, supported by a risk-aware culture and enabling  technologies, that improves decision-making and performance through an integrated  view of how well an organization manages its unique set of risks.  – Security Governance is thus defined as a number of \"cross-functional\" security  activities which include the development and maintenance of security policies,  standards & procedures, the communication of business values, culture &  principles, security strategy & organization, training & awareness, documentation  & guidance, communication plans, security service metrics, audit and compliance  oversight, financial management of security services, security vendor  management, security PMO etc. obligations. Governance costs and staffing  include the strategic leadership of security standards, policies and practices, as  typically represented by the Chief IT security Officer (CISO) or equivalent, and his  immediate office.  – Risk Management is defined as the function dedicated to ensuring that adequate  controls are designed and implemented to mitigate the various risks associated  with IT assets (including data), infrastructure, and processes. It includes activities  such as periodic and annual IT audits (non-regulatory), risk assessment /  monitoring, issue management & action tracking, and the development and  execution of remediation plans.  – Compliance Management is the process of identifying, managing and reporting  compliance activities related to organizational, commercial and regulatory  compliance obligations. Compliance requirements can be derived from internal  directives, procedures and requirements, or from external laws, regulations,  standards and contractual agreements.  B.4 SECURITY ASSET TYPES   Hardware is defined as:  – All dedicated hardware assets utilized in support of the Security operations, for  each category indicated (i.e., Network Security, Endpoint Security etc.).  – Examples include firewalls, security gateways, security appliances, security toolset  platforms and ID tokens, etc.  – Include only annual asset costs that are directly or recognizably related to the  defined in-scope security functions. Do not include costs of hardware assets  whose prime purpose is not security. For example, there may be routers deployed  that have firewall, encryption or NIPS capabilities, but you must not include any  apportionment of their annual costs unless you can identify a cost to specifically  enable a security function - such as a firewall \"add-on\" enabler cost of extra router  hardware or software.  – Hosting / facilities / occupancy costs for space dedicated to in-scope security  hardware such as the apportioned annual costs of hosting security-related  devices, storage arrays and appliances in the data center, including power/heat  management and raised floor. It also includes the annual cost of any consumables  related to the security activities.  NIS INVESTMENTS  December 2020  50   Software is defined as:  – Annual license and maintenance as well as costs associated with new purchases  and upgrades for all software dedicated to operating or managing the security  systems applications for each category of security expenditure.  – Examples include endpoint security suites, identity and access management,  security information and event management, content filtering, etc.  – Only software license costs that are directly or recognizably related to the defined  in-scope security functions are included. Costs of software whose prime purpose  is NOT security are excluded.  – For example, there may be enterprise licenses for OS, productivity suite software  or enterprise packages that have security capabilities (e.g., BitLocker encryption in  WinOS). No apportionment of their annual costs are included unless a cost to  specifically enable a security function can be identified. An example would be an  \"add-on\" software charge for a security capability, or a specific module license  charge for security functionality (e.g., Oracle Identity Manager)   Outsourcing is defined as:  – Outsourcing is the use of external service providers to effectively deliver IT-  enabled business process, application service and infrastructure solutions for  business outcomes. Outsourcing, which also includes utility services, and cloud-  enabled outsourcing, helps clients to develop the right sourcing strategies and  vision, select the right IT service providers, structure the best possible contracts,  and govern deals for sustainable win-win relationships with external providers.  Outsourcing can enable enterprises to reduce costs, accelerate time to market,  and take advantage of external expertise, assets and/or intellectual property.

    "abstract": "Four years after the NIS Directive entered into force and two years after the transposition by Member States into their national laws, this report presents the findings of a survey of 251 organisations across five EU Member States (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Poland) with regards to NIS investments. The report depicts and analyses how OES and DSPs spend their information security budget and provides indications as to how this spending has been influenced by the introduction of the NIS Directive. The results of this NIS survey were correlated with Gartner security data and insights observed globally and in the EU in order to better understand the current NIS Directive adoption dynamics and impact on related investments."

These new trust services  include electronic seals, electronic time stamps, electronic registered delivery services and, specific to this  report, certificates for website authentication. Widely known as SSL/TLS certificates, website  authentication certificates play a critical role in the security of online transactions, have long been  employed by websites and have been increasing in deployment throughout the online environment.  The eIDAS Regulation introduces a legal framework and establishes a scheme for granting qualified status  to these new types of trust services aiming to enhance consumer's trust in the digital environment and to  improve the transparency of the trust services market. Following the publication of the eIDAS Regulation, a  set of secondary and co-regulatory acts were published in order to provide technical guidance on how to  implement the specific requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. Underlying the market for EU qualified  website authentication certificates (QWACs) and other trust services is a conformity assessment scheme,  whereby the providers of qualified trust services undergo regular assessments by accredited assessment  bodies, overseen by national and EU authorities.  The goal of the study was to explore the eIDAS Conformity Assessment Report (CAR), the corresponding  audit requirements, gaps arising from comparison with competing audit schemes, and the emergent issues  at the core of the global conversation between major stakeholders in the qualified trust service provider  (QTSP) audit ecosystem. This report also seeks to accomplish a targeted survey of the non-technical sphere  of QWACs, notably the overlapping political and economic environments into which the EU certification  scheme was born and has grown in the past few years.  In this study, we discuss these aspects and identify the most prominent recommendations for  improvement that can increase global acceptance of eIDAS audits. Towards this goal, this study identifies  recommendations for strengthening:   the clear and formal adoption of a harmonised conformity assessment scheme in the EU and the  advancement of these schemes in the international context,   the promotion and referencing of specific standards covering the auditing of TSPs and the conformity  assessment report, and   the public recognition of the trust generated by the scheme.  The main recommendations deriving from the study are summarised below:   There is need to agree upon and define a harmonised conformity assessment scheme against which  CABs would be accredited and the QTSP/QTS assessed in order to verify conformance to the eIDAS  Regulation requirements. Such a process would involve all the stakeholders - EA, ETSI, EC, ENISA, SBs –  which would participate from the specification till the enforcement of such scheme.   A centralised list of all CABs should be maintained (by the European Commission) and regularly  updated, where it will be clearly indicated whether a CAB has been accredited under ETSI EN 319 403  by a NAB and whether it has been accredited in line with the ETSI standards concerning the  certification scheme in order to be recognised also by the CA/B forum and the browsers.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  06   It is recommended that ENISA, in cooperation with ETSI and CEN, develop and publish a  comprehensive set of auditors’ requirements together with best practice examples from the field.   It is recommended that ETSI ESI should provide further specifications in the detailing of the  requirements for TSP procedures and audit best practice to “set up New Roots” and “CA Key  Generation.   There is need to further analyse, test and review how the EU trust mark can be displayed on websites  in a tamper-proof manner in order to increase the global visibility of the EU trust mark as a trusted  logo for qualified trust services, which would in turn strengthen the acceptance of the audits. This  could be done by the European Commission or by ENISA.   It will be challenging to grow the value of QWACs outside the EU Digital Single Market by convincing  the browsers and OS vendors to include the TSL in their respective root stores. Towards this goal face- to-face meetings should be arranged by the European Commission with the browsers also in the  context of CA/B Forum meetings.   Since “banks are taking part in educating customers by offering browser plug-ins for enhanced security  and peripheral education” (Timmerman, 2004), a foreseeable next step is the full pan-European usage  of the trust mark on bank websites that fall under the purview of PSD2 rules. This agenda might also be  extended to the TSL integration for all operating systems and browser vendors operating in the  European Union as part of a wider rollout of the trust mark and its potential close association with  QWACs.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  07  1. Introduction  Purpose  This report explores the paths to global acceptance of the eIDAS auditing framework for trust service  providers (TSPs) issuing qualified website authentication certificates (QWACs). The goal of the study was to  explore the eIDAS Conformity Assessment Report (CAR), the corresponding audit requirements, gaps  arising from comparison with competing audit schemes, and the emergent issues at the core of the global  conversation between major stakeholders to the qualified trust service provider (QTSP) audit ecosystem.  This report also seeks to accomplish a targeted survey of the non-technical sphere of QWACs, notably the  overlapping political and economic environments into which the EU certification scheme was born and has  grown in the past few years. Developing issues concerning technology shifts, tangled with pronounced  ideological struggles in the global geo-political environment will also affect the outcome of the eIDAS trust  framework as much as the technical and procedural requirements set forth in the developed European  regulatory environment.  In order for stakeholders – such as relying parties and end users – to build and maintain confidence in the  security of qualified trust services (QTS), they need to have the assurance that qualified trust service  providers (QTSPs) have established a set of procedures, processes and security measures to minimize the  associated operational and financial threats and risks. Under eIDAS, this is accomplished by audits carried  out by accredited Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs). To support both the infrastructure of the audit  scheme as well as the audits (also called assessments) themselves, ETSI has developed a set of standards  to support TSPs (ETSI EN 319 401, 411-1, 411-2, 421) and CABs (ETSI EN 319 403, TS 119 403-2), which  meet the corresponding security and policy requirements stemming and policy requirements stemming  from the eIDAS Regulation. This report aims to map the requirements of the ETSI framework to other  international standards and requirements (as developed, for example, by the Certification  Authority/Browser Forum and WebTrust) in order to facilitate the widespread use of qualified certificates  for website authentication and the global acceptance of eIDAS audits.  In addition, it is critical for the trust placed in an underlying trust service, such as the provision of QWACs,  to be visible to the average end-user. Trust services without a visible metric of trust such as that provided  by the QWAC, which is based on accountability, will be difficult to foster and upkeep.  Considering the eIDAS Regulation as a framework, there is significant space for individual interpretation  and for development since it does not impose any specific accreditation scheme for which CABs must be  accredited against, or any best practice standard that QTSPs or QTS must comply with in order to be  granted the qualified status. From a perspective that relates to standards, policies and requirements (less  so to economic, political and social forces) upon which much of this report focuses, the success or  acceptance of the eIDAS audits depends on several factors that hinder further recognition of the scheme:   non-existent statutory/mandatory specification of any (but especially the ETSI/CEN) standards, which  were developed as a basis for the eIDAS-compliant operation of TSPs,   the lack of harmonization of requirements within the EU (and thus beyond) at the level of CABs  accreditation and certification scheme for TSP auditing, and   limited visibility of the trust generated by the scheme.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  08  In this study, we discuss these aspects and identify the most prominent recommendations for  improvement that can increase global acceptance of eIDAS audits. Towards this goal, this study identifies  recommendations for strengthening:   the clear and formal adoption of a harmonised conformity assessment scheme in the EU and the  advancement of these schemes in the international context   the promotion and referencing of best practice standards against which TSPs can be audited, and  standards for how the audit is carried out and reported   the public recognition of the trust generated by the scheme.  Methodology  This research method (Figure 1) has been selected in order to combine findings from the audit scheme and  underlying standards with input from subject matter experts, relevant literature and practical case  examples.  Figure 1: Methodology of the study  The research method for this report consists of three elements:   a description containing an assessment of the eIDAS regulatory framework for audits and underlying  best practices standards, as well as findings from literature research   an analysis in which findings based on expert contributions and presentations of international task  force sessions are substantiated via literature and the best practices standards, and   a synthesis in which opportunities and directions for improvement are identified and explored.  Ongoing discussions at international working groups and conferences and the opinions and statistics which  will emanate therefrom have informed and continue to inform this discussion, and will ultimately be useful  to policy-makers in the EU who are searching for a way to achieve the goal set forth in this report: to foster  and grow global acceptance of the eIDAS trust framework and its corresponding auditing scheme for  QTSPs issuing QWACs. During the course of the drafting and revision processes of this report, several  notable discussions between industry actors took place (and continue to take place), partially shifting the  Body of evidence  Analysis  Road map  Review of  literature  Conference  proceedings  Workshop  results  Policies,  reports  Consultations  Stakeholder  input  Working  group input  Technical std.  review  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  09  focus of this report towards the search for resolution between leading browsers and the ETSI scheme in  support of the European approach to (Q)TSP auditing within the eIDAS framework.  Structure of the report  This study is divided into six chapters in total, covering how the global acceptance of eIDAS audits can be  improved. In brief:  Chapter 2 describes the background of eIDAS and its audit scheme. It  sketches a backdrop for this study, focusing on the TSP supervisory  scheme as well as the tasks of the stakeholders in the eIDAS  organizational hierarchy. It also discusses the conformity assessment  criteria and standards, assessment procedures and the conformity  assessment report.  Chapter 3 compares the eIDAS regulatory framework for audits  with  different prevailing trust frameworks (and their respective audit  schemes) – e.g. ETSI, WebTrust for CAs, ISO 27000 series and Federal  PKI frameworks – and highlights possible shortcomings of the eIDAS  audit scheme.  Chapter 4 discusses the underlying standards of the eIDAS regulatory  framework for audits, especially certificate policy documents ETSI EN  319 411-1, ETSI EN 319 411-2 and ETSI EN 319 401, and contains a  level of detailed assessment, comparing them with others, specifically  with a narrow focus on WebTrust.  Chapter 5 presents a dive into the challenges the eIDAS regulatory  framework for audits faces to global acceptance. Topics discussed  include the current situation regarding the visibility of the use of the  EU Trust Mark, especially in current market-leading web browsers  and the ongoing struggle to convince browsers to accept the eIDAS  TLS scheme.  Chapter 6 offers a roadmap – a concrete set of recommendations –  including auditor skills and competences, optimized reports and  promotion as a way forward for the eventual, enhanced global  acceptance of the audit scheme under the eIDAS Regulation.  Figure 2: Determining gaps  between eIDAS and other  schemes  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  10  2. eIDAS Regulatory Framework  The eIDAS Regulation1 repeals the 1999 Directive concerning electronic signatures by providing a new legal  framework for “electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal  market”. Whereas the former Directive focused solely on electronic signatures, the eIDAS Regulation  extends the concept of trust services to other services such as electronic seals and time stamps, registered  mail and website authentication.  To enhance the trust of enterprises and consumers in the internal market and to promote the use of trust  services and products, the eIDAS Regulation introduces the notion of qualified to electronic trust services  as well as to the providers themselves (i.e. QTS and QTSPs). It aims to identify requirements and  obligations that ensure a high level of security for whatever qualified trust service or product is used or  provided.  Since this study primarily concerns certificates for website authentication, the discussion hereinafter  focuses on what are broadly referred to as QWACs, which play a critical role in the security of online  transactions. Prior to the rollout of eIDAS, non-qualified2 SSL/TLS certificates had long been used in  website authentication and network traffic encryption services. For more information, ENISA has  previously published a number of relevant studies which concern a range of topics concerning QWACs,  including the emergence and growth of a European market for QWACs.  QWACs present a particular case among the newly introduced trust services in the eIDAS Regulation, since  they are entering an already mature, global and unregulated (from the point of view of state governance)  market for SSL/TLS certificates. For a successful introduction, it will be necessary to stimulate demand for  QWACs by properly communicating to consumers their benefits, while at the same time supporting  providers to ensure sufficient supply.  As this emergent market matures, becoming more dynamic and transparent, the infrastructure for  ensuring the system’s trustworthiness will also need to be bolstered with smart, flexible and diverse  strategies, especially in light of the stated goal of bringing QWACs and the underlying audit schemes, as  accepted by the national authorities, to wider global acceptance, especially to achieve acceptance (i.e.  support and visualization) as “Publicly Trusted Certificates” (PTC) 3 by the browser vendors. In other words,  the emergence of an ecosystem comprising TSPs, supervisory bodies (SBs), CABs, national accreditation  bodies (NABs) and the certificates themselves onto the global stage require cooperation at all levels.  TSP supervisory scheme  In order to ensure a high-level of security of qualified trust services, the eIDAS Regulation foresees an  active supervision scheme of QTSPs and the QTS they provide by a competent national SB that supervises,  ex-ante and ex-post, fulfilment of the QTSP/QTS requirements and obligations. Therefore, when a TSP  1 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/ES/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG  2 The term “non-qualified” is expressly from the point of view of eIDAS and designates all trust services and providers  that have not undergone the rigorous certification process set forth by eIDAS since it went into effect in 2016. This  includes domain-validated (DV), organization-validated (OV), extended validation (EV) and other certificates for  website authentication.  3 “Publicly Trusted Certificate” is a specific terminology used by the CA/B Forum; all certificates issued to the public  are generally considered “publicly-trusted”. The term refers to certificates that are issued to the public and the  issuing or root CAs are included in the correspondent browser root store.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  11  (without qualified status) intends to begin providing qualified trust services, it submits to the SB a  notification of their intention, together with a CAR issued by a CAB accredited under a conformity  assessment scheme recognised by the national supervisory body (SB). NABs contribute to the quality  assurance of the whole process by being responsible for accrediting and supervising CABs, which perform  the conformity assessment audits of the TSPs.  The eIDAS Regulation introduces a clear separation of duties and tasks between CABs and SBs: while the  CAB is the body responsible for confirming the compliance of the TSP, according to eIDAS, the SB is the  body responsible for actually granting the qualified status. More precisely, Article 17 (4) of the eIDAS  Regulation states that the tasks of the supervisory body shall include in particular:   to analyse the conformity assessment reports (Articles 20(1) and 21(1))   to carry out audits or request a CAB to perform a conformity assessment of the qualified TSPs (Article  20(2)) and   to grant qualified status to TSPs and to the services they provide and to withdraw this status (Articles  20 and 21).  The tasks of CABs4 under the eIDAS Regulation are:   performing the audit of (qualified) TSPs (Article 20 (1))   reporting the audit results in written form (a requirement by CAB accreditation)   making a ‘compliance statement’ confirming (or disproving) the compliance of a QTSP and its QTS with  all the applicable eIDAS requirements (Article 20 (1))   providing the conformity assessment report (CAR) with the compliance statement to the TSP (Article  20 (1)) and   usually also directly to Supervisory Body (Article 17 (4) b), Article 20 (2)).  After the successful completion of the audit, the CAB issues a CAR. This report contains all results of the  assessment performed and is provided to the TSP, which must in turn provide it to the responsible SB. The  compliance statement by a CAB is formally non-binding for the SB for granting or not granting the qualified  status to a TSP but represents an important basis for the subsequent decision. Only after a full review of  the CAR and any additional requested information will the SB decide whether the TSP and the trust  services it provides are in fact compliant with eIDAS requirements. After a maximum of three months  following the submission of the conformity assessment report, the SB notifies the TSP of its decision.  If positive, the TSP and the audited trust services will be granted the “qualified” status and will be added to  the national trusted list (if it is not already within). In the case that a QTSP and its QTS no longer meet the  requirements, the SB then withdraws the qualified status (in the case of a new TSP/TS, it will not grant the  qualified status) and informs the body responsible for the national trusted list about its decision. As stated  by Article 20 of the eIDAS Regulation, once the qualified status is granted, a QTSP will have to provide a  new CAR to the responsible SB every 24 months (or whenever requested by the SB) in order to maintain  their qualified status.  Figure 3 provides an overview of dependencies between various stakeholders in the TSP assessment  scheme under the eIDAS Regulation.  4 A current list of accredited CABs is accessed at https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/content/list-conformity- assessment-bodies-cabs-accredited-against-requirements-eidas-regulation.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  12  Figure 3: TSP assessment scheme (courtesy of ETSI/ESI)  The European Accreditation (EA) is the body recognised under the EC Regulation No 765/2008 that  organises the peer evaluation scheme among the NABs from the EU Member States and other European  Countries. Each NAB determines the fundamental ability of a CAB for conducting conformity assessments  in accordance with (specific) accreditation criteria. To this day, there is no implementing act, but instead  the decision as to whether a scheme meets the requirements of eIDAS and expects appropriate  competencies for trust service audit is left to the supervisory body. For the accreditation of a CAB to  operate in the eIDAS scheme and, consequentially, for it to undertake certification of TSPs, ETSI, in  collaboration with the EA and with representatives of the interested parties, has developed a specific  standard (ETSI EN 319 403) for the accreditation of CABs assessing trust service providers and the services  they provide. The ETSI EN 319 403 defines an accreditation scheme that:   requires the accreditation of CABs based on ISO/IEC 17065, and   supplements ISO/IEC 17065 by defining additional requirements for a CAB’s capabilities for performing  conformity assessment (certification) of TSPs and the trust services they provide against specific  criteria based on standards (such as the ETSI standards for TSPs), publicly available specifications (such  as the CA/B Forum baseline or extended validation guidelines) or regulatory requirements (such as the  eIDAS Regulation).  Conformity assessment scheme, criteria and standards  The general approach for CABs assessing the conformity of TSPs and the services they provide is presented  in ETSI EN 319 403. For each step of the audit, all the general requirements for evaluating TSPs against the  requirements are described in the text of the eIDAS Regulation itself. As mentioned above, however, there  is currently no implementing act for this; it is left up to the supervisory body to verify whether the trust  service provider and the trust services provided by it comply with the requirements laid down in eIDAS  Regulation, and in particular, with the requirements for qualified trust service providers and for the  qualified trust services they provide. EN 319 does not include the specific criteria for the type of trust  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  13  service to be assessed. This is covered by the relevant regulatory requirements or standards aimed at the  type of trust service being assessed.  The audit process, based on ISO 17065 and implemented in ETSI EN 319 403, is divided into different parts:   General preparation – to agree on the terms of the audit (time, location, scope, etc.)   Documentation review – to review the documentation regarding the TSPs and TS provided   On-site audit – to validate the preliminary findings and complete the audit against the predefined  assessment criteria  At the end of the process, a conformity assessment report (CAR) containing all the results of the audit will  be issued by the CAB to the TSP.  After analysing the list of CABs accredited against the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation, as maintained  by the European Commission5, it is concluded that the EA has widely promoted the accreditation  framework of ISO 17065 completed by the certification scheme defined in ETSI EN 319 403. The EA has  promoted ETSI EN 319 403 as a channel to demonstrate conformity with relevant requirements laid out in  the eIDAS Regulation through assessment by CABs. In fact, 21 of the 22 currently eIDAS accredited CABs  follow this EA framework.  Conformity assessment schemes based on standards such as EN 319 403 can be adopted by CABs to certify  conformance of QTSPs, and the QTS it provides, with the eIDAS regulation (Article 20.2) as well as best  practice standards such as the CA/B Forum guidelines and/or ETSI standards defining policy requirements  for particular trust services. However, there does not exist a fully comprehensive list of requirements that  has to be used by all CABs for conducting a conformity assessment (Article 20 (4)). Consequently, there is  no guarantee that the audit is carried out by a CAB with the competencies and procedures appropriate to  the trust services it is assessing. Also, if an audit is carried out just against the requirements of the eIDAS  Regulation, there is no guarantee that the policies and practices are or will be in line with accepted best  practices standards.  Moreover, the final decision regarding the qualification of the TSP and its trust services is made by the  responsible SB that verifies compliance with the requirements laid down in eIDAS Regulation (Article  21(2)). However, the SBs in Member States lack a set of defined and harmonised requirements or criteria  related to the compliance (or lack of compliance) of a TSP to the requirements laid down in the eIDAS  regulation.  Identified gap: Harmonization  One of the major shortcomings of the conformity assessment scheme and the assessment criteria used  under the eIDAS Regulation appears to be the absence of standardization for the conformity assessment  process (certification).  While the accreditation of almost all CABs listed is according to ETSI EN 319 403 (based on ISO 17065), it  may happen that different CABs of different Member States will use different criteria by which a TSP will  be audited.  Specifically, the eIDAS Regulation itself lends few words to the topic of the CAR. The rigor of presentation  (measured generally by the level of detail) is, however, not specified, even though it may be crucial to  5 The most recent version of this list is accessed at https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/content/list-conformity- assessment-bodies-cabs-accredited-against-requirements-eidas-regulation.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  14  enabling the SB to decide on the qualified status of the TSP. The form of presentation is additionally not  specified; it is assumed that the CAR might follow the structure of each single requirement from the  applied assessment criteria e.g. directly from eIDAS itself, or like-wise from EN 319 401, EN 319 411-1 and - 2 and EN 319 421. From the above it is also derived that it is also not regulated according to which criteria  the SBs measure whether a TSP has reached the status of \"qualified\" or not.  This may result in incongruences in the qualification of TSPs in different countries as well as their qualified  trust services. This may lead to a non-harmonized trust service market and give rise to doubts about the  quality of QTS, which may include QWACs. In this case, harmonization (or the lack there-of) refers to a  mandated, detailed or specific set of norms describing the process of producing a CAR for a certification  under the eIDAS scheme; it is currently an ongoing topic of discussion at the lever of the Forum of  European Supervisory Authorities (FESA).  It is also of interest that the CAR provided to the SBs is not considered a public document, meaning that  most TSPs have not published a detailed CAR that is provided to the SB. In fact, they only publish the  “certificate”, which provides evidence for the successful completion of the audit. This is an important point  from the perspective of (different) browsers, who require documents and reports that can be made  publicly available. Some browsers may be more amenable to the confidentiality of these CAR documents  and others may not.  The absence of a standardized CAR constitutes a challenge, but also offers an opportunity forward. CABs  that have different interpretations of the actual scope of audits and/or the content of audit reports might  be better aligned with the publication and enforcement of implementation acts for the accreditation of  CABs across borders.  To avoid inconsistent qualification of TSPs and their qualified services, it is necessary to:   harmonize the conformity assessment scheme against which the CABs are accredited   harmonize the level of detail and structure of the Conformity Assessment Report issued by CABs and  the conformity assessment requirements during the TSP auditing   harmonize the procedures followed by the national Supervisory Bodies used to verify whether the TSP  and the trust services provided comply with the requirements laid down in the eIDAS Regulation, and  in particular, with the requirements for qualified trust service providers and for the qualified trust  services they provide   integrate the requirements from external bodies like the CA/B Forum to ensure that the audit follows  proper form and adheres to the requirements of the international community   agree on the criteria to be used for assessment, in particular, whether this is just at the level of the  regulation or if it also includes best practice standards such as CA/B Forum guidelines or ETSI  standards.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  15  3. Overview of Trust Frameworks  “Trust” may be defined as “a psychological state comprising the intention to accept vulnerability based  upon positive expectations of the intentions or behaviour of another” (Rousseauo, 1998). In the online  environment, required positive expectations to reach the state of trust may differ from application to  application, such as making an online payment, sending an e-mail or signing a business contract. To serve  the needs of this sensitive and differentiated digital ecosystem, several trust frameworks have been  established, each attempting to lay the groundwork for trust and enhance the confidence that users can  have in all of their digital transactions.  This chapter considers prominent existing trust frameworks in order to discover the similarities and  differences between them and analyse these findings in order to derive fundamental structural  requirements for such trust frameworks. The aim of this chapter is to identify gaps between coverage in  the trust frameworks and assess the directions our recommendations, based on the technical analysis, will  lead to some recommendations in the final chapter of this report. Since, in effect, the field is a “moving  goalpost”, the nature of this study at present is intended to be dynamic and responsive to impending  changes to the trust service landscape.  Key concepts and terminology  In terms of key concepts and terminology (cf. (Sel, 2015)), this report follows the structure of (Hamaguchi  2016), which presents the similarities and differences of several trust models. In most if not all instances  where trust in electronic transactions is established, the following four types of trust components are  involved: computational trust components (such as hard mathematical problems like the Discrete  Logarithm Problem or finding points along an elliptical curve), technology components (such as CA servers,  hardware security modules (HSMs) and online certificate status protocol (OCSP) responders), operating  procedures (such as face-to-face registration of an applicant who wants to subscribe to a TSP's services)  and compliance components. An appropriate combination of these components will yield legal effect.  There are many competing definitions and vocabularies for trust, indicating the concept's importance in  many different scenarios and for different stakeholders. In the context of the present study, we use the  following model terms:   Trust framework: a model of multiparty interactions that aims at facilitating a Relying Party's decision  on the basis of metadata and services   Trust ecosystem: collection of trust frameworks   Mechanism: the apparatus, system or process used to bind the participants within the frame-work   Actors:   Initiator: the actor that took the initiative to create the trust framework   Governor/oversight keeper: the actor that governs the trust framework and/or over-sees it   Operator: the actor responsible for the operation of the framework   Assessor: an actor that provides claims about participants   Participants: actors that accept to be bound through the mechanism, this includes:   TSPs: actors providing trust services such as authentication, signature creation, validation,  long term preservation, registered electronic delivery, time stamping etc. In such a context,  the TSP can also be referred to as the trustee, the entity that is potentially trusted   Subscribers: actors that subscribe to services offered by TSPs   Relying parties: actors that rely on services offered by TSPs.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  16   Metadata: data provided about the services and data used within a trust framework  Audit schemes by both ETSI and WebTrust are well known to major browser vendors and TSPs issuing  website authentication certificates because these two frameworks are adopted by the trusted root CA  programs of major browser vendors such as Google, Mozilla and Microsoft (CA/Browser Forum, 2017).  Website authentication (SSL/TLS) certificates are electronic certificates for managing the secure  connection between the web server and the end user’s computer through the browser. SSL/TLS  certificates are used for other services that require TLS authentication, as well.  Conformity assessment scheme and audit requirements for TSPs based on ETSI  standards  Certification in accordance with ETSI standards is performed by CABs, which are accredited by NABs within  each respective Member State. Harmonization of accreditation processes among accreditation bodies is  coordinated through by the EA. Figure 4 shows the trust framework of ETSI certification for the browsers’  root program for TSPs.  Figure 4: The trust framework of ETSI certification for root CA program (based on (Hamaguchi, 2016))  ETSI EN 319 401 specifies general requirements for TSPs; however, this is not audited independently.  When auditing against EN 319 411-1 or -2 (or any other eIDAS trust service), there exist requirements in  these documents which reference EN 319 401. This is to say, checks against relevant EN 319 401  requirements are carried out when conducting an EN 319 411-1 and/or -2 audit.  EN 319 411-1 specifies generally applicable policy and security requirements for TSPs issuing public key  certificates, including trusted website authentication certificates. It provides guidance to the TSP to  develop, implement, enforce and update the Certification Practise Statement (CPS) (which describes the  practices and procedures used to address all the requirements identified for the applicable TSP's policy)  and the Certificate Policy (CP) (which refers to the CPS to indicate how the TSP implements the policy  requirements for the selected CP). EN 319 411-2 specifies policy and security requirements for the  issuance, maintenance and life-cycle management of EU qualified certificates as defined in eIDAS  Regulation. This builds on the requirements of EN 319 411-1 and a TSP can support both technical  requirements of PTC certificate policies and eIDAS QWACs.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  17  Moreover, ETSI has recently published TS 119 403-2, which defines additional requirements for CABs  auditing TSPs that issue publicly-trusted certificates (PTC), and it is expected soon to publish the ETSI TS  119 403-3, where requirements for CABs assessing QTSPs against eIDAS will be defined. In order to clarify  the difference between TS 119 403-2 and -3, it should be noted that TS 119 403-2 is aimed at meeting the  audit requirements of issuers of PTCs as described by CA/B Forum and address specific root store  requirements. It includes requirements concerning the audit frequency and audit attestation and defines  subsequent audits that examine the history of any events that occurred over the period leading to the last  audit. TS 119 403-3, however, aims to provide additional requirements on the certification scheme used by  CABs assessing the QTSPs and the QTS they provide in order to demonstrate compliance against the  requirements laid down by eIDAS. Both TS 119 403-2 and TS 119 403-3 also require the audit to be carried  out in conformance with EN 319 403.  Table 1: Relevant ETSI standards to eIDAS conformity assessment for TSPs6  CERTIFICATION POLICY FOR TSPs  ETSI EN 319 401  General policy requirements for  trust service providers  This document specifies policy requirements for TSPs that are  independent of the type of TSP whether certificate issuer (qualified  or otherwise), timestamp issuer, signature verifier, e-delivery  provider or other form of trust service provider. It defines policy  requirements on the operation and management practices of TSPs.  ETSI EN 319 411  Policy and security requirements  for trust service providers issuing  certificates  This multi-part document specifies policy and security requirements  for TSPs issuing certificates. It references EN 319 401 for generic  requirements.  Both parts provide informative annexes with a check list of the policy  requirements that can be used by the TSP to prepare an assessment  of its practices against the document and/or by the assessor when  conducting the assessment for confirming that a TSP meets those  requirements.  It also includes the following topics:  ETSI EN 319 411-1  General requirements for trust  service providers issuing  certificates  This part specifies generally applicable policy and security  requirements for TSPs issuing public key certificates, including trusted  website certificates. The policy and security requirements are defined  in terms of requirements for certificates. These policy and security  requirements support a number of reference CPs (LCP, NCP, NCP+,  EVCP, OVCP, DVCP).  ETSI EN 319 411-2  Requirements for trust service  providers issuing EU qualified  certificates  This part specifies the policy and security requirements for TSPs  issuing qualified certificates as defined in the eIDAS Regulation. These  policy and security requirements support reference CPs (QCP-1, QCP- n, QCP-1-qscd, QCP-n-qscd, QCP-w) for the issuance, maintenance  and life-cycle management of qualified certificates issued to natural  persons (including natural persons associated with a legal person), to  legal persons and websites.  6 Visit https://portal.etsi.org/TBSiteMap/ESI/ESIActivities.aspx for more information about recent, current and  ongoing ETSI activities.

Requirements and guidance set out in this document are  independent of the class of trust service provided.  As reaction to the browser requirements, in spring of 2018, ETSI  published TS 119 403-2, Additional requirements for Conformity  Assessment Bodies auditing Trust Service Providers that issue Publicly- Trusted Certificates, which is intended to bring about audit reports  that are more compliant with the browser requirements.

ETSI TS 119 403-3  Additional requirements for  conformity assessment bodies  assessing qualified trust service  providers against the eIDAS  requirements  This document provides additional requirements for CABs assessing  qualified TSPs against the eIDAS Regulation requirements.  3.2.1 Analysis of CAB requirements and EN 319 403 / ISO/IEC 17065  The auditing scheme based on ETSI standards can be regarded as a certification scheme, meaning it  comprises an examination of whether a TSP’s system, product or process faithfully implements the  requirements as laid out in the described ETSI documents. Concluding the assessment process, if the TSP  meets the criteria described in the applicable standards, the output is a certificate. As a TSP may have a  contractual obligation to meet the criteria within three months in order to receive a positive decision on its  certification request, this TSP may have to take corrective measures on issues identified, as permitted and  requested by CAB. Specifically, a TSP audit may be passed with pending nonconformities provided that  these do not impact the ability of the TSP to meet the intended service. This certification decision is  conditional upon to the implementation of corrective actions within 3 months after conclusion of the audit  (depending on the type and criticality of the correction(s)). Moreover, the CAB assessing the TSP must  meet the specific requirements of EN 319 403, for which reporting requirements are specific to the  certification scheme and may be adjusted as necessary – for example, according to the requirements  under the forthcoming ETSI TS 119 403-3.  The assessment criteria from EN 319 403 (and, ISO/IEC 17065) set out the requirements that the CAB must  examine during the assessment of a TSP, the first of which is to indicate that CABs do not perform (or  accept contracts for) audits of TSPs for which they have less than the required competence  The contents of the audit report are expected to contain a list of the standards and publicly-available  specifications and/or regulatory requirements against which the assessment is carried out, an account of  7 Visit https://portal.etsi.org/TBSiteMap/ESI/ESIActivities.aspx for more information about recent, current and  ongoing ETSI activities.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  19  the TSP’s internal risk analysis, the time it took to conduct the assessment, detailed to the review of  documentation, on-site assessment and reporting, as well as additional audit enquiries followed, rationale  for their selection and the methodology employed, including any additional methodologies for sampling,  were that to be the case of the audit. The results contained within the audit report are expected to provide  “sufficient detail to facilitate and support a certification decision”, the details of which are laid out in EN  319 403 section 7.4.4.1 Report contents.  Problems or other discrepant issues discovered during the assessment are defined as non-conformities.  For these instances, the TSP is expected to report pending or performed changes according to the  conformity issue during the documentation phase of the assessment. Non-conformities may be resolved  with the suspension or termination of the certification or under the auspices of a contractual commitment  to corrective actions that would return the TSP to within the scope of conformity to the applicable  standards. In consideration of this, the TSP may be conferred one of three designations after the  assessment process has concluded: certified, non-certified or passed with pending non-conformities. To be  clear, if a TSP does not receive a certification, no additional status called “non-certified” is awarded.  As described in EN 319 403 7.10 Changes affecting certification, the changes that may affect certification  include (but are not limited to) major changes in TSP documentation (during the first stage of the audit),  changes to the TSP’s policies, objectives or procedures that affect the trust service(s) offered, relevant  security changes to networks and trustworthy systems or new sites providing relevant trust services. In  these cases, the TSP must undergo a full re-assessment to determine if it (still) adheres to conformance to  the requirements laid out in the respective, appropriate standards and requirements. Responses to any of  these non-conformances are described accordingly in ISO/IEC 17065 section 8.10 Termination, reduction,  suspension or withdrawal of certification. This standard also includes provisions for the reduction of the  risk of non-conformities in 9.6 Internal audits, 9.7 Corrective actions and 9.8 Preventative actions, which  list (non-explicit) strategies and actions relevant to the identification and remediation of such risks.  One point of interest regarding the ongoing industry discussion about non-conformities (and the necessity  of responses thereto) considers the absence of specification for the terms “major” and “minor” as they  relate to non-conformities. The definition of a nonconformity (from ISO/IEC 17021) is, generally, “the non- fulfilment of a requirement”. A nonconformity could be classified as major under two circumstances: “if  there is a significant doubt that effective process control is in place, or that products or services will meet  specified requirements” or if “a number of minor nonconformities associated with the same requirement  or issue could demonstrate a systemic failure…”. The functional difference between major and minor, by  definition, is its ability to “affect the capability of the management system to achieve its intended results”.  It is assumed within the wider auditing/audited community that TSPs found exhibiting “minor” non- conformities can be awarded a provisional certification whereas any present “major” non-conformities are  grounds for termination of certification pending remedial actions and a renewed full assessment.  However, these terms have been debated along descriptive lines: disagreements have arisen between e.g.  CABs and browser vendors have no existing avenue for mediation except that which is based on the  interpretation of whoever is holding the report. Though both sides of these ongoing large-scale arguments  have merits, they can also be seen through the lens of political posturing, and could potentially be resolved  in part by clearer, or more granular, distinctions between types (and the severity levels) of specific non- conformities and appropriate responses in the certification process.  Moreover, there is a number of requirements for the training and competence of the audit teams  according to EN 319 403, which includes provisions for demonstrated knowledge in technical, regulatory,  business, risk, policy and control areas, according to section 6.1 Conformity Assessment Body personnel  (6.1.2.2 Training of audit teams). The competences must be derived according to the general requirements  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  20  as described in ISO/IEC 17065 section 6.1 Certification body personnel. This includes that the certification  body, here interpreted as the CAB, needs to define the scope of competence, training and certification of  its auditors and provide for such training, performance testing and monitoring as necessary. As discussed  before, however, since ETSI (and by extension ISO) standards often do not expressly cite specific controls  or give specific examples for the fulfilment of the standards and requirements, no further explicit  directions or documentation are given for the practical training of auditors, harmonised across all CABs in  the EU (and beyond).  WebTrust for CAs assurance audit  WebTrust (Figure 5) is another well-known commercial audit scheme for TSPs and browser vendors.  WebTrust assessments are performed by independent accountant firms which are recognized by  Chartered Professional Accountants (CPA) Canada. As a rule-based assurance audit, the WebTrust scheme  aims to review the implementation and operational effectiveness of controls over a period of time in the  past (to make sure the systems have been adequately operating, with the assumption that they will  continue to do so). The functional philosophy behind WebTrust is the provision of assurance that a TSP’s  services have, until the point of time the assessment is conducted, verifiably met a rigorous set of defined  criteria. The operation assumption here is that fulfilling a checklist of objectives is the same as fulfilling the  obligations to security for which TSPs are responsible in their operations.  Figure 5: The trust framework of WebTrust for root CA program (based on (Hamaguchi, 2016))  It should be made clear that the WebTrust scheme does not actually meet the requirements of eIDAS  conformity assessment bodies in Article 3 (18)8, “which is accredited in accordance with that Regulation as  competent to carry out conformity assessment of a qualified trust service provider and the qualified trust  services it provides”. A CAB, as defined in point 13 of Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 is “a body  that performs conformity assessment activities…”, according to “a system of accreditation which functions  by reference to binding rules, [helping to] strengthen mutual confidence between Member States as  regards the competence of CABs and consequently the certificates and test reports issued by them.”  Additionally, the reference to the term “qualified” as it relates to the TSP and the trust services it provides,  8 ‘Conformity assessment body’ is defined in point 13 of Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 as “a body that  performs conformity assessment activities including calibration, testing, certification and inspection”  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  21  indicates a principal reason for why WebTrust does not align with eIDAS requirements; because there is no  current provision for the proper assessment of conformity with the existing standard for QTSPs issuing e.g.  QWACs.  ISO/IEC 27000 series  The ISO/IEC 27000 series represents the information security family of standards, which provides best  practices recommendations for the management of information security and covers a wide range of  general network and information security concerns. Table 3 outlines the preliminary set of documents in  this series.  ISO/IEC 27001 stipulates “the requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually  improving an information security management system within the context of the organization”. It also  encompasses requirements for “the assessment and treatment of information security risks tailored to the  needs of the organization. The requirements are generic and are intended to be applicable to all  organizations, regardless of type, size or nature”.9 This document requires that management  systematically examine security risks inherent to the business in question. Not unlike the ETSI protocols for  certification, ISO/IEC 27001 also focuses on the design and implementation of controls to this effect, and  the adoption of an overarching management process.  Table 3: ISO 27000 series relevant to this study  Whereas ISO/IEC 27000 and ISO/IEC 27001 outline foundational elements of ISMSs, ISO/IEC 27002 can be  read like a CP concerning a TSPs information security controls. Also important to this study are the  recommendations laid out in ISO/IEC 27006, ISO/IEC 27007 and ISO/IEC 27008, which comprise guidelines  9 cf. www.iso.org  STANDARD NO.

However, the trust scheme of ISO is very  similar and comparable to ETSI certification framework, as is shown in Figure 6.  Figure 6: The ISO trust framework (based on description of accreditation and certification process of the International  Accreditation Forum)  It should be made clear, however, that certification against ISO/IEC 27001 plus ISO/IEC 27006 does not  require that the CAB has competencies relating to trust services and does not require an assessment that  considers if the TSP follows any recognised best practices for the provision of trust services.  3.4.1 New work item (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27)  While there is currently no dedicated ISO standard for PKI, practices and corresponding policy frame- works,10 ISO is currently in discussion about such a standard as a new work item (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27),  tentatively entitled, “Information Technology – Security techniques - Public key infrastructure - Practices  and policy framework” (ISO SC 27/2WG4). This new work item proposal on information technology,  security techniques, PKI, practices and policy frameworks are, at the time of this draft, presently under  development.  The scope of this proposed work item includes the development of a framework of requirements to  manage information security for PKI TSPs through CPs, CPSs and, where applicable, their internal  underpinning by an ISMS. This requirements framework aims to include the assessment and management  of information security risks, which will be tailored to meet the agreed service requirements of its users, as  specified through the Certificate Policy. It also aims to help TSPs support multiple CPs. It intends to address  the life-cycle of public key certificates, but it is not intended to address authentication methods, non- repudiation requirements or key management protocols based on the use of public key certificates.  Moreover, the new work item will make use of concepts and requirements of an ISMS, as defined in  ISO/IEC 27000 and ISO/IEC 27001, respectively. It will also use the code of practice for information security  controls, as defined in ISO/IEC 27002. Specific PKI requirements (e.g. certificate content, identity proofing,  certificate revocation handling) will, however, not be addressed directly by a generic ISMS; it will in fact  depend on the scope of the audit chosen at the beginning of the process. The use of a generic ISMS is  extended through the application of PKI service requirements specified in the CP as described in the  10 A standard does exist, however, which is targeted at the financial sector in ISO 21188.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  23  present document. The planned ISO norm distinguishes between PKI systems used in closed, open and  contractual environments. It facilitates the implementation of “operational, baseline controls and practices  in a contractual environment”. Application of the norm to open or closed environments is not specifically  precluded.  Federal PKI  In contrast to the Trusted List framework of the eIDAS regulation, the US Federal PKI is a bridge CA  framework. Central to this trust framework is the Federal Bridge CA (FBCA), which acts as a trust hub for  disparate PKI domains (cf. (FPKI, 2015), (FPKI, 2012)). The Federal Policy Management Authority (FPKI  Management Authority) is the organization that operates and maintains the FBCA on behalf of the U.S.  Government, U.S. Federal PKI Policy Authority (FPKIPA). Figure 7 shows the trust framework of FPKI.  The FBCA is not an autonomous service as such, but rather consists of a framework of specific norms and  standards to determine the reliability of CAs, based on a standardized methodology for assessing  compliance with these norms and standards, and a cross-certification platform allowing CAs to cross- certify with the US Federal PKI Architecture at seven pre-defined assurance levels. The FBCA functions as a  non-hierarchical hub allowing relying parties to create certificate trust paths from their PKI domains back  to the PKI domain of the cross-certified CAs, so that the levels of assurance honoured by disparate CAs can  be more easily reconciled. The FBCA itself operates under the FBCA CP, which specifies seven different  levels of assurance.  All CAs have to demonstrate their compliance with the predefined assurance levels, by regular  independent audits in accordance with the published procedure.11 When a CA cross-certifies with the FPKI  architecture, and is an affiliate in good standing, a relying party operating an online application that utilizes  digital certificates for electronic identity authentication may choose to trust that PKI's digital certificates at  the Level(s) of Assurance asserted by those certificates. The purpose of the FBCA is to ensure that no other  trust requirements are needed for the relying party to make that determination. While designed  specifically with the benefit to US federal government services, the cross-certification approach is not  inherently restricted to any sector, application or domain. In fact, there are additional sectors using the  same approach and requesting the same conditions (e.g. SAFE Bio-pharma, etc.).  Figure 7: The trust framework of FPKI  Cross-certification with FBCA can demonstrate that the TSP operation and its security level is equivalent to  what the US government requires for their PKI system, which warrants harmonization. However, one  11 For more information, see https://www.idmanagement.gov/fpki-cas-audit-info/  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  24  notable problem with the system, as it currently stands, is that it is not updated very often and sometimes  includes TSPs that are trusted, although motivation to this level of trust may not be obvious.  Comparison of CA/B Forum guidelines, ETSI standards and WebTrust audit scheme  The standards that are employed by ETSI are developed by experts from different industries and all  requirements from the CA/B Forum and are included in the latest standards (ETSI, 2016a), (ETSI, 2016b),  (ETSI, 2016c).12 We refer to the ETSI approach as distributed because it makes use of a body of individual  standards. Some critics of this system cite the “disconnected” nature of the ETSI framework as a downside,  citing potential confusion from a reliance on so many external references (the scheme is not self-contained  like WebTrust) (Timmerman, 2004). Its distributed nature, however, suggests that the policy is flexible  enough to incorporate updated standards at a fairly granular level as ETSI produces them to reflect the  needs of the time. In particular, it draws particular focus to the democratic structure of how European  norms are drafted and implemented, placing high value on input and consensus from many actors rather  than favouring the few.  The criteria in the ETSI standards are also aligned with those of the CA/B Forum guidelines to facilitate  conformance to both best practices. Conformance to the requirements described in ETSI standards can  therefore demonstrate that the TSP fulfils the required assurance level in order to be trusted by browser  vendors and their users, as a product of the work of stakeholders across most or all pertinent industries.  This is the primary, generic use case for ETSI standards: to be valid inside the European community for  different levels of CPs. An EN 319 403-based conformity assessment scheme, for example, can be used to  assess conformance to the CA/B Forum guidelines as well as the ETSI standards. Inclusion in the browsers’  trusted root stores is an additional feature of ETSI certification.  Regarding the frequency of assessment, the ETSI audit cycle is two years, meaning that full assessments  are performed every second year, while annual surveillance assessments are performed in between.  Ultimately, the ETSI audit may result in a certification that legitimizes a TSP to perform certain activities in  the future by assessing if the body is capable and ready to perform those activities. For PTC, the CA/B  Forum requires annual audits, whereas in the context of eIDAS, the audit cycle is biennial.  One important aspect and defining feature of the ETSI scheme is the reliance it puts on the competence  and autonomy of individual auditors, and the extent to which he or she is afforded the flexibility to make  judgments during the audit process, and for its conclusion. On the one hand, more flexibility and trust in  the individual auditor reveals a \"human weakness\" in the trust chain (Timmerman, 2004); a TSP with and  overlooked security flaw could go “into the wild” and impact the ecosystem, as with the major breaches of  the past. However, this grim prognosis delivers an opportunity for narrowing on and addressing the  individual points of weakness along the chain. Specifically, this means that part of the solution to a more  dynamic, powerful system lies in the judgment of the auditors themselves and at least a second person  (certifier) who reviews the whole process and every single judgement done by the auditor in the  certification stage. To this end, more should be done to educate and support these actors. This point is  introduced more narrowly in chapter 6 as a pathway to systems improvement and improved global  acceptance of eIDAS audits.  Similar to the ETSI scheme (EN 319 403 requires the observation of the past period of time to the previous  audit), WebTrust is inherently interested in past performance, meaning that the ETSI certification gives the  12 It should be noted that whereas the eIDAS Regulation issues legal requirements, ETSI CP are norms (e.g. how to  conduct audits via EN 319 403) and are not mandatory for audits pertaining to QWACs under eIDAS. However, the  ETSI requirements are mandated by the CA/B Forum.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  25  TSP one or two years in advance to keep going while WebTrust certifies what the TSP did last year (AIM- BEUC Joint Initiative, 2012). It should be considered what a WebTrust auditor does when he or she  identifies a fundamental misconduct of the TSP when performing a review of past activities (e.g. ten  months ago). It is not entirely clear what happens with the TSP’s approval, from a retroactive perspective.  In cases such as these, ETSI has been cited as a more advanced system, in which changes to the operations  are always considered to the CAB before they are allowed to be implemented and taken into operation.  The trust framework for WebTrust is, at least in hierarchy, comparable with ETSI: Figure 5 lays out the  simplified structure for the trust framework, which can be compared with Figure 4 describing the ETSI trust  framework. One major difference in the system’s organization is in the absence of a “harmonization body”.  Originally developed by the AICPA and CICA, “the WebTrust program is now managed by the Chartered  Professional Accountants of Canada”. Public accounting firms and practitioners, who are specifically  licensed by CPA Canada, can provide assurance services to evaluate and test whether the services provided  by a particular Certification Authority meet these principles and criteria.”13 Since there are no other  accreditation bodies responsible for this scheme which could possibly interpret requirements in a different  way, harmonization across audits is automatically guaranteed.  Although the WebTrust and ETSI audit schemes are intended to achieve the same objectives, namely to  obtain (root and issuing) TSPs’ recognition and inclusion by browsers, there are a number of important  differences both in the practice of implementing the structure as well as important differences pertaining  to the theoretical underpinning of both trust frameworks. WebTrust is a nearly self-contained document  that hardly contains any external references, as opposed to ETSI, which refers to an expanding and  evolving body of external standards. This allows WebTrust auditors a somewhat more straightforward  process by which to conduct the assessment, but critics have, in the past, pointed out that it lacks the  durability and flexibility of consensus-based standards which reflect the needs of a larger sample of  industry stakeholders. However, recently, WebTrust has surveyed TSPs and browsers for their opinions  about possibilities for improving and updating their audit program. In this case, we see some convergence  forming between WebTrust and ETSI.  In practice, WebTrust generally employs a comprehensive set of illustrative controls, describing in detail  the stated objectives and how a TSP might meet those objectives, often (though not always) in more  specific terms than the ETSI audit. More specifically, WebTrust mirrors the exact requirements set forth by  the CA/B Forum, adding detailed instructions about how the control objectives might be reached, since  this is a primary focus of the audit. This is designed to reduce the probability of human error and to bring  added efficiency to the assessment of control objectives. The case can be made, however, that this focus  on rules and illustrative controls removes a large degree of the autonomy of the independent auditor to  issue an assessment based on his or her professional judgment, a point which will emerge later in this  report as a feature of the proposed roadmap towards global acceptance of the eIDAS audits. This study  regards the education and capability of individual auditors as integral to the system as a whole; the  checkbox approach inadvertently disarms auditors, who should be educated and empowered to think  critically and make decisions, as opposed to fulfilling the obligation of making sure a discrete list of  illustrative controls is aligned.  Like the ETSI scheme, the WebTrust audit criteria include all defined requirements from CA/B Forum (CPA,  2014)(CPA, 2016). Therefore, conformance to the WebTrust framework can also demonstrate that the TSP  fulfils the required assurance level in order to be trusted by browser vendors and their users.  13 WebTrust: www.webtrust.org/item64428.aspx  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  26  Visual guide to the trust frameworks criteria  Table 4: Comparison between the trust frameworks (based on (Hamaguchi, 2016))  ETSI  WEBTRUST eIDAS FPKI ISO 27000  Law  Supports eIDAS  Regulation  N/A eIDAS Regulation  e-Government Act of  2002  N/A  Objective  Technical interoperability  and trusted third party  assessment  Technical interoperability  and trusted third party  assessment  Legal recognition of  electronic trust services  Identity management and  trust across  organizational,  operational, physical and  network boundaries  Information security  Governor ETSI Board N/A EU Committee CIO Council  Harmonization Body ETSI ESI PKI Assurance Task Force FESA N/A  Accreditation Body  National Accreditation  Bodies  CPA Canada NAB FPKI Policy Authority  National Accreditation  Bodies  Conformity Assessment  Body  CAB accredited to  EN 319 403  Same as above  Conformity Assessment  Body  FPKI Certificate Policy  Working Group  Conformity Assessment  Body  Supporting Technical  Standards  ETSI Standards, CA/B  Forum: BRG, EVCG +  NetSec  WebTrust Criteria  ETSI Standards, CEN  Standards  NIST SPs, FIPS 201, FPKIPA  Documents  Assurance to be  achieved  Best Practices and  Legal Compliance  Best Practices Legal Compliance  Technical Compliance,  Interoperability with FPKI  system  Technical Compliance to  Management  Requirements  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  27  4. Comparison of Auditing Standards for TSPs  As discussed in chapter 2, there is no implementing act for the assessment criteria for the conducting of a  conformity assessment by accredited CABs (Article 20 (4) in the eIDAS Regulation). However, for cases of  assessing QTSPs for QWACs, the usage of ETSI EN 319 401, ETSI EN 319 411-2, supported by ETSI EN 319  411-1 and connected standards, should be expected. A reasonable next step would be to examine these  standards and compare them with other mentioned standards, especially with WebTrust as a leading  competing audit scheme. This was performed by means of a comparison of the criteria of the mentioned  ETSI and WebTrust standards.  A common discussion is about the level of detail of the criteria as they are described in the standards. If  requirements are more detailed, the possibility for different assessors to reach the same results would be  higher. However, detailed requirements may deter the free interpretation about the fulfilment of the  requirements.  Hence, in this report, each of the criteria has been assessed on level of detail. This assessment yields an  overview of the level of detail of the above-mentioned ETSI standards and give indication of the degrees of  freedom that auditors may be able to interpret differently. It is especially when norms, or the criteria  supporting those norms, are not explicit or very detailed, that the auditor will be asked to use his  professional judgment for assessing criteria and ultimately making judgments about the control objectives  and management systems.  This chapter presents a tabulated assessment that includes the level of detail of the controls of the  examined standards, which are qualitatively categorized in one of the three levels, based on (Timmerman,  2004), s indicated below:   High: The control criteria or evaluation guidance provided is detailed or includes tangible bench-marks.  In other words, how a control objective is achieved is considered in addition to what that objective  comprises. For example, “Physical barriers are in place (e.g. solid walls that extend from real floor to  real ceiling) to prevent unauthorized entry and environmental contamination to the CA’s certificate  manufacturing facility.”   Medium: The qualitative criteria are provided at a relatively high level of detail. How those objectives  are achieved, however, is generally less concrete. For example, “Physical protection shall be achieved  through the creation of clearly defined security perimeters.”   Low: Only the control objectives are provided. Commonly, what the control objective is, but not how it  is to be or should be achieved. For example, “The integrity and authenticity of the status information  shall be protected.”  Although WebTrust contains many illustrative guidance controls in addition to the high-level control  objectives, they do not necessarily yield non-compliance when not adhered to, but they do provide a  higher level of detail for interpreting the control objective. These controls were, therefore, taken into  consideration when evaluating the level of detail of the control objective. Evidently, they provide  meaningful tips and guidelines for both the manager implementing a system, and the auditor assessing the  (management) system, thereby framing the professional judgment of the auditor. It is for that reason that,  even though illustrative controls have no mandatory status, these controls are included in the comparisons  throughout this report.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  28  ETSI requirements  We start with the examination of the level of detail of ETSI standards which could/should be used by a CAB  for a conformity assessment of a TSP. The level of detail of the ETSI standards which could/should be used  by a CAB for a conformity assessment of a TSP (i.e. the controls of ETSI EN 319 401, ETSI EN 319 411-1 and  -2) are listed in the checklist contained in ETSI TR 119 411-4.14 This checklist provides all requirements  identifiers in such a way that it can be used by the TSP itself to prepare for an assessment of its practices  against the current standards (i.e. to serve as a basis for a self-declaration) and/or by the assessor when  conducting the assessment, for the sake of facility for both the assessor and the TSP being assessed. We  use here the expression “detail” exactly as it is used in (Timmerman, 2004) and follow the methodology of  (Timmerman, 2004).  Table 5 is a sample (high-order) extract of TR 119 411-4 to help give an idea about the content of the full  list. In this sample, the column “CA/B Forum Requirement” is omitted, since it is not relevant to any  technical requirement. The column “CA/B Forum Requirement” provides the reference from where the  technical requirement originates, when relevant. To indicate the severity of the requirement:   the term \"shall\" indicates requirements strictly to be followed in order to conform to the standard and  from which no deviation is permitted;   the term \"should\" indicates that among several possibilities one is recommended as particularly suit- able, without mentioning or excluding others, or that a certain course of action is preferred but not  necessarily required, or that (in the negative form) a certain possibility or course of action is  deprecated but not prohibited.  To summarize, the examined ETSI requirements in general are principle-based. Control objectives are  stated at the beginning of each section, frequently broken down into more detailed control objectives and  enriched with guidelines on what elements should be controlled to cover the objective. However, not all  elements are illustrated by measurable controls to validate effectiveness of the control objective. This is  also reflected in the fact that level of detail of the majority of these requirements received a score of  Medium.  14 This checklist can be found at https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/119400_119499/11941104/01.01.01_60/  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  29  Table 5: High-order extract of checklist ETSI TR 119 411-4  DOCUMENT  REFERENCE  REQUIREMENT  REFERENCE SEVERITY MAIN SECTION SUBSECTION  LEVEL OF  DETAIL  [ETSI 319 411-1] OVR-5.1-03 should  General provisions on Certification Practice  Statement and Certificate Policies  General requirements High  [ETSI 319 411-2] OVR-5.1-03 shall  General provisions on Certification Practice  Statement and Certificate Policies  General requirements High  [ETSI 319 411-2] OVR-5.1-04  shall  General provisions on Certification Practice  Statement and Certificate Policies  General requirements High  [ETSI 319 411-2] OVR-5.1-05  shall  General provisions on Certification Practice  Statement and Certificate Policies  General requirements High  [ETSI 319 401] REQ-5-01 shall Risk Assessment Risk Assessment Low  [ETSI 319 401] REQ-5-02 shall Risk Assessment Risk Assessment Low  [ETSI 319 401] REQ-5-03 shall Risk Assessment Risk Assessment Low  [ETSI 319 401] REQ-5-04 shall Risk Assessment Risk Assessment Low  [ETSI 319 411-1] OVR-5.1-03 should  General provisions on Certification Practice  Statement and Certificate Policies  General requirements High  [ETSI 319 411-2] OVR-5.1-03 shall  General provisions on Certification Practice  Statement and Certificate Policies General requirements High  [ETSI 319 411-2] OVR-5.1-04  shall  General provisions on Certification Practice  Statement and Certificate Policies  General requirements High  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  30  Requirements of WebTrust for CAs  In this section, we examine the level of detail of the criteria in WebTrust15. Once again we use the  expression \"detail\" exactly as it is used in (Timmerman, 2004). Table 6 analyses the level of detail  concerning the “WebTrust Principles and Criteria for Certification Authorities – Extended Validation SSL”  (WebTrust EV SSL) (CPA, 2014), and Table 7 analyses the “WebTrust Principles and Criteria for Certification  Authorities – SSL Baseline with Network Security” (CPA, 2016) (WebTrust Principles and Criteria for CAs).  The analysis is based on the analysis of the authors following the methodology of (Timmerman, 2004).

Here, rather than a mapping and comparison of the hundreds of individual requirements in  detail, we were interested in whether there may be significant differences in the level of detail between  the standards that could influence acceptance. The results of this comparison survey can be found below  in Table 8. If the level of detail is not equal, then the name of Webtrust or ETSI is indicated in Table 8.

By and large, the requirements from the ETSI standards under consideration can be  found in the world of WebTrust and vice versa.  The CA/B Forum16, as a voluntary organization comprising major browser vendors and TSPs, has specified  guidelines for TSPs: Extended Validation Guidelines (CA/Browser Forum, 2012), Baseline Requirements  (CA/Browser Forum, 2017) and Network and Certificate System Security Guidelines (CA/Browser Forum,  2013). These guidelines are for the TSPs to know what they have to do, but they are not necessarily  requirements for achieving inclusion in the browsers’ root stores. That is to say, it is not sufficient as a  stand-alone audit, but indirectly, via ETSI or WebTrust, the TSP must fulfill all of the requirements. The  browsers have policies and procedures that the TSPs must comply with in order to be included; in the  various root store policies is stated that the TSP must be compliant with them in order to achieve inclusion.  The ETSI standards include requirements from the above three guidelines, which are covered in the EN 319  4xx series documents. Moreover, WebTrust has adjusted its requirements and specifically has adopted the  (CPA, 2011) and (CPA, 2014) to meet the CA/Browser Forum Baseline SSL requirements.  According to both the in-depth technical analysis of this and other studies, as well as the judgment from  industry experts, the WebTrust audit scheme is more or less equivalent to the ETSI audit scheme in  purpose and outcome. By and large, the requirements from the ETSI standards under consideration for the  assessment of TSPs can be found in the world of WebTrust and vice versa. Likewise, the degree of detail in  the ETSI standards considered above and for WebTrust are also comparable. Therefore, from the  generalised point of view, there is no reason to prefer ETSI or WebTrust.  WebTrust assessments are performed by independent accountant firms, which are recognized by CPA  Canada. That is to say, if the WebTrust scheme is compared with the ETSI scheme, CPA Canada can  generally be regarded in parallel as an accreditation body. On the other hand, assessment and certification  in accordance with ETSI standards are often performed by a CAB accredited by a NAB (as set out in the  previous chapter). This scheme is similar to the ISO certification scheme. Capabilities of CABs are ensured  16 CA/B Forum web page: https://cabforum.org/  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  35  by the NABs, and the NABs are regulated by European Co-operation for Accreditation (EA). In this case, the  ETSI scheme stands out as a more regulated environment, with bodies in place to oversee the full length of  the trust chain, from the highest level of administration down through each individual TSP. While the two  schemes look very similar, ETSI is characterized by this higher level of organization. The ETSI trust  framework can also be considered more transparent, a characteristic typically seen as valuable across all  levels of the ICT industry, since all rules for the assessment are published and publicly accessible.  The level of detail of the requirements as they are described in the criteria in auditing is more important in  an ETSI driven world. If the criteria include more detailed requirements, the reproducibility of the audit  result would be high (even among different CABs, which are accredited by NABs within different Member  States). This means that the possibility for different assessors to reach the same results would be higher  when more detailed requirements are included. It does not mean the ETSI requirements are less complete,  effective or comprehensive criteria, but this difference about the detail levels may cause different  assessors (CABs) to deliver different decisions when assessing the same TSP according the ETSI standards.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  36  5. QWACs Recognition and Visibility  In today’s internet, browsers are necessary for providing access to the world wide web, and to this end, as  the gate-keepers of information and the secure transmission thereof, browsers wield significant weight  both in how relying parties and end users experience the deployment of certificates, and also internally to  the industry.  With this in mind, eIDAS audits, which are foundational to the European trust scheme, require the  successful deployment of QWACs into a healthy and developing digital market, here in Europe and abroad  in the wider digital world. A most notable area that needs to be addressed in order to facilitate the wide  spread and use of the QWACs lies in discussions with major browser vendors, who operate the largest  public-facing vehicle for website authentication certificate usage and European counterparts, i.e. in ETSI,  ACAB’c and other boards and agencies that exist to protect and strengthen the interests of the EU in the  global community.  This assessment views the promotion of QWACs at a high level; standards themselves can be written to  bridge technical gaps (an important point that will be covered in the roadmap), but if the system for trust  supersedes the a priori value of the (auditing) system in question, the marginal utility of QWACs will in fact  decrease. It is the task of all stakeholders of this effort to engage in the promotion of QWACs at the same  time that the audit scheme is tightened in language and in scope of the utility and value TSPs and browsers  place in it.  Visualization and visibility  It is no exaggeration to say that, without the help of various tools like indicators on the browser user  interface (UI), the average (i.e. technically inexperienced) internet user would not be able to determine  whether or not a website is secured by a corresponding valid QWAC. For example, the verification step in  which the TSP issuing a website authentication certificate was granted the “qualified” status requires that  the TSP be identified by reading and understanding the certificate, followed by a check that this status is  included in the trusted list of the EU Member State in which the TSP is located. It is by no means self- explanatory for the average end-user to know about, let alone to locate, peruse and interpret this list.  Moreover, trusted lists are primarily machine-processable documents (in XML); the legal entities “behind  the scenes” are often hidden behind trade names. In the current configuration of the trust service  environment (not only in Europe, but in the rest of the world), users will find it difficult to mark the  distinction between qualified and non-qualified trust services that any one single qualified TSP may  provide.  Web browsers have a special and important role to play here. Evidence from a number of studies  demonstrates that the average user has been educated (through the use of various web browsers active  on the market) in recent years in such a way that he or she has come to expect to see various indicators  (e.g. a URL with “https”, a green bar or padlock symbol, etc.) guaranteeing (by means of a certificate) the  security of the website currently open. More informed users may also note the difference in the web  browser UI when a webpage is secured by an Extended Validation (EV) certificate (as opposed to e.g. a  Domain Validated (DV) certificate). Until very recently, it appears that one could assume that this has more  or less become established, and browser providers would continue to handle security visibility in this way.  However, during the drafting of this study, the landscape has already changed with the latest versions of  Chrome and iOS, Apple’s mobile operating system. It appears that some browsers will change their UI and  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  37  not indicate the use of EV certificates anymore. This is one area to keep a close eye on over time and is the  basis for a strong set of recommendations in the following chapter.  5.1.1 What we have now: No industry consensus on standards for UI security indicators  Figure 8 gives a sample of the ways in which security is denoted by different browsers in different contexts.  While there is generally a hierarchy for UI marking (in so far as DV and EV certificates generally use  different indicators), there are different approaches between the browsers and between individual  browsers’ approaches to the UI that the argument has surfaced at trust service conferences and  workshops17 in the past several years in favour of unifying the browser iconography of security. The lack of  consistency among browser UI is and has long been a persistent challenge, and often appears as granular  indications of four states of security: unencrypted, Domain Validated (DV), Organization validated (OV) and  Extended Validation (EV). This can be problematic for several reasons, namely that criminal threats can  easily hide behind a DV certificate and because DV certificates have exploded into popularity, accounting  for a majority of website encryption, a problem eIDAS both sought to and has the capacity to address.  However, individual browsers have frequently changed their own UI, and it has been claimed that users  cannot keep up. Most mobile devices do not even show a symbol for encryption and, as a result, users can  be confused about how to read the browser UI and determine the safety of their online behaviour.  To date, however, despite lengthy industry discussion, no streamlining of these images or texts has taken  any public shape or direction.  Figure 8: Examples of browser UI for SSL/TLS encryption across device (Source: Security Council (CASC) May 2017 CA)  5.1.2 The future of browser security UI  Google has chosen to follow a different path with the Chrome browser. While aggressively promoting  HTTPS web encryption in the last few years, the Google Chrome security team has come to distrust CAs  and other “trusted third-parties”. In October 2017, in fact, Google began transitioning to a mandatory  policy of “Certificate Transparency” (CT), opening the way for an online community of open certificate logs,  monitors and auditors to provide near real-time validation of certificates. This push away (Fiedler, 2014)  17 E.g. CA Day Berlin 2017 & 2018, CA/B Forum meeting (Taipei), etc.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  38  from the certificate authority-based infrastructure relies on disintermediated – so-called “qualified” –  certificate logs18 for SSL/TLS end-entity certificates. Under the rules of this new “public” trust framework, if  a TSP does not include a certificate in the CT log server, it will not be trusted by Chrome or, recently, by  Apple’s Safari browser. As a logical consequence, Google has since banned the green bar in the Chrome UI  that use to indicate the deployment of an EV certificate (though Chrome 70 still has an EV indicator by  displaying the company name on the left-hand side of the URL bar). The TSP community and  representatives from other leading browsers have been public and vocal against this latest measure to  distrust trusted third parties and, especially, to simplify the UI in such a way that they claim undermines  long-vetted and practiced public understanding of web security features like the padlock and green URL  bar.  The Chrome browser has certainly introduced a number of radical changes to the web and user inter- action with the internet, and the Chrome security team is considering yet another controversial initiative:  fundamentally rethinking URLs and showing information in the address bar. While the Chrome security  team does not presently believe that URLs work well conveying website identity, Google plans to move  “toward a place where web identity is understandable by everyone – they know who they’re talking to  when they’re using a website and they can reason about whether they can trust them.” However, this will  mean substantial changes in how and when Chrome displays a URL.  It is therefore by no means clear what web browsers will show in their UI in the coming months, let alone  in the coming years. While in a world of different certificates (e.g. EV certificates and QWACs), it seems  from the plurality of industry voices both reasonable and preferable to be able to recognize these  differences when visiting a web page secured by a certificate; today there does not seem to be any activity  by browser vendors that supports this conviction. Instead there are grounds to assume that browser  vendors, especially Google, are likely to define, on their own, which websites they choose and refuse to  render.  5.1.3 Difficulties inherent to a separate QWAC UI  One could argue that because browsers are extendable, it should be possible to develop extensions that  indicate on the browser UI whether a website is secured (and, specifically, by a QWAC) or not. The modern  extension frameworks of Firefox and Chrome – and therefore also Opera, Edge and Vivaldi, which mimic  Google Chrome’s extension architecture (at least at the time of this writing) – allow the display of buttons  and/or icons on the browser UI. This could be, for example, a green or red button on the right-hand side of  the address panel or even to open a new small browser window that displays some explanatory  information. However, extensions are not able to assume control of the normal behaviour of the browser,  a rule defined by the browser vendors. If the browser indicates that a user should not trust an SSL/TLS  connection because the corresponding SSL/TLS certificate cannot be found in so called “qualified”  certificate transparency (CT) logs for SSL/TLS end-entity certificates, this cannot be changed by modern  extensions. In the case of a QWAC that cannot be found in the CT logs, this would trigger trust concerns for  users, even if the extension shows that the website uses a QWAC. Moreover, if the browser should refuse  to render websites in which the corresponding SSL/TLS-certificate cannot be found in so called “qualified”  CT logs for SSL/TLS end-entity certificates, then the proposed extensions will either be useless or need to  open a second window, which would then render the previously-refused website. Unfortunately, it is  difficult to imagine the scenario in which any customer would put much trust in such a solution.  Moreover, both on desktops and mobile devices, there is currently no way to directly provide information  about a given SSL/TLS connection to extensions based solely on modern extension frameworks. This  18 The term “qualified” in reference to Google CT must not be conflated or confused with eIDAS “qualified”.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  39  implies that the evaluation of the corresponding certificates and the validation of QWACS must be  implemented outside such an extension, i.e. by so called native messaging (s.(Mozilla, 2018)), which leads  to additional security questions.  5.1.4 The EU trust mark as a possible branding tool  Visualizing whether a website is secured by a QWAC is only one side of the coin. The visibility of the eIDAS  framework and of QTSPs and confidence in websites using QWACs is another. The confidence of the  average user to trust a website (e.g. the websites of European banks) can be based on the use of QWACs.  One of several building blocks of the EU to support the visibility of eIDAS system of QTS in the market is  the introduction of the EU trust mark (EU Commission, 2015) and its direct linking to the trusted lists. The  rules for the use of trust mark, as well as the specifications relating to the form of the EU trust mark for  qualified trust services are set in the eIDAS Regulation (EU Commission, 2014) and the above-mentioned  implementing regulation (EU Commission, 2015). The trust mark is intended to give reassurance to  customers about the confidence they can have in a certain TSP and, by extension, the area of the web they  are visiting, should it be secured with a QWAC. Once a TSP is granted the qualified status (and such status  being indicated in the trusted list), it may use the EU trust mark to indicate in a simple, recognisable and  clear manner the QTS they provide. When using the trust mark for QTS, QTSPs need to ensure that a link to  the relevant trusted list is made available on their website.  Getting browsers on board  The following section summarises key assertions presented in a paper entitled “Trust Service Provider  Technical Best Practices Considering the EU eIDAS Regulation (910/2014)”, which was developed in mid- 2017 by representatives from the leading browsers: Apple, Google, Microsoft and Mozilla.  A major point leading the report focuses on the need to look beyond the scope of what European national  or supranational governments can accomplish. While regulatory options do exist for the management of  planned activities and institutionalized learning behaviours, the eIDAS regulation expressly stipulates that  industry-led initiatives are not only an appropriate strategy, but a desirable one as well. In specific the  regulation stipulates that “Recognizing that ‘best practices in the field’ change over time, Recital 67 in the  Regulation considers industry-led initiatives to define appropriate best practices”. This is, in effect, because  the field of ICT has a propensity towards significant and frequent change. This point suggests the  significance of its own influence on the recommendations that this study makes towards meeting its goal  (see Chapter 6 for the road map).  While the legislative course might not be a match in speed for developments in technology, market tools  (broadly speaking, companies and specialist industry groups that comprise said digital ecosystem) might be  successfully interlinked to maintain the demand for cryptographic products and strategies, for the purpose  of combating cybercrime as well as to modernize government and civil applications. It also supports the  idea that key industry players like the browser vendors have a significant role to play.  This report provides an example for convergence or overlap between eIDAS and industry efforts to make  available TSP security across-the-board.  This is achieved by means of best practices which are themselves  not necessarily addressed in Implementing Acts on electronic trust services.  While there are a number of representative requirements for each major trust framework, there still exist  discrepancies between the standards set out for PTC and those for QWACs under eIDAS.  Figure 9 shows  the relevant gaps that exist between requirements for CA/B Forum PTC certificates and those for QWACs.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  40  Figure 9: Requirements for PTC and QWAC (and identified gaps)  The TSP best practice report also describes what defines an \"incident\", and lays out the steps necessary or  industry-accepted standards for appropriate response behaviour to such deviations in accepted normal  operations by TSPs:19 “An incident is any event, situation, or circumstance that has, could have, or might  cause the TSP to operate outside the requirements laid down by the Certification Authorities/Browsers  (CA/B) Forum Baseline Requirements or Extended Validation (EV) Guidelines, Root Store Policies, Audit  Requirements, or other security relevant obligation”. This definition helps to establish a baseline for what  \"acceptable\" or \"normal\" TSP operational behaviour looks like, in order for incidents to be identified and  appropriately addressed.  Although little is written in the current draft of the report about the mechanics of incident handling, it is  expressed in no uncertain terms how important incident-reporting is, as well as establishing intelligible  19 It should be noted that these guidelines or recommendations for security best practices can be observed without  specific reference to any technology to lead the way. This point is meant to suggest that, while, for example, Google  can be part of the contributors to these sets of guidelines for TSPs, trying to force an industry conversion to  certificate transparency (CT) has no real bearing on e.g. certificate lifecycles and etc., or the reporting requirement  for TSPs that experience an incident.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  41  protocols for following up.20 It appears that incident-reporting is one of the best ways that the system itself  can maintain a consistent level of ecological security; unfortunately, it is a reactive, rather than a  preventative response to security threats. It also seeks to minimize damage from breaches and other  attacks with e.g. a 72-hour maximum requirement for reporting and response, it does not offer a way to  prevent damage from occurring.  There is also a variety of agents to whom the TSP needs to report (and thus, have an appropriate  communications plan for reporting), including auditors and supervisory bodies, but especially to the root  store operators, a point which diverges somewhat from the overall hierarchical trust framework currently  employed within the eIDAS environment.  Another notable message from this study is the advice from the browser community that TSPs undergo  audits with a frequency of no less than one per year, which indicates a convergence with the WebTrust  requirement of an annual auditing requirement. In 2015, ETSI changed the audit cycles from three to two  years (see ETSI EN 319 403). The best practices study makes specific reference to this ETSI audits cycle of  two years, based on the eIDAS Regulation, which stipulates that a full conformance audit, rather than a  surveillance audit, would be necessary to constitute the successful completion of an annual audit in this  case. This presents an opportunity for both ETSI and eIDAS to close a gap that currently exists in strong  audit requirements as perceived by the browser community.  Furthermore, \"if an Auditor finds non-compliance with Audit Criteria, the Auditor should provide a  qualified report that indicates the controls that failed. If there are any changes in the certification status of  a TSP, the TSP should notify Root Store Operators immediately\". This statement indicates a divergence in  stated policy from e.g. ETSI audit standards, and the best practices set forth by the lead browser  community. The fundamental difference is in the inroads of communication through which the root store  operators are involved in the audit process. In this case, deficiencies in an audit report are suggested to be  notified by the TSP to the root store operator in addition to the requirement that they advise the  supervisory body (as required in eIDAS Article 19). A point-in-time audit statement may be used to address  a TSP that has rectified said deficiencies, but this only validates a TSP's practices on that particular date.  Indeed, it seems that regular audits, supplemented with these spot checks for interim inadequacies, are a  good way to manage the ecosystem.  As reaction to browser requirements, in July 2018, ETSI also published technical specification TS 119 403-2  (Additional Requirements for Conformity Assessment Bodies Auditing Trust Service Providers that issue  Publicly-Trusted Certificates), with the expectation that it would lead to the preparation of audit reports  that are more compliant with the browser requirements, although the reports are not required to report  publicly about any details of instances of non-compliance. Section 4.2 Audit Frequency states both that, “a  full-surveillance audit shall be conducted no less frequently than annually” and that, “updated audit  information shall be provided no less frequently than annually” (see ETSI EN 319 403, clause 7.4.6). In  addition, a current CA/B Forum ballot is under preparation to make the requirements from TS 119 403  mandatory for all ETSI audits for PTC.  Incidentally, and in consideration of appropriate management systems, the study in question also suggests  that “the CA's Certificate Policy (CP) and Certificate Practice Statement (CPS) must provide enough detail  to allow third parties to assess how TSPs enforce imposed requirements”. This is a particularly important  point, which specifically addresses the intelligibility of the CP and CPS of a TSP to third parties. A CP or CPS  20 This comment may be updated after 14 October 2018, after which the latest approved ballot will take effect.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  42  which only states that it meets CA/B Forum’s Baseline Requirements (an industry “open secret” that many,  if not most, CPs today are a copied verbatim from the BR) is not sufficiently detailed enough.  Lastly, for the purposes of this study, an interesting point was made concerning liability: the “inability to  update software due to insufficient engineering resources, contractual barriers, reprioritization, or other  delay is not a valid reason for non-compliance”. This presents an interesting economic approach to the  security ecosystem problem. It is worth discussing this statement as a theoretical end game in economic  terms e.g. what happens if it becomes too financially onerous for a large company providing certificates to  perform critical updates. Whereas small holes in the TSP infrastructure can be mended quickly by other  TSPs issuing cross-over certificates, security measures should be in place to deal with a hypothetical end- of-days event, should a “too big to fail” TSP cease to offer continuity. To illustrate, before the 2008 global  financial collapse, the collapse of large, global financial institutions was unthinkable. It is perhaps worth  exploring the possibility of ecosystem-wide failure scenarios and draft a body of documents which can help  identify and reduce such risks. A robust audit scheme will help curb the possibility of these kinds of events.  It should be noted that there has been criticism on the report from industry experts, which includes the  focus on root store operators – as bodies which see themselves as responsible for policing the operation of  TSPs – rather than a closer focus on the role of eIDAS regulatory requirements. Secondly is the section  about Certificate Transparency, which suggests that all PTC should be published to a public domain, a point  which avoids taking into account any restrictions which might apply under the rules of the European  General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which went into effect in May 2018. As a final note, some  experts have agreed that all the security requirements addressed in this study can be comfortably covered  by the current version of ETSI EN 319 411-1.  However, it appears that the recommendations issued by the browser community in this study have  regardless made some compelling suggestions about convergences and divergences between audit  requirements on the books and best industry practices, a number of which this study moulds into the  language of recommendations in the roadmap in Chapter 6.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  43  6. Conclusions and Recommendations (Road Map)  From our preliminary conclusions and based on the comparative analysis specifically between the eIDAS  regulatory framework and the ETSI and WebTrust audit schemes, we can offer the following  recommendations as a way forward for the eventual, enhanced global acceptance of an audit scheme  under the eIDAS Regulation. The recommendations can be separated into three basic categories of action:  1) making improvements to the existing scheme based on ETSI EN 319 4xx, 2) creating a branding and  public usage strategy for QWACs usage, in part by creating value for the EU trust mark and enforcing it by  law and 3) continuing to foster relationships and cooperating closely with browser vendors for better  acceptance.  Annex A includes diagrams to visualize the predicted effort required to carry out actions in each of the  recommended direction as a result from the assessment made by experts in the context of this report.  Improving the audits, top down  6.1.1 Harmonization of the conformity assessment scheme  As already discussed, the eIDAS Regulation does not place any restrictions on the conformity assessment  scheme beyond its fit into the general regulatory framework of conformity assessment in Regulation (EC)  No 765/2008. It is up to the supervisory body to specify any requirements for CAB accreditation against  any specific audit scheme. Nearly all supervisory bodies have adopted the use of EN 319 403. Without the  adoption of a scheme aimed specifically at trust services, this is may be no assurance that the CAB has the  appropriate procedures and competencies for the audit of trust services. The eIDAS Regulation does not  impose any conformity assessment criteria beyond the requirements of the Regulation. There is no  requirement for assessment against recognised best practices for trust services.  Some of the publicly-available eIDAS audit attestations do not contain the minimum-required information,  which are required to assess the trust status of a TSP. In fact, many appear untrustworthy and cannot be  downloaded from a QWAC-secured website. In comparison with the WebTrust audit scheme, these  particular deficiencies of the eIDAS audit come into focus. According to interviewed experts, a comparison  of several audit reports from different European TSPs and CABs reveals notable dissonance.  Moreover, the decision regarding the qualification of the TSP and its trust services is made by the SB that  verifies compliance with the requirements laid down in eIDAS Regulation. However, the decision regarding  the specific practices used for qualification of the TSP is made by the SB. There are no defined  requirements on the use of best practice standards across the EU. This may result in inconsistencies in the  qualification of TSPs in different countries and may lead to a non-harmonised trust service market,  facilitating the rise of doubts about the quality of QTSP and the provided QTS, hence also the QWACs.  Therefore, there is need to define a harmonised conformity assessment scheme against which CABs would  be accredited and the QTSP/QTS certified in order to verify conformance to the eIDAS Regulation  requirements. This harmonised conformity assessment scheme would ensure that the eIDAS requirements  are satisfied, while at the same time meeting the requirements of other communities like the CA/Browser  Forum, browser vendors and application providers. This process would involve the Supervisory Bodies of  the MS as key contributors towards the specification of this conformity assessment scheme.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  44  There is need to agree upon and define a harmonised conformity assessment scheme against which  CABs would be accredited and the QTSP/QTS assessed in order to verify conformance to the eIDAS  Regulation requirements. Such a process would involve all the stakeholders – EA, ETSI, EC, ENISA, SBs  – which would participate from the specification till the enforcement of such a scheme.  One possible way forward is to map the ETSI audit scheme with the ISO 27000 series. However, used  alone, this does not include best practice for trust services and does not ensure that the auditor has the  necessary competencies to evaluate the specifics of trust services. ISO/SC27/WG4 has started a new work  item, entitled “Public key infrastructure – Practices and policy framework”. To integrate the set of ETSI  documents into the ISO framework can help eIDAS achieve better acceptance, but the quality of the ISO  audit practice in the field is not (yet) defined appropriately.  The current list of accredited CABs in the EU is not frequently updated,21 potentially causing some  confusion. It is proposed as a relatively simple step to keep a centralised list of all accredited CABs, where  it will be clearly indicated whether a CAB has been accredited under ETSI EN 319 403 by a NAB and  whether it has been accredited in line with the ETSI standards concerning the certification scheme in order  to be recognised also by the CA/B forum and the browsers. This list should be regularly updated and  provide a higher level of confidence. A list with all international licenced auditors is maintained by  WebTrust website.22  A centralised list of all accredited CABs should be maintained (by the European Commission) and  regularly updated, where it will be clearly indicated whether a CAB has been accredited under ETSI EN  319 403 by a NAB and whether it has been accredited in line with the ETSI standards concerning the  certification scheme in order to be recognised also by the CA/B Forum and the browsers.  6.1.2 Standardisation of auditor requirements  This study regards the skills and competences of individual auditors as integral to the system as a whole;  the auditing scheme lies in the judgement of the auditors themselves and, their ability to make decisions.  While ETSI EN 319 403 is widely adopted, it is not universally done so as no single conformity assessment  scheme is required. eIDAS Regulation is fundamentally technology-neutral, the requirements for the use of  state-of-the-art technology to achieve control objectives, defined according to ETSI EN 319 411, are not  equally recognized or even known to all accredited CABs. In principle, since NABs interpret the  implementation of the eIDAS Regulation, possible complications may arise for the maintenance of broader  ecosystem-wide security and also the market accessibility of TSPs.  Moreover, there is a number of requirements for the training and competence of the audit teams  according to EN 319 403, which includes provisions for demonstrated knowledge in technical, regulatory,  business, risk, policy and control areas, according to section 6.1 Conformity Assessment Body personnel  (6.1.2.2 Training of audit teams). The competences must be derived according to the general requirements  as described in ISO/IEC 17065 section 6.1 Certification body personnel. This includes that the certification  body, here interpreted as the CAB, needs to define the scope of competence, training and certification of  its auditors and provide for such training, performance testing and monitoring as necessary. As discussed  21 The most recent version of this list can be accessed at https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/content/list-conformity- assessment-bodies-cabs-accredited-against-requirements-eidas-regulation.  22 http://www.webtrust.org/licensed-webtrust-practitioners-international/item64419.aspx  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  45  since ETSI (and by extension ISO) standards often do not expressly cite specific controls or give specific  examples for the fulfilment of the standards and requirements, directions should be given for  standardisation of auditor requirements across all CABs in the EU (and beyond). These issues continue to  be a challenge because of the lack of requirements for adopting consistent best practices.  Therefore, providing specific auditors requirements would help to eliminate some degree of human error  and to bring added efficiency to the verification of the control objectives as well as facilitate the exchange  of experience and practical examples from the field.  It is recommended that ENISA, in cooperation with ETSI and CEN, develop and publish a  comprehensive set of auditors’ requirements together with best practice examples from the field.  6.1.3 Further optimization of ETSI standards  The ETSI Certification Policies 319 411 have developed into good frameworks over the past 15 years and  have been well-suited to both eIDAS \"qualified\" and \"publicly trusted\" requirements according to the CA/B  Forum. In direct comparison to WebTrust, only major deficiencies in the detailing of the requirements for  TSP procedures and audit best practice to “set up New Roots” and “CA Key Generation” can be recognized.  To this end, further specifications should be made by ETSI ESI.  It is recommended that ETSI ESI provide further specifications in the detailing of the requirements for  TSP procedures and audit best practice to “set up New Roots” and “CA Key Generation.  Another recommendation is to tighten up management of the TSL. Currently, the 3-month maximum for  any changes made is a long period. While incident reports are requested within 24-72 hours, the updating  of the TSL can take up to 3 months in some countries.  The management of the TSL needs to be updated continually to maintain the fidelity of the system  and to develop the TSL system as an alternative to the hierarchical trust approach using root stores.  Branding QWACs, rolling them out for public consumption  6.2.1 Improved visibility of the EU trust mark for qualified trust services  The Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/806 lays down specifications relating to the form of  the EU Trust Mark for qualified trust services. This trademark-protected EU branding tool for qualified trust  services should signal to the users the trustworthiness of eIDAS-compliant, audited, trust services. Only  TSPs that have been audited and confirmed by a national supervisory body can advertise their products  and services with the EU trust mark for qualified trust services. Until now, this logo has been to a large  extent unknown and has rarely been used. The WebTrust logo, in contrast, is used by a number of  international TSPs for promotional and marketing purposes and is considered trust-worthy.  The difference here is that, currently, the WebTrust logo usually links the user to a webpage with all the  desired information and is managed by WebTrust itself. In fact, there are three different logos, depending  on the audit a TSP has passed. In comparison, there exists only one EU trust mark, and its meaning  currently only really reflects that the QTSP is entitled to use it, not which from the list of applicable  qualified trust services is offered by a QTSP. Access to the EU List of the Lists through an EC browser tool  currently exists, which can help users search and discover important information about TSPs based on  different criteria like country of origin or trust service type.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  46  Increasing the global visibility of the EU trust mark as a trusted logo for qualified trust services would in  turn strengthen the acceptance of the audits. In a preceding ENISA study23, it was determined that to  display the logo in the browser URL/address bar is, in the current state of the web environment, too  difficult to be effectively implemented. While it is perhaps not technically difficult to do, there is currently  no intention for browsers to integrate it.  There is need to further analyse, test and review how the EU trust mark can be displayed on websites  in a tamper-proof manner in order to increase the global visibility of the EU trust mark as a trusted  logo for qualified trust services, which would in turn strengthen the acceptance of the audits. This  could be done by the European Commission or by ENISA.  6.2.2 A logotype certificate with CA/B Forum (development of a QWAC-specific UI)  In 2004, RFC 3709 defined logotypes in X.509 certificates. Logotype certificates can help make brands or  trust marks visible in a trustworthy manner. Many issuers may use a community logotype to co-brand with  a global community in order to gain global recognition of its local service provision, a type of community  branding that is very common e.g. in the credit card business, where local independent card issuers include  a globally recognized brand (such as VISA and MasterCard).  The development of a QWAC-specific UI can be an alternative for the green bar and padlock in the  browser URL field and it will also need consent from the browser or application vendor to show the  content of the certificate.  6.2.3 Mandate EU trust mark usage, beginning with European banks  One concrete idea to complement the previous recommendation about improving the visibility of the EU  trust mark is the possibility of mandating its use in test cases and expanding its reach in an already trusted  environment. After PSD2, since it is now obligatory for European banks to deploy QWACs, it may be  possible to obligate banks to engineer some sort of visual indicator of their deployment. This seal could be  displayed in the browser for websites that deploy QWACs, beginning first with banks and then later  extending to other areas such as healthcare, etc. It should be made clear here that this strategy needs to  be one that is unified. The EU trust mark embodies an image at the heart of the European trust  iconography and is ready to be deployed more publicly.  Since “banks are taking part in educating customers by offering browser plug-ins for enhanced  security and peripheral education” (Timmerman, 2004), a foreseeable next step is the full pan- European usage of the trust mark on bank websites that fall under the purview of PSD2 rules. This  agenda might also be extended to the TSL integration for all operating systems and browser vendors  operating in the European Union as part of a wider rollout of the trust mark and its potential close  association with QWACs.  23 QWACs Plugin, January 2018, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/qwacs-plugin.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  47  Relationships with the browsers  6.3.1 Face-time with the browsers, meetings planned for CA/B Forum  A critical step forward is going to be convincing the browsers and OS vendors to include the TSL in their  respective root stores. Before they even consider including the TSL in the browser list, they need to gain  reassurance that the audit schemes meet their expectations and that the criteria used meet their  requirements as represented in the CA/B Forum documents. ETSI has gone a long way in achieving this by  the inclusion of ETSI standards for audit (EN 319 403) and the policy criteria (EN 319 411-1) in their  documents. However, there still remains some resistance to their adoption. That being said, however, ETSI  has enjoyed substantial success with CA/B Forum concerning the adoption of ETSI standards that are based  on eIDAS requirements (e.g. EN 319 403 and EN 319 411-1) as basic fulfilment of the requirements of CA/B  Forum’s Baseline and EV Guidelines.  The value of QWACs, outside the EU, will diminish as the browser vendors (after 2018, Google and Apple)  deprecate the use of EV certificates as they promote a system for which website security comes without  additional information on the certificates. Since the publication of a number of studies in which the EV  certificates no longer benefit from their previous utility leading up to the rollout of CT, unless a way  forward is fostered with these vendors, it will be challenging to grow the value of QWACs outside the EU  Digital Single Market.  In part, this argument is why individual, face-to-face meetings are being arranged with the browsers at the  CA/B Forum meeting in Shanghai in late 2018 and in Cupertino in 2019.  It will be challenging to grow the value of QWACs outside the EU Digital Single Market by convincing  the browsers and OS vendors to include the TSL in their respective root stores. Towards this goal face- to-face meetings should be arranged by the European Commission with the browsers also in the  context of CA/B Forum meetings.  6.3.2 EU browser  Because website certificate services are dependent on the willingness of browsers to recognize Trusted List  status, and because no browsers currently recognize the Trusted List by default, an alternative, if not  short- and medium-term, way forward is the cooperation with a European-based browser vendor as a test  case for Trusted List root store acceptance. Previously a partnership with the Vivaldi browser from Norway  has been floated in various EU ICT forums and workshops.  An alternative way forward is the cooperation with a European-based browser vendor as a test case  for Trusted List root store acceptance. The terms of this agreement would include e.g. mandatory use  of QWACs in e-Government and financial services for a Digital Single Gateway.  6.3.3 European Certificate Transparency  Certificate Transparency (RFC 6962) was described by Google some years ago in 2013 at the IETF as an  open framework for the monitoring of the SSL / TLS certificate system and the auditing of specific SSL/TLS  certificates. Since then, Google has implemented this RFC by requiring its use in Chrome for all EV  certificates issued after 1 Feb 2015. By the end of 2018, both Google and Apple will require CT for all  issued SSL certificates (otherwise Chrome and Safari will classify affected websites as insecure).  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  48  Using its substantial market power, with this CT initiative, Google is considerably influencing the future of  the SSL/TLS ecosystem. At the European level, it is important to play an active role in the context of CT and  to represent European concerns and enforce them in cooperation with politics and administration.  To support the visibility of eIDAS and to place the aspects of eIDAS in the context of CT, European  players should develop and operate European components for CT i.e. a European (qualified) certificate  log and European certificate monitoring and auditing services. It is anticipated that this would offer  great political leverage in the relationship between the EU concerns and major browser vendors.

These new trust services  include electronic seals, electronic time stamps, electronic registered delivery services and, specific to this  report, certificates for website authentication. Widely known as SSL/TLS certificates, website  authentication certificates play a critical role in the security of online transactions, have long been  employed by websites and have been increasing in deployment throughout the online environment.  The eIDAS Regulation introduces a legal framework and establishes a scheme for granting qualified status  to these new types of trust services aiming to enhance consumer's trust in the digital environment and to  improve the transparency of the trust services market. Following the publication of the eIDAS Regulation, a  set of secondary and co-regulatory acts were published in order to provide technical guidance on how to  implement the specific requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. Underlying the market for EU qualified  website authentication certificates (QWACs) and other trust services is a conformity assessment scheme,  whereby the providers of qualified trust services undergo regular assessments by accredited assessment  bodies, overseen by national and EU authorities.  The goal of the study was to explore the eIDAS Conformity Assessment Report (CAR), the corresponding  audit requirements, gaps arising from comparison with competing audit schemes, and the emergent issues  at the core of the global conversation between major stakeholders in the qualified trust service provider  (QTSP) audit ecosystem. This report also seeks to accomplish a targeted survey of the non-technical sphere  of QWACs, notably the overlapping political and economic environments into which the EU certification  scheme was born and has grown in the past few years.  In this study, we discuss these aspects and identify the most prominent recommendations for  improvement that can increase global acceptance of eIDAS audits. Towards this goal, this study identifies  recommendations for strengthening:   the clear and formal adoption of a harmonised conformity assessment scheme in the EU and the  advancement of these schemes in the international context,   the promotion and referencing of specific standards covering the auditing of TSPs and the conformity  assessment report, and   the public recognition of the trust generated by the scheme.  The main recommendations deriving from the study are summarised below:   There is need to agree upon and define a harmonised conformity assessment scheme against which  CABs would be accredited and the QTSP/QTS assessed in order to verify conformance to the eIDAS  Regulation requirements. Such a process would involve all the stakeholders - EA, ETSI, EC, ENISA, SBs –  which would participate from the specification till the enforcement of such scheme.   A centralised list of all CABs should be maintained (by the European Commission) and regularly  updated, where it will be clearly indicated whether a CAB has been accredited under ETSI EN 319 403  by a NAB and whether it has been accredited in line with the ETSI standards concerning the  certification scheme in order to be recognised also by the CA/B forum and the browsers.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  06   It is recommended that ENISA, in cooperation with ETSI and CEN, develop and publish a  comprehensive set of auditors’ requirements together with best practice examples from the field.   It is recommended that ETSI ESI should provide further specifications in the detailing of the  requirements for TSP procedures and audit best practice to “set up New Roots” and “CA Key  Generation.   There is need to further analyse, test and review how the EU trust mark can be displayed on websites  in a tamper-proof manner in order to increase the global visibility of the EU trust mark as a trusted  logo for qualified trust services, which would in turn strengthen the acceptance of the audits. This  could be done by the European Commission or by ENISA.   It will be challenging to grow the value of QWACs outside the EU Digital Single Market by convincing  the browsers and OS vendors to include the TSL in their respective root stores. Towards this goal face- to-face meetings should be arranged by the European Commission with the browsers also in the  context of CA/B Forum meetings.   Since “banks are taking part in educating customers by offering browser plug-ins for enhanced security  and peripheral education” (Timmerman, 2004), a foreseeable next step is the full pan-European usage  of the trust mark on bank websites that fall under the purview of PSD2 rules. This agenda might also be  extended to the TSL integration for all operating systems and browser vendors operating in the  European Union as part of a wider rollout of the trust mark and its potential close association with  QWACs.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  07  1. Introduction  Purpose  This report explores the paths to global acceptance of the eIDAS auditing framework for trust service  providers (TSPs) issuing qualified website authentication certificates (QWACs). The goal of the study was to  explore the eIDAS Conformity Assessment Report (CAR), the corresponding audit requirements, gaps  arising from comparison with competing audit schemes, and the emergent issues at the core of the global  conversation between major stakeholders to the qualified trust service provider (QTSP) audit ecosystem.  This report also seeks to accomplish a targeted survey of the non-technical sphere of QWACs, notably the  overlapping political and economic environments into which the EU certification scheme was born and has  grown in the past few years. Developing issues concerning technology shifts, tangled with pronounced  ideological struggles in the global geo-political environment will also affect the outcome of the eIDAS trust  framework as much as the technical and procedural requirements set forth in the developed European  regulatory environment.  In order for stakeholders – such as relying parties and end users – to build and maintain confidence in the  security of qualified trust services (QTS), they need to have the assurance that qualified trust service  providers (QTSPs) have established a set of procedures, processes and security measures to minimize the  associated operational and financial threats and risks. Under eIDAS, this is accomplished by audits carried  out by accredited Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs). To support both the infrastructure of the audit  scheme as well as the audits (also called assessments) themselves, ETSI has developed a set of standards  to support TSPs (ETSI EN 319 401, 411-1, 411-2, 421) and CABs (ETSI EN 319 403, TS 119 403-2), which  meet the corresponding security and policy requirements stemming and policy requirements stemming  from the eIDAS Regulation. This report aims to map the requirements of the ETSI framework to other  international standards and requirements (as developed, for example, by the Certification  Authority/Browser Forum and WebTrust) in order to facilitate the widespread use of qualified certificates  for website authentication and the global acceptance of eIDAS audits.  In addition, it is critical for the trust placed in an underlying trust service, such as the provision of QWACs,  to be visible to the average end-user. Trust services without a visible metric of trust such as that provided  by the QWAC, which is based on accountability, will be difficult to foster and upkeep.  Considering the eIDAS Regulation as a framework, there is significant space for individual interpretation  and for development since it does not impose any specific accreditation scheme for which CABs must be  accredited against, or any best practice standard that QTSPs or QTS must comply with in order to be  granted the qualified status. From a perspective that relates to standards, policies and requirements (less  so to economic, political and social forces) upon which much of this report focuses, the success or  acceptance of the eIDAS audits depends on several factors that hinder further recognition of the scheme:   non-existent statutory/mandatory specification of any (but especially the ETSI/CEN) standards, which  were developed as a basis for the eIDAS-compliant operation of TSPs,   the lack of harmonization of requirements within the EU (and thus beyond) at the level of CABs  accreditation and certification scheme for TSP auditing, and   limited visibility of the trust generated by the scheme.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  08  In this study, we discuss these aspects and identify the most prominent recommendations for  improvement that can increase global acceptance of eIDAS audits. Towards this goal, this study identifies  recommendations for strengthening:   the clear and formal adoption of a harmonised conformity assessment scheme in the EU and the  advancement of these schemes in the international context   the promotion and referencing of best practice standards against which TSPs can be audited, and  standards for how the audit is carried out and reported   the public recognition of the trust generated by the scheme.  Methodology  This research method (Figure 1) has been selected in order to combine findings from the audit scheme and  underlying standards with input from subject matter experts, relevant literature and practical case  examples.  Figure 1: Methodology of the study  The research method for this report consists of three elements:   a description containing an assessment of the eIDAS regulatory framework for audits and underlying  best practices standards, as well as findings from literature research   an analysis in which findings based on expert contributions and presentations of international task  force sessions are substantiated via literature and the best practices standards, and   a synthesis in which opportunities and directions for improvement are identified and explored.  Ongoing discussions at international working groups and conferences and the opinions and statistics which  will emanate therefrom have informed and continue to inform this discussion, and will ultimately be useful  to policy-makers in the EU who are searching for a way to achieve the goal set forth in this report: to foster  and grow global acceptance of the eIDAS trust framework and its corresponding auditing scheme for  QTSPs issuing QWACs. During the course of the drafting and revision processes of this report, several  notable discussions between industry actors took place (and continue to take place), partially shifting the  Body of evidence  Analysis  Road map  Review of  literature  Conference  proceedings  Workshop  results  Policies,  reports  Consultations  Stakeholder  input  Working  group input  Technical std.  review  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  09  focus of this report towards the search for resolution between leading browsers and the ETSI scheme in  support of the European approach to (Q)TSP auditing within the eIDAS framework.  Structure of the report  This study is divided into six chapters in total, covering how the global acceptance of eIDAS audits can be  improved. In brief:  Chapter 2 describes the background of eIDAS and its audit scheme. It  sketches a backdrop for this study, focusing on the TSP supervisory  scheme as well as the tasks of the stakeholders in the eIDAS  organizational hierarchy. It also discusses the conformity assessment  criteria and standards, assessment procedures and the conformity  assessment report.  Chapter 3 compares the eIDAS regulatory framework for audits  with  different prevailing trust frameworks (and their respective audit  schemes) – e.g. ETSI, WebTrust for CAs, ISO 27000 series and Federal  PKI frameworks – and highlights possible shortcomings of the eIDAS  audit scheme.  Chapter 4 discusses the underlying standards of the eIDAS regulatory  framework for audits, especially certificate policy documents ETSI EN  319 411-1, ETSI EN 319 411-2 and ETSI EN 319 401, and contains a  level of detailed assessment, comparing them with others, specifically  with a narrow focus on WebTrust.  Chapter 5 presents a dive into the challenges the eIDAS regulatory  framework for audits faces to global acceptance. Topics discussed  include the current situation regarding the visibility of the use of the  EU Trust Mark, especially in current market-leading web browsers  and the ongoing struggle to convince browsers to accept the eIDAS  TLS scheme.  Chapter 6 offers a roadmap – a concrete set of recommendations –  including auditor skills and competences, optimized reports and  promotion as a way forward for the eventual, enhanced global  acceptance of the audit scheme under the eIDAS Regulation.  Figure 2: Determining gaps  between eIDAS and other  schemes  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  10  2. eIDAS Regulatory Framework  The eIDAS Regulation1 repeals the 1999 Directive concerning electronic signatures by providing a new legal  framework for “electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal  market”. Whereas the former Directive focused solely on electronic signatures, the eIDAS Regulation  extends the concept of trust services to other services such as electronic seals and time stamps, registered  mail and website authentication.  To enhance the trust of enterprises and consumers in the internal market and to promote the use of trust  services and products, the eIDAS Regulation introduces the notion of qualified to electronic trust services  as well as to the providers themselves (i.e. QTS and QTSPs). It aims to identify requirements and  obligations that ensure a high level of security for whatever qualified trust service or product is used or  provided.  Since this study primarily concerns certificates for website authentication, the discussion hereinafter  focuses on what are broadly referred to as QWACs, which play a critical role in the security of online  transactions. Prior to the rollout of eIDAS, non-qualified2 SSL/TLS certificates had long been used in  website authentication and network traffic encryption services. For more information, ENISA has  previously published a number of relevant studies which concern a range of topics concerning QWACs,  including the emergence and growth of a European market for QWACs.  QWACs present a particular case among the newly introduced trust services in the eIDAS Regulation, since  they are entering an already mature, global and unregulated (from the point of view of state governance)  market for SSL/TLS certificates. For a successful introduction, it will be necessary to stimulate demand for  QWACs by properly communicating to consumers their benefits, while at the same time supporting  providers to ensure sufficient supply.  As this emergent market matures, becoming more dynamic and transparent, the infrastructure for  ensuring the system’s trustworthiness will also need to be bolstered with smart, flexible and diverse  strategies, especially in light of the stated goal of bringing QWACs and the underlying audit schemes, as  accepted by the national authorities, to wider global acceptance, especially to achieve acceptance (i.e.  support and visualization) as “Publicly Trusted Certificates” (PTC) 3 by the browser vendors. In other words,  the emergence of an ecosystem comprising TSPs, supervisory bodies (SBs), CABs, national accreditation  bodies (NABs) and the certificates themselves onto the global stage require cooperation at all levels.  TSP supervisory scheme  In order to ensure a high-level of security of qualified trust services, the eIDAS Regulation foresees an  active supervision scheme of QTSPs and the QTS they provide by a competent national SB that supervises,  ex-ante and ex-post, fulfilment of the QTSP/QTS requirements and obligations. Therefore, when a TSP  1 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/ES/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG  2 The term “non-qualified” is expressly from the point of view of eIDAS and designates all trust services and providers  that have not undergone the rigorous certification process set forth by eIDAS since it went into effect in 2016. This  includes domain-validated (DV), organization-validated (OV), extended validation (EV) and other certificates for  website authentication.  3 “Publicly Trusted Certificate” is a specific terminology used by the CA/B Forum; all certificates issued to the public  are generally considered “publicly-trusted”. The term refers to certificates that are issued to the public and the  issuing or root CAs are included in the correspondent browser root store.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  11  (without qualified status) intends to begin providing qualified trust services, it submits to the SB a  notification of their intention, together with a CAR issued by a CAB accredited under a conformity  assessment scheme recognised by the national supervisory body (SB). NABs contribute to the quality  assurance of the whole process by being responsible for accrediting and supervising CABs, which perform  the conformity assessment audits of the TSPs.  The eIDAS Regulation introduces a clear separation of duties and tasks between CABs and SBs: while the  CAB is the body responsible for confirming the compliance of the TSP, according to eIDAS, the SB is the  body responsible for actually granting the qualified status. More precisely, Article 17 (4) of the eIDAS  Regulation states that the tasks of the supervisory body shall include in particular:   to analyse the conformity assessment reports (Articles 20(1) and 21(1))   to carry out audits or request a CAB to perform a conformity assessment of the qualified TSPs (Article  20(2)) and   to grant qualified status to TSPs and to the services they provide and to withdraw this status (Articles  20 and 21).  The tasks of CABs4 under the eIDAS Regulation are:   performing the audit of (qualified) TSPs (Article 20 (1))   reporting the audit results in written form (a requirement by CAB accreditation)   making a ‘compliance statement’ confirming (or disproving) the compliance of a QTSP and its QTS with  all the applicable eIDAS requirements (Article 20 (1))   providing the conformity assessment report (CAR) with the compliance statement to the TSP (Article  20 (1)) and   usually also directly to Supervisory Body (Article 17 (4) b), Article 20 (2)).  After the successful completion of the audit, the CAB issues a CAR. This report contains all results of the  assessment performed and is provided to the TSP, which must in turn provide it to the responsible SB. The  compliance statement by a CAB is formally non-binding for the SB for granting or not granting the qualified  status to a TSP but represents an important basis for the subsequent decision. Only after a full review of  the CAR and any additional requested information will the SB decide whether the TSP and the trust  services it provides are in fact compliant with eIDAS requirements. After a maximum of three months  following the submission of the conformity assessment report, the SB notifies the TSP of its decision.  If positive, the TSP and the audited trust services will be granted the “qualified” status and will be added to  the national trusted list (if it is not already within). In the case that a QTSP and its QTS no longer meet the  requirements, the SB then withdraws the qualified status (in the case of a new TSP/TS, it will not grant the  qualified status) and informs the body responsible for the national trusted list about its decision. As stated  by Article 20 of the eIDAS Regulation, once the qualified status is granted, a QTSP will have to provide a  new CAR to the responsible SB every 24 months (or whenever requested by the SB) in order to maintain  their qualified status.  Figure 3 provides an overview of dependencies between various stakeholders in the TSP assessment  scheme under the eIDAS Regulation.  4 A current list of accredited CABs is accessed at https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/content/list-conformity- assessment-bodies-cabs-accredited-against-requirements-eidas-regulation.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  12  Figure 3: TSP assessment scheme (courtesy of ETSI/ESI)  The European Accreditation (EA) is the body recognised under the EC Regulation No 765/2008 that  organises the peer evaluation scheme among the NABs from the EU Member States and other European  Countries. Each NAB determines the fundamental ability of a CAB for conducting conformity assessments  in accordance with (specific) accreditation criteria. To this day, there is no implementing act, but instead  the decision as to whether a scheme meets the requirements of eIDAS and expects appropriate  competencies for trust service audit is left to the supervisory body. For the accreditation of a CAB to  operate in the eIDAS scheme and, consequentially, for it to undertake certification of TSPs, ETSI, in  collaboration with the EA and with representatives of the interested parties, has developed a specific  standard (ETSI EN 319 403) for the accreditation of CABs assessing trust service providers and the services  they provide. The ETSI EN 319 403 defines an accreditation scheme that:   requires the accreditation of CABs based on ISO/IEC 17065, and   supplements ISO/IEC 17065 by defining additional requirements for a CAB’s capabilities for performing  conformity assessment (certification) of TSPs and the trust services they provide against specific  criteria based on standards (such as the ETSI standards for TSPs), publicly available specifications (such  as the CA/B Forum baseline or extended validation guidelines) or regulatory requirements (such as the  eIDAS Regulation).  Conformity assessment scheme, criteria and standards  The general approach for CABs assessing the conformity of TSPs and the services they provide is presented  in ETSI EN 319 403. For each step of the audit, all the general requirements for evaluating TSPs against the  requirements are described in the text of the eIDAS Regulation itself. As mentioned above, however, there  is currently no implementing act for this; it is left up to the supervisory body to verify whether the trust  service provider and the trust services provided by it comply with the requirements laid down in eIDAS  Regulation, and in particular, with the requirements for qualified trust service providers and for the  qualified trust services they provide. EN 319 does not include the specific criteria for the type of trust  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  13  service to be assessed. This is covered by the relevant regulatory requirements or standards aimed at the  type of trust service being assessed.  The audit process, based on ISO 17065 and implemented in ETSI EN 319 403, is divided into different parts:   General preparation – to agree on the terms of the audit (time, location, scope, etc.)   Documentation review – to review the documentation regarding the TSPs and TS provided   On-site audit – to validate the preliminary findings and complete the audit against the predefined  assessment criteria  At the end of the process, a conformity assessment report (CAR) containing all the results of the audit will  be issued by the CAB to the TSP.  After analysing the list of CABs accredited against the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation, as maintained  by the European Commission5, it is concluded that the EA has widely promoted the accreditation  framework of ISO 17065 completed by the certification scheme defined in ETSI EN 319 403. The EA has  promoted ETSI EN 319 403 as a channel to demonstrate conformity with relevant requirements laid out in  the eIDAS Regulation through assessment by CABs. In fact, 21 of the 22 currently eIDAS accredited CABs  follow this EA framework.  Conformity assessment schemes based on standards such as EN 319 403 can be adopted by CABs to certify  conformance of QTSPs, and the QTS it provides, with the eIDAS regulation (Article 20.2) as well as best  practice standards such as the CA/B Forum guidelines and/or ETSI standards defining policy requirements  for particular trust services. However, there does not exist a fully comprehensive list of requirements that  has to be used by all CABs for conducting a conformity assessment (Article 20 (4)). Consequently, there is  no guarantee that the audit is carried out by a CAB with the competencies and procedures appropriate to  the trust services it is assessing. Also, if an audit is carried out just against the requirements of the eIDAS  Regulation, there is no guarantee that the policies and practices are or will be in line with accepted best  practices standards.  Moreover, the final decision regarding the qualification of the TSP and its trust services is made by the  responsible SB that verifies compliance with the requirements laid down in eIDAS Regulation (Article  21(2)). However, the SBs in Member States lack a set of defined and harmonised requirements or criteria  related to the compliance (or lack of compliance) of a TSP to the requirements laid down in the eIDAS  regulation.  Identified gap: Harmonization  One of the major shortcomings of the conformity assessment scheme and the assessment criteria used  under the eIDAS Regulation appears to be the absence of standardization for the conformity assessment  process (certification).  While the accreditation of almost all CABs listed is according to ETSI EN 319 403 (based on ISO 17065), it  may happen that different CABs of different Member States will use different criteria by which a TSP will  be audited.  Specifically, the eIDAS Regulation itself lends few words to the topic of the CAR. The rigor of presentation  (measured generally by the level of detail) is, however, not specified, even though it may be crucial to  5 The most recent version of this list is accessed at https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/content/list-conformity- assessment-bodies-cabs-accredited-against-requirements-eidas-regulation.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  14  enabling the SB to decide on the qualified status of the TSP. The form of presentation is additionally not  specified; it is assumed that the CAR might follow the structure of each single requirement from the  applied assessment criteria e.g. directly from eIDAS itself, or like-wise from EN 319 401, EN 319 411-1 and - 2 and EN 319 421. From the above it is also derived that it is also not regulated according to which criteria  the SBs measure whether a TSP has reached the status of \"qualified\" or not.  This may result in incongruences in the qualification of TSPs in different countries as well as their qualified  trust services. This may lead to a non-harmonized trust service market and give rise to doubts about the  quality of QTS, which may include QWACs. In this case, harmonization (or the lack there-of) refers to a  mandated, detailed or specific set of norms describing the process of producing a CAR for a certification  under the eIDAS scheme; it is currently an ongoing topic of discussion at the lever of the Forum of  European Supervisory Authorities (FESA).  It is also of interest that the CAR provided to the SBs is not considered a public document, meaning that  most TSPs have not published a detailed CAR that is provided to the SB. In fact, they only publish the  “certificate”, which provides evidence for the successful completion of the audit. This is an important point  from the perspective of (different) browsers, who require documents and reports that can be made  publicly available. Some browsers may be more amenable to the confidentiality of these CAR documents  and others may not.  The absence of a standardized CAR constitutes a challenge, but also offers an opportunity forward. CABs  that have different interpretations of the actual scope of audits and/or the content of audit reports might  be better aligned with the publication and enforcement of implementation acts for the accreditation of  CABs across borders.  To avoid inconsistent qualification of TSPs and their qualified services, it is necessary to:   harmonize the conformity assessment scheme against which the CABs are accredited   harmonize the level of detail and structure of the Conformity Assessment Report issued by CABs and  the conformity assessment requirements during the TSP auditing   harmonize the procedures followed by the national Supervisory Bodies used to verify whether the TSP  and the trust services provided comply with the requirements laid down in the eIDAS Regulation, and  in particular, with the requirements for qualified trust service providers and for the qualified trust  services they provide   integrate the requirements from external bodies like the CA/B Forum to ensure that the audit follows  proper form and adheres to the requirements of the international community   agree on the criteria to be used for assessment, in particular, whether this is just at the level of the  regulation or if it also includes best practice standards such as CA/B Forum guidelines or ETSI  standards.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  15  3. Overview of Trust Frameworks  “Trust” may be defined as “a psychological state comprising the intention to accept vulnerability based  upon positive expectations of the intentions or behaviour of another” (Rousseauo, 1998). In the online  environment, required positive expectations to reach the state of trust may differ from application to  application, such as making an online payment, sending an e-mail or signing a business contract. To serve  the needs of this sensitive and differentiated digital ecosystem, several trust frameworks have been  established, each attempting to lay the groundwork for trust and enhance the confidence that users can  have in all of their digital transactions.  This chapter considers prominent existing trust frameworks in order to discover the similarities and  differences between them and analyse these findings in order to derive fundamental structural  requirements for such trust frameworks. The aim of this chapter is to identify gaps between coverage in  the trust frameworks and assess the directions our recommendations, based on the technical analysis, will  lead to some recommendations in the final chapter of this report. Since, in effect, the field is a “moving  goalpost”, the nature of this study at present is intended to be dynamic and responsive to impending  changes to the trust service landscape.  Key concepts and terminology  In terms of key concepts and terminology (cf. (Sel, 2015)), this report follows the structure of (Hamaguchi  2016), which presents the similarities and differences of several trust models. In most if not all instances  where trust in electronic transactions is established, the following four types of trust components are  involved: computational trust components (such as hard mathematical problems like the Discrete  Logarithm Problem or finding points along an elliptical curve), technology components (such as CA servers,  hardware security modules (HSMs) and online certificate status protocol (OCSP) responders), operating  procedures (such as face-to-face registration of an applicant who wants to subscribe to a TSP's services)  and compliance components. An appropriate combination of these components will yield legal effect.  There are many competing definitions and vocabularies for trust, indicating the concept's importance in  many different scenarios and for different stakeholders. In the context of the present study, we use the  following model terms:   Trust framework: a model of multiparty interactions that aims at facilitating a Relying Party's decision  on the basis of metadata and services   Trust ecosystem: collection of trust frameworks   Mechanism: the apparatus, system or process used to bind the participants within the frame-work   Actors:   Initiator: the actor that took the initiative to create the trust framework   Governor/oversight keeper: the actor that governs the trust framework and/or over-sees it   Operator: the actor responsible for the operation of the framework   Assessor: an actor that provides claims about participants   Participants: actors that accept to be bound through the mechanism, this includes:   TSPs: actors providing trust services such as authentication, signature creation, validation,  long term preservation, registered electronic delivery, time stamping etc. In such a context,  the TSP can also be referred to as the trustee, the entity that is potentially trusted   Subscribers: actors that subscribe to services offered by TSPs   Relying parties: actors that rely on services offered by TSPs.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  16   Metadata: data provided about the services and data used within a trust framework  Audit schemes by both ETSI and WebTrust are well known to major browser vendors and TSPs issuing  website authentication certificates because these two frameworks are adopted by the trusted root CA  programs of major browser vendors such as Google, Mozilla and Microsoft (CA/Browser Forum, 2017).  Website authentication (SSL/TLS) certificates are electronic certificates for managing the secure  connection between the web server and the end user’s computer through the browser. SSL/TLS  certificates are used for other services that require TLS authentication, as well.  Conformity assessment scheme and audit requirements for TSPs based on ETSI  standards  Certification in accordance with ETSI standards is performed by CABs, which are accredited by NABs within  each respective Member State. Harmonization of accreditation processes among accreditation bodies is  coordinated through by the EA. Figure 4 shows the trust framework of ETSI certification for the browsers’  root program for TSPs.  Figure 4: The trust framework of ETSI certification for root CA program (based on (Hamaguchi, 2016))  ETSI EN 319 401 specifies general requirements for TSPs; however, this is not audited independently.  When auditing against EN 319 411-1 or -2 (or any other eIDAS trust service), there exist requirements in  these documents which reference EN 319 401. This is to say, checks against relevant EN 319 401  requirements are carried out when conducting an EN 319 411-1 and/or -2 audit.  EN 319 411-1 specifies generally applicable policy and security requirements for TSPs issuing public key  certificates, including trusted website authentication certificates. It provides guidance to the TSP to  develop, implement, enforce and update the Certification Practise Statement (CPS) (which describes the  practices and procedures used to address all the requirements identified for the applicable TSP's policy)  and the Certificate Policy (CP) (which refers to the CPS to indicate how the TSP implements the policy  requirements for the selected CP). EN 319 411-2 specifies policy and security requirements for the  issuance, maintenance and life-cycle management of EU qualified certificates as defined in eIDAS  Regulation. This builds on the requirements of EN 319 411-1 and a TSP can support both technical  requirements of PTC certificate policies and eIDAS QWACs.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  17  Moreover, ETSI has recently published TS 119 403-2, which defines additional requirements for CABs  auditing TSPs that issue publicly-trusted certificates (PTC), and it is expected soon to publish the ETSI TS  119 403-3, where requirements for CABs assessing QTSPs against eIDAS will be defined. In order to clarify  the difference between TS 119 403-2 and -3, it should be noted that TS 119 403-2 is aimed at meeting the  audit requirements of issuers of PTCs as described by CA/B Forum and address specific root store  requirements. It includes requirements concerning the audit frequency and audit attestation and defines  subsequent audits that examine the history of any events that occurred over the period leading to the last  audit. TS 119 403-3, however, aims to provide additional requirements on the certification scheme used by  CABs assessing the QTSPs and the QTS they provide in order to demonstrate compliance against the  requirements laid down by eIDAS. Both TS 119 403-2 and TS 119 403-3 also require the audit to be carried  out in conformance with EN 319 403.  Table 1: Relevant ETSI standards to eIDAS conformity assessment for TSPs6  CERTIFICATION POLICY FOR TSPs  ETSI EN 319 401  General policy requirements for  trust service providers  This document specifies policy requirements for TSPs that are  independent of the type of TSP whether certificate issuer (qualified  or otherwise), timestamp issuer, signature verifier, e-delivery  provider or other form of trust service provider.

ETSI EN 319 411  Policy and security requirements  for trust service providers issuing  certificates  This multi-part document specifies policy and security requirements  for TSPs issuing certificates. It references EN 319 401 for generic  requirements.  Both parts provide informative annexes with a check list of the policy  requirements that can be used by the TSP to prepare an assessment  of its practices against the document and/or by the assessor when  conducting the assessment for confirming that a TSP meets those  requirements.  It also includes the following topics:  ETSI EN 319 411-1  General requirements for trust  service providers issuing  certificates  This part specifies generally applicable policy and security  requirements for TSPs issuing public key certificates, including trusted  website certificates. The policy and security requirements are defined  in terms of requirements for certificates. These policy and security  requirements support a number of reference CPs (LCP, NCP, NCP+,  EVCP, OVCP, DVCP).  ETSI EN 319 411-2  Requirements for trust service  providers issuing EU qualified  certificates  This part specifies the policy and security requirements for TSPs  issuing qualified certificates as defined in the eIDAS Regulation. These  policy and security requirements support reference CPs (QCP-1, QCP- n, QCP-1-qscd, QCP-n-qscd, QCP-w) for the issuance, maintenance  and life-cycle management of qualified certificates issued to natural  persons (including natural persons associated with a legal person), to  legal persons and websites.  6 Visit https://portal.etsi.org/TBSiteMap/ESI/ESIActivities.aspx for more information about recent, current and  ongoing ETSI activities.

ETSI TS 119 403-3  Additional requirements for  conformity assessment bodies  assessing qualified trust service  providers against the eIDAS  requirements  This document provides additional requirements for CABs assessing  qualified TSPs against the eIDAS Regulation requirements.  3.2.1 Analysis of CAB requirements and EN 319 403 / ISO/IEC 17065  The auditing scheme based on ETSI standards can be regarded as a certification scheme, meaning it  comprises an examination of whether a TSP’s system, product or process faithfully implements the  requirements as laid out in the described ETSI documents. Concluding the assessment process, if the TSP  meets the criteria described in the applicable standards, the output is a certificate. As a TSP may have a  contractual obligation to meet the criteria within three months in order to receive a positive decision on its  certification request, this TSP may have to take corrective measures on issues identified, as permitted and  requested by CAB. Specifically, a TSP audit may be passed with pending nonconformities provided that  these do not impact the ability of the TSP to meet the intended service. This certification decision is  conditional upon to the implementation of corrective actions within 3 months after conclusion of the audit  (depending on the type and criticality of the correction(s)). Moreover, the CAB assessing the TSP must  meet the specific requirements of EN 319 403, for which reporting requirements are specific to the  certification scheme and may be adjusted as necessary – for example, according to the requirements  under the forthcoming ETSI TS 119 403-3.  The assessment criteria from EN 319 403 (and, ISO/IEC 17065) set out the requirements that the CAB must  examine during the assessment of a TSP, the first of which is to indicate that CABs do not perform (or  accept contracts for) audits of TSPs for which they have less than the required competence  The contents of the audit report are expected to contain a list of the standards and publicly-available  specifications and/or regulatory requirements against which the assessment is carried out, an account of  7 Visit https://portal.etsi.org/TBSiteMap/ESI/ESIActivities.aspx for more information about recent, current and  ongoing ETSI activities.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  19  the TSP’s internal risk analysis, the time it took to conduct the assessment, detailed to the review of  documentation, on-site assessment and reporting, as well as additional audit enquiries followed, rationale  for their selection and the methodology employed, including any additional methodologies for sampling,  were that to be the case of the audit. The results contained within the audit report are expected to provide  “sufficient detail to facilitate and support a certification decision”, the details of which are laid out in EN  319 403 section 7.4.4.1 Report contents.  Problems or other discrepant issues discovered during the assessment are defined as non-conformities.  For these instances, the TSP is expected to report pending or performed changes according to the  conformity issue during the documentation phase of the assessment. Non-conformities may be resolved  with the suspension or termination of the certification or under the auspices of a contractual commitment  to corrective actions that would return the TSP to within the scope of conformity to the applicable  standards. In consideration of this, the TSP may be conferred one of three designations after the  assessment process has concluded: certified, non-certified or passed with pending non-conformities. To be  clear, if a TSP does not receive a certification, no additional status called “non-certified” is awarded.  As described in EN 319 403 7.10 Changes affecting certification, the changes that may affect certification  include (but are not limited to) major changes in TSP documentation (during the first stage of the audit),  changes to the TSP’s policies, objectives or procedures that affect the trust service(s) offered, relevant  security changes to networks and trustworthy systems or new sites providing relevant trust services. In  these cases, the TSP must undergo a full re-assessment to determine if it (still) adheres to conformance to  the requirements laid out in the respective, appropriate standards and requirements. Responses to any of  these non-conformances are described accordingly in ISO/IEC 17065 section 8.10 Termination, reduction,  suspension or withdrawal of certification. This standard also includes provisions for the reduction of the  risk of non-conformities in 9.6 Internal audits, 9.7 Corrective actions and 9.8 Preventative actions, which  list (non-explicit) strategies and actions relevant to the identification and remediation of such risks.  One point of interest regarding the ongoing industry discussion about non-conformities (and the necessity  of responses thereto) considers the absence of specification for the terms “major” and “minor” as they  relate to non-conformities. The definition of a nonconformity (from ISO/IEC 17021) is, generally, “the non- fulfilment of a requirement”. A nonconformity could be classified as major under two circumstances: “if  there is a significant doubt that effective process control is in place, or that products or services will meet  specified requirements” or if “a number of minor nonconformities associated with the same requirement  or issue could demonstrate a systemic failure…”. The functional difference between major and minor, by  definition, is its ability to “affect the capability of the management system to achieve its intended results”.  It is assumed within the wider auditing/audited community that TSPs found exhibiting “minor” non- conformities can be awarded a provisional certification whereas any present “major” non-conformities are  grounds for termination of certification pending remedial actions and a renewed full assessment.  However, these terms have been debated along descriptive lines: disagreements have arisen between e.g.  CABs and browser vendors have no existing avenue for mediation except that which is based on the  interpretation of whoever is holding the report. Though both sides of these ongoing large-scale arguments  have merits, they can also be seen through the lens of political posturing, and could potentially be resolved  in part by clearer, or more granular, distinctions between types (and the severity levels) of specific non- conformities and appropriate responses in the certification process.  Moreover, there is a number of requirements for the training and competence of the audit teams  according to EN 319 403, which includes provisions for demonstrated knowledge in technical, regulatory,  business, risk, policy and control areas, according to section 6.1 Conformity Assessment Body personnel  (6.1.2.2 Training of audit teams). The competences must be derived according to the general requirements  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  20  as described in ISO/IEC 17065 section 6.1 Certification body personnel. This includes that the certification  body, here interpreted as the CAB, needs to define the scope of competence, training and certification of  its auditors and provide for such training, performance testing and monitoring as necessary. As discussed  before, however, since ETSI (and by extension ISO) standards often do not expressly cite specific controls  or give specific examples for the fulfilment of the standards and requirements, no further explicit  directions or documentation are given for the practical training of auditors, harmonised across all CABs in  the EU (and beyond).  WebTrust for CAs assurance audit  WebTrust (Figure 5) is another well-known commercial audit scheme for TSPs and browser vendors.  WebTrust assessments are performed by independent accountant firms which are recognized by  Chartered Professional Accountants (CPA) Canada. As a rule-based assurance audit, the WebTrust scheme  aims to review the implementation and operational effectiveness of controls over a period of time in the  past (to make sure the systems have been adequately operating, with the assumption that they will  continue to do so). The functional philosophy behind WebTrust is the provision of assurance that a TSP’s  services have, until the point of time the assessment is conducted, verifiably met a rigorous set of defined  criteria. The operation assumption here is that fulfilling a checklist of objectives is the same as fulfilling the  obligations to security for which TSPs are responsible in their operations.  Figure 5: The trust framework of WebTrust for root CA program (based on (Hamaguchi, 2016))  It should be made clear that the WebTrust scheme does not actually meet the requirements of eIDAS  conformity assessment bodies in Article 3 (18)8, “which is accredited in accordance with that Regulation as  competent to carry out conformity assessment of a qualified trust service provider and the qualified trust  services it provides”. A CAB, as defined in point 13 of Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 is “a body  that performs conformity assessment activities…”, according to “a system of accreditation which functions  by reference to binding rules, [helping to] strengthen mutual confidence between Member States as  regards the competence of CABs and consequently the certificates and test reports issued by them.”  Additionally, the reference to the term “qualified” as it relates to the TSP and the trust services it provides,  8 ‘Conformity assessment body’ is defined in point 13 of Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 as “a body that  performs conformity assessment activities including calibration, testing, certification and inspection”  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  21  indicates a principal reason for why WebTrust does not align with eIDAS requirements; because there is no  current provision for the proper assessment of conformity with the existing standard for QTSPs issuing e.g.  QWACs.  ISO/IEC 27000 series  The ISO/IEC 27000 series represents the information security family of standards, which provides best  practices recommendations for the management of information security and covers a wide range of  general network and information security concerns. Table 3 outlines the preliminary set of documents in  this series.  ISO/IEC 27001 stipulates “the requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually  improving an information security management system within the context of the organization”. It also  encompasses requirements for “the assessment and treatment of information security risks tailored to the  needs of the organization. The requirements are generic and are intended to be applicable to all  organizations, regardless of type, size or nature”.9 This document requires that management  systematically examine security risks inherent to the business in question. Not unlike the ETSI protocols for  certification, ISO/IEC 27001 also focuses on the design and implementation of controls to this effect, and  the adoption of an overarching management process.  Table 3: ISO 27000 series relevant to this study  Whereas ISO/IEC 27000 and ISO/IEC 27001 outline foundational elements of ISMSs, ISO/IEC 27002 can be  read like a CP concerning a TSPs information security controls. Also important to this study are the  recommendations laid out in ISO/IEC 27006, ISO/IEC 27007 and ISO/IEC 27008, which comprise guidelines  9 cf. www.iso.org  STANDARD NO.

However, the trust scheme of ISO is very  similar and comparable to ETSI certification framework, as is shown in Figure 6.  Figure 6: The ISO trust framework (based on description of accreditation and certification process of the International  Accreditation Forum)  It should be made clear, however, that certification against ISO/IEC 27001 plus ISO/IEC 27006 does not  require that the CAB has competencies relating to trust services and does not require an assessment that  considers if the TSP follows any recognised best practices for the provision of trust services.  3.4.1 New work item (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27)  While there is currently no dedicated ISO standard for PKI, practices and corresponding policy frame- works,10 ISO is currently in discussion about such a standard as a new work item (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27),  tentatively entitled, “Information Technology – Security techniques - Public key infrastructure - Practices  and policy framework” (ISO SC 27/2WG4). This new work item proposal on information technology,  security techniques, PKI, practices and policy frameworks are, at the time of this draft, presently under  development.  The scope of this proposed work item includes the development of a framework of requirements to  manage information security for PKI TSPs through CPs, CPSs and, where applicable, their internal  underpinning by an ISMS. This requirements framework aims to include the assessment and management  of information security risks, which will be tailored to meet the agreed service requirements of its users, as  specified through the Certificate Policy. It also aims to help TSPs support multiple CPs. It intends to address  the life-cycle of public key certificates, but it is not intended to address authentication methods, non- repudiation requirements or key management protocols based on the use of public key certificates.  Moreover, the new work item will make use of concepts and requirements of an ISMS, as defined in  ISO/IEC 27000 and ISO/IEC 27001, respectively. It will also use the code of practice for information security  controls, as defined in ISO/IEC 27002. Specific PKI requirements (e.g. certificate content, identity proofing,  certificate revocation handling) will, however, not be addressed directly by a generic ISMS; it will in fact  depend on the scope of the audit chosen at the beginning of the process. The use of a generic ISMS is  extended through the application of PKI service requirements specified in the CP as described in the  10 A standard does exist, however, which is targeted at the financial sector in ISO 21188.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  23  present document. The planned ISO norm distinguishes between PKI systems used in closed, open and  contractual environments. It facilitates the implementation of “operational, baseline controls and practices  in a contractual environment”. Application of the norm to open or closed environments is not specifically  precluded.  Federal PKI  In contrast to the Trusted List framework of the eIDAS regulation, the US Federal PKI is a bridge CA  framework. Central to this trust framework is the Federal Bridge CA (FBCA), which acts as a trust hub for  disparate PKI domains (cf. (FPKI, 2015), (FPKI, 2012)). The Federal Policy Management Authority (FPKI  Management Authority) is the organization that operates and maintains the FBCA on behalf of the U.S.  Government, U.S. Federal PKI Policy Authority (FPKIPA). Figure 7 shows the trust framework of FPKI.  The FBCA is not an autonomous service as such, but rather consists of a framework of specific norms and  standards to determine the reliability of CAs, based on a standardized methodology for assessing  compliance with these norms and standards, and a cross-certification platform allowing CAs to cross- certify with the US Federal PKI Architecture at seven pre-defined assurance levels. The FBCA functions as a  non-hierarchical hub allowing relying parties to create certificate trust paths from their PKI domains back  to the PKI domain of the cross-certified CAs, so that the levels of assurance honoured by disparate CAs can  be more easily reconciled. The FBCA itself operates under the FBCA CP, which specifies seven different  levels of assurance.  All CAs have to demonstrate their compliance with the predefined assurance levels, by regular  independent audits in accordance with the published procedure.11 When a CA cross-certifies with the FPKI  architecture, and is an affiliate in good standing, a relying party operating an online application that utilizes  digital certificates for electronic identity authentication may choose to trust that PKI's digital certificates at  the Level(s) of Assurance asserted by those certificates. The purpose of the FBCA is to ensure that no other  trust requirements are needed for the relying party to make that determination. While designed  specifically with the benefit to US federal government services, the cross-certification approach is not  inherently restricted to any sector, application or domain. In fact, there are additional sectors using the  same approach and requesting the same conditions (e.g. SAFE Bio-pharma, etc.).  Figure 7: The trust framework of FPKI  Cross-certification with FBCA can demonstrate that the TSP operation and its security level is equivalent to  what the US government requires for their PKI system, which warrants harmonization. However, one  11 For more information, see https://www.idmanagement.gov/fpki-cas-audit-info/  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  24  notable problem with the system, as it currently stands, is that it is not updated very often and sometimes  includes TSPs that are trusted, although motivation to this level of trust may not be obvious.  Comparison of CA/B Forum guidelines, ETSI standards and WebTrust audit scheme  The standards that are employed by ETSI are developed by experts from different industries and all  requirements from the CA/B Forum and are included in the latest standards (ETSI, 2016a), (ETSI, 2016b),  (ETSI, 2016c).12 We refer to the ETSI approach as distributed because it makes use of a body of individual  standards. Some critics of this system cite the “disconnected” nature of the ETSI framework as a downside,  citing potential confusion from a reliance on so many external references (the scheme is not self-contained  like WebTrust) (Timmerman, 2004). Its distributed nature, however, suggests that the policy is flexible  enough to incorporate updated standards at a fairly granular level as ETSI produces them to reflect the  needs of the time. In particular, it draws particular focus to the democratic structure of how European  norms are drafted and implemented, placing high value on input and consensus from many actors rather  than favouring the few.  The criteria in the ETSI standards are also aligned with those of the CA/B Forum guidelines to facilitate  conformance to both best practices. Conformance to the requirements described in ETSI standards can  therefore demonstrate that the TSP fulfils the required assurance level in order to be trusted by browser  vendors and their users, as a product of the work of stakeholders across most or all pertinent industries.  This is the primary, generic use case for ETSI standards: to be valid inside the European community for  different levels of CPs. An EN 319 403-based conformity assessment scheme, for example, can be used to  assess conformance to the CA/B Forum guidelines as well as the ETSI standards. Inclusion in the browsers’  trusted root stores is an additional feature of ETSI certification.  Regarding the frequency of assessment, the ETSI audit cycle is two years, meaning that full assessments  are performed every second year, while annual surveillance assessments are performed in between.  Ultimately, the ETSI audit may result in a certification that legitimizes a TSP to perform certain activities in  the future by assessing if the body is capable and ready to perform those activities. For PTC, the CA/B  Forum requires annual audits, whereas in the context of eIDAS, the audit cycle is biennial.  One important aspect and defining feature of the ETSI scheme is the reliance it puts on the competence  and autonomy of individual auditors, and the extent to which he or she is afforded the flexibility to make  judgments during the audit process, and for its conclusion. On the one hand, more flexibility and trust in  the individual auditor reveals a \"human weakness\" in the trust chain (Timmerman, 2004); a TSP with and  overlooked security flaw could go “into the wild” and impact the ecosystem, as with the major breaches of  the past. However, this grim prognosis delivers an opportunity for narrowing on and addressing the  individual points of weakness along the chain. Specifically, this means that part of the solution to a more  dynamic, powerful system lies in the judgment of the auditors themselves and at least a second person  (certifier) who reviews the whole process and every single judgement done by the auditor in the  certification stage. To this end, more should be done to educate and support these actors. This point is  introduced more narrowly in chapter 6 as a pathway to systems improvement and improved global  acceptance of eIDAS audits.  Similar to the ETSI scheme (EN 319 403 requires the observation of the past period of time to the previous  audit), WebTrust is inherently interested in past performance, meaning that the ETSI certification gives the  12 It should be noted that whereas the eIDAS Regulation issues legal requirements, ETSI CP are norms (e.g. how to  conduct audits via EN 319 403) and are not mandatory for audits pertaining to QWACs under eIDAS. However, the  ETSI requirements are mandated by the CA/B Forum.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  25  TSP one or two years in advance to keep going while WebTrust certifies what the TSP did last year (AIM- BEUC Joint Initiative, 2012). It should be considered what a WebTrust auditor does when he or she  identifies a fundamental misconduct of the TSP when performing a review of past activities (e.g. ten  months ago). It is not entirely clear what happens with the TSP’s approval, from a retroactive perspective.  In cases such as these, ETSI has been cited as a more advanced system, in which changes to the operations  are always considered to the CAB before they are allowed to be implemented and taken into operation.  The trust framework for WebTrust is, at least in hierarchy, comparable with ETSI: Figure 5 lays out the  simplified structure for the trust framework, which can be compared with Figure 4 describing the ETSI trust  framework. One major difference in the system’s organization is in the absence of a “harmonization body”.  Originally developed by the AICPA and CICA, “the WebTrust program is now managed by the Chartered  Professional Accountants of Canada”. Public accounting firms and practitioners, who are specifically  licensed by CPA Canada, can provide assurance services to evaluate and test whether the services provided  by a particular Certification Authority meet these principles and criteria.”13 Since there are no other  accreditation bodies responsible for this scheme which could possibly interpret requirements in a different  way, harmonization across audits is automatically guaranteed.  Although the WebTrust and ETSI audit schemes are intended to achieve the same objectives, namely to  obtain (root and issuing) TSPs’ recognition and inclusion by browsers, there are a number of important  differences both in the practice of implementing the structure as well as important differences pertaining  to the theoretical underpinning of both trust frameworks. WebTrust is a nearly self-contained document  that hardly contains any external references, as opposed to ETSI, which refers to an expanding and  evolving body of external standards. This allows WebTrust auditors a somewhat more straightforward  process by which to conduct the assessment, but critics have, in the past, pointed out that it lacks the  durability and flexibility of consensus-based standards which reflect the needs of a larger sample of  industry stakeholders. However, recently, WebTrust has surveyed TSPs and browsers for their opinions  about possibilities for improving and updating their audit program. In this case, we see some convergence  forming between WebTrust and ETSI.  In practice, WebTrust generally employs a comprehensive set of illustrative controls, describing in detail  the stated objectives and how a TSP might meet those objectives, often (though not always) in more  specific terms than the ETSI audit. More specifically, WebTrust mirrors the exact requirements set forth by  the CA/B Forum, adding detailed instructions about how the control objectives might be reached, since  this is a primary focus of the audit. This is designed to reduce the probability of human error and to bring  added efficiency to the assessment of control objectives. The case can be made, however, that this focus  on rules and illustrative controls removes a large degree of the autonomy of the independent auditor to  issue an assessment based on his or her professional judgment, a point which will emerge later in this  report as a feature of the proposed roadmap towards global acceptance of the eIDAS audits. This study  regards the education and capability of individual auditors as integral to the system as a whole; the  checkbox approach inadvertently disarms auditors, who should be educated and empowered to think  critically and make decisions, as opposed to fulfilling the obligation of making sure a discrete list of  illustrative controls is aligned.  Like the ETSI scheme, the WebTrust audit criteria include all defined requirements from CA/B Forum (CPA,  2014)(CPA, 2016). Therefore, conformance to the WebTrust framework can also demonstrate that the TSP  fulfils the required assurance level in order to be trusted by browser vendors and their users.  13 WebTrust: www.webtrust.org/item64428.aspx  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  26  Visual guide to the trust frameworks criteria  Table 4: Comparison between the trust frameworks (based on (Hamaguchi, 2016))  ETSI  WEBTRUST eIDAS FPKI ISO 27000  Law  Supports eIDAS  Regulation  N/A eIDAS Regulation  e-Government Act of  2002  N/A  Objective  Technical interoperability  and trusted third party  assessment  Technical interoperability  and trusted third party  assessment  Legal recognition of  electronic trust services  Identity management and  trust across  organizational,  operational, physical and  network boundaries  Information security  Governor ETSI Board N/A EU Committee CIO Council  Harmonization Body ETSI ESI PKI Assurance Task Force FESA N/A  Accreditation Body  National Accreditation  Bodies  CPA Canada NAB FPKI Policy Authority  National Accreditation  Bodies  Conformity Assessment  Body  CAB accredited to  EN 319 403  Same as above  Conformity Assessment  Body  FPKI Certificate Policy  Working Group  Conformity Assessment  Body  Supporting Technical  Standards  ETSI Standards, CA/B  Forum: BRG, EVCG +  NetSec  WebTrust Criteria  ETSI Standards, CEN  Standards  NIST SPs, FIPS 201, FPKIPA  Documents  Assurance to be  achieved  Best Practices and  Legal Compliance  Best Practices Legal Compliance  Technical Compliance,  Interoperability with FPKI  system  Technical Compliance to  Management  Requirements  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  27  4. Comparison of Auditing Standards for TSPs  As discussed in chapter 2, there is no implementing act for the assessment criteria for the conducting of a  conformity assessment by accredited CABs (Article 20 (4) in the eIDAS Regulation). However, for cases of  assessing QTSPs for QWACs, the usage of ETSI EN 319 401, ETSI EN 319 411-2, supported by ETSI EN 319  411-1 and connected standards, should be expected. A reasonable next step would be to examine these  standards and compare them with other mentioned standards, especially with WebTrust as a leading  competing audit scheme. This was performed by means of a comparison of the criteria of the mentioned  ETSI and WebTrust standards.  A common discussion is about the level of detail of the criteria as they are described in the standards. If  requirements are more detailed, the possibility for different assessors to reach the same results would be  higher. However, detailed requirements may deter the free interpretation about the fulfilment of the  requirements.  Hence, in this report, each of the criteria has been assessed on level of detail. This assessment yields an  overview of the level of detail of the above-mentioned ETSI standards and give indication of the degrees of  freedom that auditors may be able to interpret differently. It is especially when norms, or the criteria  supporting those norms, are not explicit or very detailed, that the auditor will be asked to use his  professional judgment for assessing criteria and ultimately making judgments about the control objectives  and management systems.  This chapter presents a tabulated assessment that includes the level of detail of the controls of the  examined standards, which are qualitatively categorized in one of the three levels, based on (Timmerman,  2004), s indicated below:   High: The control criteria or evaluation guidance provided is detailed or includes tangible bench-marks.  In other words, how a control objective is achieved is considered in addition to what that objective  comprises. For example, “Physical barriers are in place (e.g. solid walls that extend from real floor to  real ceiling) to prevent unauthorized entry and environmental contamination to the CA’s certificate  manufacturing facility.”   Medium: The qualitative criteria are provided at a relatively high level of detail. How those objectives  are achieved, however, is generally less concrete. For example, “Physical protection shall be achieved  through the creation of clearly defined security perimeters.”   Low: Only the control objectives are provided. Commonly, what the control objective is, but not how it  is to be or should be achieved. For example, “The integrity and authenticity of the status information  shall be protected.”  Although WebTrust contains many illustrative guidance controls in addition to the high-level control  objectives, they do not necessarily yield non-compliance when not adhered to, but they do provide a  higher level of detail for interpreting the control objective. These controls were, therefore, taken into  consideration when evaluating the level of detail of the control objective. Evidently, they provide  meaningful tips and guidelines for both the manager implementing a system, and the auditor assessing the  (management) system, thereby framing the professional judgment of the auditor. It is for that reason that,  even though illustrative controls have no mandatory status, these controls are included in the comparisons  throughout this report.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  28  ETSI requirements  We start with the examination of the level of detail of ETSI standards which could/should be used by a CAB  for a conformity assessment of a TSP. The level of detail of the ETSI standards which could/should be used  by a CAB for a conformity assessment of a TSP (i.e. the controls of ETSI EN 319 401, ETSI EN 319 411-1 and  -2) are listed in the checklist contained in ETSI TR 119 411-4.14 This checklist provides all requirements  identifiers in such a way that it can be used by the TSP itself to prepare for an assessment of its practices  against the current standards (i.e. to serve as a basis for a self-declaration) and/or by the assessor when  conducting the assessment, for the sake of facility for both the assessor and the TSP being assessed. We  use here the expression “detail” exactly as it is used in (Timmerman, 2004) and follow the methodology of  (Timmerman, 2004).  Table 5 is a sample (high-order) extract of TR 119 411-4 to help give an idea about the content of the full  list. In this sample, the column “CA/B Forum Requirement” is omitted, since it is not relevant to any  technical requirement. The column “CA/B Forum Requirement” provides the reference from where the  technical requirement originates, when relevant. To indicate the severity of the requirement:   the term \"shall\" indicates requirements strictly to be followed in order to conform to the standard and  from which no deviation is permitted;   the term \"should\" indicates that among several possibilities one is recommended as particularly suit- able, without mentioning or excluding others, or that a certain course of action is preferred but not  necessarily required, or that (in the negative form) a certain possibility or course of action is  deprecated but not prohibited.  To summarize, the examined ETSI requirements in general are principle-based. Control objectives are  stated at the beginning of each section, frequently broken down into more detailed control objectives and  enriched with guidelines on what elements should be controlled to cover the objective. However, not all  elements are illustrated by measurable controls to validate effectiveness of the control objective. This is  also reflected in the fact that level of detail of the majority of these requirements received a score of  Medium.  14 This checklist can be found at https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/119400_119499/11941104/01.01.01_60/  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  29  Table 5: High-order extract of checklist ETSI TR 119 411-4  DOCUMENT  REFERENCE  REQUIREMENT  REFERENCE SEVERITY MAIN SECTION SUBSECTION  LEVEL OF  DETAIL  [ETSI 319 411-1] OVR-5.1-03 should  General provisions on Certification Practice  Statement and Certificate Policies  General requirements High  [ETSI 319 411-2] OVR-5.1-03 shall  General provisions on Certification Practice  Statement and Certificate Policies  General requirements High  [ETSI 319 411-2] OVR-5.1-04  shall  General provisions on Certification Practice  Statement and Certificate Policies  General requirements High  [ETSI 319 411-2] OVR-5.1-05  shall  General provisions on Certification Practice  Statement and Certificate Policies  General requirements High  [ETSI 319 401] REQ-5-01 shall Risk Assessment Risk Assessment Low  [ETSI 319 401] REQ-5-02 shall Risk Assessment Risk Assessment Low  [ETSI 319 401] REQ-5-03 shall Risk Assessment Risk Assessment Low  [ETSI 319 401] REQ-5-04 shall Risk Assessment Risk Assessment Low  [ETSI 319 411-1] OVR-5.1-03 should  General provisions on Certification Practice  Statement and Certificate Policies  General requirements High  [ETSI 319 411-2] OVR-5.1-03 shall  General provisions on Certification Practice  Statement and Certificate Policies General requirements High  [ETSI 319 411-2] OVR-5.1-04  shall  General provisions on Certification Practice  Statement and Certificate Policies  General requirements High  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  30  Requirements of WebTrust for CAs  In this section, we examine the level of detail of the criteria in WebTrust15. Once again we use the  expression \"detail\" exactly as it is used in (Timmerman, 2004). Table 6 analyses the level of detail  concerning the “WebTrust Principles and Criteria for Certification Authorities – Extended Validation SSL”  (WebTrust EV SSL) (CPA, 2014), and Table 7 analyses the “WebTrust Principles and Criteria for Certification  Authorities – SSL Baseline with Network Security” (CPA, 2016) (WebTrust Principles and Criteria for CAs).  The analysis is based on the analysis of the authors following the methodology of (Timmerman, 2004).

Here, rather than a mapping and comparison of the hundreds of individual requirements in  detail, we were interested in whether there may be significant differences in the level of detail between  the standards that could influence acceptance. The results of this comparison survey can be found below  in Table 8. If the level of detail is not equal, then the name of Webtrust or ETSI is indicated in Table 8.

By and large, the requirements from the ETSI standards under consideration can be  found in the world of WebTrust and vice versa.  The CA/B Forum16, as a voluntary organization comprising major browser vendors and TSPs, has specified  guidelines for TSPs: Extended Validation Guidelines (CA/Browser Forum, 2012), Baseline Requirements  (CA/Browser Forum, 2017) and Network and Certificate System Security Guidelines (CA/Browser Forum,  2013). These guidelines are for the TSPs to know what they have to do, but they are not necessarily  requirements for achieving inclusion in the browsers’ root stores. That is to say, it is not sufficient as a  stand-alone audit, but indirectly, via ETSI or WebTrust, the TSP must fulfill all of the requirements. The  browsers have policies and procedures that the TSPs must comply with in order to be included; in the  various root store policies is stated that the TSP must be compliant with them in order to achieve inclusion.  The ETSI standards include requirements from the above three guidelines, which are covered in the EN 319  4xx series documents. Moreover, WebTrust has adjusted its requirements and specifically has adopted the  (CPA, 2011) and (CPA, 2014) to meet the CA/Browser Forum Baseline SSL requirements.  According to both the in-depth technical analysis of this and other studies, as well as the judgment from  industry experts, the WebTrust audit scheme is more or less equivalent to the ETSI audit scheme in  purpose and outcome. By and large, the requirements from the ETSI standards under consideration for the  assessment of TSPs can be found in the world of WebTrust and vice versa. Likewise, the degree of detail in  the ETSI standards considered above and for WebTrust are also comparable. Therefore, from the  generalised point of view, there is no reason to prefer ETSI or WebTrust.  WebTrust assessments are performed by independent accountant firms, which are recognized by CPA  Canada. That is to say, if the WebTrust scheme is compared with the ETSI scheme, CPA Canada can  generally be regarded in parallel as an accreditation body. On the other hand, assessment and certification  in accordance with ETSI standards are often performed by a CAB accredited by a NAB (as set out in the  previous chapter). This scheme is similar to the ISO certification scheme. Capabilities of CABs are ensured  16 CA/B Forum web page: https://cabforum.org/  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  35  by the NABs, and the NABs are regulated by European Co-operation for Accreditation (EA). In this case, the  ETSI scheme stands out as a more regulated environment, with bodies in place to oversee the full length of  the trust chain, from the highest level of administration down through each individual TSP. While the two  schemes look very similar, ETSI is characterized by this higher level of organization. The ETSI trust  framework can also be considered more transparent, a characteristic typically seen as valuable across all  levels of the ICT industry, since all rules for the assessment are published and publicly accessible.  The level of detail of the requirements as they are described in the criteria in auditing is more important in  an ETSI driven world. If the criteria include more detailed requirements, the reproducibility of the audit  result would be high (even among different CABs, which are accredited by NABs within different Member  States). This means that the possibility for different assessors to reach the same results would be higher  when more detailed requirements are included. It does not mean the ETSI requirements are less complete,  effective or comprehensive criteria, but this difference about the detail levels may cause different  assessors (CABs) to deliver different decisions when assessing the same TSP according the ETSI standards.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  36  5. QWACs Recognition and Visibility  In today’s internet, browsers are necessary for providing access to the world wide web, and to this end, as  the gate-keepers of information and the secure transmission thereof, browsers wield significant weight  both in how relying parties and end users experience the deployment of certificates, and also internally to  the industry.  With this in mind, eIDAS audits, which are foundational to the European trust scheme, require the  successful deployment of QWACs into a healthy and developing digital market, here in Europe and abroad  in the wider digital world. A most notable area that needs to be addressed in order to facilitate the wide  spread and use of the QWACs lies in discussions with major browser vendors, who operate the largest  public-facing vehicle for website authentication certificate usage and European counterparts, i.e. in ETSI,  ACAB’c and other boards and agencies that exist to protect and strengthen the interests of the EU in the  global community.  This assessment views the promotion of QWACs at a high level; standards themselves can be written to  bridge technical gaps (an important point that will be covered in the roadmap), but if the system for trust  supersedes the a priori value of the (auditing) system in question, the marginal utility of QWACs will in fact  decrease. It is the task of all stakeholders of this effort to engage in the promotion of QWACs at the same  time that the audit scheme is tightened in language and in scope of the utility and value TSPs and browsers  place in it.  Visualization and visibility  It is no exaggeration to say that, without the help of various tools like indicators on the browser user  interface (UI), the average (i.e. technically inexperienced) internet user would not be able to determine  whether or not a website is secured by a corresponding valid QWAC. For example, the verification step in  which the TSP issuing a website authentication certificate was granted the “qualified” status requires that  the TSP be identified by reading and understanding the certificate, followed by a check that this status is  included in the trusted list of the EU Member State in which the TSP is located. It is by no means self- explanatory for the average end-user to know about, let alone to locate, peruse and interpret this list.  Moreover, trusted lists are primarily machine-processable documents (in XML); the legal entities “behind  the scenes” are often hidden behind trade names. In the current configuration of the trust service  environment (not only in Europe, but in the rest of the world), users will find it difficult to mark the  distinction between qualified and non-qualified trust services that any one single qualified TSP may  provide.  Web browsers have a special and important role to play here. Evidence from a number of studies  demonstrates that the average user has been educated (through the use of various web browsers active  on the market) in recent years in such a way that he or she has come to expect to see various indicators  (e.g. a URL with “https”, a green bar or padlock symbol, etc.) guaranteeing (by means of a certificate) the  security of the website currently open. More informed users may also note the difference in the web  browser UI when a webpage is secured by an Extended Validation (EV) certificate (as opposed to e.g. a  Domain Validated (DV) certificate). Until very recently, it appears that one could assume that this has more  or less become established, and browser providers would continue to handle security visibility in this way.  However, during the drafting of this study, the landscape has already changed with the latest versions of  Chrome and iOS, Apple’s mobile operating system. It appears that some browsers will change their UI and  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  37  not indicate the use of EV certificates anymore. This is one area to keep a close eye on over time and is the  basis for a strong set of recommendations in the following chapter.  5.1.1 What we have now: No industry consensus on standards for UI security indicators  Figure 8 gives a sample of the ways in which security is denoted by different browsers in different contexts.  While there is generally a hierarchy for UI marking (in so far as DV and EV certificates generally use  different indicators), there are different approaches between the browsers and between individual  browsers’ approaches to the UI that the argument has surfaced at trust service conferences and  workshops17 in the past several years in favour of unifying the browser iconography of security. The lack of  consistency among browser UI is and has long been a persistent challenge, and often appears as granular  indications of four states of security: unencrypted, Domain Validated (DV), Organization validated (OV) and  Extended Validation (EV). This can be problematic for several reasons, namely that criminal threats can  easily hide behind a DV certificate and because DV certificates have exploded into popularity, accounting  for a majority of website encryption, a problem eIDAS both sought to and has the capacity to address.  However, individual browsers have frequently changed their own UI, and it has been claimed that users  cannot keep up. Most mobile devices do not even show a symbol for encryption and, as a result, users can  be confused about how to read the browser UI and determine the safety of their online behaviour.  To date, however, despite lengthy industry discussion, no streamlining of these images or texts has taken  any public shape or direction.  Figure 8: Examples of browser UI for SSL/TLS encryption across device (Source: Security Council (CASC) May 2017 CA)  5.1.2 The future of browser security UI  Google has chosen to follow a different path with the Chrome browser. While aggressively promoting  HTTPS web encryption in the last few years, the Google Chrome security team has come to distrust CAs  and other “trusted third-parties”. In October 2017, in fact, Google began transitioning to a mandatory  policy of “Certificate Transparency” (CT), opening the way for an online community of open certificate logs,  monitors and auditors to provide near real-time validation of certificates. This push away (Fiedler, 2014)  17 E.g. CA Day Berlin 2017 & 2018, CA/B Forum meeting (Taipei), etc.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  38  from the certificate authority-based infrastructure relies on disintermediated – so-called “qualified” –  certificate logs18 for SSL/TLS end-entity certificates. Under the rules of this new “public” trust framework, if  a TSP does not include a certificate in the CT log server, it will not be trusted by Chrome or, recently, by  Apple’s Safari browser. As a logical consequence, Google has since banned the green bar in the Chrome UI  that use to indicate the deployment of an EV certificate (though Chrome 70 still has an EV indicator by  displaying the company name on the left-hand side of the URL bar). The TSP community and  representatives from other leading browsers have been public and vocal against this latest measure to  distrust trusted third parties and, especially, to simplify the UI in such a way that they claim undermines  long-vetted and practiced public understanding of web security features like the padlock and green URL  bar.  The Chrome browser has certainly introduced a number of radical changes to the web and user inter- action with the internet, and the Chrome security team is considering yet another controversial initiative:  fundamentally rethinking URLs and showing information in the address bar. While the Chrome security  team does not presently believe that URLs work well conveying website identity, Google plans to move  “toward a place where web identity is understandable by everyone – they know who they’re talking to  when they’re using a website and they can reason about whether they can trust them.” However, this will  mean substantial changes in how and when Chrome displays a URL.  It is therefore by no means clear what web browsers will show in their UI in the coming months, let alone  in the coming years. While in a world of different certificates (e.g. EV certificates and QWACs), it seems  from the plurality of industry voices both reasonable and preferable to be able to recognize these  differences when visiting a web page secured by a certificate; today there does not seem to be any activity  by browser vendors that supports this conviction. Instead there are grounds to assume that browser  vendors, especially Google, are likely to define, on their own, which websites they choose and refuse to  render.  5.1.3 Difficulties inherent to a separate QWAC UI  One could argue that because browsers are extendable, it should be possible to develop extensions that  indicate on the browser UI whether a website is secured (and, specifically, by a QWAC) or not. The modern  extension frameworks of Firefox and Chrome – and therefore also Opera, Edge and Vivaldi, which mimic  Google Chrome’s extension architecture (at least at the time of this writing) – allow the display of buttons  and/or icons on the browser UI. This could be, for example, a green or red button on the right-hand side of  the address panel or even to open a new small browser window that displays some explanatory  information. However, extensions are not able to assume control of the normal behaviour of the browser,  a rule defined by the browser vendors. If the browser indicates that a user should not trust an SSL/TLS  connection because the corresponding SSL/TLS certificate cannot be found in so called “qualified”  certificate transparency (CT) logs for SSL/TLS end-entity certificates, this cannot be changed by modern  extensions. In the case of a QWAC that cannot be found in the CT logs, this would trigger trust concerns for  users, even if the extension shows that the website uses a QWAC. Moreover, if the browser should refuse  to render websites in which the corresponding SSL/TLS-certificate cannot be found in so called “qualified”  CT logs for SSL/TLS end-entity certificates, then the proposed extensions will either be useless or need to  open a second window, which would then render the previously-refused website. Unfortunately, it is  difficult to imagine the scenario in which any customer would put much trust in such a solution.  Moreover, both on desktops and mobile devices, there is currently no way to directly provide information  about a given SSL/TLS connection to extensions based solely on modern extension frameworks. This  18 The term “qualified” in reference to Google CT must not be conflated or confused with eIDAS “qualified”.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  39  implies that the evaluation of the corresponding certificates and the validation of QWACS must be  implemented outside such an extension, i.e. by so called native messaging (s.(Mozilla, 2018)), which leads  to additional security questions.  5.1.4 The EU trust mark as a possible branding tool  Visualizing whether a website is secured by a QWAC is only one side of the coin. The visibility of the eIDAS  framework and of QTSPs and confidence in websites using QWACs is another. The confidence of the  average user to trust a website (e.g. the websites of European banks) can be based on the use of QWACs.  One of several building blocks of the EU to support the visibility of eIDAS system of QTS in the market is  the introduction of the EU trust mark (EU Commission, 2015) and its direct linking to the trusted lists. The  rules for the use of trust mark, as well as the specifications relating to the form of the EU trust mark for  qualified trust services are set in the eIDAS Regulation (EU Commission, 2014) and the above-mentioned  implementing regulation (EU Commission, 2015). The trust mark is intended to give reassurance to  customers about the confidence they can have in a certain TSP and, by extension, the area of the web they  are visiting, should it be secured with a QWAC. Once a TSP is granted the qualified status (and such status  being indicated in the trusted list), it may use the EU trust mark to indicate in a simple, recognisable and  clear manner the QTS they provide. When using the trust mark for QTS, QTSPs need to ensure that a link to  the relevant trusted list is made available on their website.  Getting browsers on board  The following section summarises key assertions presented in a paper entitled “Trust Service Provider  Technical Best Practices Considering the EU eIDAS Regulation (910/2014)”, which was developed in mid- 2017 by representatives from the leading browsers: Apple, Google, Microsoft and Mozilla.  A major point leading the report focuses on the need to look beyond the scope of what European national  or supranational governments can accomplish. While regulatory options do exist for the management of  planned activities and institutionalized learning behaviours, the eIDAS regulation expressly stipulates that  industry-led initiatives are not only an appropriate strategy, but a desirable one as well. In specific the  regulation stipulates that “Recognizing that ‘best practices in the field’ change over time, Recital 67 in the  Regulation considers industry-led initiatives to define appropriate best practices”. This is, in effect, because  the field of ICT has a propensity towards significant and frequent change. This point suggests the  significance of its own influence on the recommendations that this study makes towards meeting its goal  (see Chapter 6 for the road map).  While the legislative course might not be a match in speed for developments in technology, market tools  (broadly speaking, companies and specialist industry groups that comprise said digital ecosystem) might be  successfully interlinked to maintain the demand for cryptographic products and strategies, for the purpose  of combating cybercrime as well as to modernize government and civil applications. It also supports the  idea that key industry players like the browser vendors have a significant role to play.  This report provides an example for convergence or overlap between eIDAS and industry efforts to make  available TSP security across-the-board.  This is achieved by means of best practices which are themselves  not necessarily addressed in Implementing Acts on electronic trust services.  While there are a number of representative requirements for each major trust framework, there still exist  discrepancies between the standards set out for PTC and those for QWACs under eIDAS.  Figure 9 shows  the relevant gaps that exist between requirements for CA/B Forum PTC certificates and those for QWACs.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  40  Figure 9: Requirements for PTC and QWAC (and identified gaps)  The TSP best practice report also describes what defines an \"incident\", and lays out the steps necessary or  industry-accepted standards for appropriate response behaviour to such deviations in accepted normal  operations by TSPs:19 “An incident is any event, situation, or circumstance that has, could have, or might  cause the TSP to operate outside the requirements laid down by the Certification Authorities/Browsers  (CA/B) Forum Baseline Requirements or Extended Validation (EV) Guidelines, Root Store Policies, Audit  Requirements, or other security relevant obligation”. This definition helps to establish a baseline for what  \"acceptable\" or \"normal\" TSP operational behaviour looks like, in order for incidents to be identified and  appropriately addressed.  Although little is written in the current draft of the report about the mechanics of incident handling, it is  expressed in no uncertain terms how important incident-reporting is, as well as establishing intelligible  19 It should be noted that these guidelines or recommendations for security best practices can be observed without  specific reference to any technology to lead the way. This point is meant to suggest that, while, for example, Google  can be part of the contributors to these sets of guidelines for TSPs, trying to force an industry conversion to  certificate transparency (CT) has no real bearing on e.g. certificate lifecycles and etc., or the reporting requirement  for TSPs that experience an incident.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  41  protocols for following up.20 It appears that incident-reporting is one of the best ways that the system itself  can maintain a consistent level of ecological security; unfortunately, it is a reactive, rather than a  preventative response to security threats. It also seeks to minimize damage from breaches and other  attacks with e.g. a 72-hour maximum requirement for reporting and response, it does not offer a way to  prevent damage from occurring.  There is also a variety of agents to whom the TSP needs to report (and thus, have an appropriate  communications plan for reporting), including auditors and supervisory bodies, but especially to the root  store operators, a point which diverges somewhat from the overall hierarchical trust framework currently  employed within the eIDAS environment.  Another notable message from this study is the advice from the browser community that TSPs undergo  audits with a frequency of no less than one per year, which indicates a convergence with the WebTrust  requirement of an annual auditing requirement. In 2015, ETSI changed the audit cycles from three to two  years (see ETSI EN 319 403). The best practices study makes specific reference to this ETSI audits cycle of  two years, based on the eIDAS Regulation, which stipulates that a full conformance audit, rather than a  surveillance audit, would be necessary to constitute the successful completion of an annual audit in this  case. This presents an opportunity for both ETSI and eIDAS to close a gap that currently exists in strong  audit requirements as perceived by the browser community.  Furthermore, \"if an Auditor finds non-compliance with Audit Criteria, the Auditor should provide a  qualified report that indicates the controls that failed. If there are any changes in the certification status of  a TSP, the TSP should notify Root Store Operators immediately\". This statement indicates a divergence in  stated policy from e.g. ETSI audit standards, and the best practices set forth by the lead browser  community. The fundamental difference is in the inroads of communication through which the root store  operators are involved in the audit process. In this case, deficiencies in an audit report are suggested to be  notified by the TSP to the root store operator in addition to the requirement that they advise the  supervisory body (as required in eIDAS Article 19). A point-in-time audit statement may be used to address  a TSP that has rectified said deficiencies, but this only validates a TSP's practices on that particular date.  Indeed, it seems that regular audits, supplemented with these spot checks for interim inadequacies, are a  good way to manage the ecosystem.  As reaction to browser requirements, in July 2018, ETSI also published technical specification TS 119 403-2  (Additional Requirements for Conformity Assessment Bodies Auditing Trust Service Providers that issue  Publicly-Trusted Certificates), with the expectation that it would lead to the preparation of audit reports  that are more compliant with the browser requirements, although the reports are not required to report  publicly about any details of instances of non-compliance. Section 4.2 Audit Frequency states both that, “a  full-surveillance audit shall be conducted no less frequently than annually” and that, “updated audit  information shall be provided no less frequently than annually” (see ETSI EN 319 403, clause 7.4.6). In  addition, a current CA/B Forum ballot is under preparation to make the requirements from TS 119 403  mandatory for all ETSI audits for PTC.  Incidentally, and in consideration of appropriate management systems, the study in question also suggests  that “the CA's Certificate Policy (CP) and Certificate Practice Statement (CPS) must provide enough detail  to allow third parties to assess how TSPs enforce imposed requirements”. This is a particularly important  point, which specifically addresses the intelligibility of the CP and CPS of a TSP to third parties. A CP or CPS  20 This comment may be updated after 14 October 2018, after which the latest approved ballot will take effect.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  42  which only states that it meets CA/B Forum’s Baseline Requirements (an industry “open secret” that many,  if not most, CPs today are a copied verbatim from the BR) is not sufficiently detailed enough.  Lastly, for the purposes of this study, an interesting point was made concerning liability: the “inability to  update software due to insufficient engineering resources, contractual barriers, reprioritization, or other  delay is not a valid reason for non-compliance”. This presents an interesting economic approach to the  security ecosystem problem. It is worth discussing this statement as a theoretical end game in economic  terms e.g. what happens if it becomes too financially onerous for a large company providing certificates to  perform critical updates. Whereas small holes in the TSP infrastructure can be mended quickly by other  TSPs issuing cross-over certificates, security measures should be in place to deal with a hypothetical end- of-days event, should a “too big to fail” TSP cease to offer continuity. To illustrate, before the 2008 global  financial collapse, the collapse of large, global financial institutions was unthinkable. It is perhaps worth  exploring the possibility of ecosystem-wide failure scenarios and draft a body of documents which can help  identify and reduce such risks. A robust audit scheme will help curb the possibility of these kinds of events.  It should be noted that there has been criticism on the report from industry experts, which includes the  focus on root store operators – as bodies which see themselves as responsible for policing the operation of  TSPs – rather than a closer focus on the role of eIDAS regulatory requirements. Secondly is the section  about Certificate Transparency, which suggests that all PTC should be published to a public domain, a point  which avoids taking into account any restrictions which might apply under the rules of the European  General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which went into effect in May 2018. As a final note, some  experts have agreed that all the security requirements addressed in this study can be comfortably covered  by the current version of ETSI EN 319 411-1.  However, it appears that the recommendations issued by the browser community in this study have  regardless made some compelling suggestions about convergences and divergences between audit  requirements on the books and best industry practices, a number of which this study moulds into the  language of recommendations in the roadmap in Chapter 6.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  43  6. Conclusions and Recommendations (Road Map)  From our preliminary conclusions and based on the comparative analysis specifically between the eIDAS  regulatory framework and the ETSI and WebTrust audit schemes, we can offer the following  recommendations as a way forward for the eventual, enhanced global acceptance of an audit scheme  under the eIDAS Regulation. The recommendations can be separated into three basic categories of action:  1) making improvements to the existing scheme based on ETSI EN 319 4xx, 2) creating a branding and  public usage strategy for QWACs usage, in part by creating value for the EU trust mark and enforcing it by  law and 3) continuing to foster relationships and cooperating closely with browser vendors for better  acceptance.  Annex A includes diagrams to visualize the predicted effort required to carry out actions in each of the  recommended direction as a result from the assessment made by experts in the context of this report.  Improving the audits, top down  6.1.1 Harmonization of the conformity assessment scheme  As already discussed, the eIDAS Regulation does not place any restrictions on the conformity assessment  scheme beyond its fit into the general regulatory framework of conformity assessment in Regulation (EC)  No 765/2008. It is up to the supervisory body to specify any requirements for CAB accreditation against  any specific audit scheme. Nearly all supervisory bodies have adopted the use of EN 319 403. Without the  adoption of a scheme aimed specifically at trust services, this is may be no assurance that the CAB has the  appropriate procedures and competencies for the audit of trust services. The eIDAS Regulation does not  impose any conformity assessment criteria beyond the requirements of the Regulation. There is no  requirement for assessment against recognised best practices for trust services.  Some of the publicly-available eIDAS audit attestations do not contain the minimum-required information,  which are required to assess the trust status of a TSP. In fact, many appear untrustworthy and cannot be  downloaded from a QWAC-secured website. In comparison with the WebTrust audit scheme, these  particular deficiencies of the eIDAS audit come into focus. According to interviewed experts, a comparison  of several audit reports from different European TSPs and CABs reveals notable dissonance.  Moreover, the decision regarding the qualification of the TSP and its trust services is made by the SB that  verifies compliance with the requirements laid down in eIDAS Regulation. However, the decision regarding  the specific practices used for qualification of the TSP is made by the SB. There are no defined  requirements on the use of best practice standards across the EU. This may result in inconsistencies in the  qualification of TSPs in different countries and may lead to a non-harmonised trust service market,  facilitating the rise of doubts about the quality of QTSP and the provided QTS, hence also the QWACs.  Therefore, there is need to define a harmonised conformity assessment scheme against which CABs would  be accredited and the QTSP/QTS certified in order to verify conformance to the eIDAS Regulation  requirements. This harmonised conformity assessment scheme would ensure that the eIDAS requirements  are satisfied, while at the same time meeting the requirements of other communities like the CA/Browser  Forum, browser vendors and application providers. This process would involve the Supervisory Bodies of  the MS as key contributors towards the specification of this conformity assessment scheme.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  44  There is need to agree upon and define a harmonised conformity assessment scheme against which  CABs would be accredited and the QTSP/QTS assessed in order to verify conformance to the eIDAS  Regulation requirements. Such a process would involve all the stakeholders – EA, ETSI, EC, ENISA, SBs  – which would participate from the specification till the enforcement of such a scheme.  One possible way forward is to map the ETSI audit scheme with the ISO 27000 series. However, used  alone, this does not include best practice for trust services and does not ensure that the auditor has the  necessary competencies to evaluate the specifics of trust services. ISO/SC27/WG4 has started a new work  item, entitled “Public key infrastructure – Practices and policy framework”. To integrate the set of ETSI  documents into the ISO framework can help eIDAS achieve better acceptance, but the quality of the ISO  audit practice in the field is not (yet) defined appropriately.  The current list of accredited CABs in the EU is not frequently updated,21 potentially causing some  confusion. It is proposed as a relatively simple step to keep a centralised list of all accredited CABs, where  it will be clearly indicated whether a CAB has been accredited under ETSI EN 319 403 by a NAB and  whether it has been accredited in line with the ETSI standards concerning the certification scheme in order  to be recognised also by the CA/B forum and the browsers. This list should be regularly updated and  provide a higher level of confidence. A list with all international licenced auditors is maintained by  WebTrust website.22  A centralised list of all accredited CABs should be maintained (by the European Commission) and  regularly updated, where it will be clearly indicated whether a CAB has been accredited under ETSI EN  319 403 by a NAB and whether it has been accredited in line with the ETSI standards concerning the  certification scheme in order to be recognised also by the CA/B Forum and the browsers.  6.1.2 Standardisation of auditor requirements  This study regards the skills and competences of individual auditors as integral to the system as a whole;  the auditing scheme lies in the judgement of the auditors themselves and, their ability to make decisions.  While ETSI EN 319 403 is widely adopted, it is not universally done so as no single conformity assessment  scheme is required. eIDAS Regulation is fundamentally technology-neutral, the requirements for the use of  state-of-the-art technology to achieve control objectives, defined according to ETSI EN 319 411, are not  equally recognized or even known to all accredited CABs. In principle, since NABs interpret the  implementation of the eIDAS Regulation, possible complications may arise for the maintenance of broader  ecosystem-wide security and also the market accessibility of TSPs.  Moreover, there is a number of requirements for the training and competence of the audit teams  according to EN 319 403, which includes provisions for demonstrated knowledge in technical, regulatory,  business, risk, policy and control areas, according to section 6.1 Conformity Assessment Body personnel  (6.1.2.2 Training of audit teams). The competences must be derived according to the general requirements  as described in ISO/IEC 17065 section 6.1 Certification body personnel. This includes that the certification  body, here interpreted as the CAB, needs to define the scope of competence, training and certification of  its auditors and provide for such training, performance testing and monitoring as necessary. As discussed  21 The most recent version of this list can be accessed at https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/content/list-conformity- assessment-bodies-cabs-accredited-against-requirements-eidas-regulation.  22 http://www.webtrust.org/licensed-webtrust-practitioners-international/item64419.aspx  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  45  since ETSI (and by extension ISO) standards often do not expressly cite specific controls or give specific  examples for the fulfilment of the standards and requirements, directions should be given for  standardisation of auditor requirements across all CABs in the EU (and beyond). These issues continue to  be a challenge because of the lack of requirements for adopting consistent best practices.  Therefore, providing specific auditors requirements would help to eliminate some degree of human error  and to bring added efficiency to the verification of the control objectives as well as facilitate the exchange  of experience and practical examples from the field.  It is recommended that ENISA, in cooperation with ETSI and CEN, develop and publish a  comprehensive set of auditors’ requirements together with best practice examples from the field.  6.1.3 Further optimization of ETSI standards  The ETSI Certification Policies 319 411 have developed into good frameworks over the past 15 years and  have been well-suited to both eIDAS \"qualified\" and \"publicly trusted\" requirements according to the CA/B  Forum. In direct comparison to WebTrust, only major deficiencies in the detailing of the requirements for  TSP procedures and audit best practice to “set up New Roots” and “CA Key Generation” can be recognized.  To this end, further specifications should be made by ETSI ESI.  It is recommended that ETSI ESI provide further specifications in the detailing of the requirements for  TSP procedures and audit best practice to “set up New Roots” and “CA Key Generation.  Another recommendation is to tighten up management of the TSL. Currently, the 3-month maximum for  any changes made is a long period. While incident reports are requested within 24-72 hours, the updating  of the TSL can take up to 3 months in some countries.  The management of the TSL needs to be updated continually to maintain the fidelity of the system  and to develop the TSL system as an alternative to the hierarchical trust approach using root stores.  Branding QWACs, rolling them out for public consumption  6.2.1 Improved visibility of the EU trust mark for qualified trust services  The Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/806 lays down specifications relating to the form of  the EU Trust Mark for qualified trust services. This trademark-protected EU branding tool for qualified trust  services should signal to the users the trustworthiness of eIDAS-compliant, audited, trust services. Only  TSPs that have been audited and confirmed by a national supervisory body can advertise their products  and services with the EU trust mark for qualified trust services. Until now, this logo has been to a large  extent unknown and has rarely been used. The WebTrust logo, in contrast, is used by a number of  international TSPs for promotional and marketing purposes and is considered trust-worthy.  The difference here is that, currently, the WebTrust logo usually links the user to a webpage with all the  desired information and is managed by WebTrust itself. In fact, there are three different logos, depending  on the audit a TSP has passed. In comparison, there exists only one EU trust mark, and its meaning  currently only really reflects that the QTSP is entitled to use it, not which from the list of applicable  qualified trust services is offered by a QTSP. Access to the EU List of the Lists through an EC browser tool  currently exists, which can help users search and discover important information about TSPs based on  different criteria like country of origin or trust service type.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  46  Increasing the global visibility of the EU trust mark as a trusted logo for qualified trust services would in  turn strengthen the acceptance of the audits. In a preceding ENISA study23, it was determined that to  display the logo in the browser URL/address bar is, in the current state of the web environment, too  difficult to be effectively implemented. While it is perhaps not technically difficult to do, there is currently  no intention for browsers to integrate it.  There is need to further analyse, test and review how the EU trust mark can be displayed on websites  in a tamper-proof manner in order to increase the global visibility of the EU trust mark as a trusted  logo for qualified trust services, which would in turn strengthen the acceptance of the audits. This  could be done by the European Commission or by ENISA.  6.2.2 A logotype certificate with CA/B Forum (development of a QWAC-specific UI)  In 2004, RFC 3709 defined logotypes in X.509 certificates. Logotype certificates can help make brands or  trust marks visible in a trustworthy manner. Many issuers may use a community logotype to co-brand with  a global community in order to gain global recognition of its local service provision, a type of community  branding that is very common e.g. in the credit card business, where local independent card issuers include  a globally recognized brand (such as VISA and MasterCard).  The development of a QWAC-specific UI can be an alternative for the green bar and padlock in the  browser URL field and it will also need consent from the browser or application vendor to show the  content of the certificate.  6.2.3 Mandate EU trust mark usage, beginning with European banks  One concrete idea to complement the previous recommendation about improving the visibility of the EU  trust mark is the possibility of mandating its use in test cases and expanding its reach in an already trusted  environment. After PSD2, since it is now obligatory for European banks to deploy QWACs, it may be  possible to obligate banks to engineer some sort of visual indicator of their deployment. This seal could be  displayed in the browser for websites that deploy QWACs, beginning first with banks and then later  extending to other areas such as healthcare, etc. It should be made clear here that this strategy needs to  be one that is unified. The EU trust mark embodies an image at the heart of the European trust  iconography and is ready to be deployed more publicly.  Since “banks are taking part in educating customers by offering browser plug-ins for enhanced  security and peripheral education” (Timmerman, 2004), a foreseeable next step is the full pan- European usage of the trust mark on bank websites that fall under the purview of PSD2 rules. This  agenda might also be extended to the TSL integration for all operating systems and browser vendors  operating in the European Union as part of a wider rollout of the trust mark and its potential close  association with QWACs.  23 QWACs Plugin, January 2018, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/qwacs-plugin.  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  47  Relationships with the browsers  6.3.1 Face-time with the browsers, meetings planned for CA/B Forum  A critical step forward is going to be convincing the browsers and OS vendors to include the TSL in their  respective root stores. Before they even consider including the TSL in the browser list, they need to gain  reassurance that the audit schemes meet their expectations and that the criteria used meet their  requirements as represented in the CA/B Forum documents. ETSI has gone a long way in achieving this by  the inclusion of ETSI standards for audit (EN 319 403) and the policy criteria (EN 319 411-1) in their  documents. However, there still remains some resistance to their adoption. That being said, however, ETSI  has enjoyed substantial success with CA/B Forum concerning the adoption of ETSI standards that are based  on eIDAS requirements (e.g. EN 319 403 and EN 319 411-1) as basic fulfilment of the requirements of CA/B  Forum’s Baseline and EV Guidelines.  The value of QWACs, outside the EU, will diminish as the browser vendors (after 2018, Google and Apple)  deprecate the use of EV certificates as they promote a system for which website security comes without  additional information on the certificates. Since the publication of a number of studies in which the EV  certificates no longer benefit from their previous utility leading up to the rollout of CT, unless a way  forward is fostered with these vendors, it will be challenging to grow the value of QWACs outside the EU  Digital Single Market.  In part, this argument is why individual, face-to-face meetings are being arranged with the browsers at the  CA/B Forum meeting in Shanghai in late 2018 and in Cupertino in 2019.  It will be challenging to grow the value of QWACs outside the EU Digital Single Market by convincing  the browsers and OS vendors to include the TSL in their respective root stores. Towards this goal face- to-face meetings should be arranged by the European Commission with the browsers also in the  context of CA/B Forum meetings.  6.3.2 EU browser  Because website certificate services are dependent on the willingness of browsers to recognize Trusted List  status, and because no browsers currently recognize the Trusted List by default, an alternative, if not  short- and medium-term, way forward is the cooperation with a European-based browser vendor as a test  case for Trusted List root store acceptance. Previously a partnership with the Vivaldi browser from Norway  has been floated in various EU ICT forums and workshops.  An alternative way forward is the cooperation with a European-based browser vendor as a test case  for Trusted List root store acceptance. The terms of this agreement would include e.g. mandatory use  of QWACs in e-Government and financial services for a Digital Single Gateway.  6.3.3 European Certificate Transparency  Certificate Transparency (RFC 6962) was described by Google some years ago in 2013 at the IETF as an  open framework for the monitoring of the SSL / TLS certificate system and the auditing of specific SSL/TLS  certificates. Since then, Google has implemented this RFC by requiring its use in Chrome for all EV  certificates issued after 1 Feb 2015. By the end of 2018, both Google and Apple will require CT for all  issued SSL certificates (otherwise Chrome and Safari will classify affected websites as insecure).  Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits  v1.1 |  May 2019  48  Using its substantial market power, with this CT initiative, Google is considerably influencing the future of  the SSL/TLS ecosystem. At the European level, it is important to play an active role in the context of CT and  to represent European concerns and enforce them in cooperation with politics and administration.  To support the visibility of eIDAS and to place the aspects of eIDAS in the context of CT, European  players should develop and operate European components for CT i.e. a European (qualified) certificate  log and European certificate monitoring and auditing services. It is anticipated that this would offer  great political leverage in the relationship between the EU concerns and major browser vendors.

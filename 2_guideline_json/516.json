Conclusions 39  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  05  Executive Summary  Taking into account the increasing need for online data protection and the availability of numerous Privacy  Enhancing Technologies1 (PETs) for internet and mobile users, ENISA conducted, under its 2015 work  programme2, a study on online privacy tools, aiming at enhancing trust and assurance in their use by the  general public. In particular, this study includes three parts: a) a review of existing web portals promoting  the use of online privacy tools for the general public, b) a proposal for a methodology for evaluating the  quality and functionality of PETs, and c) a pilot application of the proposed methodology in the area of anti-  tracking browser extensions.  The review analysed several web portals that are listing and/or recommending the use of specific online  privacy tools (e.g. for secure messaging, anti-tracking, encryption, etc.). The main focus was on the criteria  applied for the selection (and further assessment) of these tools. The analysis showed that there are no  commonly accepted methodologies and in most cases there is not even a description of the rationale used  for selecting and recommending certain tools.  To this end, based on the results of the privacy portals’ review, a number of criteria was defined relating to  the reliability and usability of online privacy tools, especially when targeting the general public. These criteria  set the basis for ENISA’s proposal for a generic PETs evaluation methodology and are divided in three  categories: basic, quality and functionality. The basic criteria are a preliminary set of fundamental  characteristics that the tool should have (a threshold for proceeding with further analysis). They are related  to the maturity and stability of a PET, overall maintenance (last update), reactivity to known vulnerabilities,  ease of access and installation, availability of documentation. The quality criteria aim to assess generic  quality features related to the reliability and usability of the tool. In that respect they include: background  information for the tool, version history, transparency of installation and use, available public reviews,  privacy by design and by default, ease of use, user interaction and side effects. Last, the functionality criteria  assess whether the tool offers the promised functionality and features (in other words what the tool does  and what it does not) and they differ for each area of privacy tools.  Following the proposed methodology, as part of the study, a pilot analysis of six popular anti-tracking  browser extensions was also conducted. The results of the analysis is a comparative presentation of the  tools, aiming at highlighting their differences and similarities and drawing relevant conclusions.  A generic methodology for evaluation of PETs  One of the main findings of this study is the need for a widely accepted methodology for the evaluation of  PETs, which could enable a uniform presentation of their different aspects, thus supporting the general  1 In the context of this report, PETs is also used to refer to privacy enhancing tools (or privacy tools).  2 ENISA Work Programme 2015 including multi-annual planning,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/enisa-work-programme-2015  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/enisa-work-programme-2015  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  06  public in making informed choices. Such a methodology could be used both by privacy experts providing  reviews and/or comparisons of tools and/or by the PET developers (in the course of a self-assessment  practice). More advanced users could also apply the methodology to assess certain elements of their  preferred tools. Although only an in-depth technical analysis (e.g. code inspection) may provide certainty  regarding a tool’s functionality at a certain point in time, such a generic methodology could be very useful  in evaluating PETs, serving as an indicator of their reliability and usability.  Criteria for evaluating PETs – open issues and further work  On top of the evaluation criteria already proposed in the report, several parameters still need to considered  for a systematic assessment of PETs and there are extensive grounds for research and improvement in the  field. A number of open issues where, thus, identified, for example relating to the assessment of privacy by  design, the analysis of side effects (due to the use of PETs), the usability and accessibility assessment,  performance and costs of PETs, relevant legal, ethical and societal aspects, etc. Taking into account the  above points, this study should be seen as a step forward for opening this discussion and engaging all  involved parties in it.  Providing guidance to the general public  A critical dimension of the proposed methodology is its’ practical application and use for providing guidance  to the general public. Several elements need to be discussed in this area, for example who is doing the  evaluation, the extent that self-assessments (by PET developers) can be useful, visual and comprehensive  presentation of results to internet and mobile users, maintenance of the information, etc. Awareness and  education of the users is central in such an approach and different dissemination channels and methods can  be applied, especially through social media platforms.  Building trust in online privacy: a combined effort  As a final remark, it should be noted that the promotion of online privacy enhancing technologies for the  general public needs to be a combined effort of all involved stakeholders, such as the Data Protection  Authorities, the privacy researchers, the independent privacy organisations and associations, the users of  PETs, as well as the industry of PET developers. ENISA will continue its efforts in this field by bringing the  different communities together and building the necessary expertise for this important task.  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  07  1. Introduction  Privacy and data protection are fundamental human rights and are strictly anchored within the EU legal  framework3. Over the last years, ENISA has put considerable effort in these areas, providing technical  guidance on key privacy technologies such as cryptographic techniques, trust frameworks and electronic  seals, and supporting the ongoing discussions for the reform of the European data protection regime.  Following the recent revelations on mass surveillance of electronic communications4, it is widely recognised  that one of the most serious concerns today is the preservation of privacy when using internet and mobile  applications. This concern has given rise to an increasing appearance of online tools, often open-source  and/or freeware, affirming that they can offer certain privacy-preventive functionality for the average user,  such as for example secure communication, protection against tracking, safeguarding of personal data,  anonymous browsing, etc. However, in many cases the functionality of such tools is not as expected, for  example due to lack of transparency on the tool’s development and operation or lack of proper maintenance  mechanisms. There are already a few known cases of tools declared as top privacy solutions that have been  proven fraudulent5. Privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) that fail to offer what they promise can be very  dangerous, as the false sense of protection can compromise the users’ personal data and negatively affect  or even put in harm’s way their personal life.  Against this background, ENISA decided to carry out under its 2015 work programme a study in the area of  PETs for the protection of online privacy (online privacy tools) with two main objectives: a) to define the  current level of information and guidance that is provided to the general public and b) to provide a proposal  for an assessment model for online privacy tools that could bring more assurance in their use, supporting  their wider adoption by internet and mobile users.  In particular, the study comprises three parts:   A review of existing web portals promoting the use of online privacy tools by the general public.   A proposed methodology for evaluating the reliability and usability of online privacy tools based on a set  of predefined criteria.   A pilot evaluation and comparative presentation of PETs in a specific privacy area.  3 See the European Commission’s data protection web site for a thorough overview of the underlying legal and  regulatory framework, http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/index_en.htm; Also, the web site of the Article 29  Working Party for a list of opinions and other documents on specific data protection maters,  http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/  4 European Parliament, Committee of Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, \"Report on the US NSA surveillance  programme, surveillance bodies in various Member States and their impact on EU citizens’ fundamental rights and on  transatlantic cooperation in Justice and Home Affairs\", 2013,  http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+REPORT+A7-2014- 0139+0+DOC+PDF+V0//EN  5 See for example: http://www.zdnet.com/article/charlatans-the-new-wave-of-privacy-profiteers/  http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/index_en.htm http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/ http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+REPORT+A7-2014-0139+0+DOC+PDF+V0//EN http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+REPORT+A7-2014-0139+0+DOC+PDF+V0//EN http://www.zdnet.com/article/charlatans-the-new-wave-of-privacy-profiteers/  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  08  In the following Chapters the three different parts of the study are described in detail. More specifically,  Chapter 2 presents a number of initiatives listing and/or recommending the use of specific PETs, focusing  especially on the scheme used for the selection of these tools. Based on the results of this review, Chapter  3 provides a proposal for an evaluation methodology for PETs, paying particular attention on their levels of  reliability and usability. Chapter 4 then shows a practical application of this methodology in the area of anti-  tracking browser extensions. Finally, Chapter 5 draws some conclusions and recommendations regarding  the evaluation of online privacy tools, as a means for increasing trust and certainty in the field for the general  public.  It should be noted that for the purpose of the study only tools targeting directly the protection of users’  privacy have been considered. To this end, although most general security tools (e.g. antivirus or firewalls)  would also contribute to the protection of privacy, they have not been considered in our work.  Moreover,  emphasis is mainly put on online privacy tools, i.e. tools designed to operate during an internet connection  (e.g. anonymizers, secure instant messenger applications, etc.). Last, the study paid particular attention to  open source tools, due to the fact that open software allows for independent evaluation by any interested  party, thus increasing trust in the tool’s functionality. Having said that, it is important to note that no in-  depth security analysis of PETs (e.g. code inspection) has been part of this study. This is due to the fact that  such an activity requires much specialised skills and at the same time it can only guarantee security at a  certain point in time (and not beyond this). Still, such an analysis, whenever available, can provide useful  input in the course of the methodology proposed in this document.  The target audience for this document includes all interested stakeholders in the area of privacy tools (Data  Protection Authorities, industry, academia), as well as the general public, i.e. internet or mobile users who  would like to use specific tools for the preservation of their privacy and personal data.  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  09  2. A review of web portals promoting online privacy tools  This review is the first part of our study and the basis to develop a methodology to evaluate online privacy  tools. In particular, the scope of the review is to identify web portals promoting the use of selected PETs,  analyse them against a set of parameters (relevant to the objectives of the study) and provide a comparative  presentation of them, highlighting similarities, differences, strengths and weaknesses. The main focus of the  analysis was on the methodology used for the selection of the proposed tools, as well as the overall quality  and completeness of information offered to the general public. The review includes information gathered  or elaborated by both public and private sectors in EU member states or third countries.  Identification of existing web portals  In order to identify initiatives which promote the use of privacy tools, a comprehensive review of websites  and documents available online was made. The approach followed has been mainly based on web search,  using several search engines to take advantage of different indexing methods. In addition, privacy and  security experts from different domains (academia, industry, public sector) have been contacted to provide  this review with specialised advice. Effort was made to reflect both European and international projects, as  well as national initiatives in Europe and beyond.  Taking into account the objectives of the overall study, we considered explicitly initiatives fulfilling the  following characteristics:   Focusing on online privacy. This is the main topic of the review and most initiatives listed below fulfil  this characteristic. Still in some cases privacy initiatives of broader scope were considered if they had an  interesting evaluation/maintenance scheme for the selection and promotion of online privacy tools.   Listing and/or recommending specific online privacy tools. This is a very important feature as it is closely  related to the assurance level of PETs, especially if reviews and/or comparisons of tools are offered. As  an example, a portal which includes reviews of certain PETs by privacy experts can enhance trust on the  tools. As another example, a portal which enables users’ reviews makes it easier also for other users to  assess the usability and trust they can put on a certain tool.   Targeting general public. Portals directed towards developers or similar specialised user groups are out  of the scope.  Taking into account these characteristics, the most relevant web portals promoting the use of privacy tools  identified through our review are provided in the Table 1 below (see Annex A for a more detailed description  for each portal).

Moreover, there are several private blogs that provide advice and  recommendations on specific tools7. Last, plenty reports from various stakeholders (European institutions  and agencies, Data Protection Authorities, independent privacy organisations, NGOs, etc.) advocate in  favour of the wider adoption of online private tools by the general public, offering in some cases relevant  recommendations and examples8. Although the content of such initiatives is very useful and relevant to our  survey’s objectives, we did not include them in our list, as the focus in only on dynamic material, presented  in a structured way and offering specific recommendations and/or evaluations of different tools.  Moreover, it should be noted that there are many other quite advanced portals and web sites on information  security, including portals from member states’ public institutions, such as the ones of ANSSI (France), BSI  (Germany) and INCIBE (Spain). Also several EU Data Protection Authorities have dedicated portals or web  sites providing, among others, privacy recommendations and advice for the general public. Still such type of  portals have not been considered in our review, since we are specialising explicitly in online initiatives  promoting and/or recommending specific PETs.  It should also be mentioned that our analysis focused mainly on initiatives promoting open-source tools as  it is possible to get more insight in their operation and they also offer the possibility for independent code  review. Most of the initiatives listed in Table 1 have this characteristic. Still in some cases commercial portals  with privacy tools were considered if they had an interesting evaluation/maintenance scheme for the  selection of PETs.  Comparative analysis of web portals  Following the identification of the relevant web portals, we conducted, as part of this study, a more detailed  analysis of each one of them, based on a set of predefined parameters. In particular, the parameters used  are grouped under three different blocks, depending on their association with the site’s content, the  methodology followed for selecting or comparing the privacy tools, and the maintenance characteristics.  Table 2 provides in more detail the aforementioned parameters and their descriptions.  6 For example the Directory Mozilla (DMOZ), covering privacy among many other topics, www.dmoz.org  7 As for example the blog of journalist and author Julia Angwin that provides tips about protecting online privacy and  offers suggestions on the use of relevant protection tools, juliaangwin.com/privacy-tools  8 See for example: European Parliament, Mass surveillance- part 1: risk, opportunities and mitigation strategies, 2015,  http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2015/527409/EPRS_STU(2015)527409_REV1_EN.pdf  http://www.dmoz.org/ http://juliaangwin.com/privacy-tools/ http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2015/527409/EPRS_STU(2015)527409_REV1_EN.pdf  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  12  CATEGORY PARAMETERS DESCRIPTION  CONTENT  TYPE OF SITE  It describes the extent that the portal is dedicated to online privacy, e.g. whether it is  explicitly addressing PETs (covering several topics or specializing in one or more privacy  areas) or it is a general purpose security portal providing also guidance for privacy tools.  TYPE OF  MATERIAL  It indicates the type of information (on privacy tools) offered by the portal. As a  minimum a list of PETs should be provided with a basic description of what the tool  offers. A most interesting feature would be the provision of reviews and/or comparative  assessments of privacy tools.  PRESENTATION  It indicates how easy it is for the average user to browse the portal and find the desired  information. This is obviously related both to the design of the user interface, availability  of classifications per platforms and privacy areas, use of plain and understandable  language, etc.  NUMBER OF  TOOLS  It indicates the number of privacy tools presented by the portal. This is of course related  to the privacy areas that are covered by the tool and can be seen only as factor of  providing greater choice to the general public.  INTERACTION  It describes if users can provide their feedback to the portal and how this feedback is  presented and taken into account. The most interesting feature in this perspective is the  availability of active user forums where registered users can contribute with comments.  OTHER FEATURES  It covers additional functionality not included under the previous parameters, e.g.  availability of help wizard, multilingual support, etc.  METHODOLOGY  DESCRIPTION  It indicates if the portal includes a description of the methodology used for the  selection/comparison of the listed privacy tools. The most interesting portals in that  respect are those that do apply such a methodology and clearly describe it to anyone  interested, thus allowing wider understanding regarding the choice of particular tools.  EVALUATORS It provides information on the persons that did the selection and evaluation of tools.  MAINTENANCE  FREQUENCY  It provides information on the maintenance effort exerted in order to keep the content  up-to-date. Portals that are often updated (e.g. the last update is not later than six  months ago) can offer more assurance regarding the proposed PETs.  UPDATE  DOCUMENTATION  It indicates the amount of information provided on the site about the last updates. The  more information on updates is provided, the more trust a user can put on the content  of the portal. Information can include list of added/removed PETs and the reasons for  doing so.  Table 2: Parameters used for the analysis of web portals promoting the use of online privacy tools  Using the above criteria, we performed a more detailed analysis of each of the privacy tools initiatives. Based  on this work, Table 3 below gives a comparative presentation of the different web portals.

on online privacy or have a specific section  dedicated to it, although their approach towards selection of tools and maintenance of the site varies.  In particular, most portals provide a selection of tools with some description but without further analysis  and/or comparison. Moreover, the rationale behind the particular selection of tools, so as to support the  user’s final choice, is usually not clearly explained. There are, however, a few cases were a specific  methodology and/or set of criteria is applied, as for example the case of the EFF Secure Message Scoreboard  https://myshadow.org/resources https://myshadow.org/resources http://www.techsupportalert.com/content/free-windows-desktop-software-security-list-privacy.htm http://www.techsupportalert.com/content/free-windows-desktop-software-security-list-privacy.htm http://bestprivacytools.com/ http://bestprivacytools.com/ http://bestprivacytools.com/ http://privacytools.freeservers.com/ http://privacytools.freeservers.com/ http://privacytools.freeservers.com/ https://pack.resetthenet.org/ https://pack.resetthenet.org/  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  15  where 7 criteria are used (and explained to the users) for the assessment of secure messaging applications.  Another example is Security-in-a-box which provides a list of generic criteria that they apply for their  selection, though without further detailing how these criteria have been taken into account in each of the  selected tools.  Having said that, it is important to note that there is no uniform way of assessing online privacy tools even  in the context of specific application areas, e.g. anti-tracking or encryption tools. Moreover, there is no  uniform mechanism for the providers of such tools to offer relevant information about their products, e.g.  in the form of PETs quality and functionality matrix. Such a facility could be of great use to the general public,  as it would allow comparison of different online privacy tools, helping them to select the one that can be  appropriate for their own case.  Another interesting element that came out of the review is the difficulty in maintaining the portal’s  information up-to-date and to accordingly inform the users about this. Although yearly updates seem to be  feasible for most of the portals we examined, a complete changelog was available to the users only in a few  cases. Still, this is an important element for building trust to the information provided, in particular the  selection of online privacy tools.  Although not critical from the perspective of trust, the web portal’s usability is another significant criterion  for the overall promotion of privacy tools to the general public. As it has been shown in our review, many  web portals promoting online privacy tools are not always user friendly, e.g. because of lack of plain language  explanations or descriptions of tools. Classification of tools per platform and privacy area with short and to  the point reviews can be of great help when presenting tools for wider public adoption. Another singificant  element concerns the use of language on these resources: although English is the standard one, multilingual  websites have a much greater chance to become practically of use to the general public.  Interaction with the users is also an essential element in the context of a privacy tools’ web portal. The  possibility of receiving feedback from users adds value to the content of the portal by addressing points of  common interest, as well as by enhancing the portal’s overall functionality. A suitable way to implement this  could be to establish a procedure so that registered (and identified) users could contribute with suggestions,  comments, and criticisms. That contribution, however, needs to be filtered before its publication in order to  avoid inappropriate (e.g. offensive) content.  Requirements for an online privacy tools portal for the general public  Following the comparative analysis of web portals, it is clear that there are many interesting initiatives  providing lists of online privacy tools for the general public. Still, we find that there is room for improvement  both in providing more detailed guidance and analysis of specific tools, as well as presenting and maintaining  the portal’s material.  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  16  To this end, we list below the main characteristics that a privacy tools portal targeting the general public  should ideally have:   Guidance to the users  The portal should offer proper guidance to the users for the selection and use of the online privacy tools,  aiming at increasing their trust and assurance and supporting them in making an informed choice. Such  guidance should include information on the privacy risks online, pointing to the different options of tools  that can help mitigate these risks, as well as the criteria that the users should apply when making their  choice. Moreover, it should offer reviews and/or comparison between different privacy tools (of the  same category), highlighting pros and cons (weak/strong points) and providing subsequent information  for their operation and use. It should ideally propose a list of recommended privacy tools (for different  privacy areas). A list of non-recommended tools could also be a plus. As an additional element the PETs  providers could also be invited to provide their own assessments for their tools using the same criteria  (e.g. in the context of an open online PETs evaluation matrix). The methodology followed to perform  the reviews and issue the recommendations must be adequately described, with a clear explanation of  the evaluation criteria applied, as well as any other aspect relevant to the selection of certain tools.  Moreover, adequate information should be offered about the experts who perform the selection and  evaluation of the recommended tools.   Maintenance  The information provided, including the reviews and recommendations, should be frequently updated.  Static information is soon useless. Furthermore, a log of changes should be provided, describing which  tools have been added to or removed from the list of recommendations, and the reasons for doing so.   User interaction  The portal should enable feedback or even reviews by registered users or other external experts. This  can be a very good way to actively involve the broader EU and international privacy community in the  enhancement of the portal. Such contributions can improve the general knowledge about the tools,  supporting the users to assess the usefulness and reliability of a given tool.   Usability  The portal should target the general public and, thus, it should be designed in a way that non-expert  users can benefit from it. Proper classifications (e.g. per privacy area, per platform, etc.) and an easy to  user interface could be very important elements for increasing usability, taking also into account wider  web accessibility standards. The evaluations/reviews of the tools should also follow the same concept.  Although the use of English language is usually the standard, providing multilingual content can be a plus  for increasing general public involvement and awareness.  The above features can be used to enhance existing portals’ functionality or in the framework of new  initiatives in the field that are targeting the general public.  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  17  3. A methodology for the evaluation of online privacy tools  As shown in the privacy portals’ review (Chapter 2), despite the availability of a great number of web  resources listing online privacy tools, it is in many cases quite hard for the users to select among the variety  of tools and even harder for them to assess whether the tools indeed offer what they promise.  In order to  provide further guidance and support internet and mobile users in selecting the right application, we find  that there is a need for a generic methodology that could be used to review and/or compare different online  privacy tools.  Having said that, it is important to note that evaluating PETs is not an easy thing. However, we find that,  although only an in-depth technical analysis of the tools (e.g. code review) could provide a thorough insight  on their functionality at a certain point in time, there are still a number of more generic elements that could  be assessed, simply by using the tools and reviewing available public information. Such elements relate to  the general quality and functionality characteristics of the tools, as for example information about their  developers, the tools’ maintenance level, their transparency regarding the processing of personal data, the  provided documentation, etc. Although these elements alone cannot guarantee the trust level of a PET, they  can still serve as indicators of the PET’s overall operation, providing more confidence regarding what the  tool does offer (and what it does not).  To this end, for the purpose of this study we propose an evaluation methodology for online privacy tools  based on a set of general criteria that can be assessed by testing the operation of the PET in combination  with publicly available information. No in-depth technical analysis is supposed to take place in the context  of the methodology, although the results of relevant analysis for certain tools (if publicly available) could be  a great source of information.  The scope of the methodology is threefold:   Set a structured way for the evaluation of online privacy tools that can be used by privacy experts to  provide relevant reviews/recommendations of tools (e.g. in the context of a web portal as the ones  presented in Chapter 2).   Allow the PETs developers to provide more structured information regarding their tools, using the  proposed criteria, enabling in this way a uniform presentation of the different tools.   Offer internet and mobile users the possibility to assess themselves the different criteria for their tool  of interest before making their final choice.  The overall scope is, as already mentioned, to increase in one or more ways the availability of  information/assessment of existing privacy tools, providing more guidance to the general public.  In the next paragraphs we first set a number of characteristics that are important for building trust in online  privacy tools. Then, based on this set, we define the criteria for a PETs evaluation methodology with the  above described aim and approach.  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  18  Building trust in online privacy tools  As a first step of defining the evaluation methodology, it is important to determine the parameters which  could increase trust and assurance on a specific privacy tool, making it at the same time attractive for the  general public. In other words it is important to outline what the desired characteristics of such a tool are in  terms of reliability and usability, in order to have it further recommended to internet and mobile users.  In this context and taking into account relevant work of existing privacy tools initiatives9, we define in the  following list the most important generic quality features that an online privacy tool should have:   Maturity and stability. It is very important for the tool to be mature and stable and to count with a  responsible developer community. Tools that have been used for years in diverse environments or  different operating systems (and versions) are usually more stable.   Reactivity to vulnerabilities. A rapid reaction after the detection of a weakness or vulnerability is also  important as an indicator of the level of reliability and security of a tool.   Proper maintenance. The developers of a tool should provide an updated log of changes and  improvements, showing clearly how bugs or other issues have been resolved, as well as what new  features have been added to the tool.   Adequate background information and documentation. The background of the entity proposing the tool  or being responsible for its development should be available to the users.  Also, technical documentation  allows expert users to assess whether the best up-to-date technical criteria and parameters have been  taken into account.   Transparency. It should be clear from the provided information what the functionality of the tool is, i.e.  what the tool does and does not offer. No software or other content should be installed without user  consent. No personal data should be processed (e.g. transferred to other parties or used for analytics)  without user’s consent. Proper information regarding the processing of personal data is essential.   Privacy by design and by default. The tool should follow the principles of privacy by design and by  default. For example, personal data should be properly anonymised before further processed. As  another example, the default settings of the tool should be preserving user privacy and its overall  functionality should be well explained to the users.   Positive public reviews. It is very useful to have positive public reviews on the tool, both by identified  privacy experts and/or by the general public – end users. The reviews can provide good insights to the  functionality of the tools, as well as identify potential drawbacks and considerations. The reviews should  be as recent as possible.   Usability. Several aspects can be considered under this feature:   Ease of installation: The installation process should be easy and straightforward, avoiding questions  which can be a strong barrier for non-expert users.  9 For example EFF Secure Messaging Scorecard and Security in-a-box web portals described in Chapter 2.  http://www.eff.org/secure-messaging-scorecard https://securityinabox.org/en  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  19   User interaction: The existence of a reliable feedback mechanism for user contributions could help  improve the functionality of the tool and support its user basis.   User guidance: The tool should be accompanied with high-quality documentation (installation guide,  user’s manual, error guide, FAQ, etc.).   User friendly: The use of the tool should be straightforward and should not require much training.  No or very few technical support should be needed by the users.   Multilingual: Although the use of the English language should be considered as a standard, including  other languages would broaden the spectrum of potential users.   Accessibility: the tool should be available to different categories of users (including elderly  population and users with special needs), taking also into account relevant web accessibility  standards.  In addition to the above generic features, an online privacy tool must also have the specific functional  characteristics that it promises. These characteristics may vary considerably depending on the privacy area.  The important element in that perspective is that the tool does not have any hidden functionality and that  it is consistent regarding the privacy features that it claims to offer. Moreover, it is important that the tool  does not have any security traps/bugs and that its use does not bring problems to the user (e.g. affecting  other applications, very high utilisation of memory, etc.).  Criteria for the evaluation of online privacy tools  Following the desirable features of online privacy tools described above, we define in this section a set of  criteria that can be used for the evaluation of PETs.  In particular, we define three broad groups of criteria:   Basic criteria: a preliminary set of fundamental characteristics of a tool, setting the basis for evaluation.   Quality criteria: criteria assessing generic quality features related to the reliability and usability of a tool.   Functionality criteria: criteria assessing whether the tool offers the promised functionality and privacy  features (differ for each category of privacy tools).  Table 4 provides an overview of the proposed basic and quality criteria, whereas Table 5 provides an example  of functionality criteria in the area of anti-tracking browser extensions.  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  20  CRITERION  BASIC CRITERIA  MATURITY AND STABILITY  MAINTENANCE (LAST UPDATE)  REACTIVITY TO PUBLICLY KNOWN VULNERABILITIES  EASE OF ACCESS AND INSTALLATION  DOCUMENTATION  QUALITY CRITERIA  BACKGROUND INFORMATION  VERSION HISTORY  TRANSPARENCY OF INSTALLATION AND USE  PUBLIC REVIEWS  PRIVACY BY DESIGN AND BY DEFAULT  EASE OF USE  USER INTERACTION  SIDE EFFECTS  FUNCTIONALITY CRITERIA TO BE SPECIFIED PER CATEGORY OF TOOLS  Table 4: Proposed criteria for the evaluation of online privacy tools  CRITERION  FUNCTIONALITY CRITERIA  FOR ANTI-TRACKING  BROWSER EXTENSIONS  (AN EXAMPLE)  TYPE OF BLOCKING/ ANTI-TRACKING BEHAVIOUR  PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA  FLEXIBILITY  CHOICE  ON/OFF  HISTORY OF BLOCKED ELEMENTS  BROWSER COMPATIBILITY AND SIGNATURE  Table 5: Functionality criteria for anti-tracking browser extensions  The above listed criteria are described in more detail in the next paragraphs.  3.2.1 Basic criteria  The basic criteria can be seen as the «first test» of a given tool against a set of preliminary necessary  requirements that can be easily assessed based on existing publicly available information. The basic criteria  can in fact serve as exclusion criteria: if even one of these requirements is not satisfied, the tool can be  directly discarded with no further analysis of its quality or functionality. In other words, the basic criteria can  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  21  be used to quickly reject certain tools without proceeding in a deeper evaluation. They can also be used (e.g.  in the framework of a web portal as the ones presented in Chapter 2) as the threshold for providing lists of  non-recommended tools.  In this context, we define the following list of basic criteria:   Maturity and stability  Maturity and stability are integral parameters for developing trust and assurance in software. Time can  be a useful element to consider, in the sense that tools dating back a few years might have the  opportunity to get tested (and probably be improved). Still, time cannot alone define the level of  maturity and stability of a certain piece of software: it is the overall evolution of the software and the  way that is has grown with time that finally determines its maturity and stability10.  In order to assess this criterion, it is important to evaluate both the time in the market but also the way  the tool has evolved and improved over time.  For example, a minimum period of three months would  in most cases be considered necessary in order to test a tool’s maturity and stability in the market. For  a tool dating back a few years, the evolution of the tool (in terms of features added or removed over  time, corrections of bugs, etc.) is a major element to assess. Public reviews of the tools can provide  useful insight to this type of information.   Maintenance (last update)  The maintenance of tools is also a crucial parameter for trust, both in terms of security, as well as  functionality. Updates need to be performed regularly, taking into account the type of the tool and the  components that need to be maintained. For example in the case of browser plugins, often available in  the area of anti-tracking tools, maintenance would naturally need to follow the latest versions of the  relevant browser software.  In order to assess this criterion, it is important to check the latest update of a tool, taking into account  its overall functionality and dependency on other types of software.   Reactivity to publicly known vulnerabilities  This criterion is essential for the security of the tool to the extent that it can be assessed using publicly  available information. As a first step, what needs to be assessed is whether any publicly known  10 There is a lot of work in the area of maturity and stability evaluation for software, which could be taken into  account in this respect. See for example: Justin Etheredge, \"How Do We Measure Maturity In Software?,\" Code  Thinked, http://www.codethinked.com/how-do-we-measure-maturity-in-software for a relevant discussion on the  topic; Also ENISA’s 2015 report on technology readiness for PETs, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/  http://www.codethinked.com/how-do-we-measure-maturity-in-software https://www.enisa.europa.eu/  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  22  vulnerabilities have ever been reported for a certain tool11. In case that a publicly known vulnerability is  indeed found, what is important to assess is whether this vulnerability has been properly addressed, as  well as the reaction time of the developers (between the discovery of the vulnerability and its  resolution).   Ease of access and installation  This criterion is related to the availability and usability of the tool and, in the context of this  methodology, it is an important one for enabling use by the general public.  Ease of access refers to the effort needed by the user to locate and download the tool (and its potential  updates). For example, it is preferable that the download page includes only the tool in study and it  automatically selects the proper version of the tool based on the characteristics of the user’s end device  (operating system, 32/64-bit version, etc.). Tools that are hard to find and download will probably not  be appealing to the general public.  Ease of installation is examined with regard to the effort and expertise that is expected from the user to  install the tool (and its potential updates). In principle, the tool must have an installer or plugin directly  available to the users, i.e. users should not be required to compile any source code before installing the  tool.  Note that the overall usability of the tool is discussed later in the quality criteria. The reason that we  address this particular point under the basic criteria is the fact that ease of access and installation might  play a very critical role on the user’s choice to further proceed with a tool. For example when the tool is  not easy to find or when the configuration process is too complicated, the user would probably not  consider the tool at all (no matter how good the offered functionality is). In that sense, it is a basic  parameter that, in the context of our methodology, should be considered before addressing quality in  detail.   Documentation  Documentation is also an important element for enhancing use of the tool, as long as it is clear and  understandable by the general public and is regularly updated. The assessment of this criterion should,  thus, be based both on the availability of documentation, as well as its presentation (e.g. in the form of  installation instructions, user guides, FAQs or Wikis).  11 See for example CVE dictionary for publicly known security vulnerabilities and exposures, https://cve.mitre.org/  https://cve.mitre.org/  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  23  As already mentioned, the basic criteria should be checked as the first step of the assessment process. If a  tool passes this test, then the criteria assessing its quality and functionality need to be applied.  3.2.2 Quality criteria  Quality aims at evaluating the overall reliability (in terms of privacy protection) and usability of the tools,  taking into account that the scope of the assessment is to increase trust and assurance on the tools and  putting special emphasis to aspects related to privacy and the protection of personal data.  In order to provide an objective and standardised assessment process, we propose a classification scheme  for the evaluation of each criterion (Low (L), Medium (M), and High (H)). The scheme is based on quantitative  information, wherever possible, so as to support the objectives of the evaluation, for example regarding the  number of updates (in version history) or the availability of background information (yes/no). Still, in most  cases a qualitative approach is needed, in the sense that the assessment cannot be solely based on a generic  scale (such as for example the criteria on transparency or public reviews). Therefore, the classification mainly  aims to provide possible scenarios or examples that could help the assessment. On top of this, we have tried  to support the assessment process by providing guidance on the different aspects that need to be considered  by the evaluator and the possible sources of relevant information.  To this end, the following list includes the proposed quality criteria:   Background information  User’s choice of privacy tools may be supported by the provision of adequate background information  regarding the tools’ developers and/or the entities that are behind their overall maintenance and  promotion. Although this criterion cannot be considered as directly affecting the reliability of a tool, still  it is important for allowing the users to find useful information that could increase or decrease their level  of trust on a certain tool (e.g. based on the expertise of the developers or the business model behind  the operation of the tool).  In the assessment of this criterion it is important to note that it is the availability and quality of clear  background information that is being evaluated rather than the content of this information per se (e.g.  no evaluation of the tool’s developer’s knowledge and expertise is taking place as part of this  methodology).  Classification/examples:   Low: no clear background information is provided regarding the entity that provides and supports  the tool; no information regarding the tool’s development and support team.   Medium: the organisation that provides the tool is well defined, without further information about  the specific development and support of this tool.  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  24   High: clear information is provided regarding both the tool’s development, as well as the entity that  is behind its’ maintenance and support.   Version history  A complete and documented version history is an important feature for building trust on a certain tool,  as it permits potential users to check the evolution of the tool and, in some cases, understand how the  developers have reacted to users’ feedback or to the resolution of bugs. As part of this feature, it is also  useful to provide update mechanisms that can inform the users about new versions and/or issues that  have been added or resolved. This criterion is in fact a feature that can reveal the level and quality of  maintenance of the tool.  Classification/examples:   Low: there is no version history containing information about the new functionalities or the  corrected bugs.   Medium: some information on versioning is provided without specifically documenting the  performed updates.   High: a version history containing information about updated functionalities and corrected bugs is  available; a mechanism for informing users about new updates is available.   Transparency of installation and use  This criterion is mainly related to the transparency of the installation process, as well as the overall  operation of the tool.  In particular during the installation process the user should be clearly informed whether any additional  software is being installed (apart from the requested tool) or in general whether any other data is being  stored and/or accessed in the user’s terminal device (e.g. cookies). User’s consent should be obtained  before performing any relevant installation or access during the installation process of the tool or during  its operation.  The user should also be clearly informed if any processing of his/her personal data takes place during  the operation of the tool (e.g. transfer of user’s personal data for analytics purposes). No processing of  personal data should take place without prior user’s consent.  Moreover, adequate information should be provided to the user regarding the functionalities of the tool  (what it does and what is does not). Also, regarding the features that are enabled by default and those  that the user needs to enable himself/herself.  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  25  In order to assess this criterion, it is important to check both the installation process and operation  (default features, network traffic) of the tool, as well as the notice and information that is provided at  the tool’s web site.  Classification/examples:   Low: the installation process and/or the operation of the tool are not transparent to the user. For  example, it is not clear if changes to other applications or user settings are being performed during  the installation process (e.g. changes in the selected search engine, homepage, tool bars, etc.). As  another example, user’s data are being further processed for analytics purposes without clear  notice.   Medium: the installation process is transparent to the user but the default operation of the tool is  not as naturally expected. For example, a tool that is supposed to block advertising, it does not do  so for certain companies without clearly informing the user about it.   High: the installation process and operation of the tool are transparent to the user; the tool clearly  informs the user about its default operation and the actions that need to be taken (if any) in order  for the tool to reach its maximum privacy protection.  Note should be taken that for this particular criterion, the low value would imply possible unlawfulness  of the tool and would, thus, directly exclude the tool from further being considered for evaluation.   Public reviews  This is a special criterion as it can provide an overall insight of the reliability and usability of the tool  based on feedback from other users. Its evaluation can in fact serve as input to the evaluation of all other  criteria. Still, we preferred to address it separately as locating and assessing existing reviews is a special  task in itself: it is not only important to identify relevant reviews but also to assess their quality,  independence and accuracy. This is why this particular criterion is rather subjective as it is up to the  evaluator to decide which information sources he/she can trust.  Reviews may come from specific experts or general users of the tool and they can take different formats  (e.g. an article written by an analyst, an average rating provided by users at a software download centre,  a prominent position at one of the existing portals promoting privacy tools). As already mentioned, it is  the evaluator who will decide, based on his/her experience, if and how these reviews are worth being  considered. Still what is most important to assess under this criterion is whether there are identified  problems with a certain tool, especially hidden traps or information that is not directly available to the  users (e.g. hidden monetization goals of anti-tracking tools whitelisting certain advertising companies or  secretly selling users’ personal data to advertisers). Also, public reviews can provide a useful criterion  for the usability of the tool and the overall user satisfaction.  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  26  Classification/examples:   Low: one or more public reviews outline a serious issue related to the installation or operation of  the tool (e.g. possible hidden software installation, unlawful processing of users’ personal data,  functionality that is different than advertised/expected, etc.).   Medium: some negative aspects can be found in public reviews but none of them is indicating any  important functionality flaw (e.g. reviews are mostly about difficulty of use, complex interface, etc.).   High: there are many reviews and most of them are positive; no or very few negative aspects can be  found in public reviews e.g. indicating only minor usability problems.  Note that for this particular criterion, the low value could imply possible hidden unwanted functionality  or even unlawfulness of the tool that could directly exclude the tool from further being considered for  evaluation. This is of course very much dependent on the content and sources of the reviews and would,  thus, need to be assessed separately for each different case.   Privacy by design and by default  This criterion aims first of all to assess whether privacy and data protection have been considered in the  overall design and implementation of the tool12. As outlined in the latest ENISA report in the field13,  privacy by design principles can be translated into certain design strategies, such as data minimization,  anonymization, integration of proper notice and consent mechanisms, etc. Moreover, the purpose of  this criterion is to assess whether the tool offers all its privacy preserving features by default, without  the need for the user to configure it. Apart from the general configuration of the tool, what is also  important to assess is the default behaviour of the tool and the particular features that the user needs  to configure himself/herself so as to get the maximum privacy protection.  Classification/examples:   Low: the tool asks users to provide their personal data in order to complete the installation although  this is not necessary (e.g. in order to participate in a survey); the privacy features of the tool are not  enabled by default.   Medium: some privacy features are enabled by default but others need to be activated by the user  through a complicated configuration process.   High: the tool provides its maximum privacy preserving features without the need to configure it;  no personal data are being collected and statistics are drawn only with the use of anonymous data.  12 Privacy by design and by default have been introduced as new obligations for the data controllers and processors in  the context of the European Commission proposal for the General Data Protection Regulation,  http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf  13 Privacy and data protection by design – from policy to enginnering, ENISA, 2014,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/privacy-and-data-protection-by- design  http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/privacy-and-data-protection-by-design https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/privacy-and-data-protection-by-design  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  27   Ease of use  This criterion is aimed to cover the user friendliness of the tool, which directly affects its usability. Having  said that, it is important to note that usability is related to the effectiveness, efficiency and user  satisfaction14 and, thus, it should in a way be assessed as part of most of the criteria already described.  Although it is not the aim of this study to provide a detailed analysis for usability testing, it is important  to note a number of parameters that need to be considered under the criterion for ease of use, such as  the clarity of the user interface, the level of configuration that is needed by the users, the availability of  customization options, etc. It is up to the evaluator (and his/her particular expertise) to address the  above-mentioned parameters, taking into account the fact that the target group is the general public.  Classification/examples:   Low: the tool requires complex configuration that is difficult for non-expert users; many of the tool’s  functionalities are hidden and not clearly explained.   Medium: the main tool’s functionality is achieved without need for further configuration but there  are no customization options and/or the user has to spend a lot of time in order to find them.   High: the main tool’s functionality is achieved without need for further configuration; customization  options are available and easy to configure; a help wizard or wiki can easily guide the user through  the tool’s functionality after installation.  It is important to note that usability of PETs is a topic that needs more thorough consideration, taking  into account existing research in the field and addressing all relevant aspects. User accessibility (for  example in relation to elderly users or users with disabilities) is also a core issue of usability, especially  in the area of online privacy15. Another important aspect is to examine usability in relation to the  reliability/trustworthiness of the tools, as it is not always easy to find the right balance between user  friendliness and privacy protection. These issues have not been detailed in the context of our study and  they should be subject of a specific analysis on the usability of PETs.   User interaction  This criterion evaluates the support offered to the users of a tool, mainly in terms of addressing user  comments, feedback mechanism, etc.16. It is important both for increasing the usability of the tool, as  14 According to the International Standards Organization (ISO), usability refers to: \"...the extent to which a product can  be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context  of use.” See: ISO 9241-11:1998, \"Ergonomic requirements for office work with visual display terminals (VDTs) -- Part  11: Guidance on usability,\" 1998, http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=16883  15 W3C Web accessibility initiative, \"Introduction to web accessibility\",  https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility.php  16 Note that the availability and quality of documentation, which are also relevant to user support, are addressed under  the basic criteria.  http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=16883 https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility.php  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  28  well as for integrating user comments and reviews as part of the tool’s overall evolution. Moreover, well  established user interaction mechanisms can help establish trust on the tool and create a supporting  user community.  Classification/examples:   Low: there is no way of user interaction with the developers/owners of the tool.   Medium: users can submit comments/questions (e.g. by email or via web forms) but there is no  active user forum where comments and relevant feedback are published.   High: a well-established user interaction mechanism is available, including fast feedback  mechanisms and an active user forum.   Side effects  Another important criterion is the possible side effects that the tool’s operation might have. These side  effects can be twofold:   Technical side effects for example related to the tool’s CPU usage, possible overhead in network  traffic, performance loss, possible false alerts in intrusion detection systems, etc.   Blocking of access to certain web sites /services due to the use of a particular PET.  Although we find that this information is crucial for supporting an internet or mobile user to make  his/her choice, we did not further address its practical assessment in our proposal, due to the fact that  its analysis would probably require a deeper inspection of the tool’s technical operation (especially in  the case of technical side effects). Still, we tried to assess some of these aspects under the criteria of  transparency and public reviews and we aim at further developing our methodology to better address  this perspective.  On top of the criteria mentioned above, there are also some other parameters that, although they cannot  be directly used as evaluation criteria, still they are quite important in the selection of a tool by the general  public. These parameters are:   Multilingual: Although English has been considered as a standard for the purpose of this study, it is still  recognised that tools available also in other languages can increase adoption by the general public.   Cross-platform: Tools available in multiple platforms can offer more options and flexibility to the users,  making it easier for them to manage their privacy protection without the need to change their favourite  applications. Depending on the specific tool, the software platform can be the operating system (as in  the case of traditional applications), such as Windows, Mac, GNU/Linux, Android, iOS, or Windows Phone,  or the web browser (as in the case of plugins or add-ons), e.g. Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer, Opera,  or Safari.  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  29  Last, it should be noted that as part of the evaluation it is important to address what jurisdictions the tool is  compliant with and in particular whether it is consistent with EU data protection legal framework. Also other  legal considerations should be taken into account, for example regarding individual property rights or export  restrictions if applicable.  3.2.3 Functionality criteria  Based on the functional privacy area which the tool belongs to, during the analysis it will be necessary to  consider a specific set of criteria directly related to the functionality of the tool. This set of criteria will in fact  assess to what extent the tool does what it claims in terms of protecting user privacy and personal data.  Clearly, functionality criteria will differ depending on the privacy area. To this end, it is first of all important  to define the expected privacy features/characteristics of the tool. This will help determine its core  functionality, as well as any optional/desirable functions that a tool (under a certain privacy area) could  offer.  As an example we provide in the following a list of functionality criteria that we drew for the area of anti-  tracking browser extensions (plug-ins/add-ons).  3.2.3.1 Example: Functionality criteria for anti-tracking browser extensions  Anti-tracking browser extensions (plug-ins/add-ons) aim at blocking attempts of certain websites to record  the internet activity and other personal information of a web user (e.g. visited web page, user location, type  of browser, etc.) and/or present content to the user. In particular, they are usually intended to block one or  more of the following elements:   Advertisements (e.g. in the form of a banner, images, etc.).   Scripts (e.g. Java, JavaScript, and Flash scripts).   Pop-ups.   Cookies.   Other elements (e.g. social buttons, such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc.).  Main functionality (type of blocking/anti-tracking behaviour)  In most cases, the tools block one or more of the above mentioned elements, providing also information to  the user about the service that is trying to capture personal data, the processes and connections that are  active and the number and types of elements that have been blocked. Besides, they can offer real-time  information about user’s activity, the hosts and ports that are being used, etc.  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  30  Processing of personal data  An anti-tracking tool is expected to protect a user from being tracked when surfing the web, offering the  functionality described above. It should not be used for the processing of user’s personal data (e.g. online  behaviour, favourite ads) for analytics or other purposes without user’s consent.  No hidden activities  affecting users’ personal data (e.g. by whitelisting specific advertising companies or secretly selling user’s  data to advertisers) should be acceptable.  Additional features   Flexibility: The tool could allow users to personalize the way it is used, e.g. what and how is blocked  (varying from single webpages to full domains). This option could be offered in various ways, e.g.  white/black listing, filtering options, etc.   Choice: The tool could provide the possibility for the user to temporarily block/unblock a specific  element (emerging windows, advertising, trackers, etc.). This can be very useful, e.g. if the user would  like to allow graphs from a certain company, while images from all other companies would be blocked.   On/off: The tool could allow users to pause the blocking/unblocking process (as a whole and not only  for a specific element).   History (of blocked elements): The tool could make it possible for the user to check what has been  blocked. Although this is only informative, it may be very useful for users to be aware about the attempts  of tracking their behaviour while surfing the web. It could be up to the user to define how the history of  blocking is presented.  On top of the criteria mentioned above, there are also some more generic features that are applicable to  browser plugins and add-ons and could be quite essential also in the case of anti-tracking tools. These are:   Browser compatibility: The tool could be available as a plugin or an add-on in the corresponding official  store of the evaluated platform (Firefox, Chrome, etc.). This may be seen as an additional guarantee that  the tool is going to be downloaded from a safe place.   Signature: Singed plugins (which can be found when using a plugin locator menu option) may provide  additional security guarantees.  Following the criteria described above, in the context of the assessment of anti-tracking tools, the evaluator  would first have to check the main functionality of the tool, trying to identify any issues affecting the user’s  privacy (e.g. due to lack of proper information or hidden operations of the tool). Then the other functional  criteria would also be examined. The result of this evaluation would be a list of what the tool offers and what  it does not offer, including ideally its pros and cons and outlining any serious functionality issues.  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  31  4. A pilot evaluation of anti-tracking browser extensions  Scope of the pilot  This chapter provides a pilot analysis of anti-tracking browser extensions (plug-ins/add-ons) following the  methodology that we defined in Chapter 3. The focus is on applying the predefined assessment criteria on a  number of well-known browser extensions that can be used for blocking online tracking, as well as provide  a comparative presentation of the different tools. The aim of the pilot is to demonstrate the practical  application of the proposed methodology, serving as the basis for evaluations of privacy tools in the future.  There is a great variety of anti-tracking tools today, offering different options and functionality. For the  purpose of the study we selected six of the most popular anti-tracking browser extensions that are listed in  many of the web portals we identified in Chapter 2. Our selection was based on the popularity of the tools,  as well as the fact that they cover different types of functionalities in the field. In particular, the tools we  considered were as follows:   Ghostery17   Disconnect18   uBlock origin19   Privacy badger20   NoScript21   AdBlockPlus22  All of the above-mentioned tools satisfy the set of basic criteria, as they date already some years with a  specific development team, their latest updates where less than six months old at the time of our study, no  publicly known vulnerability is reported, they are all easy to access and install and they provide relevant  documentation. Therefore, in the context of our pilot we focused our analysis of the tools on the quality and  functionality criteria described in Chapter 3.  It is important to note again that our analysis is based solely on criteria that can be evaluated via publicly  available information and/or the test installation and use of the tool. Still, only an in-depth security analysis  (e.g. code inspection) can guarantee the functionality of a tool at a certain point in time. Such an analysis  was not part of our pilot.  17 www.ghostery.com  18 disconnect.me  19 github.com/gorhill/uBlock  20 https://www.eff.org/privacybadger  21 noscript.net  22 adblockplus.org  www.ghostery.com disconnect.me github.com/gorhill/uBlock https://www.eff.org/privacybadger noscript.net  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  32  It must also be mentioned that for the scope of the pilot the only platforms that have been considered are  Firefox and Chrome due to the fact that they have similar characteristics (e.g. official add-on store) and they  represent an important percentage of the browsing quota today.  A comparative presentation of six anti-tracking browser extensions  Following the approach and analysis mentioned above, Table 6 resumes the main functionality and features  of the six selected anti-tracking tools, whereas Tables 7 and 8 summarize their specific quality and  functionality characteristics. Annex B provides a more detailed description per tool.  TOOL WHAT IT DOES ADDITIONAL FEATURES CONSIDERATIONS  Ghostery  Blocks several types of elements  (cookies, scripts, ad networks,  social buttons, etc.).  Trackers are classified in five  categories (analytics, web beacons,  privacy, advertising, and widgets).  Shows what has been blocked in  each site during the session.  Has an editable whitelist.  Click-to-play functionality  enables unblocking of  useful widgets (e.g. a  comments form or an  embedded video player).  Very efficient memory  usage.  Configuration tutorial after  installation.  Blocking is not enabled by default (but  needs to be activated by the user).  The Ghostrank option, when activated,  allows selling of info related to blocked ads  to advertising companies. Evidon, the  company behind Ghostery (also an  advertising company) claims that no  personal data are being processed. Still,  this topic raises ethical issues for some  users. Ghostrank is deactivated by default.  Disconnect  Blocks several types of elements  (cookies, scripts, ad networks,  social buttons, etc.).  Presents trackers in four  categories: advertising, analytics,  social networking, and content,  plus three specific buttons for  Facebook, Google and Twitter.  Shows what has been blocked in  each site during the session.  Whitelist available (not editable).  In Chrome, it shows users  who is tracking them with a  collusion graph.  Automatically reloads the  page after a change in the  filtering options.  The dashboard shows the  time and bandwidth saved.  After installation, a tab asks for financial  support without any «exit» or «no  support» button (the only option to avoid  it is to close the tab or to select the «Tour  the interface» button). This can be  confusing for non-expert users.  uBlock  origin  By default it blocks advertising,  malware domains and social  buttons. By enabling more lists  more elements can be blocked  (e.g. analytics).  Shows what has been blocked in  each site during the session  (through the requests register).  Has an editable whitelist.  Great CPU and memory  performance. Very fast  page loading.  Great customization  capabilities (importing of  host files, third party filters  selection, editing user’s  filters and rules).  It is possible to enable an  option to stop WebRTC  from revealing local IP  addresses of VPN users.  Sometimes (and depending on how the  strict blocking option is set), some sites  cannot be accessed (although the user is  informed, and buttons appear to allow  him/her to change the configuration at a  permanent- or temporary basis).  A little bit difficult to configure by a non-  expert user.  To see what has been blocked it is  necessary to go to the requests register.  Privacy  Badger  Blocks several types of elements  (cookies, scripts, ad networks, etc.)  Its dynamic blocking  behaviour, increases ease of  Due to its way of operation, it requires  browsing around several different websites  to start blocking.  https://www.ghostery.com/es/home https://disconnect.me/ https://www.mozilla.org/es-ES/lightbeam/ https://www.eff.org/es/node/73969 https://www.eff.org/es/node/73969  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  33  TOOL WHAT IT DOES ADDITIONAL FEATURES CONSIDERATIONS  It builds its blocking list as the user  navigates through different pages  (dynamic).  In each session, it shows the  potential trackers and whether  they have been blocked or not. In  the configuration it records all  potential trackers identified and  those which have been blocked so  far.  Has an editable whitelist.  use and requires very little  user configuration.  It can detect canvas based  fingerprinting.  More advanced integration  of Do not Track (DNT) –  compliance with EFF DNT.  Shows a tutorial after  installation.  If a site is included in the whitelist, the  configuration button disappears from the  user interface.  NoScript  Blocks scripts (it blocks advertising  or any other element provided  that they include script).  Allows selecting whether to block  JavaScript, Adobe Flash, Microsoft  Silverlight and other similar  programs.  Shows what has been blocked in  each site during the session  Has an editable whitelist.  Great customization  options  It does not rely on a  virus/vulnerability database  (good for unknown  threats).  Prevents «Clickjacking» and  cross-site scripting attacks.  It can be configured to  automatically reload the  page after a change in the  blocking options.  It only blocks scripts.  Time-consuming setup, otherwise pages  with many scripts can be not properly  displayed. This can be hard for non- experts.  Only available as an extension for Mozilla- based browsers.  AdBlock  Plus  It is primarily an ad blocker rather  than an anti-tracking tool. Ad  blocking is done by default, except  from ads coming from the  «acceptable ads» whitelist. It can  be configured to block trackers,  social buttons, and malware  domains. Different functionalities  are available for Firefox and  Chrome.  It is possible to check what has  been blocked, but only in Firefox. In  Chrome it is only possible to check  the number of blocked elements.  Has an editable whitelist in  Chrome.  Wild cards allow blocking of  specific sections of a  domain (granularity).  It allows selecting third  party filters, and edit user’s  filters.  Via context menu, images  in a page can be blocked.  Additionally, (only in  Chrome) specific elements  can be blocked via context  menu or through user  interface.  The default operation only blocks  advertising. Any other type of blocking  needs to be activated by the user. If this  activation is not done directly after  installation (through a tab that is  automatically opened), it is quite difficult  to do it later.  It includes an acceptable ads whitelist  (include ads from Google and Microsoft),  which is enabled by default. The user  needs to deactivate it in order not to  receive ads from the companies in the list.  High RAM penalty and CPU intensive.

Table 8: Presentation of functionality analysis of the tools (additional features)  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  37  With the help of the previous information, it can be said that there are no major functional differences  between most of the analysed tools, in the sense that all of them protect user’s privacy by preventing user’s  activities to be tracked. Ad, cookies and script blockers give the users control over their browsing experience.  They can block ads on the visited sites and kill scripts and widgets that send users’ data to unknown third-  parties. Still some functional differences can be found, for example AdBlockPlus is primarily an ad blocker  rather than an anti-tracking tool, uBlock origin also primarily works with ads (but not only), NoScript is only  for preventing scripts from running while browsing.  All the tools are quite popular and provide plenty of support information (e.g. background information,  version history), user forums, as well as many configuration options.  However, there are some differences regarding the default privacy preserving functionality and  transparency to the user. For example, AdBlockPlus allows acceptable ads and this option is enabled by  default, although the user is informed about this fact. Privacy Badger or Disconnect block tracking cookies  and scripts from running by default, while Ghostery does not block any tracker by default (the functionality  needs to be enabled by the user).  Also, there are differences regarding the way the different tools operate, but details are only for advanced  users. As an example, Privacy Badger does not use standard lists but follows a behavioural blocking process  (learning user preferences while browsing). This can very useful in some cases, as it could enable blocking of  a tracker that is not included in standard lists. However, with this approach the tool might take longer to  build its own anti-tracking list (because the user needs to browse around several different websites for the  tool to learn what to block).  Differences can also be found regarding the overall performance of the tools. For example uBlock origin has  very good CPU and memory utilization, whereas AdBlockPlus is CPU and RAM intensive. However, with  uBlock origin some sites might not be accessed without proper configuration of the tool’s properties.  Looking at Tables 6 to 8 it is possible to provide tips which can serve as guidance for different types of users.  For example, advanced users interested in having the possibility of including filters, should select uBlock  origin, NoScript or AdBlockPlus. Disconnect users who want to see in a collusion graph what connections are  activated when a web page is visited and which of them are blocked, should install the Chrome version.  Users aiming to use an online privacy tool but do not want to be worried about any configuration process  (even though this can be assisted through a wizard) should use Disconnect or Privacy Badger. A user who is  interested in defining white or black lists to improve his/her browsing experience could select any of the  tools. Similarly, if temporary blocking/unblocking is needed, all tools could be used (uBlock Origin and the  Chrome version of AdBlockPlus allows to select what to block via context menu or the user interface; context  menu is also available for AdBlockPlus users in Firefox, but only to block images).  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  38  Available public reviews also provide tips and recommendations to help users decide which tool to choose.  For example, a recent review24 recommends using both, Ghostery and Disconnect. The reason is that,  although Ghostery blocks more trackers, there are many (even popular) trackers that it misses which are  actually blocked by Disconnect, and vice versa25. In the same review, Privacy Badger is also recommended,  highlighting that none of the add-ons makes the other one redundant.  A general conclusion that can be drawn from our analysis is that a clear description of the functionalities of  the tools is needed, in order for the user to understand what exactly he/she needs and make the best  possible choice. In many cases, tools would need to be complemented in order to provide for maximum  protection in a specific privacy area.  24 A review on tracker and script blocker extensions for Firefox: log.add0n.com/2015/05/16/tracker-and- script%20blocker-extensions-for-firefox.html  25 See also: The best browser extensions that protect your privacy: lifehacker.com/the-best-browser-extensions-that- protect-your-privacy-479408034  http://blog.add0n.com/2015/05/16/tracker-and-script%20blocker-extensions-for-firefox.html http://blog.add0n.com/2015/05/16/tracker-and-script%20blocker-extensions-for-firefox.html http://lifehacker.com/the-best-browser-extensions-that-protect-your-privacy-479408034 http://lifehacker.com/the-best-browser-extensions-that-protect-your-privacy-479408034  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  39  5. Conclusions  The goal of this report has been to support the protection of online privacy by using PETs. Despite the  availability of different tools and technologies, information provided is not always sufficient to guide internet  and mobile users and help them select the PET that is most appropriate for their needs. Following a review  of existing web portals promoting PETs, this report sought to identify the elements that could build trust  and assurance for the general public when making their choice. The conclusions of our work and relevant  open issues are listed below.  The need for a widely accepted methodology for the evaluation of PETs  Assessment of online privacy tools and comparison between different tools of the same category can assist  internet and mobile users in understanding the options they have and make an informed choice. Although  there are several web portals listing and/or recommending privacy tools, there is no uniform methodology  for assessing the selected tools (and in many cases there is no methodology at all). It appears that that the  definition and adoption of such a methodology both by the PETs developers, as well as by the greater privacy  community, could greatly support an objective evaluation of the tools’ quality and functionality, providing  valuable output for the general public. The methodology should be based on specific predefined criteria (e.g.  in the mode of an evaluation matrix) that could be used to assess different aspects of an online privacy tool.  It could be applied both by privacy experts providing reviews and/or comparisons of tools and/or by the PET  developers (in the course of a self-assessment practice). More advanced users could also apply the criteria  of the methodology to assess certain aspects of their preferred online privacy tools. Although only an in-  depth technical analysis (e.g. code inspection) can provide certainty regarding a tool’s functionality at a  certain point in time, we believe that such a generic methodology can still be very useful in evaluating PETs,  serving as an indicator of their reliability and usability.  Criteria for a generic methodology for PETs evaluation  In the context of this report we proposed a number of criteria that could be used to develop a generic  methodology for the evaluation of online privacy tools (basic, quality and functionality criteria). Having said  that, it is important to note that evaluating PETs is not an easy task. Several parameters need to be  considered and there is a lot of area for research and improvement. To this end, our proposal should be  seen as a step forward for opening this discussion and engaging all involved parties in it. Still, there are many  questions that need to be answered and further detailed, such as:   Trust on the authors/developers/providers of the tool: The access to background information relevant  to the tool is in most cases easy to achieve. Still, how can we assess the expertise of the entity behind  the tool and how much is this relevant to the tool’s functionality? (e.g. if it makes any difference that  the tool is created by a known privacy expert rather than an unknown developer and at what extent).  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  40   Companion tools: In many cases a tool alone would not be enough to protect the user. Combined use of  different tools would probably enhance full protection in a certain domain. Recommendations of tools  should take this into account and, to this end, the evaluation methodology should define not only what  tools offer but also what they do not offer. In what detail can this be done?   Privacy by design: Although some elements might be easy to check, still further research is needed on  the practical evaluation of whether privacy has been an integral design element of a specific tool. At  what level can this be performed and how can it be connected to the relevant legal obligations for the  protection of personal data?   Side effects: Does the tool «break» other applications or does it invalidate certain functionalities? Does  it introduce any security risk? These are only some of the possible side effects of the tool that would  probably demand a more in-depth technical insight in its functionality.   Exclusion: Does the use of tool prevent the user from accessing certain sites or services (e.g. certain anti-  tracking tools being blocked by specific sites)? It is important to address the extent that this element can  be assessed and whether any practical solutions or tips can be offered to the users.   Technology readiness: The maturity level of the tool (e.g. prototype or commercial product) is another  dimension that needs to be considered. ENISA has addressed this topic with a specific report in 2015  and the results of this work need to be taken into account also for the assessment of online privacy tools  for the general public.   Usability: Many different aspects need to be taken into account for a thorough assessment of usability  in different phases, including installation process, update configuration, regular utilisation, and de-  installation. Relevant research in the field (e.g. with particular user groups) needs to be considered,  including also conformity with web accessibility standards. It is also of utmost importance to examine  usability in relation with all the other parameters, as the most easy-to-use tools are not necessarily the  best in terms of privacy protection (but still if not easy enough, they are useless for the general public).  The right balance between usability and protection is an aspect for further consideration.   Performance and costs: How well does the tool perform its tasks and what is the cost of using it (e.g.  financial cost, CPU, battery, network traffic)? This is also an important dimension in terms of cost benefit  analysis for a certain tool.   Legal, ethical and societal aspects: Many issues need to be discussed under this area. For example, which  privacy legislation was the tool designed for and does it comply with the EU data protection legal  framework? Are there any other legal concerns regarding its use (e.g. intellectual property rights)? Is the  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  41  use of the tool ethical? The answer to these questions might not be easy and would probably require  additional testing against legal provisions and involvement of legal experts.   Open code: Although the aim of the methodology would not be to promote only open source tools, it is  widely recognised that the availability of open code can increase trust as it allows for independent  reviews. It is important to explore this dimension further, considering also relevant performed code  audits for certain privacy tools (if applicable).  Apart from the issues mentioned above, it is important to test the criteria and their practical applicability  with specific tools. In the course of our study we were able to do so to a limited extent with the pilot on anti-  tracking tools but more testing and in several privacy areas is required.  Providing guidance to the general public  Together with the generic methodology, another important aspect to consider is the way that the  methodology can be used in practice, as well as the type of guidance to be provided for the general public.  Several elements need to be considered in this area, such as:   Evaluators: Who performs the evaluations of tools and how their level of independence can be  guaranteed? This is an important issue and it requires synergies between involved parties (e.g. privacy  web portals and known experts in the field). In case of self-assessments (performed by the PETs  developers), how can the accuracy of the provided information be guaranteed? To what extent can self-  assessments be useful in the context of evaluating PETs?   Presentation: It is important to provide the information on different privacy tools in a way that the  general public can really benefit from them. To this end, visual representations and graphics can greatly  help, together with plain language and clear definition of functionalities of the tools.   Maintenance: This is also of utmost importance, as evaluations can only show the tool’s state at a certain  point in time. How often should this information be updated and how are these updates presented to  the general public?  On top of the above points, the involvement of the users is also critical in order to broadly engage them in  the online privacy tools and allow them to reflect their opinions, comments and requests. In other words it  is important to invest on the wider PETs user community, involving also non expert users that would like to  address their worries and concerns. Awareness and education of the users is, thus, central in such an  approach and different dissemination channels and methods can be applied, especially through social media  platforms.  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  42  Having said that, it is also important to note that the use of PETs is sometimes presented to the general  public as a deterrent to timely accessing critical information, e.g. in case of an emergency or in combatting  terrorism. However, mass surveillance cannot be the response to these problems with a cost to everyone’s  private lives26 and should not be the reason for discouraging users to apply online privacy tools. Security is  a fundamental part of privacy, in the same way as privacy is a fundamental aspect of one’s perception of  security, especially in the evolving online and mobile information landscape.  Building trust in online privacy: a combined effort  As a final conclusion, we find that the promotion of online privacy enhancing technologies for the general  public needs to be a combined effort of all involved stakeholders, such as the Data Protection Authorities,  the privacy researchers, the independent privacy organisations and associations, the users of PETs, as well  as the industry of PET developers. It is for the mutual interest of all parties, and especially the internet and  mobile users, to define and apply an objective way of assessing online privacy tools and openly presenting  them in a comparable way. To this end, co-operation is important so as to bring the different perspectives  and ideas on the table and to work towards a common approach on addressing the different characteristics  of PETs.  This could ideally lead to a widely accepted PETs evaluation/controls matrix open to the general  public. ENISA will continue its efforts in this field by bringing the different communities together and building  the necessary expertise for this important task.  26 Article 29 Working Party, Opinion 4/2014 on surveillance of electronic communications for intelligence and national  security purposes, http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion- recommendation/files/2014/wp215_en.pdf  http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2014/wp215_en.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2014/wp215_en.pdf  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  43  Annex A:  Description of web portals promoting the use of online privacy tools  A.1 EFF Secure Messaging Scorecard  The Secure Messaging Scorecard website27, launched in November 2014, represents the first phase of an  Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) campaign in collaboration with Julia Angwin at ProPublica and Joseph  Bonneau at the Princeton Center for Information Technology Policy.

It is available for most PC browsers and also for the Android version of Firefox.  It allows users to check what trackers are following them and decide which ones to allow and which ones to  block. Besides, the tool shows the elements that have been effectively blocked in the user interface and also  in a separate window, depending on the configuration. Through click-to-play content replacement, if a user  finds he/she is missing elements on a page, he/she can access a small ghost image informing him/her about  the elements that were blocked from his/her view. The tool has an option to ignore first party trackers (also  known as direct trackers, e.g. the DoubleClick tracker on doubleclick.com).  It is important to mention that if the «GhostRank» option is activated, anonymous information about the  elements encountered and blocked is sent to the Evidon’s servers (the company behind Ghostery) to be sold  to advertising companies. According to Evidon, the tool does not collect any information which could be  used to identify users or target ads specifically at individual users.  Ghostery is an open source tool whose usage is limited by a private license, meaning that users can review  the code but they are not allowed to modify or use it in any other non-authorized way41. The source code is  only available for Firefox42. The tool provides an email address (info@ghostery.com) and a forum43  for user  support. Regarding the documentation, the tool has a FAQ page44.  Quality criteria   Background information: The tool was originally developed by David Cancel45, but in January 2010  Ghostery was acquired by the advertising company Better Advertising, which later on became Evidon.  In April 2014 Evidon and Ghostery became Ghostery Inc.   Version history: In the Firefox store there is a list of versions, with the new functionalities and corrected  bugs of each version, when applicable46.   Transparency of installation and use: The installation process is transparent to the user. Still, just after  the installation, a new tab is opened to configure the tool where the user is asked if he/she wants to  participate in Ghostrank and the button for doing so is highlighted in green (it must be noted that the  «next» button requires to select an option to be enabled). If this tab is closed, the Ghostrank option gets  40 www.ghostery.com  41 addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/ghostery/license/5.4.8.1  42 addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/files/browse/312088/A  43 getsatisfaction.com/ghostery  44 www.ghostery.com/en/faq  45 http://www.davidcancel.com  46 addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/ghostery/versions  www.ghostery.com https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/ghostery/license/5.4.8.1 http://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/files/browse/312088/A http://getsatisfaction.com/ghostery http://www.ghostery.com/en/faq http://www.davidcancel.com/ https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/ghostery/versions  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  51  unchecked and the default configuration is used. The default configuration does not activate the anti-  tracking capabilities of the tool but this is clearly explained to the user in the tool’s tutorial.  It is worth mentioning that the installer opens automatically another tab for the user to participate in a  Ghostery Install Survey (which asks for some personal details, such as the age, gender, or employment  status.) Although it is possible to avoid participation in the survey by closing the tab, the way the  presentation is done (automatically opened tab which directly shows the first question to the survey)  may be confusing and/or misleading for some non-experts users. Moreover, although the installation  does not seem to include any third party software, if the survey is completed the last page suggests the  user to register (for free) in a third party surveying service.   Public reviews: The average rating at Mozilla’s add-ons site is 5 over 5 (1195 reviews), and at Google  Chrome’s add-ons site is also 5 over 5 (7958 reviews). It is included in the Me and My Shadow and Best  Privacy Tools websites. In addition to that, there are several external reviews, most of them positive and  in general without outlining any major problem47. One point that is noted, though, is the Ghostrank  option and the ethical issues surrounding its function.   Privacy by design and default: When it is installed, an assistant with basic configuration options is  executed. In addition to that, there are other advanced configuration options. It is important to mention  that no tracker is blocked by default, so users have to activate that functionality by selecting the  corresponding option (either during the initial configuration phase, or at any moment once the tool is  installed). This can be easily made through the tool’s options page.   Ease of use: The tool is moderately easy to use for non-experts due to its complex configuration options.   User interaction: A quite active forum is available48 where users’ comments are published. In addition,  there is a web form where comments, suggestions and doubts can be sent49.   Other aspects: The tool is available in more than 15 languages and it is multiplatform, being available  for the browsers Opera, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, and for the mobile systems Android  and iOS (in Android users can choose the plugin for Firefox or the Ghostery browser).  Functionality criteria   General functionality: Blocks trackers, cookies, pixels beacons, and social network indicators. Trackers  are classified in five categories (analytics, web beacons, privacy, advertising, and widgets). The tool  allows the blocking history to be reviewed during each session.   Processing of personal data: If users activate the Ghostrank option, anonymous information about the  browsing history and the blocked elements is sent to the company’s servers to be sold to advertising  47 Some example reviews can be found in: venturebeat.com/2012/07/31/ghostery-a-web-tracking-blocker-that- actually-helps-the-ad-industry, http://www.bestvpn.com/blog/10401/ghostery-a-great-web-extension-but-shady- business-practices, longhandpixels.net/blog/2014/05/protect-your-privacy-ghostery,  www.thewindowsclub.com/ghostery-review  48 getsatisfaction.com/ghostery  49 www.ghostery.com/en/about-us/contact-us  http://venturebeat.com/2012/07/31/ghostery-a-web-tracking-blocker-that-actually-helps-the-ad-industry http://venturebeat.com/2012/07/31/ghostery-a-web-tracking-blocker-that-actually-helps-the-ad-industry http://www.bestvpn.com/blog/10401/ghostery-a-great-web-extension-but-shady-business-practices http://www.bestvpn.com/blog/10401/ghostery-a-great-web-extension-but-shady-business-practices http://longhandpixels.net/blog/2014/05/protect-your-privacy-ghostery file:///C:/TEXTOS/TIC/CONTRATOS/ENISA%20-%20PRIVACY%20TOOLS%20-%20Febrero%202015/Ejecución/Task-3/getsatisfaction.com/ghostery http://www.ghostery.com/en/about-us/contact-us  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  52  companies. However, the company claims that no personal data that could identify the users are  collected.   Flexibility: The tool does allow to define white/black lists. Also, it allows enabling/disabling of different  categories of trackers.   Choice: It is possible to temporarily block and unblock specific elements. In addition to that, by clicking  a button, it is possible to allow an element in the current page, in a way that it is always enabled for that  page even if it is disabled for all the other pages.   On/off: The tool allows to pause the blocking (affecting all tabs).   History (of blocked elements): It is possible to check what has been blocked in each page while it is  opened.   Plugins are available in the Chrome and Firefox official stores, but they are not signed (as on  10/15/2015).  B.2 Disconnect  Disconnect50  is an anti-tracking tool available for Mac (version 10.7 and above), Windows (version 7.0 and  above), Android (version 4.0 and above), and iOS (version 7.1 and above).  It allows first party trackers by  default, and detects when the user’s browser tries to make a connection to anything other than the site  he/she is visiting. By checking and unchecking the corresponding box, it allows to block and unblock trackers  of different categories (Advertising, Analytics, Social Networking, and Content), plus three specific trackers  which are shown separately (Google, Facebook, and Twitter). The tool can be found in a free version (its  source code can be found on GitHub) and a premium (paid) version. Both versions show users who is tracking  them. Besides, it allows to manage white/black lists.  It is not necessary to make a great effort in the configuration process to achieve its total capacity, as the tool  has very intuitive configuration options. In this sense, it is worthwhile to mention the graphic interface for  Chromium-based browsers that, with a glance, permits to see what connections are activated when a web  page is visited and which of them are blocked.  The source code is available at the Firefox store and from GitHub51 (though it does not seem to be maintained  anymore).  The tool offers a forum52 and an email address53 for contacting the developers. Besides, the documentation  includes a FAQ54 and a user manual55.  50 disconnect.me  51 github.com/disconnectme/disconnect  52 github.com/disconnectme/disconnect/issues  53 support@disconnect.me  54 disconnect.me/help#disconnect-private-browsing-browser-extension_faq  55 disconnect.me/disconnect  https://disconnect.me/free/mac https://disconnect.me/free/win https://disconnect.me/mobile/disconnect-mobile/sideload https://itunes.apple.com/app/id935480186 disconnect.me http://github.com/disconnectme/disconnect http://github.com/disconnectme/disconnect/issues mailto:support@disconnect.me http://disconnect.me/help#disconnect-private-browsing-browser-extension_faq http://disconnect.me/disconnect  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  53  Quality criteria   Background information: The team in charge of the tool’s maintenance is well identified56.

The  plugin is signed for Firefox (as on 10/15/2015).  B.3 uBlock origin  uBlock origin61  is a general purpose blocker for Chrome and Firefox designed to work with custom rules and  filters. The default behavior of uBlock origin is to block ads, trackers and malware sites, through the lists  EasyList, Peter Lowe's Adservers, EasyPrivacy, various lists of malware sites, and uBlock origin's own filter  lists. More lists are available to block trackers, analytics, and other elements.  The tool can load and enforce filters used by other popular adblockers such as AdBlock Plus or Disconnect.  The control interface is minimal and very intuitive. It is important to mention the ability for creating  «cosmetic» filters, that is filters used to delete something on a page which will not be displayed in  subsequent visits, as well as the ability to pause the activity in a single page or in all of them.  The source code is available at GitHub and support is provided through a forum62. With regards to the  documentation, it has a wiki63. Also a user manual is available64.  Quality criteria   Background information: Raymond Hill (the responsible for uBlock origin and the original developer  behind uBlock) transferred ownership of the original uBlock project in 2015. After that, Hill forked uBlock  into uBlock origin, a personal fork for which he's been releasing builds and providing support65.   Version history: In the Firefox store there is a list of versions, with the new functionalities and corrected  bugs of each version, when applicable66.

B.6 AdBlockPlus  AdBlockPlus92 blocks ads by default, though it is initially configured to allow what they call «non intrusive  advertising» (i.e. advertising from companies which have signed the acceptable ads manifesto with  AdBlockPlus). It is necessary to configure the tool in order to eliminate these acceptable ads. In addition to  that, it can be configured to block trackers, social buttons, and malware domains. There is quite a lot of  documentation accesible to users (first steps, how-to-use tutorials, how to allow acceptable advertisements,  FAQ, and an advanced document about how to create filters, preferences, interfaces, etc.). The source code  is available for both Firefox and Chrome93. The available support channels are a forum94, and an email  address95. The documentation is clear and it consists of a FAQ96 and additional information97.  Quality criteria   Background information: This tool is a spin-off of the former tool Adblock. The company which develops  it is eyeo, and the developing team, led by Wladimir Palant, is well defined98.   Version history: In the Firefox store there is a list of new versions, with the new functionalities and  corrected bugs of each version, when applicable99. At the Adblock Plus site, it is also possible to find  records of changes made in files of successive versions of Adblock Plus (for both Firefox and Chrome).   Transparency of installation and use: The installation process is transparent, and the tool offers its basic  functionality (ad blocking) by default as soon as it is installed. Still, advertisements from the acceptable  ads list will not be blocked and this is not clearly indicated to the users.  The tool does not seem to include third party software or modify other applications or user  configurations. Once installed, a tab is opened allowing to configure the tool for enabling malware  blocking, social buttons elimination, and trackers blocking (all these options are disabled by default). It  is interesting to mention that if this configuration is not made through that tab, it is not possible to do it  92 adblockplus.org  93 github.com/adblockplus  94 adblockplus.org/forum  95 info@eyeo.com  96 adblockplus.org/faq  97 adblockplus.org/en/android-config and adblockplus.org/en/getting_started  98 eyeo.com/en/team  99 addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/adblock-plus/versions, hg.adblockplus.org/adblockplus/log  http://github.com/adblockplus http://adblockplus.org/forum mailto:info@eyeo.com file:///C:/Users/bourkat/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.Outlook/SCZDIPSL/adblockplus.org/faq http://adblockplus.org/en/android-config http://adblockplus.org/en/getting_started http://eyeo.com/en/team https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/adblock-plus/versions https://hg.adblockplus.org/adblockplus/log  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  60  through the tool’s options menu (it is necessary to do it through the features option in the developer’s  website).   Public reviews: The average rating at Mozilla’s add-ons site is 5 over 5 (4947 reviews), and at Google  Chrome’s add-ons site is also 5 over 5 (86235 reviews). It is included in the Security in a Box, EPIC, Best  VPN, Me and My Shadow, and Reset the Net websites100.   Privacy by design and by default: The tool provides adequate capacity as ad-blocker. In order to use  additional privacy capabilities, it is necessary to complete a configuration process. As mentioned above,  the difficulty to access these configuration options depends on whether they were activated during the  initial configuration phase. Also, the acceptable ads option needs to deactivated by the user.   Ease of use: The tool is generally easy to use for non-expert users. Blocking of images can be done via  the context menu (in Chrome), also individual elements can be blocked via the user interface.   User interaction: There is a forum101 where users’ comments are published. A blog102 is also available to  users.   Other aspects: There are more than 25 available languages. The tool is multiplatform. There are versions  for Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, and Opera browsers.  Functionality criteria   General functionality: The tool is primarily an ad blocker and not an anti-tracking tool. It blocks ads by  default. It is initially configured to allow acceptable ads list (this can be changed in the options menu).

Conclusions 39  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  05  Executive Summary  Taking into account the increasing need for online data protection and the availability of numerous Privacy  Enhancing Technologies1 (PETs) for internet and mobile users, ENISA conducted, under its 2015 work  programme2, a study on online privacy tools, aiming at enhancing trust and assurance in their use by the  general public. In particular, this study includes three parts: a) a review of existing web portals promoting  the use of online privacy tools for the general public, b) a proposal for a methodology for evaluating the  quality and functionality of PETs, and c) a pilot application of the proposed methodology in the area of anti-  tracking browser extensions.  The review analysed several web portals that are listing and/or recommending the use of specific online  privacy tools (e.g. for secure messaging, anti-tracking, encryption, etc.). The main focus was on the criteria  applied for the selection (and further assessment) of these tools. The analysis showed that there are no  commonly accepted methodologies and in most cases there is not even a description of the rationale used  for selecting and recommending certain tools.  To this end, based on the results of the privacy portals’ review, a number of criteria was defined relating to  the reliability and usability of online privacy tools, especially when targeting the general public. These criteria  set the basis for ENISA’s proposal for a generic PETs evaluation methodology and are divided in three  categories: basic, quality and functionality. The basic criteria are a preliminary set of fundamental  characteristics that the tool should have (a threshold for proceeding with further analysis). They are related  to the maturity and stability of a PET, overall maintenance (last update), reactivity to known vulnerabilities,  ease of access and installation, availability of documentation. The quality criteria aim to assess generic  quality features related to the reliability and usability of the tool. In that respect they include: background  information for the tool, version history, transparency of installation and use, available public reviews,  privacy by design and by default, ease of use, user interaction and side effects. Last, the functionality criteria  assess whether the tool offers the promised functionality and features (in other words what the tool does  and what it does not) and they differ for each area of privacy tools.  Following the proposed methodology, as part of the study, a pilot analysis of six popular anti-tracking  browser extensions was also conducted. The results of the analysis is a comparative presentation of the  tools, aiming at highlighting their differences and similarities and drawing relevant conclusions.  A generic methodology for evaluation of PETs  One of the main findings of this study is the need for a widely accepted methodology for the evaluation of  PETs, which could enable a uniform presentation of their different aspects, thus supporting the general  1 In the context of this report, PETs is also used to refer to privacy enhancing tools (or privacy tools).  2 ENISA Work Programme 2015 including multi-annual planning,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/enisa-work-programme-2015  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/enisa-work-programme-2015  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  06  public in making informed choices. Such a methodology could be used both by privacy experts providing  reviews and/or comparisons of tools and/or by the PET developers (in the course of a self-assessment  practice). More advanced users could also apply the methodology to assess certain elements of their  preferred tools. Although only an in-depth technical analysis (e.g. code inspection) may provide certainty  regarding a tool’s functionality at a certain point in time, such a generic methodology could be very useful  in evaluating PETs, serving as an indicator of their reliability and usability.  Criteria for evaluating PETs – open issues and further work  On top of the evaluation criteria already proposed in the report, several parameters still need to considered  for a systematic assessment of PETs and there are extensive grounds for research and improvement in the  field. A number of open issues where, thus, identified, for example relating to the assessment of privacy by  design, the analysis of side effects (due to the use of PETs), the usability and accessibility assessment,  performance and costs of PETs, relevant legal, ethical and societal aspects, etc. Taking into account the  above points, this study should be seen as a step forward for opening this discussion and engaging all  involved parties in it.  Providing guidance to the general public  A critical dimension of the proposed methodology is its’ practical application and use for providing guidance  to the general public. Several elements need to be discussed in this area, for example who is doing the  evaluation, the extent that self-assessments (by PET developers) can be useful, visual and comprehensive  presentation of results to internet and mobile users, maintenance of the information, etc. Awareness and  education of the users is central in such an approach and different dissemination channels and methods can  be applied, especially through social media platforms.  Building trust in online privacy: a combined effort  As a final remark, it should be noted that the promotion of online privacy enhancing technologies for the  general public needs to be a combined effort of all involved stakeholders, such as the Data Protection  Authorities, the privacy researchers, the independent privacy organisations and associations, the users of  PETs, as well as the industry of PET developers. ENISA will continue its efforts in this field by bringing the  different communities together and building the necessary expertise for this important task.  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  07  1. Introduction  Privacy and data protection are fundamental human rights and are strictly anchored within the EU legal  framework3. Over the last years, ENISA has put considerable effort in these areas, providing technical  guidance on key privacy technologies such as cryptographic techniques, trust frameworks and electronic  seals, and supporting the ongoing discussions for the reform of the European data protection regime.  Following the recent revelations on mass surveillance of electronic communications4, it is widely recognised  that one of the most serious concerns today is the preservation of privacy when using internet and mobile  applications. This concern has given rise to an increasing appearance of online tools, often open-source  and/or freeware, affirming that they can offer certain privacy-preventive functionality for the average user,  such as for example secure communication, protection against tracking, safeguarding of personal data,  anonymous browsing, etc. However, in many cases the functionality of such tools is not as expected, for  example due to lack of transparency on the tool’s development and operation or lack of proper maintenance  mechanisms. There are already a few known cases of tools declared as top privacy solutions that have been  proven fraudulent5. Privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) that fail to offer what they promise can be very  dangerous, as the false sense of protection can compromise the users’ personal data and negatively affect  or even put in harm’s way their personal life.  Against this background, ENISA decided to carry out under its 2015 work programme a study in the area of  PETs for the protection of online privacy (online privacy tools) with two main objectives: a) to define the  current level of information and guidance that is provided to the general public and b) to provide a proposal  for an assessment model for online privacy tools that could bring more assurance in their use, supporting  their wider adoption by internet and mobile users.  In particular, the study comprises three parts:   A review of existing web portals promoting the use of online privacy tools by the general public.   A proposed methodology for evaluating the reliability and usability of online privacy tools based on a set  of predefined criteria.   A pilot evaluation and comparative presentation of PETs in a specific privacy area.  3 See the European Commission’s data protection web site for a thorough overview of the underlying legal and  regulatory framework, http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/index_en.htm; Also, the web site of the Article 29  Working Party for a list of opinions and other documents on specific data protection maters,  http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/  4 European Parliament, Committee of Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, \"Report on the US NSA surveillance  programme, surveillance bodies in various Member States and their impact on EU citizens’ fundamental rights and on  transatlantic cooperation in Justice and Home Affairs\", 2013,  http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+REPORT+A7-2014- 0139+0+DOC+PDF+V0//EN  5 See for example: http://www.zdnet.com/article/charlatans-the-new-wave-of-privacy-profiteers/  http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/index_en.htm http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/ http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+REPORT+A7-2014-0139+0+DOC+PDF+V0//EN http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+REPORT+A7-2014-0139+0+DOC+PDF+V0//EN http://www.zdnet.com/article/charlatans-the-new-wave-of-privacy-profiteers/  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  08  In the following Chapters the three different parts of the study are described in detail. More specifically,  Chapter 2 presents a number of initiatives listing and/or recommending the use of specific PETs, focusing  especially on the scheme used for the selection of these tools. Based on the results of this review, Chapter  3 provides a proposal for an evaluation methodology for PETs, paying particular attention on their levels of  reliability and usability. Chapter 4 then shows a practical application of this methodology in the area of anti-  tracking browser extensions. Finally, Chapter 5 draws some conclusions and recommendations regarding  the evaluation of online privacy tools, as a means for increasing trust and certainty in the field for the general  public.  It should be noted that for the purpose of the study only tools targeting directly the protection of users’  privacy have been considered. To this end, although most general security tools (e.g. antivirus or firewalls)  would also contribute to the protection of privacy, they have not been considered in our work.  Moreover,  emphasis is mainly put on online privacy tools, i.e. tools designed to operate during an internet connection  (e.g. anonymizers, secure instant messenger applications, etc.). Last, the study paid particular attention to  open source tools, due to the fact that open software allows for independent evaluation by any interested  party, thus increasing trust in the tool’s functionality. Having said that, it is important to note that no in-  depth security analysis of PETs (e.g. code inspection) has been part of this study. This is due to the fact that  such an activity requires much specialised skills and at the same time it can only guarantee security at a  certain point in time (and not beyond this). Still, such an analysis, whenever available, can provide useful  input in the course of the methodology proposed in this document.  The target audience for this document includes all interested stakeholders in the area of privacy tools (Data  Protection Authorities, industry, academia), as well as the general public, i.e. internet or mobile users who  would like to use specific tools for the preservation of their privacy and personal data.  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  09  2. A review of web portals promoting online privacy tools  This review is the first part of our study and the basis to develop a methodology to evaluate online privacy  tools. In particular, the scope of the review is to identify web portals promoting the use of selected PETs,  analyse them against a set of parameters (relevant to the objectives of the study) and provide a comparative  presentation of them, highlighting similarities, differences, strengths and weaknesses. The main focus of the  analysis was on the methodology used for the selection of the proposed tools, as well as the overall quality  and completeness of information offered to the general public. The review includes information gathered  or elaborated by both public and private sectors in EU member states or third countries.  Identification of existing web portals  In order to identify initiatives which promote the use of privacy tools, a comprehensive review of websites  and documents available online was made. The approach followed has been mainly based on web search,  using several search engines to take advantage of different indexing methods. In addition, privacy and  security experts from different domains (academia, industry, public sector) have been contacted to provide  this review with specialised advice. Effort was made to reflect both European and international projects, as  well as national initiatives in Europe and beyond.  Taking into account the objectives of the overall study, we considered explicitly initiatives fulfilling the  following characteristics:   Focusing on online privacy. This is the main topic of the review and most initiatives listed below fulfil  this characteristic. Still in some cases privacy initiatives of broader scope were considered if they had an  interesting evaluation/maintenance scheme for the selection and promotion of online privacy tools.   Listing and/or recommending specific online privacy tools. This is a very important feature as it is closely  related to the assurance level of PETs, especially if reviews and/or comparisons of tools are offered. As  an example, a portal which includes reviews of certain PETs by privacy experts can enhance trust on the  tools. As another example, a portal which enables users’ reviews makes it easier also for other users to  assess the usability and trust they can put on a certain tool.   Targeting general public. Portals directed towards developers or similar specialised user groups are out  of the scope.  Taking into account these characteristics, the most relevant web portals promoting the use of privacy tools  identified through our review are provided in the Table 1 below (see Annex A for a more detailed description  for each portal).

Moreover, there are several private blogs that provide advice and  recommendations on specific tools7. Last, plenty reports from various stakeholders (European institutions  and agencies, Data Protection Authorities, independent privacy organisations, NGOs, etc.) advocate in  favour of the wider adoption of online private tools by the general public, offering in some cases relevant  recommendations and examples8. Although the content of such initiatives is very useful and relevant to our  survey’s objectives, we did not include them in our list, as the focus in only on dynamic material, presented  in a structured way and offering specific recommendations and/or evaluations of different tools.  Moreover, it should be noted that there are many other quite advanced portals and web sites on information  security, including portals from member states’ public institutions, such as the ones of ANSSI (France), BSI  (Germany) and INCIBE (Spain). Also several EU Data Protection Authorities have dedicated portals or web  sites providing, among others, privacy recommendations and advice for the general public. Still such type of  portals have not been considered in our review, since we are specialising explicitly in online initiatives  promoting and/or recommending specific PETs.  It should also be mentioned that our analysis focused mainly on initiatives promoting open-source tools as  it is possible to get more insight in their operation and they also offer the possibility for independent code  review. Most of the initiatives listed in Table 1 have this characteristic. Still in some cases commercial portals  with privacy tools were considered if they had an interesting evaluation/maintenance scheme for the  selection of PETs.  Comparative analysis of web portals  Following the identification of the relevant web portals, we conducted, as part of this study, a more detailed  analysis of each one of them, based on a set of predefined parameters. In particular, the parameters used  are grouped under three different blocks, depending on their association with the site’s content, the  methodology followed for selecting or comparing the privacy tools, and the maintenance characteristics.  Table 2 provides in more detail the aforementioned parameters and their descriptions.  6 For example the Directory Mozilla (DMOZ), covering privacy among many other topics, www.dmoz.org  7 As for example the blog of journalist and author Julia Angwin that provides tips about protecting online privacy and  offers suggestions on the use of relevant protection tools, juliaangwin.com/privacy-tools  8 See for example: European Parliament, Mass surveillance- part 1: risk, opportunities and mitigation strategies, 2015,  http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2015/527409/EPRS_STU(2015)527409_REV1_EN.pdf  http://www.dmoz.org/ http://juliaangwin.com/privacy-tools/ http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2015/527409/EPRS_STU(2015)527409_REV1_EN.pdf  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  12  CATEGORY PARAMETERS DESCRIPTION  CONTENT  TYPE OF SITE  It describes the extent that the portal is dedicated to online privacy, e.g. whether it is  explicitly addressing PETs (covering several topics or specializing in one or more privacy  areas) or it is a general purpose security portal providing also guidance for privacy tools.  TYPE OF  MATERIAL  It indicates the type of information (on privacy tools) offered by the portal. As a  minimum a list of PETs should be provided with a basic description of what the tool  offers. A most interesting feature would be the provision of reviews and/or comparative  assessments of privacy tools.  PRESENTATION  It indicates how easy it is for the average user to browse the portal and find the desired  information. This is obviously related both to the design of the user interface, availability  of classifications per platforms and privacy areas, use of plain and understandable  language, etc.  NUMBER OF  TOOLS  It indicates the number of privacy tools presented by the portal. This is of course related  to the privacy areas that are covered by the tool and can be seen only as factor of  providing greater choice to the general public.  INTERACTION  It describes if users can provide their feedback to the portal and how this feedback is  presented and taken into account. The most interesting feature in this perspective is the  availability of active user forums where registered users can contribute with comments.  OTHER FEATURES  It covers additional functionality not included under the previous parameters, e.g.  availability of help wizard, multilingual support, etc.  METHODOLOGY  DESCRIPTION  It indicates if the portal includes a description of the methodology used for the  selection/comparison of the listed privacy tools. The most interesting portals in that  respect are those that do apply such a methodology and clearly describe it to anyone  interested, thus allowing wider understanding regarding the choice of particular tools.  EVALUATORS It provides information on the persons that did the selection and evaluation of tools.  MAINTENANCE  FREQUENCY  It provides information on the maintenance effort exerted in order to keep the content  up-to-date. Portals that are often updated (e.g. the last update is not later than six  months ago) can offer more assurance regarding the proposed PETs.  UPDATE  DOCUMENTATION  It indicates the amount of information provided on the site about the last updates. The  more information on updates is provided, the more trust a user can put on the content  of the portal. Information can include list of added/removed PETs and the reasons for  doing so.  Table 2: Parameters used for the analysis of web portals promoting the use of online privacy tools  Using the above criteria, we performed a more detailed analysis of each of the privacy tools initiatives. Based  on this work, Table 3 below gives a comparative presentation of the different web portals.

on online privacy or have a specific section  dedicated to it, although their approach towards selection of tools and maintenance of the site varies.  In particular, most portals provide a selection of tools with some description but without further analysis  and/or comparison. Moreover, the rationale behind the particular selection of tools, so as to support the  user’s final choice, is usually not clearly explained. There are, however, a few cases were a specific  methodology and/or set of criteria is applied, as for example the case of the EFF Secure Message Scoreboard  https://myshadow.org/resources https://myshadow.org/resources http://www.techsupportalert.com/content/free-windows-desktop-software-security-list-privacy.htm http://www.techsupportalert.com/content/free-windows-desktop-software-security-list-privacy.htm http://bestprivacytools.com/ http://bestprivacytools.com/ http://bestprivacytools.com/ http://privacytools.freeservers.com/ http://privacytools.freeservers.com/ http://privacytools.freeservers.com/ https://pack.resetthenet.org/ https://pack.resetthenet.org/  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  15  where 7 criteria are used (and explained to the users) for the assessment of secure messaging applications.  Another example is Security-in-a-box which provides a list of generic criteria that they apply for their  selection, though without further detailing how these criteria have been taken into account in each of the  selected tools.  Having said that, it is important to note that there is no uniform way of assessing online privacy tools even  in the context of specific application areas, e.g. anti-tracking or encryption tools. Moreover, there is no  uniform mechanism for the providers of such tools to offer relevant information about their products, e.g.  in the form of PETs quality and functionality matrix. Such a facility could be of great use to the general public,  as it would allow comparison of different online privacy tools, helping them to select the one that can be  appropriate for their own case.  Another interesting element that came out of the review is the difficulty in maintaining the portal’s  information up-to-date and to accordingly inform the users about this. Although yearly updates seem to be  feasible for most of the portals we examined, a complete changelog was available to the users only in a few  cases. Still, this is an important element for building trust to the information provided, in particular the  selection of online privacy tools.  Although not critical from the perspective of trust, the web portal’s usability is another significant criterion  for the overall promotion of privacy tools to the general public. As it has been shown in our review, many  web portals promoting online privacy tools are not always user friendly, e.g. because of lack of plain language  explanations or descriptions of tools. Classification of tools per platform and privacy area with short and to  the point reviews can be of great help when presenting tools for wider public adoption. Another singificant  element concerns the use of language on these resources: although English is the standard one, multilingual  websites have a much greater chance to become practically of use to the general public.  Interaction with the users is also an essential element in the context of a privacy tools’ web portal. The  possibility of receiving feedback from users adds value to the content of the portal by addressing points of  common interest, as well as by enhancing the portal’s overall functionality. A suitable way to implement this  could be to establish a procedure so that registered (and identified) users could contribute with suggestions,  comments, and criticisms. That contribution, however, needs to be filtered before its publication in order to  avoid inappropriate (e.g. offensive) content.  Requirements for an online privacy tools portal for the general public  Following the comparative analysis of web portals, it is clear that there are many interesting initiatives  providing lists of online privacy tools for the general public. Still, we find that there is room for improvement  both in providing more detailed guidance and analysis of specific tools, as well as presenting and maintaining  the portal’s material.  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  16  To this end, we list below the main characteristics that a privacy tools portal targeting the general public  should ideally have:   Guidance to the users  The portal should offer proper guidance to the users for the selection and use of the online privacy tools,  aiming at increasing their trust and assurance and supporting them in making an informed choice. Such  guidance should include information on the privacy risks online, pointing to the different options of tools  that can help mitigate these risks, as well as the criteria that the users should apply when making their  choice. Moreover, it should offer reviews and/or comparison between different privacy tools (of the  same category), highlighting pros and cons (weak/strong points) and providing subsequent information  for their operation and use. It should ideally propose a list of recommended privacy tools (for different  privacy areas). A list of non-recommended tools could also be a plus. As an additional element the PETs  providers could also be invited to provide their own assessments for their tools using the same criteria  (e.g. in the context of an open online PETs evaluation matrix). The methodology followed to perform  the reviews and issue the recommendations must be adequately described, with a clear explanation of  the evaluation criteria applied, as well as any other aspect relevant to the selection of certain tools.  Moreover, adequate information should be offered about the experts who perform the selection and  evaluation of the recommended tools.   Maintenance  The information provided, including the reviews and recommendations, should be frequently updated.  Static information is soon useless. Furthermore, a log of changes should be provided, describing which  tools have been added to or removed from the list of recommendations, and the reasons for doing so.   User interaction  The portal should enable feedback or even reviews by registered users or other external experts. This  can be a very good way to actively involve the broader EU and international privacy community in the  enhancement of the portal. Such contributions can improve the general knowledge about the tools,  supporting the users to assess the usefulness and reliability of a given tool.   Usability  The portal should target the general public and, thus, it should be designed in a way that non-expert  users can benefit from it. Proper classifications (e.g. per privacy area, per platform, etc.) and an easy to  user interface could be very important elements for increasing usability, taking also into account wider  web accessibility standards. The evaluations/reviews of the tools should also follow the same concept.  Although the use of English language is usually the standard, providing multilingual content can be a plus  for increasing general public involvement and awareness.  The above features can be used to enhance existing portals’ functionality or in the framework of new  initiatives in the field that are targeting the general public.  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  17  3. A methodology for the evaluation of online privacy tools  As shown in the privacy portals’ review (Chapter 2), despite the availability of a great number of web  resources listing online privacy tools, it is in many cases quite hard for the users to select among the variety  of tools and even harder for them to assess whether the tools indeed offer what they promise.  In order to  provide further guidance and support internet and mobile users in selecting the right application, we find  that there is a need for a generic methodology that could be used to review and/or compare different online  privacy tools.  Having said that, it is important to note that evaluating PETs is not an easy thing. However, we find that,  although only an in-depth technical analysis of the tools (e.g. code review) could provide a thorough insight  on their functionality at a certain point in time, there are still a number of more generic elements that could  be assessed, simply by using the tools and reviewing available public information. Such elements relate to  the general quality and functionality characteristics of the tools, as for example information about their  developers, the tools’ maintenance level, their transparency regarding the processing of personal data, the  provided documentation, etc. Although these elements alone cannot guarantee the trust level of a PET, they  can still serve as indicators of the PET’s overall operation, providing more confidence regarding what the  tool does offer (and what it does not).  To this end, for the purpose of this study we propose an evaluation methodology for online privacy tools  based on a set of general criteria that can be assessed by testing the operation of the PET in combination  with publicly available information. No in-depth technical analysis is supposed to take place in the context  of the methodology, although the results of relevant analysis for certain tools (if publicly available) could be  a great source of information.  The scope of the methodology is threefold:   Set a structured way for the evaluation of online privacy tools that can be used by privacy experts to  provide relevant reviews/recommendations of tools (e.g. in the context of a web portal as the ones  presented in Chapter 2).   Allow the PETs developers to provide more structured information regarding their tools, using the  proposed criteria, enabling in this way a uniform presentation of the different tools.   Offer internet and mobile users the possibility to assess themselves the different criteria for their tool  of interest before making their final choice.  The overall scope is, as already mentioned, to increase in one or more ways the availability of  information/assessment of existing privacy tools, providing more guidance to the general public.  In the next paragraphs we first set a number of characteristics that are important for building trust in online  privacy tools. Then, based on this set, we define the criteria for a PETs evaluation methodology with the  above described aim and approach.  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  18  Building trust in online privacy tools  As a first step of defining the evaluation methodology, it is important to determine the parameters which  could increase trust and assurance on a specific privacy tool, making it at the same time attractive for the  general public. In other words it is important to outline what the desired characteristics of such a tool are in  terms of reliability and usability, in order to have it further recommended to internet and mobile users.  In this context and taking into account relevant work of existing privacy tools initiatives9, we define in the  following list the most important generic quality features that an online privacy tool should have:   Maturity and stability. It is very important for the tool to be mature and stable and to count with a  responsible developer community. Tools that have been used for years in diverse environments or  different operating systems (and versions) are usually more stable.   Reactivity to vulnerabilities. A rapid reaction after the detection of a weakness or vulnerability is also  important as an indicator of the level of reliability and security of a tool.   Proper maintenance. The developers of a tool should provide an updated log of changes and  improvements, showing clearly how bugs or other issues have been resolved, as well as what new  features have been added to the tool.   Adequate background information and documentation. The background of the entity proposing the tool  or being responsible for its development should be available to the users.  Also, technical documentation  allows expert users to assess whether the best up-to-date technical criteria and parameters have been  taken into account.   Transparency. It should be clear from the provided information what the functionality of the tool is, i.e.  what the tool does and does not offer. No software or other content should be installed without user  consent. No personal data should be processed (e.g. transferred to other parties or used for analytics)  without user’s consent. Proper information regarding the processing of personal data is essential.   Privacy by design and by default. The tool should follow the principles of privacy by design and by  default. For example, personal data should be properly anonymised before further processed. As  another example, the default settings of the tool should be preserving user privacy and its overall  functionality should be well explained to the users.   Positive public reviews. It is very useful to have positive public reviews on the tool, both by identified  privacy experts and/or by the general public – end users. The reviews can provide good insights to the  functionality of the tools, as well as identify potential drawbacks and considerations. The reviews should  be as recent as possible.   Usability. Several aspects can be considered under this feature:   Ease of installation: The installation process should be easy and straightforward, avoiding questions  which can be a strong barrier for non-expert users.  9 For example EFF Secure Messaging Scorecard and Security in-a-box web portals described in Chapter 2.  http://www.eff.org/secure-messaging-scorecard https://securityinabox.org/en  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  19   User interaction: The existence of a reliable feedback mechanism for user contributions could help  improve the functionality of the tool and support its user basis.   User guidance: The tool should be accompanied with high-quality documentation (installation guide,  user’s manual, error guide, FAQ, etc.).   User friendly: The use of the tool should be straightforward and should not require much training.  No or very few technical support should be needed by the users.   Multilingual: Although the use of the English language should be considered as a standard, including  other languages would broaden the spectrum of potential users.   Accessibility: the tool should be available to different categories of users (including elderly  population and users with special needs), taking also into account relevant web accessibility  standards.  In addition to the above generic features, an online privacy tool must also have the specific functional  characteristics that it promises. These characteristics may vary considerably depending on the privacy area.  The important element in that perspective is that the tool does not have any hidden functionality and that  it is consistent regarding the privacy features that it claims to offer. Moreover, it is important that the tool  does not have any security traps/bugs and that its use does not bring problems to the user (e.g. affecting  other applications, very high utilisation of memory, etc.).  Criteria for the evaluation of online privacy tools  Following the desirable features of online privacy tools described above, we define in this section a set of  criteria that can be used for the evaluation of PETs.  In particular, we define three broad groups of criteria:   Basic criteria: a preliminary set of fundamental characteristics of a tool, setting the basis for evaluation.   Quality criteria: criteria assessing generic quality features related to the reliability and usability of a tool.   Functionality criteria: criteria assessing whether the tool offers the promised functionality and privacy  features (differ for each category of privacy tools).  Table 4 provides an overview of the proposed basic and quality criteria, whereas Table 5 provides an example  of functionality criteria in the area of anti-tracking browser extensions.  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  20  CRITERION  BASIC CRITERIA  MATURITY AND STABILITY  MAINTENANCE (LAST UPDATE)  REACTIVITY TO PUBLICLY KNOWN VULNERABILITIES  EASE OF ACCESS AND INSTALLATION  DOCUMENTATION  QUALITY CRITERIA  BACKGROUND INFORMATION  VERSION HISTORY  TRANSPARENCY OF INSTALLATION AND USE  PUBLIC REVIEWS  PRIVACY BY DESIGN AND BY DEFAULT  EASE OF USE  USER INTERACTION  SIDE EFFECTS  FUNCTIONALITY CRITERIA TO BE SPECIFIED PER CATEGORY OF TOOLS  Table 4: Proposed criteria for the evaluation of online privacy tools  CRITERION  FUNCTIONALITY CRITERIA  FOR ANTI-TRACKING  BROWSER EXTENSIONS  (AN EXAMPLE)  TYPE OF BLOCKING/ ANTI-TRACKING BEHAVIOUR  PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA  FLEXIBILITY  CHOICE  ON/OFF  HISTORY OF BLOCKED ELEMENTS  BROWSER COMPATIBILITY AND SIGNATURE  Table 5: Functionality criteria for anti-tracking browser extensions  The above listed criteria are described in more detail in the next paragraphs.  3.2.1 Basic criteria  The basic criteria can be seen as the «first test» of a given tool against a set of preliminary necessary  requirements that can be easily assessed based on existing publicly available information. The basic criteria  can in fact serve as exclusion criteria: if even one of these requirements is not satisfied, the tool can be  directly discarded with no further analysis of its quality or functionality. In other words, the basic criteria can  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  21  be used to quickly reject certain tools without proceeding in a deeper evaluation. They can also be used (e.g.  in the framework of a web portal as the ones presented in Chapter 2) as the threshold for providing lists of  non-recommended tools.  In this context, we define the following list of basic criteria:   Maturity and stability  Maturity and stability are integral parameters for developing trust and assurance in software. Time can  be a useful element to consider, in the sense that tools dating back a few years might have the  opportunity to get tested (and probably be improved). Still, time cannot alone define the level of  maturity and stability of a certain piece of software: it is the overall evolution of the software and the  way that is has grown with time that finally determines its maturity and stability10.  In order to assess this criterion, it is important to evaluate both the time in the market but also the way  the tool has evolved and improved over time.  For example, a minimum period of three months would  in most cases be considered necessary in order to test a tool’s maturity and stability in the market. For  a tool dating back a few years, the evolution of the tool (in terms of features added or removed over  time, corrections of bugs, etc.) is a major element to assess. Public reviews of the tools can provide  useful insight to this type of information.   Maintenance (last update)  The maintenance of tools is also a crucial parameter for trust, both in terms of security, as well as  functionality. Updates need to be performed regularly, taking into account the type of the tool and the  components that need to be maintained. For example in the case of browser plugins, often available in  the area of anti-tracking tools, maintenance would naturally need to follow the latest versions of the  relevant browser software.  In order to assess this criterion, it is important to check the latest update of a tool, taking into account  its overall functionality and dependency on other types of software.   Reactivity to publicly known vulnerabilities  This criterion is essential for the security of the tool to the extent that it can be assessed using publicly  available information. As a first step, what needs to be assessed is whether any publicly known  10 There is a lot of work in the area of maturity and stability evaluation for software, which could be taken into  account in this respect. See for example: Justin Etheredge, \"How Do We Measure Maturity In Software?,\" Code  Thinked, http://www.codethinked.com/how-do-we-measure-maturity-in-software for a relevant discussion on the  topic; Also ENISA’s 2015 report on technology readiness for PETs, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/  http://www.codethinked.com/how-do-we-measure-maturity-in-software https://www.enisa.europa.eu/  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  22  vulnerabilities have ever been reported for a certain tool11. In case that a publicly known vulnerability is  indeed found, what is important to assess is whether this vulnerability has been properly addressed, as  well as the reaction time of the developers (between the discovery of the vulnerability and its  resolution).   Ease of access and installation  This criterion is related to the availability and usability of the tool and, in the context of this  methodology, it is an important one for enabling use by the general public.  Ease of access refers to the effort needed by the user to locate and download the tool (and its potential  updates). For example, it is preferable that the download page includes only the tool in study and it  automatically selects the proper version of the tool based on the characteristics of the user’s end device  (operating system, 32/64-bit version, etc.). Tools that are hard to find and download will probably not  be appealing to the general public.  Ease of installation is examined with regard to the effort and expertise that is expected from the user to  install the tool (and its potential updates). In principle, the tool must have an installer or plugin directly  available to the users, i.e. users should not be required to compile any source code before installing the  tool.  Note that the overall usability of the tool is discussed later in the quality criteria. The reason that we  address this particular point under the basic criteria is the fact that ease of access and installation might  play a very critical role on the user’s choice to further proceed with a tool. For example when the tool is  not easy to find or when the configuration process is too complicated, the user would probably not  consider the tool at all (no matter how good the offered functionality is). In that sense, it is a basic  parameter that, in the context of our methodology, should be considered before addressing quality in  detail.   Documentation  Documentation is also an important element for enhancing use of the tool, as long as it is clear and  understandable by the general public and is regularly updated. The assessment of this criterion should,  thus, be based both on the availability of documentation, as well as its presentation (e.g. in the form of  installation instructions, user guides, FAQs or Wikis).  11 See for example CVE dictionary for publicly known security vulnerabilities and exposures, https://cve.mitre.org/  https://cve.mitre.org/  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  23  As already mentioned, the basic criteria should be checked as the first step of the assessment process. If a  tool passes this test, then the criteria assessing its quality and functionality need to be applied.  3.2.2 Quality criteria  Quality aims at evaluating the overall reliability (in terms of privacy protection) and usability of the tools,  taking into account that the scope of the assessment is to increase trust and assurance on the tools and  putting special emphasis to aspects related to privacy and the protection of personal data.  In order to provide an objective and standardised assessment process, we propose a classification scheme  for the evaluation of each criterion (Low (L), Medium (M), and High (H)). The scheme is based on quantitative  information, wherever possible, so as to support the objectives of the evaluation, for example regarding the  number of updates (in version history) or the availability of background information (yes/no). Still, in most  cases a qualitative approach is needed, in the sense that the assessment cannot be solely based on a generic  scale (such as for example the criteria on transparency or public reviews). Therefore, the classification mainly  aims to provide possible scenarios or examples that could help the assessment. On top of this, we have tried  to support the assessment process by providing guidance on the different aspects that need to be considered  by the evaluator and the possible sources of relevant information.  To this end, the following list includes the proposed quality criteria:   Background information  User’s choice of privacy tools may be supported by the provision of adequate background information  regarding the tools’ developers and/or the entities that are behind their overall maintenance and  promotion. Although this criterion cannot be considered as directly affecting the reliability of a tool, still  it is important for allowing the users to find useful information that could increase or decrease their level  of trust on a certain tool (e.g. based on the expertise of the developers or the business model behind  the operation of the tool).  In the assessment of this criterion it is important to note that it is the availability and quality of clear  background information that is being evaluated rather than the content of this information per se (e.g.  no evaluation of the tool’s developer’s knowledge and expertise is taking place as part of this  methodology).  Classification/examples:   Low: no clear background information is provided regarding the entity that provides and supports  the tool; no information regarding the tool’s development and support team.   Medium: the organisation that provides the tool is well defined, without further information about  the specific development and support of this tool.  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  24   High: clear information is provided regarding both the tool’s development, as well as the entity that  is behind its’ maintenance and support.   Version history  A complete and documented version history is an important feature for building trust on a certain tool,  as it permits potential users to check the evolution of the tool and, in some cases, understand how the  developers have reacted to users’ feedback or to the resolution of bugs. As part of this feature, it is also  useful to provide update mechanisms that can inform the users about new versions and/or issues that  have been added or resolved. This criterion is in fact a feature that can reveal the level and quality of  maintenance of the tool.  Classification/examples:   Low: there is no version history containing information about the new functionalities or the  corrected bugs.   Medium: some information on versioning is provided without specifically documenting the  performed updates.   High: a version history containing information about updated functionalities and corrected bugs is  available; a mechanism for informing users about new updates is available.   Transparency of installation and use  This criterion is mainly related to the transparency of the installation process, as well as the overall  operation of the tool.  In particular during the installation process the user should be clearly informed whether any additional  software is being installed (apart from the requested tool) or in general whether any other data is being  stored and/or accessed in the user’s terminal device (e.g. cookies). User’s consent should be obtained  before performing any relevant installation or access during the installation process of the tool or during  its operation.  The user should also be clearly informed if any processing of his/her personal data takes place during  the operation of the tool (e.g. transfer of user’s personal data for analytics purposes). No processing of  personal data should take place without prior user’s consent.  Moreover, adequate information should be provided to the user regarding the functionalities of the tool  (what it does and what is does not). Also, regarding the features that are enabled by default and those  that the user needs to enable himself/herself.  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  25  In order to assess this criterion, it is important to check both the installation process and operation  (default features, network traffic) of the tool, as well as the notice and information that is provided at  the tool’s web site.  Classification/examples:   Low: the installation process and/or the operation of the tool are not transparent to the user. For  example, it is not clear if changes to other applications or user settings are being performed during  the installation process (e.g. changes in the selected search engine, homepage, tool bars, etc.). As  another example, user’s data are being further processed for analytics purposes without clear  notice.   Medium: the installation process is transparent to the user but the default operation of the tool is  not as naturally expected. For example, a tool that is supposed to block advertising, it does not do  so for certain companies without clearly informing the user about it.   High: the installation process and operation of the tool are transparent to the user; the tool clearly  informs the user about its default operation and the actions that need to be taken (if any) in order  for the tool to reach its maximum privacy protection.  Note should be taken that for this particular criterion, the low value would imply possible unlawfulness  of the tool and would, thus, directly exclude the tool from further being considered for evaluation.   Public reviews  This is a special criterion as it can provide an overall insight of the reliability and usability of the tool  based on feedback from other users. Its evaluation can in fact serve as input to the evaluation of all other  criteria. Still, we preferred to address it separately as locating and assessing existing reviews is a special  task in itself: it is not only important to identify relevant reviews but also to assess their quality,  independence and accuracy. This is why this particular criterion is rather subjective as it is up to the  evaluator to decide which information sources he/she can trust.  Reviews may come from specific experts or general users of the tool and they can take different formats  (e.g. an article written by an analyst, an average rating provided by users at a software download centre,  a prominent position at one of the existing portals promoting privacy tools). As already mentioned, it is  the evaluator who will decide, based on his/her experience, if and how these reviews are worth being  considered. Still what is most important to assess under this criterion is whether there are identified  problems with a certain tool, especially hidden traps or information that is not directly available to the  users (e.g. hidden monetization goals of anti-tracking tools whitelisting certain advertising companies or  secretly selling users’ personal data to advertisers). Also, public reviews can provide a useful criterion  for the usability of the tool and the overall user satisfaction.  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  26  Classification/examples:   Low: one or more public reviews outline a serious issue related to the installation or operation of  the tool (e.g. possible hidden software installation, unlawful processing of users’ personal data,  functionality that is different than advertised/expected, etc.).   Medium: some negative aspects can be found in public reviews but none of them is indicating any  important functionality flaw (e.g. reviews are mostly about difficulty of use, complex interface, etc.).   High: there are many reviews and most of them are positive; no or very few negative aspects can be  found in public reviews e.g. indicating only minor usability problems.  Note that for this particular criterion, the low value could imply possible hidden unwanted functionality  or even unlawfulness of the tool that could directly exclude the tool from further being considered for  evaluation. This is of course very much dependent on the content and sources of the reviews and would,  thus, need to be assessed separately for each different case.   Privacy by design and by default  This criterion aims first of all to assess whether privacy and data protection have been considered in the  overall design and implementation of the tool12. As outlined in the latest ENISA report in the field13,  privacy by design principles can be translated into certain design strategies, such as data minimization,  anonymization, integration of proper notice and consent mechanisms, etc. Moreover, the purpose of  this criterion is to assess whether the tool offers all its privacy preserving features by default, without  the need for the user to configure it. Apart from the general configuration of the tool, what is also  important to assess is the default behaviour of the tool and the particular features that the user needs  to configure himself/herself so as to get the maximum privacy protection.  Classification/examples:   Low: the tool asks users to provide their personal data in order to complete the installation although  this is not necessary (e.g. in order to participate in a survey); the privacy features of the tool are not  enabled by default.   Medium: some privacy features are enabled by default but others need to be activated by the user  through a complicated configuration process.   High: the tool provides its maximum privacy preserving features without the need to configure it;  no personal data are being collected and statistics are drawn only with the use of anonymous data.  12 Privacy by design and by default have been introduced as new obligations for the data controllers and processors in  the context of the European Commission proposal for the General Data Protection Regulation,  http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf  13 Privacy and data protection by design – from policy to enginnering, ENISA, 2014,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/privacy-and-data-protection-by- design  http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/privacy-and-data-protection-by-design https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/privacy-and-data-protection-by-design  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  27   Ease of use  This criterion is aimed to cover the user friendliness of the tool, which directly affects its usability. Having  said that, it is important to note that usability is related to the effectiveness, efficiency and user  satisfaction14 and, thus, it should in a way be assessed as part of most of the criteria already described.  Although it is not the aim of this study to provide a detailed analysis for usability testing, it is important  to note a number of parameters that need to be considered under the criterion for ease of use, such as  the clarity of the user interface, the level of configuration that is needed by the users, the availability of  customization options, etc. It is up to the evaluator (and his/her particular expertise) to address the  above-mentioned parameters, taking into account the fact that the target group is the general public.  Classification/examples:   Low: the tool requires complex configuration that is difficult for non-expert users; many of the tool’s  functionalities are hidden and not clearly explained.   Medium: the main tool’s functionality is achieved without need for further configuration but there  are no customization options and/or the user has to spend a lot of time in order to find them.   High: the main tool’s functionality is achieved without need for further configuration; customization  options are available and easy to configure; a help wizard or wiki can easily guide the user through  the tool’s functionality after installation.  It is important to note that usability of PETs is a topic that needs more thorough consideration, taking  into account existing research in the field and addressing all relevant aspects. User accessibility (for  example in relation to elderly users or users with disabilities) is also a core issue of usability, especially  in the area of online privacy15. Another important aspect is to examine usability in relation to the  reliability/trustworthiness of the tools, as it is not always easy to find the right balance between user  friendliness and privacy protection. These issues have not been detailed in the context of our study and  they should be subject of a specific analysis on the usability of PETs.   User interaction  This criterion evaluates the support offered to the users of a tool, mainly in terms of addressing user  comments, feedback mechanism, etc.16. It is important both for increasing the usability of the tool, as  14 According to the International Standards Organization (ISO), usability refers to: \"...the extent to which a product can  be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context  of use.” See: ISO 9241-11:1998, \"Ergonomic requirements for office work with visual display terminals (VDTs) -- Part  11: Guidance on usability,\" 1998, http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=16883  15 W3C Web accessibility initiative, \"Introduction to web accessibility\",  https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility.php  16 Note that the availability and quality of documentation, which are also relevant to user support, are addressed under  the basic criteria.  http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=16883 https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility.php  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  28  well as for integrating user comments and reviews as part of the tool’s overall evolution. Moreover, well  established user interaction mechanisms can help establish trust on the tool and create a supporting  user community.  Classification/examples:   Low: there is no way of user interaction with the developers/owners of the tool.   Medium: users can submit comments/questions (e.g. by email or via web forms) but there is no  active user forum where comments and relevant feedback are published.   High: a well-established user interaction mechanism is available, including fast feedback  mechanisms and an active user forum.   Side effects  Another important criterion is the possible side effects that the tool’s operation might have. These side  effects can be twofold:   Technical side effects for example related to the tool’s CPU usage, possible overhead in network  traffic, performance loss, possible false alerts in intrusion detection systems, etc.   Blocking of access to certain web sites /services due to the use of a particular PET.  Although we find that this information is crucial for supporting an internet or mobile user to make  his/her choice, we did not further address its practical assessment in our proposal, due to the fact that  its analysis would probably require a deeper inspection of the tool’s technical operation (especially in  the case of technical side effects). Still, we tried to assess some of these aspects under the criteria of  transparency and public reviews and we aim at further developing our methodology to better address  this perspective.  On top of the criteria mentioned above, there are also some other parameters that, although they cannot  be directly used as evaluation criteria, still they are quite important in the selection of a tool by the general  public. These parameters are:   Multilingual: Although English has been considered as a standard for the purpose of this study, it is still  recognised that tools available also in other languages can increase adoption by the general public.   Cross-platform: Tools available in multiple platforms can offer more options and flexibility to the users,  making it easier for them to manage their privacy protection without the need to change their favourite  applications. Depending on the specific tool, the software platform can be the operating system (as in  the case of traditional applications), such as Windows, Mac, GNU/Linux, Android, iOS, or Windows Phone,  or the web browser (as in the case of plugins or add-ons), e.g. Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer, Opera,  or Safari.  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  29  Last, it should be noted that as part of the evaluation it is important to address what jurisdictions the tool is  compliant with and in particular whether it is consistent with EU data protection legal framework. Also other  legal considerations should be taken into account, for example regarding individual property rights or export  restrictions if applicable.  3.2.3 Functionality criteria  Based on the functional privacy area which the tool belongs to, during the analysis it will be necessary to  consider a specific set of criteria directly related to the functionality of the tool. This set of criteria will in fact  assess to what extent the tool does what it claims in terms of protecting user privacy and personal data.  Clearly, functionality criteria will differ depending on the privacy area. To this end, it is first of all important  to define the expected privacy features/characteristics of the tool. This will help determine its core  functionality, as well as any optional/desirable functions that a tool (under a certain privacy area) could  offer.  As an example we provide in the following a list of functionality criteria that we drew for the area of anti-  tracking browser extensions (plug-ins/add-ons).  3.2.3.1 Example: Functionality criteria for anti-tracking browser extensions  Anti-tracking browser extensions (plug-ins/add-ons) aim at blocking attempts of certain websites to record  the internet activity and other personal information of a web user (e.g. visited web page, user location, type  of browser, etc.) and/or present content to the user. In particular, they are usually intended to block one or  more of the following elements:   Advertisements (e.g. in the form of a banner, images, etc.).   Scripts (e.g. Java, JavaScript, and Flash scripts).   Pop-ups.   Cookies.   Other elements (e.g. social buttons, such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc.).  Main functionality (type of blocking/anti-tracking behaviour)  In most cases, the tools block one or more of the above mentioned elements, providing also information to  the user about the service that is trying to capture personal data, the processes and connections that are  active and the number and types of elements that have been blocked. Besides, they can offer real-time  information about user’s activity, the hosts and ports that are being used, etc.  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  30  Processing of personal data  An anti-tracking tool is expected to protect a user from being tracked when surfing the web, offering the  functionality described above. It should not be used for the processing of user’s personal data (e.g. online  behaviour, favourite ads) for analytics or other purposes without user’s consent.  No hidden activities  affecting users’ personal data (e.g. by whitelisting specific advertising companies or secretly selling user’s  data to advertisers) should be acceptable.  Additional features   Flexibility: The tool could allow users to personalize the way it is used, e.g. what and how is blocked  (varying from single webpages to full domains). This option could be offered in various ways, e.g.  white/black listing, filtering options, etc.   Choice: The tool could provide the possibility for the user to temporarily block/unblock a specific  element (emerging windows, advertising, trackers, etc.). This can be very useful, e.g. if the user would  like to allow graphs from a certain company, while images from all other companies would be blocked.   On/off: The tool could allow users to pause the blocking/unblocking process (as a whole and not only  for a specific element).   History (of blocked elements): The tool could make it possible for the user to check what has been  blocked. Although this is only informative, it may be very useful for users to be aware about the attempts  of tracking their behaviour while surfing the web. It could be up to the user to define how the history of  blocking is presented.  On top of the criteria mentioned above, there are also some more generic features that are applicable to  browser plugins and add-ons and could be quite essential also in the case of anti-tracking tools. These are:   Browser compatibility: The tool could be available as a plugin or an add-on in the corresponding official  store of the evaluated platform (Firefox, Chrome, etc.). This may be seen as an additional guarantee that  the tool is going to be downloaded from a safe place.   Signature: Singed plugins (which can be found when using a plugin locator menu option) may provide  additional security guarantees.  Following the criteria described above, in the context of the assessment of anti-tracking tools, the evaluator  would first have to check the main functionality of the tool, trying to identify any issues affecting the user’s  privacy (e.g. due to lack of proper information or hidden operations of the tool). Then the other functional  criteria would also be examined. The result of this evaluation would be a list of what the tool offers and what  it does not offer, including ideally its pros and cons and outlining any serious functionality issues.  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  31  4. A pilot evaluation of anti-tracking browser extensions  Scope of the pilot  This chapter provides a pilot analysis of anti-tracking browser extensions (plug-ins/add-ons) following the  methodology that we defined in Chapter 3. The focus is on applying the predefined assessment criteria on a  number of well-known browser extensions that can be used for blocking online tracking, as well as provide  a comparative presentation of the different tools. The aim of the pilot is to demonstrate the practical  application of the proposed methodology, serving as the basis for evaluations of privacy tools in the future.  There is a great variety of anti-tracking tools today, offering different options and functionality. For the  purpose of the study we selected six of the most popular anti-tracking browser extensions that are listed in  many of the web portals we identified in Chapter 2. Our selection was based on the popularity of the tools,  as well as the fact that they cover different types of functionalities in the field. In particular, the tools we  considered were as follows:   Ghostery17   Disconnect18   uBlock origin19   Privacy badger20   NoScript21   AdBlockPlus22  All of the above-mentioned tools satisfy the set of basic criteria, as they date already some years with a  specific development team, their latest updates where less than six months old at the time of our study, no  publicly known vulnerability is reported, they are all easy to access and install and they provide relevant  documentation. Therefore, in the context of our pilot we focused our analysis of the tools on the quality and  functionality criteria described in Chapter 3.  It is important to note again that our analysis is based solely on criteria that can be evaluated via publicly  available information and/or the test installation and use of the tool. Still, only an in-depth security analysis  (e.g. code inspection) can guarantee the functionality of a tool at a certain point in time. Such an analysis  was not part of our pilot.  17 www.ghostery.com  18 disconnect.me  19 github.com/gorhill/uBlock  20 https://www.eff.org/privacybadger  21 noscript.net  22 adblockplus.org  www.ghostery.com disconnect.me github.com/gorhill/uBlock https://www.eff.org/privacybadger noscript.net  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  32  It must also be mentioned that for the scope of the pilot the only platforms that have been considered are  Firefox and Chrome due to the fact that they have similar characteristics (e.g. official add-on store) and they  represent an important percentage of the browsing quota today.  A comparative presentation of six anti-tracking browser extensions  Following the approach and analysis mentioned above, Table 6 resumes the main functionality and features  of the six selected anti-tracking tools, whereas Tables 7 and 8 summarize their specific quality and  functionality characteristics. Annex B provides a more detailed description per tool.  TOOL WHAT IT DOES ADDITIONAL FEATURES CONSIDERATIONS  Ghostery  Blocks several types of elements  (cookies, scripts, ad networks,  social buttons, etc.).  Trackers are classified in five  categories (analytics, web beacons,  privacy, advertising, and widgets).  Shows what has been blocked in  each site during the session.  Has an editable whitelist.  Click-to-play functionality  enables unblocking of  useful widgets (e.g. a  comments form or an  embedded video player).  Very efficient memory  usage.  Configuration tutorial after  installation.  Blocking is not enabled by default (but  needs to be activated by the user).  The Ghostrank option, when activated,  allows selling of info related to blocked ads  to advertising companies. Evidon, the  company behind Ghostery (also an  advertising company) claims that no  personal data are being processed. Still,  this topic raises ethical issues for some  users. Ghostrank is deactivated by default.  Disconnect  Blocks several types of elements  (cookies, scripts, ad networks,  social buttons, etc.).  Presents trackers in four  categories: advertising, analytics,  social networking, and content,  plus three specific buttons for  Facebook, Google and Twitter.  Shows what has been blocked in  each site during the session.  Whitelist available (not editable).  In Chrome, it shows users  who is tracking them with a  collusion graph.  Automatically reloads the  page after a change in the  filtering options.  The dashboard shows the  time and bandwidth saved.  After installation, a tab asks for financial  support without any «exit» or «no  support» button (the only option to avoid  it is to close the tab or to select the «Tour  the interface» button). This can be  confusing for non-expert users.  uBlock  origin  By default it blocks advertising,  malware domains and social  buttons. By enabling more lists  more elements can be blocked  (e.g. analytics).  Shows what has been blocked in  each site during the session  (through the requests register).  Has an editable whitelist.  Great CPU and memory  performance. Very fast  page loading.  Great customization  capabilities (importing of  host files, third party filters  selection, editing user’s  filters and rules).  It is possible to enable an  option to stop WebRTC  from revealing local IP  addresses of VPN users.  Sometimes (and depending on how the  strict blocking option is set), some sites  cannot be accessed (although the user is  informed, and buttons appear to allow  him/her to change the configuration at a  permanent- or temporary basis).  A little bit difficult to configure by a non-  expert user.  To see what has been blocked it is  necessary to go to the requests register.  Privacy  Badger  Blocks several types of elements  (cookies, scripts, ad networks, etc.)  Its dynamic blocking  behaviour, increases ease of  Due to its way of operation, it requires  browsing around several different websites  to start blocking.  https://www.ghostery.com/es/home https://disconnect.me/ https://www.mozilla.org/es-ES/lightbeam/ https://www.eff.org/es/node/73969 https://www.eff.org/es/node/73969  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  33  TOOL WHAT IT DOES ADDITIONAL FEATURES CONSIDERATIONS  It builds its blocking list as the user  navigates through different pages  (dynamic).  In each session, it shows the  potential trackers and whether  they have been blocked or not. In  the configuration it records all  potential trackers identified and  those which have been blocked so  far.  Has an editable whitelist.  use and requires very little  user configuration.  It can detect canvas based  fingerprinting.  More advanced integration  of Do not Track (DNT) –  compliance with EFF DNT.  Shows a tutorial after  installation.  If a site is included in the whitelist, the  configuration button disappears from the  user interface.  NoScript  Blocks scripts (it blocks advertising  or any other element provided  that they include script).  Allows selecting whether to block  JavaScript, Adobe Flash, Microsoft  Silverlight and other similar  programs.  Shows what has been blocked in  each site during the session  Has an editable whitelist.  Great customization  options  It does not rely on a  virus/vulnerability database  (good for unknown  threats).  Prevents «Clickjacking» and  cross-site scripting attacks.  It can be configured to  automatically reload the  page after a change in the  blocking options.  It only blocks scripts.  Time-consuming setup, otherwise pages  with many scripts can be not properly  displayed. This can be hard for non- experts.  Only available as an extension for Mozilla- based browsers.  AdBlock  Plus  It is primarily an ad blocker rather  than an anti-tracking tool. Ad  blocking is done by default, except  from ads coming from the  «acceptable ads» whitelist. It can  be configured to block trackers,  social buttons, and malware  domains. Different functionalities  are available for Firefox and  Chrome.  It is possible to check what has  been blocked, but only in Firefox. In  Chrome it is only possible to check  the number of blocked elements.  Has an editable whitelist in  Chrome.  Wild cards allow blocking of  specific sections of a  domain (granularity).  It allows selecting third  party filters, and edit user’s  filters.  Via context menu, images  in a page can be blocked.  Additionally, (only in  Chrome) specific elements  can be blocked via context  menu or through user  interface.  The default operation only blocks  advertising. Any other type of blocking  needs to be activated by the user. If this  activation is not done directly after  installation (through a tab that is  automatically opened), it is quite difficult  to do it later.  It includes an acceptable ads whitelist  (include ads from Google and Microsoft),  which is enabled by default. The user  needs to deactivate it in order not to  receive ads from the companies in the list.  High RAM penalty and CPU intensive.

Table 8: Presentation of functionality analysis of the tools (additional features)  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  37  With the help of the previous information, it can be said that there are no major functional differences  between most of the analysed tools, in the sense that all of them protect user’s privacy by preventing user’s  activities to be tracked. Ad, cookies and script blockers give the users control over their browsing experience.  They can block ads on the visited sites and kill scripts and widgets that send users’ data to unknown third-  parties. Still some functional differences can be found, for example AdBlockPlus is primarily an ad blocker  rather than an anti-tracking tool, uBlock origin also primarily works with ads (but not only), NoScript is only  for preventing scripts from running while browsing.  All the tools are quite popular and provide plenty of support information (e.g. background information,  version history), user forums, as well as many configuration options.  However, there are some differences regarding the default privacy preserving functionality and  transparency to the user. For example, AdBlockPlus allows acceptable ads and this option is enabled by  default, although the user is informed about this fact. Privacy Badger or Disconnect block tracking cookies  and scripts from running by default, while Ghostery does not block any tracker by default (the functionality  needs to be enabled by the user).  Also, there are differences regarding the way the different tools operate, but details are only for advanced  users. As an example, Privacy Badger does not use standard lists but follows a behavioural blocking process  (learning user preferences while browsing). This can very useful in some cases, as it could enable blocking of  a tracker that is not included in standard lists. However, with this approach the tool might take longer to  build its own anti-tracking list (because the user needs to browse around several different websites for the  tool to learn what to block).  Differences can also be found regarding the overall performance of the tools. For example uBlock origin has  very good CPU and memory utilization, whereas AdBlockPlus is CPU and RAM intensive. However, with  uBlock origin some sites might not be accessed without proper configuration of the tool’s properties.  Looking at Tables 6 to 8 it is possible to provide tips which can serve as guidance for different types of users.  For example, advanced users interested in having the possibility of including filters, should select uBlock  origin, NoScript or AdBlockPlus. Disconnect users who want to see in a collusion graph what connections are  activated when a web page is visited and which of them are blocked, should install the Chrome version.  Users aiming to use an online privacy tool but do not want to be worried about any configuration process  (even though this can be assisted through a wizard) should use Disconnect or Privacy Badger. A user who is  interested in defining white or black lists to improve his/her browsing experience could select any of the  tools. Similarly, if temporary blocking/unblocking is needed, all tools could be used (uBlock Origin and the  Chrome version of AdBlockPlus allows to select what to block via context menu or the user interface; context  menu is also available for AdBlockPlus users in Firefox, but only to block images).  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  38  Available public reviews also provide tips and recommendations to help users decide which tool to choose.  For example, a recent review24 recommends using both, Ghostery and Disconnect. The reason is that,  although Ghostery blocks more trackers, there are many (even popular) trackers that it misses which are  actually blocked by Disconnect, and vice versa25. In the same review, Privacy Badger is also recommended,  highlighting that none of the add-ons makes the other one redundant.  A general conclusion that can be drawn from our analysis is that a clear description of the functionalities of  the tools is needed, in order for the user to understand what exactly he/she needs and make the best  possible choice. In many cases, tools would need to be complemented in order to provide for maximum  protection in a specific privacy area.  24 A review on tracker and script blocker extensions for Firefox: log.add0n.com/2015/05/16/tracker-and- script%20blocker-extensions-for-firefox.html  25 See also: The best browser extensions that protect your privacy: lifehacker.com/the-best-browser-extensions-that- protect-your-privacy-479408034  http://blog.add0n.com/2015/05/16/tracker-and-script%20blocker-extensions-for-firefox.html http://blog.add0n.com/2015/05/16/tracker-and-script%20blocker-extensions-for-firefox.html http://lifehacker.com/the-best-browser-extensions-that-protect-your-privacy-479408034 http://lifehacker.com/the-best-browser-extensions-that-protect-your-privacy-479408034  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  39  5. Conclusions  The goal of this report has been to support the protection of online privacy by using PETs. Despite the  availability of different tools and technologies, information provided is not always sufficient to guide internet  and mobile users and help them select the PET that is most appropriate for their needs. Following a review  of existing web portals promoting PETs, this report sought to identify the elements that could build trust  and assurance for the general public when making their choice. The conclusions of our work and relevant  open issues are listed below.  The need for a widely accepted methodology for the evaluation of PETs  Assessment of online privacy tools and comparison between different tools of the same category can assist  internet and mobile users in understanding the options they have and make an informed choice. Although  there are several web portals listing and/or recommending privacy tools, there is no uniform methodology  for assessing the selected tools (and in many cases there is no methodology at all). It appears that that the  definition and adoption of such a methodology both by the PETs developers, as well as by the greater privacy  community, could greatly support an objective evaluation of the tools’ quality and functionality, providing  valuable output for the general public. The methodology should be based on specific predefined criteria (e.g.  in the mode of an evaluation matrix) that could be used to assess different aspects of an online privacy tool.  It could be applied both by privacy experts providing reviews and/or comparisons of tools and/or by the PET  developers (in the course of a self-assessment practice). More advanced users could also apply the criteria  of the methodology to assess certain aspects of their preferred online privacy tools. Although only an in-  depth technical analysis (e.g. code inspection) can provide certainty regarding a tool’s functionality at a  certain point in time, we believe that such a generic methodology can still be very useful in evaluating PETs,  serving as an indicator of their reliability and usability.  Criteria for a generic methodology for PETs evaluation  In the context of this report we proposed a number of criteria that could be used to develop a generic  methodology for the evaluation of online privacy tools (basic, quality and functionality criteria). Having said  that, it is important to note that evaluating PETs is not an easy task. Several parameters need to be  considered and there is a lot of area for research and improvement. To this end, our proposal should be  seen as a step forward for opening this discussion and engaging all involved parties in it. Still, there are many  questions that need to be answered and further detailed, such as:   Trust on the authors/developers/providers of the tool: The access to background information relevant  to the tool is in most cases easy to achieve. Still, how can we assess the expertise of the entity behind  the tool and how much is this relevant to the tool’s functionality? (e.g. if it makes any difference that  the tool is created by a known privacy expert rather than an unknown developer and at what extent).  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  40   Companion tools: In many cases a tool alone would not be enough to protect the user. Combined use of  different tools would probably enhance full protection in a certain domain. Recommendations of tools  should take this into account and, to this end, the evaluation methodology should define not only what  tools offer but also what they do not offer. In what detail can this be done?   Privacy by design: Although some elements might be easy to check, still further research is needed on  the practical evaluation of whether privacy has been an integral design element of a specific tool. At  what level can this be performed and how can it be connected to the relevant legal obligations for the  protection of personal data?   Side effects: Does the tool «break» other applications or does it invalidate certain functionalities? Does  it introduce any security risk? These are only some of the possible side effects of the tool that would  probably demand a more in-depth technical insight in its functionality.   Exclusion: Does the use of tool prevent the user from accessing certain sites or services (e.g. certain anti-  tracking tools being blocked by specific sites)? It is important to address the extent that this element can  be assessed and whether any practical solutions or tips can be offered to the users.   Technology readiness: The maturity level of the tool (e.g. prototype or commercial product) is another  dimension that needs to be considered. ENISA has addressed this topic with a specific report in 2015  and the results of this work need to be taken into account also for the assessment of online privacy tools  for the general public.   Usability: Many different aspects need to be taken into account for a thorough assessment of usability  in different phases, including installation process, update configuration, regular utilisation, and de-  installation. Relevant research in the field (e.g. with particular user groups) needs to be considered,  including also conformity with web accessibility standards. It is also of utmost importance to examine  usability in relation with all the other parameters, as the most easy-to-use tools are not necessarily the  best in terms of privacy protection (but still if not easy enough, they are useless for the general public).  The right balance between usability and protection is an aspect for further consideration.   Performance and costs: How well does the tool perform its tasks and what is the cost of using it (e.g.  financial cost, CPU, battery, network traffic)? This is also an important dimension in terms of cost benefit  analysis for a certain tool.   Legal, ethical and societal aspects: Many issues need to be discussed under this area. For example, which  privacy legislation was the tool designed for and does it comply with the EU data protection legal  framework? Are there any other legal concerns regarding its use (e.g. intellectual property rights)? Is the  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  41  use of the tool ethical? The answer to these questions might not be easy and would probably require  additional testing against legal provisions and involvement of legal experts.   Open code: Although the aim of the methodology would not be to promote only open source tools, it is  widely recognised that the availability of open code can increase trust as it allows for independent  reviews. It is important to explore this dimension further, considering also relevant performed code  audits for certain privacy tools (if applicable).  Apart from the issues mentioned above, it is important to test the criteria and their practical applicability  with specific tools. In the course of our study we were able to do so to a limited extent with the pilot on anti-  tracking tools but more testing and in several privacy areas is required.  Providing guidance to the general public  Together with the generic methodology, another important aspect to consider is the way that the  methodology can be used in practice, as well as the type of guidance to be provided for the general public.  Several elements need to be considered in this area, such as:   Evaluators: Who performs the evaluations of tools and how their level of independence can be  guaranteed? This is an important issue and it requires synergies between involved parties (e.g. privacy  web portals and known experts in the field). In case of self-assessments (performed by the PETs  developers), how can the accuracy of the provided information be guaranteed? To what extent can self-  assessments be useful in the context of evaluating PETs?   Presentation: It is important to provide the information on different privacy tools in a way that the  general public can really benefit from them. To this end, visual representations and graphics can greatly  help, together with plain language and clear definition of functionalities of the tools.   Maintenance: This is also of utmost importance, as evaluations can only show the tool’s state at a certain  point in time. How often should this information be updated and how are these updates presented to  the general public?  On top of the above points, the involvement of the users is also critical in order to broadly engage them in  the online privacy tools and allow them to reflect their opinions, comments and requests. In other words it  is important to invest on the wider PETs user community, involving also non expert users that would like to  address their worries and concerns. Awareness and education of the users is, thus, central in such an  approach and different dissemination channels and methods can be applied, especially through social media  platforms.  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  42  Having said that, it is also important to note that the use of PETs is sometimes presented to the general  public as a deterrent to timely accessing critical information, e.g. in case of an emergency or in combatting  terrorism. However, mass surveillance cannot be the response to these problems with a cost to everyone’s  private lives26 and should not be the reason for discouraging users to apply online privacy tools. Security is  a fundamental part of privacy, in the same way as privacy is a fundamental aspect of one’s perception of  security, especially in the evolving online and mobile information landscape.  Building trust in online privacy: a combined effort  As a final conclusion, we find that the promotion of online privacy enhancing technologies for the general  public needs to be a combined effort of all involved stakeholders, such as the Data Protection Authorities,  the privacy researchers, the independent privacy organisations and associations, the users of PETs, as well  as the industry of PET developers. It is for the mutual interest of all parties, and especially the internet and  mobile users, to define and apply an objective way of assessing online privacy tools and openly presenting  them in a comparable way. To this end, co-operation is important so as to bring the different perspectives  and ideas on the table and to work towards a common approach on addressing the different characteristics  of PETs.  This could ideally lead to a widely accepted PETs evaluation/controls matrix open to the general  public. ENISA will continue its efforts in this field by bringing the different communities together and building  the necessary expertise for this important task.  26 Article 29 Working Party, Opinion 4/2014 on surveillance of electronic communications for intelligence and national  security purposes, http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion- recommendation/files/2014/wp215_en.pdf  http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2014/wp215_en.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2014/wp215_en.pdf  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  43  Annex A:  Description of web portals promoting the use of online privacy tools  A.1 EFF Secure Messaging Scorecard  The Secure Messaging Scorecard website27, launched in November 2014, represents the first phase of an  Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) campaign in collaboration with Julia Angwin at ProPublica and Joseph  Bonneau at the Princeton Center for Information Technology Policy.

It is available for most PC browsers and also for the Android version of Firefox.  It allows users to check what trackers are following them and decide which ones to allow and which ones to  block. Besides, the tool shows the elements that have been effectively blocked in the user interface and also  in a separate window, depending on the configuration. Through click-to-play content replacement, if a user  finds he/she is missing elements on a page, he/she can access a small ghost image informing him/her about  the elements that were blocked from his/her view. The tool has an option to ignore first party trackers (also  known as direct trackers, e.g. the DoubleClick tracker on doubleclick.com).  It is important to mention that if the «GhostRank» option is activated, anonymous information about the  elements encountered and blocked is sent to the Evidon’s servers (the company behind Ghostery) to be sold  to advertising companies. According to Evidon, the tool does not collect any information which could be  used to identify users or target ads specifically at individual users.  Ghostery is an open source tool whose usage is limited by a private license, meaning that users can review  the code but they are not allowed to modify or use it in any other non-authorized way41. The source code is  only available for Firefox42. The tool provides an email address (info@ghostery.com) and a forum43  for user  support. Regarding the documentation, the tool has a FAQ page44.  Quality criteria   Background information: The tool was originally developed by David Cancel45, but in January 2010  Ghostery was acquired by the advertising company Better Advertising, which later on became Evidon.  In April 2014 Evidon and Ghostery became Ghostery Inc.   Version history: In the Firefox store there is a list of versions, with the new functionalities and corrected  bugs of each version, when applicable46.   Transparency of installation and use: The installation process is transparent to the user. Still, just after  the installation, a new tab is opened to configure the tool where the user is asked if he/she wants to  participate in Ghostrank and the button for doing so is highlighted in green (it must be noted that the  «next» button requires to select an option to be enabled). If this tab is closed, the Ghostrank option gets  40 www.ghostery.com  41 addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/ghostery/license/5.4.8.1  42 addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/files/browse/312088/A  43 getsatisfaction.com/ghostery  44 www.ghostery.com/en/faq  45 http://www.davidcancel.com  46 addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/ghostery/versions  www.ghostery.com https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/ghostery/license/5.4.8.1 http://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/files/browse/312088/A http://getsatisfaction.com/ghostery http://www.ghostery.com/en/faq http://www.davidcancel.com/ https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/ghostery/versions  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  51  unchecked and the default configuration is used. The default configuration does not activate the anti-  tracking capabilities of the tool but this is clearly explained to the user in the tool’s tutorial.  It is worth mentioning that the installer opens automatically another tab for the user to participate in a  Ghostery Install Survey (which asks for some personal details, such as the age, gender, or employment  status.) Although it is possible to avoid participation in the survey by closing the tab, the way the  presentation is done (automatically opened tab which directly shows the first question to the survey)  may be confusing and/or misleading for some non-experts users. Moreover, although the installation  does not seem to include any third party software, if the survey is completed the last page suggests the  user to register (for free) in a third party surveying service.   Public reviews: The average rating at Mozilla’s add-ons site is 5 over 5 (1195 reviews), and at Google  Chrome’s add-ons site is also 5 over 5 (7958 reviews). It is included in the Me and My Shadow and Best  Privacy Tools websites. In addition to that, there are several external reviews, most of them positive and  in general without outlining any major problem47. One point that is noted, though, is the Ghostrank  option and the ethical issues surrounding its function.   Privacy by design and default: When it is installed, an assistant with basic configuration options is  executed. In addition to that, there are other advanced configuration options. It is important to mention  that no tracker is blocked by default, so users have to activate that functionality by selecting the  corresponding option (either during the initial configuration phase, or at any moment once the tool is  installed). This can be easily made through the tool’s options page.   Ease of use: The tool is moderately easy to use for non-experts due to its complex configuration options.   User interaction: A quite active forum is available48 where users’ comments are published. In addition,  there is a web form where comments, suggestions and doubts can be sent49.   Other aspects: The tool is available in more than 15 languages and it is multiplatform, being available  for the browsers Opera, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, and for the mobile systems Android  and iOS (in Android users can choose the plugin for Firefox or the Ghostery browser).  Functionality criteria   General functionality: Blocks trackers, cookies, pixels beacons, and social network indicators. Trackers  are classified in five categories (analytics, web beacons, privacy, advertising, and widgets).

However, the company claims that no personal data that could identify the users are  collected.   Flexibility: The tool does allow to define white/black lists. Also, it allows enabling/disabling of different  categories of trackers.   Choice: It is possible to temporarily block and unblock specific elements. In addition to that, by clicking  a button, it is possible to allow an element in the current page, in a way that it is always enabled for that  page even if it is disabled for all the other pages.   On/off: The tool allows to pause the blocking (affecting all tabs).   History (of blocked elements): It is possible to check what has been blocked in each page while it is  opened.   Plugins are available in the Chrome and Firefox official stores, but they are not signed (as on  10/15/2015).  B.2 Disconnect  Disconnect50  is an anti-tracking tool available for Mac (version 10.7 and above), Windows (version 7.0 and  above), Android (version 4.0 and above), and iOS (version 7.1 and above).  It allows first party trackers by  default, and detects when the user’s browser tries to make a connection to anything other than the site  he/she is visiting. By checking and unchecking the corresponding box, it allows to block and unblock trackers  of different categories (Advertising, Analytics, Social Networking, and Content), plus three specific trackers  which are shown separately (Google, Facebook, and Twitter). The tool can be found in a free version (its  source code can be found on GitHub) and a premium (paid) version. Both versions show users who is tracking  them. Besides, it allows to manage white/black lists.  It is not necessary to make a great effort in the configuration process to achieve its total capacity, as the tool  has very intuitive configuration options. In this sense, it is worthwhile to mention the graphic interface for  Chromium-based browsers that, with a glance, permits to see what connections are activated when a web  page is visited and which of them are blocked.  The source code is available at the Firefox store and from GitHub51 (though it does not seem to be maintained  anymore).  The tool offers a forum52 and an email address53 for contacting the developers. Besides, the documentation  includes a FAQ54 and a user manual55.  50 disconnect.me  51 github.com/disconnectme/disconnect  52 github.com/disconnectme/disconnect/issues  53 support@disconnect.me  54 disconnect.me/help#disconnect-private-browsing-browser-extension_faq  55 disconnect.me/disconnect  https://disconnect.me/free/mac https://disconnect.me/free/win https://disconnect.me/mobile/disconnect-mobile/sideload https://itunes.apple.com/app/id935480186 disconnect.me http://github.com/disconnectme/disconnect http://github.com/disconnectme/disconnect/issues mailto:support@disconnect.me http://disconnect.me/help#disconnect-private-browsing-browser-extension_faq http://disconnect.me/disconnect  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  53  Quality criteria   Background information: The team in charge of the tool’s maintenance is well identified56.

The  plugin is signed for Firefox (as on 10/15/2015).  B.3 uBlock origin  uBlock origin61  is a general purpose blocker for Chrome and Firefox designed to work with custom rules and  filters. The default behavior of uBlock origin is to block ads, trackers and malware sites, through the lists  EasyList, Peter Lowe's Adservers, EasyPrivacy, various lists of malware sites, and uBlock origin's own filter  lists. More lists are available to block trackers, analytics, and other elements.  The tool can load and enforce filters used by other popular adblockers such as AdBlock Plus or Disconnect.  The control interface is minimal and very intuitive. It is important to mention the ability for creating  «cosmetic» filters, that is filters used to delete something on a page which will not be displayed in  subsequent visits, as well as the ability to pause the activity in a single page or in all of them.  The source code is available at GitHub and support is provided through a forum62. With regards to the  documentation, it has a wiki63. Also a user manual is available64.  Quality criteria   Background information: Raymond Hill (the responsible for uBlock origin and the original developer  behind uBlock) transferred ownership of the original uBlock project in 2015. After that, Hill forked uBlock  into uBlock origin, a personal fork for which he's been releasing builds and providing support65.   Version history: In the Firefox store there is a list of versions, with the new functionalities and corrected  bugs of each version, when applicable66.

B.6 AdBlockPlus  AdBlockPlus92 blocks ads by default, though it is initially configured to allow what they call «non intrusive  advertising» (i.e. advertising from companies which have signed the acceptable ads manifesto with  AdBlockPlus). It is necessary to configure the tool in order to eliminate these acceptable ads. In addition to  that, it can be configured to block trackers, social buttons, and malware domains. There is quite a lot of  documentation accesible to users (first steps, how-to-use tutorials, how to allow acceptable advertisements,  FAQ, and an advanced document about how to create filters, preferences, interfaces, etc.). The source code  is available for both Firefox and Chrome93. The available support channels are a forum94, and an email  address95. The documentation is clear and it consists of a FAQ96 and additional information97.  Quality criteria   Background information: This tool is a spin-off of the former tool Adblock. The company which develops  it is eyeo, and the developing team, led by Wladimir Palant, is well defined98.   Version history: In the Firefox store there is a list of new versions, with the new functionalities and  corrected bugs of each version, when applicable99. At the Adblock Plus site, it is also possible to find  records of changes made in files of successive versions of Adblock Plus (for both Firefox and Chrome).   Transparency of installation and use: The installation process is transparent, and the tool offers its basic  functionality (ad blocking) by default as soon as it is installed. Still, advertisements from the acceptable  ads list will not be blocked and this is not clearly indicated to the users.  The tool does not seem to include third party software or modify other applications or user  configurations.

Functionality criteria   General functionality: The tool is primarily an ad blocker and not an anti-tracking tool. It blocks ads by  default. It is initially configured to allow acceptable ads list (this can be changed in the options menu). It  can also be configured to block trackers, social buttons, and malware domains.   Processing of personal data: According to the available information, no personal data is processed.   Flexibility: The tool allows to define white/black lists (only in Chrome), and to edit filters.   Choice: It is possible to temporarily block specific elements.   On/off: The tool allows to pause the blocking process. In the case of Firefox the options are: only for  current page, for the full domain (site), or globally (for all tabs). In the case of Chrome, the option is to  enable or disable blocking for the full domain.   History (of blocked elements): It is possible to check what has been blocked, but only in Firefox. In  Chrome it is only possible to check the number of blocked elements.   The plugin is available in the official Firefox store, but it is not signed (as on 10/15/2015).  100 Some example reviews can be found in: www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2476293,00.asp,  ajr.org/2015/05/08/adblock-plus-test, techcrunch.com/2013/10/07/adblock-plus-whitelist-acceptable-ads-numbers,  arstechnica.com/business/2015/02/over-300-businesses-now-whitelisted-on-adblock-plus-10-pay-to-play  101 adblockplus.org/forum  102 adblockplus.org/blog  http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2476293,00.asp http://ajr.org/2015/05/08/adblock-plus-test http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/07/adblock-plus-whitelist-acceptable-ads-numbers http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/02/over-300-businesses-now-whitelisted-on-adblock-plus-10-pay-to-play file:///C:/TEXTOS/TIC/CONTRATOS/ENISA%20-%20PRIVACY%20TOOLS%20-%20Febrero%202015/Ejecución/Task-3/adblockplus.org/forum/ file:///C:/TEXTOS/TIC/CONTRATOS/ENISA%20-%20PRIVACY%20TOOLS%20-%20Febrero%202015/Ejecución/Task-3/adblockplus.org/blog  Online privacy tools for the general public  Final  |  1.0  |  Public  |  DECEMBER 2015  61  ENISA  European Union Agency for Network  and Information Security  Science and Technology Park of Crete (ITE)  Vassilika Vouton, 700 13, Heraklion, Greece  Athens Office  1 Vass.

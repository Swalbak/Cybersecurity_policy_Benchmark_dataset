The  Computer Security Division (CSD), a component of the Information Technology Laboratory at the National Institute  of Standards and Technology (NIST) is responsible for developing standards, guidelines, tests, and metrics for the  protection of non-national security federal information and communication infrastructure. These standards,  guidelines, tests, and metrics are also important resources for the private sector.  In 2012, CSD aligned its resources to enable greater development and application of practical, innovative  security technologies and methodologies, and to enhance our ability to address current and future computer and  information security challenges in support of critical national and international priorities.  CSD extended its research and development agenda for high-quality, cost-effective security and privacy  mechanisms to foster improved information security across the federal government and the global information  security community. In 2012, NIST concluded the five-year SHA-3 Cryptographic Hash Algorithm Competition with  the selection of KECCAK for standardization and worldwide adoption. The selection of this cryptographic hash  algorithm, an indispensable component for the information and communication systems that support commerce  in the modern era, confirmed NIST’s well-respected and trusted technical authority in this field.  A strong partnership with industry is vital to the success of our technical programs. In 2012, CSD engaged  the international standards community on emerging technical standards to advance continuous monitoring  capabilities and to further interoperability with commercially available tools. We also devised new security  testing methodologies for smart phone software app functionality. Our research in hardware-enabled security  continued with the development of guidelines on mechanisms that measure and report the security state of BIOS.  Our research also continued to expand into the cybersecurity aspects of cyber-physical and embedded systems,  and the mechanisms for enabling and protecting public safety communications.  Our ability to interact with the broad federal community continues to be critical to our success. This interaction  helps to ensure that our research is consistent with national objectives related to or impacted by information  security. This interaction is most prominent in our strengthened collaborations with the Department of Defense,  the Intelligence Community, and the Committee on National Security Systems to establish a common foundation  for information security across the federal government. The release of Special Publication 800-30, Guide for  Conducting Risk Assessments, developed by the Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative Interagency Working  Group, is not only leading to more consistent ways to assess risks, but is also enabling more effective risk  management and facilitating greater sharing of information across organizational boundaries.  For many years, the Computer Security Division (CSD), in collaboration with our global partners from government,  industry, and academia, has made great contributions to help secure the nation’s critical information and  infrastructure. We look forward to furthering these relationships in 2013 as we lead in  examining the diverse cybersecurity aspects of a broad set of areas, including supply  chain risk management; security analytics; cloud, mobile, and privacy-enhancing  technologies; hardware-enabled security; and cyber-physical and embedded systems.

Overview:  The Cryptographic Technology Group’s (CTG) work  in cryptographic mechanisms addresses topics such  as hash algorithms, symmetric and asymmetric  cryptographic techniques, key management,  authentication, and random number generation.  Strong cryptography is used to improve the security  of information systems and the information they  process. Users then take advantage of the availability  of secure applications in the marketplace made  possible by the appropriate use of standardized, high- quality cryptography.  CTG continued its work in a number of cryptographic  areas, including:  �� Specifying and using cryptographic algorithms;  �� Revising Federal Information Processing  Standard (FIPS) 140-2, Security Requirements  for Cryptographic Modules;  �� Developing hardware roots of trust to support  reliable device authentication and establish  new bases for system measurement;  �� Supporting the Smart Grid Interoperability  Panel by assessing the security of  cryptographic methods used in the security  protocols for the communication and  management networks used by public utility  companies, and in developing security  guidelines for the Smart Grid;  �� Advising the FIPS 140-2 Validation Program  in the validation of cryptographic algorithms  and cryptographic modules; and  �� Supporting NIST’s Personal Identity  Verification (PIV) project that was initiated  in response to the Homeland Security  Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12).  A major highlight of this year is the completion of the  SHA-3 Cryptographic Hash Algorithm Competition and  the selection of KECCAK as the SHA-3 algorithm.  CTG continued to make an impact in the field of  cryptography, both within and outside the federal  government, by collaborating with national and  international agencies, academic and research  organizations, and standards bodies to develop  interoperable security standards and guidelines.  Federal agency collaborators include the National  Security Agency (NSA), the National Telecommunications  and Information Administration (NTIA), the General  Services Administration (GSA), the Election Assistance  Commission (EAC) and the Federal Voting Assistance  Program (FVAP). International agencies include the  Communications Security Establishment of Canada,  and Australia’s Defense Signals Agency and Centrelink.

Group Manager:  Mr. William (Tim) Polk  william.polk@nist.gov  (301) 975-3348  Introduction to Computer Security Division’s 5 Groups  4  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  Security Components and Mechanisms  Group  Mission Statement:  Research, develop, and standardize foundational  security mechanisms, protocols, and services.  Overview:  The Security Components and Mechanisms Group’s  (SCMG) security research focuses on the development  and management of foundational building-block  security mechanisms and techniques that can be  integrated into a wide variety of mission-critical  U.S. information systems. The group’s work spans a  spectrum from near-term hardening and improvement  to the design and analysis of next-generation, leap- ahead security capabilities. Computer security  depends fundamentally on the level of trust that can  be established for computer software and systems.  This work, therefore, focuses strongly on assurance- building activities ranging from the analysis of software  configuration settings to advanced trust architectures  to testing tools that surface flaws in software  modules. Due to the often manual and costly nature  of assurance building using current techniques, this  work focuses strongly on increasing the applicability  and effectiveness of automated techniques wherever  feasible. SCMG conducts research collaboratively with  government, industry, and academia. The outputs of  this research consist of prototype systems, software  tools, demonstrations, NIST Special Publications and  NIST Interagency Reports, conference papers, and  journal papers.  SCMG works on a variety of topics, such as specifications  for the automated exchange of security information  between systems, computer security incident handling  guidelines, formulation of high-assurance software  configuration settings, hardware roots of trust for  mobile devices, combinatorial testing techniques,  conformity assessment of software implementing  biometric standards, and adoption of Internet Protocol  Version 6 and Internet Protocol security extensions.  SCMG collaborates extensively with government,  academia, and the private sector. In the last year,  collaborations have included the University of Texas  Arlington, University of North Texas, University of  Maryland-Baltimore County (UMBC), North Carolina  State University, Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab  (APL), National Aeronautics and Space Administration  (NASA), U.S. Air Force T&E, Massachusetts Institute of  Technology (MIT) Lincoln Labs, the Defense Advanced  Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and Carnegie  Mellon University (CMU).  Example successes from this work include a second  revision of the NIST Special Publication 800-61,  Computer Security Incident Handling Guide, the  Advanced Combinatorial Testing System (ACTS)  software and documentation, the NIST BioCTS 2012  conformance testing tool and test assertions, a design  for continuous monitoring systems, and a continuous  monitoring prototype system.  Group Manager:  Mr. Mark (Lee) Badger  mark.badger@nist.gov  (301) 975-3176  Secure Systems and Applications Group  Mission Statement:  Integrate and apply security technologies, standards,  and guidelines for computing platforms and information  systems.  Overview:  The Secure Systems and Applications Group’s (SSAG)  security research focuses on identifying emerging and  high-priority technologies, and on developing security  solutions that will have a high impact on the U.S.  critical information infrastructure. The group conducts  research and development on behalf of government  and industry from the earliest stages of technology  development through proof-of-concept, reference and  prototype implementations, and demonstrations. SSAG  works to transfer new technologies to industry, produce  new standards and guidance for federal agencies and  industry, and develop tests, test methodologies, and  assurance methods.  5  Some of the many topics the group investigates  include mobile device security, cloud computing  and virtualization, identity management, access  control and authorization management, and software  assurance. This research helps to meet federal  information security requirements that may not be fully  addressed by existing technology. SSAG collaborates  extensively with government, academia, and private  sector entities, including FY2012 collaborations with  the National Security Agency (NSA), the Department  of Defense (DoD), the Defense Advanced Research  Projects Agency (DARPA), the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS), the White House Communications  Agency (WHCA), George Mason University, North  Carolina State University, Microsoft Corporation, VM  Ware, Symantec, Mobile System 7, One Enterprise  Consulting Group, and MITRE.  Example successes from this work include tools  for access control policy testing; new concepts in  access control and policy enforcement; methods for  achieving comprehensive policy enforcement and  data interoperability across enterprise data services;  test methods for mobile device (smart phone)  application security; validation of cryptography for  smart phones, and several government wide technical  exchange meetings on mobile device security. For the  federal government’s cloud computing initiatives,  SSAG led the NIST Security Working Group’s task of  developing the NIST Cloud Computing - Security  Reference Architecture working document, and  contributed to the development of the white paper  “Challenging Security Requirements for the USG  Cloud Computing Adoption.” To improve access to new  technologies, SSAG chaired, edited, and participated  in the development of a wide variety of national and  international security standards.  Group Manager:  Mr. David Ferraiolo  david.ferraiolo@nist.gov  (301) 975-3046  Security Outreach and Integration Group  Mission Statement:  Develop, integrate, and promote the mission- specific application of information security standards,  guidelines, best practices, and technologies.  Overview:  The U.S. economy, citizens, and government rely  on information technology. Protecting information  technology, including its information and the  information infrastructure, is critical for the nation.  As part of the Computer Security Division, the Security  Outreach and Integration Group (SOIG) leverages its  broad cybersecurity and risk management expertise to  develop, integrate, and promote security standards,  guidelines, tools, technologies, methodologies, tests,  and measurements to address critical cybersecurity  needs in many areas of national and international  importance.  Major initiatives in this area include the development  of standards, guidelines, tools, technologies, and  methodologies to enable the security and risk  management of the Information and Communications  Technologies (ICT) supply chain; Smart Grid; Electronic  Voting; Cyber Physical and Industrial Control Systems;  Health Information Technology; National Public Safety  Broadband Network, and the Federal Information  Security Management Act (FISMA) implementation  program. The group also serves as lead for the National  Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE), and  provides extended outreach initiatives to stakeholders  across federal, state, and local governments, industry,  academia, small businesses, and the public.  Key to the group’s success is the ability to interact  with a broad constituency – government, industry,  academia, and the public – in order to ensure that  SOIG’s program is consistent with national objectives  related to or impacted by information security.  Through collaboration, cooperation, and open and  transparent public engagement, SOIG works to address  these critical cybersecurity challenges, enable greater  U.S. industrial competitiveness, and facilitate the  practical implementation of scalable and sustainable  information security standards and practices.  Group Manager:  Mr. Kevin Stine  kevin.stine@nist.gov  (301) 975-4483  Introduction to Computer Security Division’s 5 Groups  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  Security Testing, Validation, and  Measurement Group  Mission Statement:  Advance information security testing, measurement  science, and conformance.  Overview:  Federal agencies, industry, and the public rely on  cryptography for the protection of information and  communications used in electronic commerce, critical  infrastructure, and other application areas. At the  core of all products offering cryptographic services  is the cryptographic module. Cryptographic modules,  which contain cryptographic algorithms, are used in  products and systems to provide security services  such as confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.  Although cryptography is used to provide security,  weaknesses such as poor design or weak algorithms can  render a product insecure and place highly sensitive  information at risk. When protecting their sensitive  data, federal government agencies require a minimum  level of assurance that cryptographic products meet  their security requirements. Also, federal agencies are  required to use only tested and validated cryptographic  modules. Adequate testing and validation of the  cryptographic module and its underlying cryptographic  algorithms against established standards is essential to  provide security assurance.  The group’s testing-focused activities include  validating cryptographic algorithm implementations,  cryptographic modules, and Security Content  Automation Protocol (SCAP)-compliant products;  developing test suites and test methods; providing  implementation guidance and technical support to  industry forums; and conducting education, training,  and outreach programs.  All of the Security Testing, Validation, and  Measurement Group’s validation programs work  together with independent Cryptographic and Security  Testing laboratories that are accredited by the NIST  National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program  (NVLAP). Based on the independent laboratory test  report and test evidence, the Validation Program  then validates the implementation under test. The  validations awarded to vendor implementations are  publicly posted on the NIST website.  Group Manager:  Mr. Michael Cooper  michael.cooper@nist.gov  (301) 975-8077  66  mailto:michael.cooper@nist.gov  The CSD Implements FISMA of 2002The Computer Security Division Implements the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002  The E-Government Act, Public Law 107-347, passed by  the 107th Congress and signed into law by the President in  December 2002, recognized the importance of information  security to the economic and national security interests  of the United States. Title III of the E-Government Act,  entitled the Federal Information Security Management  Act (FISMA) of 2002, included duties and responsibilities  for the National Institute of Standards and Technology,  Information Technology Laboratory, Computer Security  Division (CSD). In 2012, CSD addressed its assignments  through the following activities:  ��Issued one final and two draft Federal Information  Processing Standards (FIPS) that specify hash  algorithms used to generate message digests,  algorithms used to generate digital signatures,  and technical requirements for a common  identification standard for federal employees  and contractors;  ��Issued 28 draft and final NIST Special Publications  (SPs) that provide management, operational,  and technical security guidelines in areas such  as BIOS management and measurement, key  management and derivation, media sanitization,  electronic authentication, security automation,  Bluetooth and wireless protocols, incident  handling and intrusion detection, malware,  cloud computing, public key infrastructure,  and risk assessments. In addition, 12 draft and  final NIST Interagency Reports were issued on  a variety of topics including supply chain risk  management, personal identity verification,  access control, security automation and  continuous monitoring, and the Smart Grid  Advanced Metering Infrastructure;  ��Produced guidelines concerning the handling of  information security incidents to help agencies  analyze incident-related data and determine  the appropriate response to each incident;  ��Continued the successful collaboration with the  Office of the Director of National Intelligence,  the Committee on National Security Systems,  and the Department of Defense to establish a  common foundation for information security  across the federal government, including a  structured, yet flexible approach for managing  information security risk across an organization.  In 2012, this collaboration produced foundational  guidelines for conducting risk assessments, and  updated guidelines for selecting and specifying  security controls for federal information systems  and organizations;  ��Provided assistance to agencies and the  private sector: conducted ongoing, substantial  reimbursable and non-reimbursable assistance  to the government and private sector, including  many outreach efforts through the Federal  Information Systems Security Educators’  Association (FISSEA), the Federal Computer  Security Program Managers’ Forum, and the  Small Business Information Security Corner;  ��Reviewed security policies and technologies  from the private sector and national security  systems for potential federal agency use:  hosted a repository of federal agency security  practices, public/private security practices,  and security configuration checklists for IT  products. Continued to lead, in conjunction with  the Government of Canada’s Communications  Security Establishment, the Cryptographic  Module Validation Program (CMVP). The Common  Criteria Evaluation and Validation Scheme  (CCEVS) and CMVP facilitate security testing of  IT products usable by the federal government;  ��Solicited recommendations of the Information  Security and Privacy Advisory Board (ISPAB)  on draft standards and guidelines, and on  information security and privacy issues;  ��Conducted workshops, awareness briefings,  and outreach to CSD customers to ensure  comprehension of standards and guidelines, to  share ongoing and planned activities, and to aid  in scoping guidelines in a collaborative, open,  and transparent manner. CSD also held workshops  on diverse information security and technology  topics including security automation, identity  management, information and communications  technologies supply chain risk management,  information security awareness and training,  cybersecurity of cyber physical systems,  technical aspects of botnets, health information  security, and mobile computing; and  ��Produced an annual report as a NIST Special  Publication (SP). The 2003-2011 Annual Reports  are available on the Computer Security Resource  Center (CSRC) at http://csrc.nist.gov.  The Computer Security Division Implements FISMA of 2002  77  http://csrc.nist.gov  8  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  CSD Work in National and International  Standards  CSD’s Part in National and International  ISO Security Standards Processes  Figure 1 (below) shows the many national and  international standards-developing organizations  (SDOs) involved in cybersecurity standardization.  CSD participates in many cybersecurity standards  activities in many of these organizations, either in  leadership positions or as editors and contributors.  Many of CSD’s publications have been the basis for  both national and international standards projects.  This section discusses CSD standards activities  in conjunction with InterNational Committee for  Information Technology Standards (INCITS) Technical  Committee Cyber Security (CS) 1, where Dan Benigni  serves as Chair and U.S. Head of Delegation to SC 27.  The International Organization for  Standardization  The International Organization for Standardization  (ISO) is a network of the national standards  institutes of 148 countries, with the representation  of one member per country. The scope of ISO covers  standardization in all fields except electrical and  electronic engineering standards, which are the  responsibility of the International Electrotechnical  Commission (IEC).  The IEC prepares and publishes international  standards for all electrical, electronic, and related  technologies, including electronics, magnetics and  electromagnetics, electroacoustics, multimedia,  telecommunication, and energy production and  distribution, as well as associated general disciplines  such as terminology and symbols, electromagnetic  compatibility, measurement and performance,  dependability, design and development, safety, and  the environment.  CSD’s Programs/Projects for FY2012CSD’s Programs/Projects for FY2012  Figure 1: SDOs involved in Cybersecurity  9  Joint Technical Committee 1 (JTC 1) was formed  by ISO and IEC to be responsible for international  standardization in the field of Information Technology.  It develops, maintains, promotes, and facilitates  IT standards required by global markets, meeting  business and user requirements concerning—  ��Design and development of IT systems and  tools;  ��Performance and quality of IT products and  systems;  ��Security of IT systems and information;  ��Portability of application programs;  ��Interoperability of IT products and systems;  ��Unified tools and environments;  ��Harmonized IT vocabulary; and  ��User-friendly and ergonomically designed  user interfaces.  JTC 1 consists of a number of subcommittees (SCs)  and working groups that address specific technologies.  SCs that produce standards relating to IT security  include:  ��SC 06 - Telecommunications and Information  Exchange Between Systems;  ��SC 17 - Cards and Personal Identification;  ��SC 27 - IT Security Techniques; and  ��SC 37 – Biometrics (Fernando Podio of NIST  serves as Chair).  JTC1 also has—  ��Technical Committee 68 – Financial Services;  ��SC 2 - Operations and Procedures including  Security;  ��SC 4 – Securities;  ��SC 6 - Financial Transaction Cards, Related  Media and Operations; and  ��SC 7 – Software and Systems Engineering.  The American National Standards  Institute  The American National Standards Institute (ANSI)  is a private, nonprofit organization (501(c)(3)) that  administers and coordinates the U.S. voluntary  standardization and conformity assessment system.  ANSI facilitates the development of American National  Standards (ANSs) by accrediting the procedures of  standards-developing organizations (SDOs). The  InterNational Committee for Information Technology  Standards (INCITS) is accredited by ANSI.  ANSI promotes the use of U.S. standards  internationally, advocates U.S. policy and technical  positions in international and regional standards  organizations, and encourages the adoption of  international standards as national standards where  they meet the needs of the user community. ANSI is  the sole U.S. representative and dues-paying member  of the two major non-treaty international standards  organizations, ISO and, via the United States National  Committee (USNC), the IEC.  INCITS serves as the ANSI Technical Advisory Group  (TAG) for ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1. INCITS  is sponsored by the Information Technology Industry  (ITI) Council, a trade association representing the  leading U.S. providers of information technology  products and services. INCITS currently has more than  975 published standards.  INCITS is organized into Technical Committees that  focus on the creation of standards for different  technology areas. Technical committees that focus  on IT security and IT security-related technologies, or  that may require separate security standards include:  ��B10 – Identification Cards and Related  Devices (Sal Francomacaro, Chair Task  Group B10.12, Integrated Circuit Cards with  Contacts);  ��CS1 – Cyber Security (Dan Benigni, Chair  and Richard Kissel, NIST Principal voting  member);  ��E22 – Item Authentication;  ��M1 – Biometrics (Fernando Podio, Chair);  ��T3 – Open Distributed Processing (ODP);  ��T6 – Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)  Technology;  ��CGIT1 – Corporate Governance of IT (Richard  Kissel, NIST Principal voting member and  International Representative); and  ��DAPS38 – Distributed Application Platforms  and Services.  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  10  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  As a technical committee of INCITS, CS1 develops  United States, national, ANSI-accredited standards in  the area of cybersecurity. Its scope encompasses—  ��Management of information security and  systems;  ��Management of third-party information  security service providers;  ��Intrusion detection;  ��Network security;  ��Cloud computing security;  ��Supply chain risk management;  ��Incident handling;  ��IT security evaluation and assurance;  ��Security assessment of operational systems;  ��Security requirements for cryptographic  modules;  ��Protection profiles;  ��Role-based access control;  ��Security checklists;  ��Security metrics;  ��Cryptographic and non-cryptographic  techniques and mechanisms including  confidentiality, entity authentication,  non-repudiation, key management, data  integrity, message authentication, hash  functions, and digital signatures;  ��Future service and applications standards  supporting the implementation of control  objectives and controls as defined in ISO  27001, in the areas of business continuity,  and outsourcing;  ��Identity management, including identity  management framework, role-based access  control, and single sign-on; and  ��Privacy technologies, including privacy  framework, privacy reference architecture,  privacy infrastructure, anonymity and  credentials, and specific privacy-enhancing  technologies.  The scope of CS1 explicitly excludes the areas of  work on cybersecurity standardization presently  under way in INCITS B10, M1, T3, T10, and T11, as  well as other standard groups, such as the Alliance  for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS), the  Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.  (IEEE), the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF),  the Travel Industry Association of America (TIAA), and  Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X9. The CS1  scope of work includes standardization in most of the  same cybersecurity areas as are covered in the NIST  CSD.  As the U.S. TAG to ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27, CS1 contributes  to the SC 27 program of work on IT Security Techniques  in terms of comments and contributions on SC 27  standards projects; votes on SC 27 standards documents  at various stages of development; and nominates U.S.  experts to work on various SC 27 projects as editors,  coeditors, or in other SC 27 leadership positions.  Currently a number of CS1 members are serving as SC  27 document editors or coeditors on various standards  projects, including CSD staff Randy Easter and Richard  Kissel.  All input from CS1 is processed through INCITS to ANSI,  then to SC 27. It is also a conduit for getting U.S. - based  new work item proposals and U.S.-developed national  standards into the international SC 27 standards  development process. In its international efforts, CS1  responded to all calls for U.S. contributions and/or  voting positions on all international security standards  projects in ISO/IEC JTC1 SC 27 in a consistent, efficient,  and timely manner.  NIST contributes to many of CS1’s national and  international IT security standards efforts through its  membership on CS1, where Dan Benigni serves as the  nonvoting chair and Richard Kissel as the NIST Principal  voting member. Internationally, there are over 100  published standards, and almost all have been adopted  as U.S. national standards. There are more than 100  current international standards projects.  CSD’s Role in Cybersecurity Standardization  CSD’s cybersecurity research also plays a direct role  in the Cybersecurity Standardization efforts of CS1 at  the national level. During FY2012:  ��Through the CS1 Ad hoc Group on Role-Based  Access Control (RBAC), ANSI has published  three national standards:  11  �◦ “Requirements for the Implementation  and Interoperability of Role Based Access  Control”;  �◦ “Revision of INCITS 359 – 2004, Role Based  Access Control (RBAC)”; and  �◦ “Information technology -- Role Based Access  Control – Policy Enhanced” and Project 2214- D.  NIST originally authored RBAC, and Rick Kuhn is the  NIST lead in the Ad hoc group.  �� The NIST Policy Machine research and  development has resulted in three ongoing  national standards projects in CS1 in the  early stages of development. They include:  �◦ “Next Generation Access Control  -Implementation Requirements, Protocols  and API Definitions (NGAC-IRPADS).” Its  assigned project number is 2193-D;  �◦ Just published “Next Generation Access  Control –Functional Architecture (NGAC- FA).” Its assigned project number is 2194-D;  David Ferraiolo of NIST is editor; and  �◦ “Next Generation Access Control – Generic  Operations & Abstract Data Structures  (NGAC-GOADS).” Its assigned project  number is 2195-D, and Serban Gavrila of  NIST is editor.  Within CS1, liaisons are maintained with nearly 20  organizations.

CSD actively participates in InterNational Committee  for Information Technology Standards (INCITS) B10  committee which is focused on interoperability of  Identification Cards and Related Devices. CSD staff  serves as Chair and Vice Chair of the B10.12 committee  which develops interoperable standards for Integrated  Circuit Cards with Contacts. CSD staff also serves as  the U.S. Head of delegation to Working Group 4 and  Working Group 11 of the International Organization  for Standardization / International Electrotechnical  Commission (ISO/IEC) Joint Technical Committee (JTC)  1 Subcommittee 17.  In addition to chairing the B10.12 committee,  CSD provides technical and editorial support in the  development of national and international standards.  Specifically, CSD staff serves as the technical editor  of ANSI 504-1, Generic Identity Command Set (GICS).  GICS provides for Personal Identity Verification (PIV),  PIV-I (PIV-Interoperable) and Common Access Card  (CAC) card applications (but not limited to these  applications) to be built from a single platform.  GICS defines an open platform where identity  applications can be instantiated, deployed, and used  in an interoperable way between the credential  issuers and credential users. CSD staff also provides  significant input to standards of major interest to  U.S. government agencies and U.S. markets. CSD  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  12  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  influences the development and revision of ISO/IEC  7816 (Identification Cards, Integrated Circuit Cards),  ISO/IEC 24727 (Identification Cards, Integrated Circuit  Card Programming Interfaces), and ISO/IEC 24787  (Biometrics ‘Match On Card’ Comparison).  During FY2012, many of these standards reached  important milestones: ANSI 504 was published; ISO/IEC  24727 amendments to part 2, 3, and 4 were published;  ISO/IEC 7816 part 4 was updated to add significant  functionality: several modifications requested by the  U.S. delegation are now part of this standard. CSD  provides contributions and feedback on many other  INCITS B10 standards projects that support identity  management.  CSD’s investment in this section is motivated by  the “new technical ideas” that are supported by  these standards. For example, ANSI 504 (GICS) is an  ID platform that leverages the existing FIPS 201 (PIV)  infrastructure to offer support to a larger number  of initiatives for both government agencies and  enterprises. In particular, it aims to support initiatives  like the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in  Cyberspace (NSTIC). ISO/IEC 24727 aims to create  an interoperability framework to increase resilience  and scalability of identity management solutions  and provide interoperability domestically and  internationally.  Contact:  Mr. Salvatore Francomacaro  (301) 975-6414  salvatore.francomacaro@nist.gov  Federal Information Security Management  Act (FISMA) Implementation Project  The FISMA Implementation Project focuses on:  �� Developing a comprehensive series of  standards and guidelines to help federal  agencies build strong cybersecurity  programs, defend against increasingly  sophisticated cyber attacks, and demonstrate  compliance to security requirements set  forth in legislation, Executive Orders,  Homeland Security Directives, and Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) polices;  �� Building common understanding and  reference guides for organizations applying  the NIST suite of standards and guidelines  that support the NIST Risk Management  Framework (RMF);  �� Developing minimum criteria and guidelines  for recognizing security assessment  organization provider’s as capable of  assessing information systems consistent  with NIST standards and guidelines  supporting the RMF; and  �� Conducting FISMA outreach to public and  private sector organizations.  During 2011-2012, CSD strengthened its collaboration  with the Department of Defense, the Intelligence  Community, and the Committee on National Security  Systems, in partnership with the Joint Task Force  Transformation Initiative, which continues to  develop key cybersecurity guidelines for protecting  federal information and information systems for the  Unified Information Security Framework. Previously,  the Joint Task Force developed common security  guidance in the critical areas of security controls  for information systems and organizations, security  assessment procedures to demonstrate security  control effectiveness, security authorizations for risk  acceptance decisions, and continuous monitoring  activities to ensure that decision makers receive  the most up-to-date information on the security  state of their information systems. In addition, CSD  worked with the General Services Administration’s  (GSAs), Federal Risk and Authorization Management  Program to identify security assessment requirements,  1  and prototype a process for approving Third-Party  Assessment Organizations (3PAOs) that demonstrate  capability in assessing Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)  information systems for conformance to NIST standards  and guidelines.  In FY2012,  initiatives:  CSD worked on the following three  (i) Risk Management and Risk Assessment  Guidelines: Developed a comprehensive  risk assessment guideline examining the  relationships among key risk factors including  threats, vulnerabilities, impact, and likelihood.  NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-30, Revision  1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments, is  the fifth in the series of risk management and  information security guidelines being developed  by the Joint Task Force. This revision changes the  focus of SP 800-30, originally published as a risk  management guideline, to focus exclusively on  conducting risk assessments. The risk assessment  guidance in SP 800-30 has been significantly  expanded to include more in-depth information  on a wide variety of risk factors essential to  determining information security risk (e.g.,  threat sources and events, vulnerabilities and  predisposing conditions, impact, and likelihood  of threat occurrence). A three-step process is  described including key activities to prepare  for risk assessments, activities to successfully  conduct risk assessments, and approaches to  maintain the currency of assessment results.  In addition to providing a comprehensive  process for assessing information security  risk, this publication also describes how to  apply the process at the three tiers in the risk  management hierarchy—the organization level,  the mission/business process level, and the  information system level. To facilitate ease  of use for individuals or groups conducting  risk assessments within organizations, this  publication also provides a set of exemplary  templates, tables, and assessment scales for  common risk factors. The templates, tables, and  assessment scales give maximum flexibility in  designing risk assessments based on the express  GENERIC RISK MODEL WITH KEY RISK FACTORS  producing  initiates exploits causing  Threat  Source  Threat  Predisposing  Conditions  Event Vulnerability  with Risk  as a combination of  Impact and Likelihood  with Severity  In the context of  Inputs from Risk Framing Step  (Risk Management Strategy or Approach)  Influencing and Potentially Modifying  Key Risk Factors  with  Characteristics  (e.g., Capability, Intent, and  Targeting for Adversarial Threats)  with  Sequence  of actions, activities,  or scenarios  with  Likelihood  of Initiation  with  Likelihood  of Success  with  Degree  with  Pervasiveness  with  Effectiveness  Security Controls  Planned / Implemented  ORGANIZATIONAL RISK  To organizational operations (mission, functions,  image, reputation), organizational assets,  individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.

The Figure 2 on  previous page illustrates a generic risk model  with key risk factors.  (ii)  Criteria and Guidelines for Recognizing  Security Assessment Provider Organizations:  CSD developed proficiency tests and capability  demonstration requirements for evaluating the  capability of security assessment organizations  to conduct security assessments of information  systems security controls for compliance to  NIST standards and guidelines. The technical  capability requirements were derived from  draft NIST Interagency Report (NISTIR) 7328,  Security Assessment Provider Requirements and  Customer Responsibilities: Building a Security  Assessment Credentialing Program for Federal  Information Systems.  (iii) FISMA Outreach Activity to Public and  Private Sector Organizations: CSD conducted  cybersecurity outreach briefings and provided  support to state and local governments as  well as private sector organizations on topics  of interest, such as effective implementation  of the NIST Risk Management Framework. In  addition, CSD conducted outreach activities with  academic institutions, providing information on  NIST’s security standards and guidelines and  exploring new areas of cybersecurity research  and development.  In FY2012, CSD completed the following activities:  ��Developed NIST SP 800-30, Revision 1, Guide  for Conducting Risk Assessments;  ��Developed draft SP 800-53, Revision 4,  Recommended Security Controls for Federal  Information Systems and Organizations;  ��Released example security assessment cases  for  assessment procedures in SP 800-53A,  Revision 1, Guide for Security Assessment  of Federal Information Systems and  Organizations: Building Effective Security  Assessment Plans; and  ��Collaborated with the ITL Software and  Systems Division and the NIST Standards  Coordination Office using the International  Standard ISO/IEC 17020:2008 General  criteria for the operation of various types of  bodies performing inspections, in support of  GSA in establishing a process for qualifying  Third Party Assessment Organizations  (3PAOs) to conduct security assessments of  Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) information  systems consistent with GSA requirements  based on NIST standards and guidelines.  In FY2013, CSD intends to:  ��Finalize SP 800-53, Revision 4, Recommended  Security Controls for Federal Information  Systems and Organizations;  ��Develop SP 800-53A, Revision 2, Guide for  Assessing the Security and Privacy Controls  in Federal Information Systems and  Organizations;  ��Develop draft SP 800-18, Revision 2, Guide  for Developing Security Plans for Federal  Information Systems and Organizations;  ��Develop an information system security and  engineering guideline; and  ��Expand cybersecurity outreach to  include additional state, local, and tribal  governments as well as private sector  organizations and academic institutions.  Additionally, the outreach program will  continue to support federal agencies in  effective implementation of the NIST Risk  Management Framework.  http://csrc.nist.gov/sec-cert  Contacts:  Dr. Ron Ross Ms. Pat Toth  (301) 975-5390 (301) 975-5140  ron.ross@nist.gov patricia.toth@nist.gov  Mr. Arnold Johnson Ms. Kelley Dempsey  (301) 975-3247 (301) 975-2827  arnold.johnson@nist.gov kelley.dempsey@nist.gov  Ms. Peggy Himes  (301) 975-2489  peggy.himes@nist.gov  mailto:peggy.himes%40nist.gov?subject= mailto:kelley.dempsey@nist.gov mailto:arnold.johnson@nist.gov mailto:patricia.toth@nist.gov mailto:ron.ross@nist.gov http://csrc.nist.gov/sec-cert  15  Biometric Standards and Associated  Conformity Assessment Testing Tools  CSD staff responds to government, industry, and  market requirements for open systems standards by:  �� Accelerating development of formal  biometric standards;  �� Providing effective leadership and technical  participation in the development of these  standards;  �� Developing Conformance Test Architectures  and Test Suites designed to test  implementations of biometric standards;  �� Supporting harmonization of biometric,  tokens, and security standards;  �� Promoting biometric standards adoption;  and  �� Promoting conformity assessment efforts.  CSD continues to work in close partnership with  government agencies, industry, and academic  institutions to achieve the project goals delineated  above. CSD actively participates in a number  of biometric standards development projects,  contributes to the development of biometric  standards, and leads national and international  biometric standards bodies. Nationally, CSD’s staff  leads InterNational Committee for Information  Technology Standards (INCITS) Technical Committee  1 (M1) – Biometrics; international efforts include Joint  Technical Committee 1 (JTC 1) of the International  Standards Organization (ISO) and the International  Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Subcommittee  SC 37 - Biometrics - JTC 1/SC 37. CSD plans to continue  this work in FY2013.  During FY2012, CSD developed and publicly released  one advanced Conformance Test Architecture (CTA)  designed to test implementations of the International  Standards Organization/International Electrotechnical  Commission (ISO/IEC) biometric standards called  BioCTS2012 for ISO/IEC and another CTA designed  to test implementations of the American National  Standards Institute (ANSI)/NIST-ITL 1-2011 (AN-2011)  standard.1 This architecture is called BioCTS2012 for  ANSI/NIST 2011.  Eight Conformance Test Suites (CTSs) to test  implementations of binary-encoded data formats were  developed and released. These test implementations  of the first and second generation of binary-encoded  data formats developed by the Joint Technical  Commission 1 Subcommittee 37 – Biometrics  (JTC 1/SC 37) (finger minutiae and finger image,  face, and iris image data formats). The CTS  set also includes two CTSs designed to support  testing of on-card and off-card Personal Identity  Verification (PIV) iris data format profiles specified  in draft NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-76-2,  Biometric Data Specification for Personal Identity  Verification (released June 2012). These CTSs run  under BioCTS 2012 for ISO/IEC.  BioCTS2012 for AN-2011 incorporates over 1,200  test assertions designed to test the requirements  of selected Record Types of AN-2011. Other Record  Types included in AN-2011 Transactions are detected  and their length and location in the transactions are  reported. The test assertions implemented in code  for BioCTS2012 for AN-2011 are documented in NIST  SP 500-295, Conformance Testing Methodology for  ANSI/NIST-ITL 2011, American National Standard  for Information Systems, Data Format for the  Interchange of Fingerprint, Facial & Other Biometric  Information (September 2012), developed by the  NIST/ITL AN-2011 Conformance Testing Methodology  Working Group.  These tools were designed to achieve significant  functionality, usability, and performance. NIST  Interagency Report (NISTIR) 7877, BioCTS 2012:  Advanced Conformance Test Architectures and Test  Suites for Biometric Data Interchange Formats and  Biometric Information Records (September 2012),  and a presentation delivered at the last Biometric  Consortium conference2 discussed these test tools and  provided technical implementation details. This work  is sponsored, in part, by DHS/US-VISIT.  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  16  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  In FY2013, CSD plans to develop additional CTSs to  test implementations of international biometric data  interchange formats under development in JTC 1/SC 37  for both binary and Extensible Markup Language (XML)  data-encoded formats as well as extending BioCTS  for AN-2011 to other record types (for Traditional and  XML encoding). CSD plans to research handling large  number of files concurrently to increase still further  test report capabilities and analysis. CSD will also  continue researching and developing additional test  environments support (such as web services and tools  in the cloud).  A more detailed discussion on the need for  conformance testing and roadmaps of conformance  test tools development for the following period can  be found in NISTIR 7877 and two related presentations  delivered during 20123, 4. CSD is currently evaluating  the users’ needs for conformance test tools to support  testing of additional biometric standard profile  implementations.  CSD cochaired the Biometric Consortium conferences  and developed the conference technical programs in  cooperation with a member of the National Security  Agency’s staff. The 2012 annual conference, held  September 18-20, 2012 in Tampa, Florida, included  nearly 1,700 attendees from 30 countries representing  government, industry, and academia. The four- track conference included presentations given by  internationally recognized experts in biometric  technologies, system and application developers, IT  business strategists, and government and commercial  officers. It focused on biometric technologies for  homeland security, identity management, border  crossing, electronic commerce, and other applications.  Dr. Charles H. Romine, Director of the Information  Technology Laboratory at NIST, was a keynote speaker.  Other keynote and featured speakers were Mr. Steven  Martinez, Executive Assistant Director, Science and  Technology Branch, Federal Bureau of Investigation;  Mr. Peter F. Verga, Chief of Staff for the Under  17  Secretary of Defense for Policy; Dr. Husni Fahmi, Chief  of Sub-directorate Population Administration, Head of  the e-KPT Technical Team, Ministry of Home Affairs,  Indonesia; Mr. Stephen Dennis, Technical Director  HSARPA (Homeland Security Advanced Research  Projects Agency), Science and Technology Directorate,  Department of Homeland Security; Mr. Duane  Blackburn, Multi-Discipline Systems Engineer, MITRE;  and Mr. R. S. Sharma, Director General and Mission  Director, Unique Identification Authority of India.  The conference program included sessions on  federal government programs, advances on  biometric technologies (e.g., face recognition, rapid  DNA [Deoxyribonucleic acid], iris) and standards,  Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  (IEEE) Biometrics - Identity and Security (BIdS)  research, international biometric programs, and  an Armed Forces Communications and Electronics  Association (AFCEA) Identity Management session.  NIST’s session highlighted achievements and ongoing  biometric research, testing, and standards projects  delivered by experts from the NIST Information  Access and Computer Security Divisions, the  Standards Coordination Office, and the Office of  Law Enforcement Standards. In addition, a number  of workshops and special sessions were held  addressing topics such as biometric security,  large-scale  identity solutions, Organization for the Advancement  of Structured Information Standards (OASIS)  biometrics, the role of biometrics in the National  Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC)  identity ecosystem, a new biometrics domain for  XML, and biometrics in a cloud computing  environment. Over 135 speakers participated in  the program. CSD coordinated NIST’s booth at the  Technology Expo presented by AFCEA, which was  collocated with the conference. The NIST booth  showcased NIST/ITL ongoing projects and provided  attendees with technology demonstrations and  technical information on these projects. CSD plans  to continue supporting the Biometric Consortium at  its 2013 annual conference scheduled for September  17–19 in Tampa, Florida.

The Computer Security Division (CSD)  has provided leadership and expertise to the Smart  Grid Interoperability Panel’s Cyber Security Working  Group. Leveraging CSD’s broad expertise in relevant  areas, CSD is now looking at the cybersecurity needs  of the broader landscape of cyber-physical systems.  Cyber-physical systems (CPS), hybrid networked  cyber and engineered physical elements codesigned  to create adaptive and predictive systems for  enhanced performance, are commonly used in the  nation’s critical infrastructure. Such systems control  the electrical grid, provide clean water, produce  chemicals, and underlie transportation systems. CPS  are gaining in capability as advances are made in  technology, and they are critical to future engines of  growth such as advanced manufacturing, as well as  safety initiatives such as autonomous driving cars.  Cybersecurity is an important cross-cutting discipline  that is critical to provide confidence that CPS and  their information and supporting communications and  information infrastructure are adequately safeguarded.  CPS have many unique characteristics, including  the need for real-time response and extremely high  availability, predictability, and reliability. However,  despite the ubiquity and criticality of CPS, little  thought has been given so far to secure design. As a  result, there have been successful and major attacks  such as Stuxnet, Duqu, Flame, and Gauss that target  CPS controlling critical infrastructure.  In April 2012, CSD hosted a two-day workshop  to explore CPS cybersecurity needs, with a focus  on research results and real-world deployment  experiences across multiple industries, including  healthcare, manufacturing, automotive, and the  electric Smart Grid. The goals of the workshop were  to gain a better understanding of the cybersecurity  challenges faced by CPS across multiple industries, and  to determine if there are security requirements that  are unique to CPS as opposed to strictly cyber or physical  systems. More information on this workshop, including  the agenda, session abstracts, and slides, is available at  http://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/cyberphysical-workshop.cfm.  In 2013, CSD plans to host a workshop to identify and  evaluate the current and needed CPS standards and  practices, as well as tools, technologies, and safeguards  that protect CPS. CSD, in conjunction with NIST’s  Engineering Laboratory, will also be updating SP 800- 82, Guide to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security.  CSD will continue participating with the International  Society of Automation (ISA) 99 Committee, which  develops and establishes standards, recommended  practices, technical reports, and related information  that define procedures for implementing electronically  secure industrial automation and control systems and  security practices, and for assessing electronic security  performance.

CSD remained committed to the value  of communicating its R&D efforts to other federal  colleagues and identifying the opportunities to support  the R&D efforts of federal colleagues throughout the  federal government.  The NITRD Program operates under the aegis of the  NITRD Subcommittee of the National Science and  Technology Council (NSTC) Committee on Technology.  The Subcommittee, made up of representatives from  each of NITRD's member agencies, provides overall  coordination for NITRD activities.  Federal IT R&D, which launched and fueled the digital  revolution, continues to drive innovation in scientific  research, national security, communication, and  commerce to sustain U.S. technological leadership.  The NITRD agencies' collaborative efforts increase the  19  overall effectiveness and productivity of these federal  R&D investments, leveraging strengths, avoiding  duplication, and increasing interoperability of R&D  products.  The NITRD Program has its focus on the following  research areas:  ��Big Data (BD);  ��Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS);  ��Cyber Security and Information Assurance  (CSIA);  ��Health Information Technology Research and  Development (Health IT R&D);  ��Human Computer Interaction and Information  Management (HCI&IM);  ��High-Confidence Software and Systems  (HCSS);  ��High-End Computing (HEC);  ��Large-Scale Networking (LSN);  ��Software Design and Productivity (SDP);  ��Social, Economic, and Workforce Implications  of IT and IT Workforce Development (SEW);  and  ��Wireless Spectrum Research and  Development (WSRD).  CSD maintains a strong presence in many of these  groups with leadership roles in the CSIA Interagency  Working Group (IWG) cochaired by Bill Newhouse  and the SEW Education Team cochaired by Dr. Ernest  McDuffie. Colleagues from other divisions within  the Information Technology Laboratory maintain  leadership roles in Faster Administration of Science  and Technology Education and Research (FASTER)  Community of Practice (CoP), HCI&IM, and SDP. NIST  colleagues from the Engineering Laboratory have  leadership roles in HCSS and the Senior Steering Group  for Cyber-Physical Systems.  The CSIA IWG used its monthly meetings to explore the  themes and thrusts expressed in the Strategic Plan for  the Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development.1  This plan represents the culmination of focused  interactions with academia and industry on  forward-thinking concepts and was published by the  CSIA IWG in December 2011. The plan introduces  1http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/  fed_cybersecurity_rd_strategic_plan_2011.pdf  four game-changing themes (Tailored Trustworthy  Spaces, Moving Target, Cyber Economic Incentives,  and Designed-In Security); describes the need to  develop Scientific Foundations which minimize  future cybersecurity problems by developing the  science of security; identifies the relevant national  priorities where CSD can maximize research impact by  catalyzing coordination, collaboration, and integration  of research activities across federal agencies for  maximum effectiveness; and accelerates Transition  to Practice by expediting improvements in cyberspace  from research findings through focused transition  programs.  The breadth of CSD’s work was shared over the course  of the year’s monthly meetings. Specific briefings  were given on CSD’s efforts in the area of Continuous  Monitoring, Smart Grid, and Healthcare IT Security.  In addition to coordination via the NITRD programs,  CSD is a regular participant in the coordination  activities of the Federal Special Cyber Operations  Research and Engineering (SCORE) Committee, which  was established based on recognition by the architects  of the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative  (CNCI) that expanded R&D coordination was vital to  allow the nation to leap ahead of today’s cybersecurity  challenges.  On behalf of SCORE, CSD hosted an October 2011  cybersecurity “assumption buster” workshop focused  on cloud computing. It was the fourth in a series  of workshops designed to explore the assumptions  that cyber space is an adversarial domain, and the  adversary is tenacious, clever, and capable. By  reexamining cybersecurity solutions in the context of  these assumptions, the workshops aimed to identify  key insights that will lead to novel solutions for some  of the nation’s needs.  The SCORE committee interacts with CNCI leadership.  CSD not only represents the breadth of its work to this  committee, but also shares the progress and relevance  of research initiatives from other divisions across  NIST’s Information Technology Laboratory (ITL), such as  Foundations of Measurement Science for Information  System (Applied and Computational Mathematics  Division) and Usability (Information Access Division).

HAVA established the Election  Assistance Commission (EAC) and the Technical  Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC), chaired  by the Director of NIST. HAVA calls on NIST to provide  technical support to the EAC and TGDC in efforts  related to human factors, security, and laboratory  accreditation. As part of NIST’s efforts, CSD supports  the activities of the EAC and the TGDC related to  voting equipment security.  In the past year, CSD supported the EAC in updating  the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG), VVSG  1.1, by assisting the EAC with the development of a  new draft of the guidelines for public comment. The  security guidelines were updated to improve the  auditability of voting systems, to provide greater  software integrity protections, to expand and improve  access control requirements, and to help ensure that  cryptographic security mechanisms are implemented  properly. In addition, CSD supported the efforts of the  EAC and the Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP)  of the Department of Defense (DoD) to improve the  voting process for citizens under the Uniformed and  Overseas Citizens Voting Act (UOCAVA) by leveraging  electronic technologies. CSD worked with the TDCG’s  UOCAVA Working Group to develop a narrative risk  analysis on current UOCAVA voting processes, including  vote-by-mail and electronic ballot delivery. CSD’s work  on voting technologies has also spun off interesting  research topics, including the Rabin Beacon project  that is discussed separately in this annual report.  In FY2013, CSD will assist the EAC in developing  responses to public comments and provide updates  to VVSG 1.1 and the associated security test suites.  CSD will continue to support the efforts for the EAC  and FVAP to improve the voting process for UOCAVA  voters. CSD will also continue to expand on research  activities, particularly in the areas of risks to voting  systems and innovative voting system architectures.  In addition, CSD will support the NIST National  Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP)  efforts to accredit voting system test laboratories by  developing proficiency tests and testing artifacts, and  by updating Handbook 150-22 used to accredit voting  system test laboratories. CSD plans to engage voting  system manufacturers, voting system test laboratories,  state election officials, and the academic community  to explore ways to increase voting system security and  transparency.  http://vote.nist.gov/  Contacts:  Dr. Nelson Hastings Mr. Andrew Regenscheid  (301) 975-5237 (301) 975-5155  nelson.hastings@nist.gov andrew.regenscheid@nist.gov  Mr. Joshua Franklin  (301) 975-8463  joshua.franklin@nist.gov  21  Health Information Technology Security  Health information technology (HIT) makes it possible  for healthcare providers to better manage patient care  through secure use and sharing of health information,  leading to improvements in healthcare quality, reduced  medical errors, increased efficiencies in care delivery  and administration, and improved population health.  Central to reaching these goals is the assurance of the  confidentiality, integrity, and availability of health  information. CSD works actively with government,  industry, academia, and others to provide security  tools, technologies, and methodologies that provide  for the security and privacy of health information.  In FY2012, NIST issued the Health Insurance  Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Security  Rule self-assessment toolkit to help organizations  better understand the requirements of the HIPAA  Security Rule, implement those requirements, and  assess those implementations in their operational  environment. This project enabled NIST to leverage  security automation specifications within the context  of the healthcare use case.  NIST continued its HIT security outreach efforts. NIST  and the Department of Health and Human Services’  (DHHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) cohosted the fifth  annual HIPAA Security Rule conference, “Safeguarding  Health Information: Building Assurance through HIPAA  Security,” in June 2012 at the Ronald Reagan Building  and International Trade Center in Washington, D.C.  The conference offered important sessions that  focused on broad topics of interest to the healthcare  and health IT security community. Over 500 attendees  from federal, state, and local governments, academia,  HIPAA-covered entities and business associates,  industry groups, and vendors heard from, and  interacted with, healthcare, security, and privacy  experts on technologies and methodologies for  safeguarding health information and for implementing  the requirements of the HIPAA Security Rule.  Presentations covered a variety of current topics  including updates on OCR’s health information  privacy and security audit and enforcement activities;  establishing an access audit program; securing mobile  devices; securing health information in the Cloud;  improving the usability and accessibility of HIT;  managing breaches of health information; and the  relationship between the HIPAA Security Rule and  Meaningful Use.  In FY2013, NIST plans to issue a draft revision to  Special Publication (SP) 800-66, An Introductory  Resource Guide for Implementing the HIPAA Security  Rule. As part of its continued outreach efforts, NIST  also plans to host the sixth annual “Safeguarding  Health Information” conference with OCR.  http://www.nist.gov/healthcare/security/index.cfm  Contacts:  Mr. Kevin Stine Mr. Matthew Scholl  (301) 975-4483 (301) 975-2941  kevin.stine@nist.gov matthew.scholl@nist.gov  ICT Supply Chain Risk Management  Federal agency information systems are increasingly  at risk of both intentional and unintentional supply  chain compromise due to the growing sophistication  of information and communications technologies  (ICT) and the growing speed and scale of a complex,  distributed global supply chain. A lack of visibility into,  and control over, the ICT supply chain increases the risk  technologies will be vulnerable to a variety of threats,  including counterfeit materials, malicious software,  disruption in logistics, and makes it increasingly difficult  for federal agencies to understand their exposure and  manage the associated supply chain risks.  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  22  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  The ICT Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM)  project seeks to provide federal agencies with a  standardized, repeatable, and feasible toolkit of  technical and intelligence resources to strategically  manage supply chain risk throughout the entire life  cycle of ICT products, systems and services.  In 2012, CSD continued to collaborate with several  industry, standards, academic, and government  organizations in order to learn about their efforts  related to SCRM, and provide technical input as  appropriate. NIST’s CSD issued draft NISTIR 7622,  Notional Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for  Federal Information Systems, in FY2012. This draft  document provides an initial set of means and methods  for reducing the risk associated with ICT supply  chain vulnerabilities. It also seeks to equip federal  departments and agencies with implementation  guidance as well as offer a set of practices acquiring  organizations can implement to increase their  understanding of, and visibility throughout, the supply  chain.  With a grant issued by NIST, the University of Maryland  (UMD), Robert H. Smith School of Business, Supply  Chain Management Center published a report which  inventories the proliferating array of existing public  and private sector ICT supply chain initiatives across  diverse ICT segment and formulates a framework  for defining various initiative within a single SCRM  architecture. This framework has three tiers:  enterprise risk governance, system integration, and  operations. Within each tier, the report defines a core  set of attributes or distinct organizational capabilities  to facilitate the identification and assessment of gaps  in coverage in the ICT SCRM community.  CSD also awarded a grant to UMD’s Supply Chain  Management Center to develop a prototype web  portal, which will include:  ��Enterprise Risk Assessments: Three-tier  risk score-carding system based on the ICT  SCRM Community Framework Reference  Architecture: Strategic Assessment/  Organizational Readiness, Practices from  NISTIR 7622, and composite network  vulnerability map of physical and cyber hubs  and nodes, with CVSS ratings;  ��Collaboration / Crowdsourcing: User- documented ICT SCRM use/abuse cases and  real-time polling about vulnerabilities and  responses;  ��ICT SCRM Initiatives: A dynamic matrix  of current industry and public sector ICT  SCRM best practices, standards, and policy  reform initiatives which can be updated by  appropriate individuals from across industry,  academia, and government; and  ��ICT SCRM Digital Library: An online repository  of policy and academic documents related  to ICT SCRM.  In FY2013, CSD will continue to research and develop  tools and guidance to help agencies more effectively  manage their ICT supply chain risk. In October 2013,  CSD intends to publish final NISTIR 7622, Notional  Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Federal  Information Systems.  CSD also plans to host a workshop in October 2012  to bring together a varied group of stakeholders  and thought leaders from industry, academia and  government to future NIST/CSD efforts relating to ICT  SCRM. Outputs from this workshop will include:  ��Fundamental underpinnings of ICT SCRM  (terms, definitions, characterizations);  ��Current and needed commercially reasonable  ICT SCRM-related standards and practices  (need, scope, and development approach);  ��Current and needed ICT SCRM tools,  technology and techniques useful in securing  the ICT supply chain; and  ��Current and needed research and resources.  CSD plans to use the proceedings of this workshop to  transition into producing a draft Special Publication (SP)  800-161 to provide federal departments and agencies  guidance on managing the risk to their ICT supply chains.  In addition, a number of small forums with academia,  industry, and government stakeholders will also be used  to inform the development of draft SP 800-161.  23  Contacts:  Mr. Jon Boyens Ms. Celia Paulsen  ICT SCRM Project Lead (301) 975-5981  (301) 975-5549 celia.paulsen@nist.gov  jon.boyens@nist.gov  Nationwide Public Safety Broadband  Network (NPSBN) Security  In February 2012, Congress passed the Middle  Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act. One portion  of this legislation calls for the  establishment of a nationwide,  interoperable public safety  broadband network based on  Long-Term Evolution (LTE)  technology to be deployed and  operated by the First Responder  Network Authority (FirstNet). The  planned National Public Safety  Broadband Network (NPSBN) is  intended to “create a much- needed nationwide interoperable  broadband network that will help police, firefighters,  emergency medical service professionals and other  public safety officials stay safe and do their jobs.”  (http://www.ntia.doc.gov/category/public-safety).  In addition, the Director of NIST is called upon to  establish a list of certified devices and components to  be adhered to when interacting with the nationwide  network for the use of public safety officials, vendors,  and other interested parties; and to conduct research  and development that supports the acceleration and  advancement of the nationwide network.  In FY2012, CSD advised the National  Telecommunications and Information Administration  (NTIA) and NIST’s Engineering Laboratory on the  security of the proposed NPSBN.  NTIA is helping the National Public Safety  Telecommunications Council (NPSTC) develop a  Statement of Requirements (SoR) to submit to FirstNet  that will describe, in increasing levels of detail, the  technical requirements of the NPSBN infrastructure,  equipment, and communications. This undertaking  has required the involvement of representatives of  numerous professional communities and a wide variety  of disciplines, including federal, state, local, and  tribal officials; public safety and other First Responder  personnel; mobile carrier operators; and mobile  device vendors. CSD commented and contributed text  for the security-related aspects of the SoR.  In FY2013, CSD plans to continue supporting the  development and refinement of the NPSTC SoR and  represent public safety in international standardization  efforts, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force  (IETF) and the 3rd Generation Partnership Project  (3GPP), that impact their communication requirements.  In addition, CSD will identify gaps between NIST  security guidelines and NPSBN security requirements  as well as relevant 3GPP LTE specifications. CSD also  plans to research some of the currently unresolved  issues and risks related to public safety security.

Key to the successful deployment  of the Smart Grid infrastructure is the development  of the cybersecurity strategy for the Smart Grid. In  fact, cybersecurity needs to be designed into the  deploying systems that support Smart Grid, and added  into existing systems. The electric grid is critical to  the economic and physical well-being of the nation,  and emerging cyber threats targeting power systems  highlight the need to integrate advanced security to  protect critical assets.  Image Source:  http://www.pscr.gov/index.php  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  mailto:celia.paulsen@nist.gov  24  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  NIST established the Smart Grid Interoperability  Panel (SGIP) Cyber Security Working Group (CSWG) in  support of the Energy Independence and  Security Act of 2007 to address the cross- cutting issue of cybersecurity. The CSWG has  more than 750 participants worldwide from the  private sector (including utilities, vendors, and  service providers),  academia, regulatory  organizations, state  and local government,  and U.S. federal  agencies. Membership  in the CSWG has been  free and open to all  since its inception. Many members participate from  around the world by monitoring the minutes and email  conversations of the subgroups.  1NIST Special Publication 1108R2, NIST Framework and Roadmap  for Smart Grid Interoperability Standards, Release 2.0 Available at  ht t p://www.nist .gov/sma rt grid/ uploa d/ NIST_ Fra me work _  Release_2-0_corr.pdf.  The CSWG membership collaborated to deliver the  NIST Interagency Report (NISTIR) 7628, Guidelines  for Smart Grid Cyber Security, in August 2010. Since  then the group has focused on specific topics such as  risk management processes, key management in the  Smart Grid, the Smart Grid security architecture,  security testing and certification, Advanced Metering  Infrastructure (AMI) security, and privacy in the Smart  Grid. In addition, the group is conducting security  reviews of many Smart Grid-related standards and  beginning to develop a User’s Guide for NISTIR 7628.  To complete the work, there are seven subgroups  that focus on specific topics. During the development  of NISTIR 7628, the subgroups performed detailed  technical analyses on an array of security-related  topics, and then documented the research, issues,  and guidance in specific sections. The approach  that has been taken by all subgroups is an open and  collaborative process in which any CSWG member is  welcome to participate and contribute.

Since the NISTIR 7628 publication,  some of the CSWG subgroups have merged, while  others are regrouping as they determine their next set  of tasks. The CSWG currently consists of the following  subgroups:  ��The Architecture subgroup focuses on  the enhancement of the logical security  architecture for the Smart Grid. This group’s  work is used as input to the SGIP Architecture  Committee;  ��The High-Level Requirements subgroup  addresses the procedural and technical  security requirements of the Smart Grid to  be addressed by stakeholders in Smart Grid  security. To create the initial set of security  requirements in NISTIR 7628, this subgroup  adapted industry-accepted security source  documents for the Smart Grid;  ��The NISTIR 7628 User’s Guide subgroup  will provide an easy-to-understand tool  that utilities and other entities involved in  implementing Smart Grid-based systems can  use to navigate NISTIR 7628 to identify and  select the security requirements needed to  help protect those systems;  ��The Privacy subgroup continues to  investigate privacy concerns between  utilities, consumers, and nonutility third  parties;  ��The Standards subgroup assesses standards  and other documents with respect to the  cybersecurity and privacy requirements  from NISTIR 7628. These assessments are  performed on the standards contained  in NIST Special Publication (SP) 1108,  Framework and Roadmap for Smart Grid  Interoperability Standards, or in support of  the SGIP’s Priority Action Plans (PAPs). The  group has reviewed over 75 documents to  date; and  ��The Testing and Certification subgroup  establishes guidance and methodologies for  cybersecurity testing of Smart Grid systems,  subsystems, and components.  During the past year, members of the CSWG  collaborated with the Department of Energy (DOE) and  the North American Electric Reliability Corporation  (NERC) to develop a harmonized electricity sector  enterprise-wide risk management process. This was  published by DOE as “Electricity Subsector Cybersecurity  Risk Management Process Guideline” in May 2012. The  CSWG also collaborated with the National Electric  Sector Cybersecurity Organization Resource (NESCOR)  to develop a technical white paper on Smart Energy  Profile (SEP) 1.0 and 1.1. The CSWG Lead, Marianne  Swanson, also served as a subject-matter expert on  the DOE Electricity Subsector Cybersecurity Capability  Maturity Model (ES-C2M2) project.  Members of the CSWG produced a white paper on  automating Smart Grid security in December 2011. The  group produced a mapping between the NERC Critical  Infrastructure Protection standards, version 5, and the  high-level security requirements found in NISTIR 7628.  For the SGIP’s second version of the Interoperability  Process Reference Manual, the group produced a  chapter on cybersecurity testing. The group also  developed an SGIP document, Guide for Testing the  NISTIR 7628 High-level Security Requirements, in order  to help utilities and other Smart Grid organizations  assess how well they are meeting those high-level  security requirements.  The CSWG’s Privacy subgroup developed customizable  train-the-trainer privacy briefings for utilities,  public utility commissions, and those dealing with  consumers. This subgroup also developed a set of  recommended practices for how third parties should  protect consumers’ privacy when handling customer  energy usage data received from a source other than a  utility (e.g., an in-home device).  CSD also supports CSWG by assessing the security of  cryptographic methods used in security protocols for  utilities’ communication and management networks  and by developing cryptographic security guidelines  for the Smart Grid. During the past year, CSD reviewed  and analyzed cryptographic techniques in the  Smart Energy Profile (SEP) standards, and provided  guidance to the CSWG. The EAX’ block cipher mode of  operation, specified in the ANSI C12.22-2008 standard,  26  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  was intended by industry to serve as a solution for  cybersecurity needs in smart meters. CSD reviewed  the EAX’ scheme, submitted by members of the ANSI  C11.22 SC 17 Committee, and decided not to include  it in the toolkit of NIST-approved algorithms. CSD  also reviewed the IEC 62541-6 standard (OPC unified  architecture - Part 6: Mappings)2 and identified issues  with the cryptographic methods used in the standard  that could potentially create a substantial security  risk for communication networks running the standard  protocol. CSD provided recommendations to improve  the security and performance of this standard.  CSD also represented the CSWG, in collaboration  with the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)  and Department of Energy/NESCOR, in identifying  requirements, features, and capabilities for a  cryptographic key-management system for an  Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). This is an  ongoing work project.  Future work includes working with the SGIP — the  Committees, the Domain Expert Working Groups, and  the Priority Action Plans — to integrate cybersecurity  into their work efforts. Collaboration will continue  with DOE and NERC to produce a cybersecurity risk  management process use case for the electricity sector  to accompany the Risk Management Process document.  Reviewing and updating NISTIR 7628 will occur in the  next year. This will result in the issuance of NISTIR  7628 Revision 1. Afterwards, the group will update the  Guide for Testing the NISTIR 7628 High-level Security  Requirements to reflect any changes in the high- level security requirements from NISTIR 7628 Rev. 1.  Members of the group will produce a white paper on  cloud computing and the Smart Grid, as well as the  NISTIR 7628 User’s Guide. The Standards subgroup will  continue to review documents for the SGIP. CSD will  continue to support the CSWG in the evaluation of the  cryptographic methods used in security protocols for  the communication and management networks used  by utility companies.  2Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) for Process Control  http://collaborate.nist.gov/twiki-sggrid/bin/view/  SmartGrid/WebHome  Contacts:  Ms. Marianne Swanson Ms. Tanya Brewer  (301) 975-3293 (301) 975-4534  marianne.swanson@nist.gov tbrewer@nist.gov  Mr. Quynh Dang  (301) 975-3610  qdang@nist.gov  Cybersecurity Awareness, Training,  Education, and Outreach  Î National Initiative for  Cybersecurity Education (NICE)  NIST became the lead for the National Initiative  for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) in 2010 based  on a recommendation of the Information and  Communications Infrastructure – Interagency Policy  Committee (ICI-IPC). This recommendation was built  out of chapter two of the May 2009 Cyberspace Policy  Review titled “Building Capacity for a Digital Nation”  and is responsive to President Obama’s declaration that  the “cyber threat is one of the most serious economic  and national security challenges we face as a nation”  and that “America’s economic prosperity in the 21st  century will depend on cybersecurity.”  The goal of NICE is to enhance the overall cybersecurity  posture of the United States by accelerating the  availability of educational and training resources  designed to improve the cyber behavior, skills, and  knowledge of every segment of the population,  enabling a safer cyberspace for all. NICE addresses this  challenging goal by:  �� Raising national awareness about risks in  cyberspace;  �� Broadening the pool of individuals prepared  to enter the cybersecurity workforce; and  �� Cultivating a globally competitive  cybersecurity workforce.  http://collaborate.nist.gov/twiki-sggrid/bin/view/SmartGrid/WebHome http://collaborate.nist.gov/twiki-sggrid/bin/view/SmartGrid/WebHome  27  This initiative comprises four component areas:  1) National Cybersecurity Awareness; 2) Formal  Cybersecurity Education; 3) Cybersecurity Workforce  Structure; and 4) Cybersecurity Workforce Training  and Professional Development.  The Computer Security Division (CSD) is home to the  NIST NICE Leadership Team (NNLT), and they focus on  the following activities for NICE:  ��Developing planning documents, and  building consensus on the strategy and  implementation activities of NICE;  ��Facilitating cross-functional cooperation  among NICE component lead agencies;  ��Fostering communication between the  component lead agencies by coordinating  meetings, facilitating discussions, and  disseminating information;  ��Promoting the initiative and its efforts  by representing NICE and speaking at  cybersecurity events nationwide;  ��Planning and hosting an annual workshop to  promote and support the evolving issues in  cybersecurity education;  ��Coordinating with other federal initiatives  and efforts related to NICE; and  ��Maintaining and updating the NICE website.  In FY2012, NIST updated the draft NICE Strategic Plan  and stewarded the National Cybersecurity Workforce  Framework, developed within NICE’s Cybersecurity  Workforce Training and Professional Development  Component, through government-wide review. Both  documents can be found on the NICE website, http://  csrc.nist.gov/nice/.  NIST organized and planned to host the third annual  NICE Workshop, “Shaping the Future of Cybersecurity  Education, Connecting the Dots in Cyberspace,”  from October 30 – November 1, 2012. However, the  workshop was cancelled due to Hurricane Sandy. The  next NICE workshop will be held in the fall of 2013  and will serve as a forum to develop the connections  within the cybersecurity and education communities  to make progress on the strategic goals and objectives  of NICE.  The NNLT attended more than 100 events, symposia,  forums, competitions, educational outreach  meetings, and workshops to promote the activities  within NICE. In FY2012, the National Cybersecurity  Education Council was established with the signing  of a Memorandum of Understanding between the  Department of Education, NIST, and over 50 private  sector organizations convened by the National Cyber  Security Alliance.  In FY2013, the NNLT plans to develop innovative  strategies to support the Office of Personnel  Management (OPM) issuance and the governmentwide  adoption of cybersecurity function codes that  will, for the first time, allow agencies to identify  their cybersecurity workforce. The NNLT will also  demonstrate the value of framework adoption to  government agencies and private sector organizations  who are formalizing their cybersecurity training needs.  The NNLT will be identifying opportunities to tie the  framework to existing and new training initiatives.  The NNLT has cultivated the trust of the Component  lead agencies. In FY2013, NNLT will use that trust to  best support the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) development of the National Initiative for  Cybersecurity Careers and Studies (NICCS) web portal.  All of the Components have identified deliverables and  milestones, and the NNLT will work to publicize the  accomplishments of the Components.  http://www.nist.gov/nice/  Contacts:  Dr. Ernest McDuffie Mr. Bill Newhouse  NICE Project Lead NICE Program Lead  (301) 975-8897 (301) 975-2869  ernest.mcduffie@nist.gov william.newhouse@nist.gov  Ms. Magdalena Benitez Ms. Pat Toth  (301) 975-6182 (301) 975-5140  mbenitez@nist.gov ptoth@nist.gov  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  mailto:ptoth@nist.gov mailto:mbenitez@nist.gov mailto:william.newhouse@nist.gov mailto:ernest.mcduffie@nist.gov http://www.nist.gov/nice  28  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  Î Computer Security Resource  Center (CSRC)  The Computer Security Resource Center (CSRC), CSD’s  website, is one of the most visited websites at NIST.

NIST’s plan includes a graceful transition to  a NIST program supported by the current Executive  Board, and include direct and formal connections with  the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education  (NICE).  FISSEA membership is open to information systems  security professionals, professional trainers and  educators, and managers responsible for information  systems security training programs in federal agencies,  as well as contractors of these agencies and faculty  members of accredited educational institutions who  are involved in information security training and  education. There are no membership fees to join  FISSEA; all that is required is a willingness to share  products, information, and experiences. Business is  administered by a working group that meets monthly.  FISSEA maintains a website, a mailing list, and  participates in a social networking site as a means of  improving communication for its members. NIST assists  FISSEA with its operations by providing staff support  for several of its activities and by being FISSEA’s host  agency.  FISSEA membership in 2012 spanned federal agencies,  industry, military, contractors, state governments,  academia, the press, and foreign organizations to  reach over 1,295 members in a total of ten countries.  The 700 federal agency members represent 89  agencies from the executive and legislative branches  of government.  The 2012 FISSEA conference returned to NIST on  March 27-29, 2012, and the theme was “A New Era  in Cybersecurity Awareness, Training, and Education.”  The theme was chosen to reflect current projects,  trends, and initiatives that provide pathways to future  solutions. Approximately 184 information systems  security professionals and trainers from federal  agencies, academia, and industry attended. Attendees  received an update on NICE activities, gained new  techniques for developing and conducting training, as  well as awareness and training ideas, resources, and  contacts. Presenters represented NIST, the Department  of Homeland Security (DHS), the Defense Intelligence  Agency (DIA), the U.S. Department of State (DOS),  the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of  Defense (DoD), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA),  the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  (NASA), the National Security Agency (NSA), the  Department of Interior, the Bureau of the Public Debt  (BPD), and the Library of Congress. Presenters also  represented private industry and academia. Attendees  had an opportunity to visit 22 vendors on the second  day.  Another bonus of attending the FISSEA conference  is networking.  The conference continues to be a valuable  forum in which individuals from government,  industry, and academia involved with information  systems/cybersecurity workforce development –  awareness, training, education, certification, and  professionalization – may learn of ongoing and planned  training and education programs and initiatives.  At each annual conference, an award is presented to  a candidate selected as FISSEA Educator of the Year;  this award honors distinguished accomplishments  in information systems security training programs.  Susan Hansche, Avaya Government Solutions/U.S.  Department of State was awarded the Educator of  the Year for 2011 at the 2012 FISSEA Conference.  The annual FISSEA Security Awareness, Training and  Education Contest consists of five categories from one  of FISSEA’s three key areas of Awareness, Training, and  Education. The categories are: (1) awareness poster,  (2) motivational item (aka: trinkets - pens, stress  relief items, t-shirts, etc.), (3) awareness website, (4)  awareness newsletter, and (5) role-based training and  education. Winning entries for the security awareness  contest are posted to the FISSEA website. The winners  for the FY2012 contest were:  ��David Kurtz and Bruce Sharp, Bureau of the  Public Debt, U.S. Treasury Department won  the Poster Contest;  ��Maureen Moore, Sara Fitzgerald, Kimberly  Conway, and Mechelle Munn, Food and Drug  Administration, was selected as winners for  their Security Motivation Item as well as for  their Security Newsletter; and  31  ��Shelly Tzoumas, U.S. House of  Representatives, had the winning security  website and was selected as the Role-Based  Training Contest winner.  New in FY 2012 was a poster session which provided  an opportunity to share and tell about their specific  awareness and training programs. During the poster  session, conference attendees voted for their favorite  selection in each category to select the “Peer’s Choice”  award. Attendees selected the same newsletter,  motivational item, and security training winners as the  contest judging committee. However, peers selected  the poster submitted by Terri Cinnamon, Department  of Veterans Affairs, and Alexis Benjamin, Department  of State, as the peer’s choice for website.  The 2013 FISSEA conference is being planned for  March 19-21, 2013, at NIST.  http://csrc.nist.gov/fissea  fisseamembership@nist.gov  Contacts:  Ms. Patricia Toth Ms. Peggy Himes  (301) 975-5140 (301) 975-2489  patricia.toth@nist.gov peggy.himes@nist.gov  Î Information Security and Privacy  Advisory Board (ISPAB)  The Information Security and Privacy Advisory  Board (ISPAB) is a federal advisory committee. It  brings together senior professionals from industry,  government, and academia to advise NIST, the Office  of Management and Budget (OMB), the Secretary of  Commerce, and appropriate committees of the U.S.  Congress about information security and privacy  issues pertaining to unclassified federal government  information systems.  In accordance with 15 U.S.C. 278g-4, the ISPAB is  rechartered by the Secretary of Commerce for 2012- 2013 in pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee  Act, 5 U.S.C. App. The scope and objectives of the  Board are to—  ��Identify emerging managerial, technical,  administrative, and physical safeguard issues  relative to information security and privacy;  ��Advise NIST, the Secretary of Commerce, and  the Director of OMB on information security  and privacy issues pertaining to federal  government information systems, including  thorough review of proposed standards and  guidelines developed by NIST; and  ��Annually submit a report to the Secretary  of Commerce, the Director of OMB, the  Director of the National Security Agency, and  the appropriate committees of the Congress.  The charter (http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/ispab/  documents/ispab_charter-2012-2014.pdf) defines that  the Board’s membership consists of twelve members  and a Chairperson. The Chairperson is appointed by  the Secretary of Commerce, and the Board members  are selected for their preeminence in the information  technology industry or related disciplines. The term of  office for each board member is four years. The ISPAB  Board members are:  ��Daniel Chenok (Chair), IBM Center for The  Business of Government;  ��Julie Boughn, Center for Medicare and  Medicaid Innovation, Department of Human  Health and Services, Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (DHHS/CMS);  ��Christopher Boyer, AT&T;  ��Kevin Fu, University of Massachusetts  Amherst;  ��Gregory Garcia, Garcia Cyber Partners;  ��Brian Gouker, National Security Agency (NSA)  - U.S. Army War College;  ��Toby Levin, (retired);  ��Edward Roback, U.S. Department of the  Treasury;  ��Phyllis Schneck, McAfee, Inc.;  ��Gale Stone, Social Security Administration;  ��Matthew Thomlinson, Microsoft; and  ��Peter Weinberger, Google, Inc.

The  members’ careers cover government, industry, and  academia. Members have worked in the executive and  legislative branches of the federal government, civil  service, senior executive service, the military, some  of the largest corporations worldwide, small  and medium-size businesses, and some of the  top universities in the nation. The members’  experience, likewise, covers a broad spectrum of  activities including many different engineering  disciplines, computer programming, systems analysis,  mathematics, management, information technology  auditing, privacy, and law. Members also have an  extensive history of professional publications and  professional journalism. Members have worked (and  in many cases, continue to work) on the development  and evolution of some of the most important pieces  of information security and privacy legislation in the  federal government, including the Privacy Act of 1974,  the Computer Security Act of 1987, the E-Government  Act (including FISMA), and other e-government services  and initiatives.  In FY2012, the board lost a valuable member, Joseph  Guirreri, who had diligently served the Board for the  past six years. In the same year, F. Lynn McNulty, a board  member (2005-2011) and a significant contributor to  information security in the government, passed away  on June 4th.  The Board usually meets three times per year and  meetings are open to the public. NIST provides the  Board with its Secretariat and meetings are usually  located in Washington, D.C. In June 2012, NIST  requested to host ISPAB at NIST and showcased a range  of research for the Board’s discussion. The Board has  received numerous briefings from federal and private  sector representatives on a wide range of privacy and  security topics in the past year. Areas of interest that  the Board followed in FY2011-FY2012 were:  ��Special Publication (SP) 800-53 Revision 4,  Security and Privacy Controls for Federal  Information Systems and Organizations, and  its appendices;  ��Federal Communications Commission (FCC)  and technology;  33  ��Cyber defense;  ��Prospects for and content of cyber  legislature;  ��Consumer privacy;  ��Security in the next generation mobility;  ��Cloud Computing - data location, data  storage, and data sovereignty;  ��Legislature and security;  ��Derived credentials;  ��Economic incentives for medical device  cybersecurity;  ��Cyber ecosystem and automated cyber  indicator sharing;  ��Key Management;  ��Defense Industrial Base (DIB) pilot and  its potential application to other private  sectors;  ��Progress for modernizing federal desktop  platforms;  ��Trustworthy cyberspace: Strategic Plan for  the Federal Cybersecurity Research and  Development Program; and  ��Federal initiatives such as:  ◦�National Initiative for Cybersecurity  Education (NICE);  ◦�National Strategy for Trusted Identities in  Cyberspace (NSTIC);  ◦�Federal Risk and Authorization Management  Pilot program (FedRAMP);  ◦�United States Computer Emergency  Readiness Team (US-CERT);  ◦�Homeland Security Presidential Directive  (HSPD) 12;  ◦�Draft FIPS 201-2, Personal Identity  Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and  Contractors;  ◦�National Cybersecurity and Communications  Integration Center (NCCIC) and Cyber Storm  - Automated Indicator Sharing;  ◦�Continuous Monitoring;  ◦�IT System Performance and Conformity;  ◦�Federal Guide to Privacy and Security of  Health;  ◦�Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  Security Breach Notification;  ◦�Federal Information Security Management  Act (FISMA); and  ◦�NIST’s outreach, research, and strategies.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/ispab/index.html  Contact:  Ms. Annie Sokol  (301) 975-2006  annie.sokol@nist.gov  Î Small and Medium-Size Business (SMB)  Outreach  What do business  invoices have in  common with email?  If both are done on  the same computer,  the business owner  may want to think more about computer security  information – payroll records, proprietary information,  client or employee data – as essential to a business’s  success. A computer failure or system breach could  cost a business anything from its reputation to damages  and recovery costs. The small business owner who  recognizes the threat of computer crime and takes  steps to deter inappropriate activities is less likely to  become a victim.  The vulnerability of any one small business may  not seem significant to many people, other than the  owner and employees of that business. However,  over 25 million U.S. businesses, comprising more  than 99 percent of all U.S. businesses, are small and  medium-size businesses (SMBs) of 500 employees  or less (http://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/  us11_0.pdf). Therefore, a vulnerability common to a  large percentage of SMBs could pose a threat to the  nation’s information infrastructure and economic  base. SMBs frequently cannot justify the employment  of an extensive security program or a full-time expert.  Nonetheless, they confront serious security challenges.  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  http://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/us11_0.pdf http://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/us11_0.pdf mailto:annie.sokol@nist.gov http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/ispab/index.html  34  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  The difficulty for these businesses is to identify  security mechanisms and training that are practical  and cost-effective. Such businesses also need to  become more educated in terms of security so that  limited resources are well applied to meet the most  relevant and serious threats. To address this need,  NIST, the Small Business Administration (SBA), and the  Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are cosponsoring  a series of training workshops on computer security for  small businesses. The purpose of the workshops is to  provide an overview of information security threats,  vulnerabilities, and corresponding protective tools  and techniques, with a special emphasis on providing  useful information that small business personnel can  apply directly.  In FY2012, twenty-five SMB outreach workshops were  provided in twenty-four cities: Tulsa, Oklahoma;  Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Lake Charles, Louisiana;  Lafayette, Louisiana; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Slidell,  Louisiana; New Orleans, Louisiana; Denver, Colorado;  Nashua, New Hampshire; New Haven, Connecticut;  Rochester, Minnesota; St Paul, Minnesota; St Cloud,  Minnesota; Austin, Texas; San Antonio, Texas; San Diego,  California; Los Angeles, California; Albuquerque, New  Mexico; Indianapolis, Indiana; Sacramento, California;  Cincinnati, Ohio; Dayton, Ohio; Columbus, Ohio; and  Chillicothe, Ohio.  In collaboration with the SBA and the FBI, planning  is under way to identify locations for small business  information security workshops in FY2013.  http://sbc.nist.gov  Contact:  Mr. Richard Kissel  (301) 975-5017  richard.kissel@nist.gov  Cryptographic Technology  Î Crypto Standards Program  Hash Algorithms and the Secure Hash  Algorithm (SHA-3) Competition  The Cryptographic Technology Group (CTG) is  responsible for the maintenance and development  of the Secure Hash Standard (SHS), FIPS 180. A hash  algorithm processes a message, which can be very  large, and produces a condensed representation of  the message, called a message digest. A cryptographic  hash algorithm is a fundamental component of many  cryptographic functions, such as digital signature  algorithms, key-derivation functions, keyed-hash  message authentication codes (HMAC), or random  number generators. Cryptographic hash algorithms  are frequently used in Internet protocols or in other  security applications.  In 2005, researchers developed an attack method  that threatened the security of the Secure Hash  Algorithm-1 (SHA-1), a NIST-approved hash algorithm.  Researchers at NIST and elsewhere also discovered  several generic limitations in the basic Merkle- Damgard construct that is used in SHA-1 and most  other existing hash algorithms. To address these  vulnerabilities, NIST opened a public competition in  November 2007 to develop a new cryptographic hash  algorithm, which would be called “SHA-3,” and would  augment the Secure Hash Standard by adding the new  hash algorithm.  NIST received sixty-four entries from cryptographers  around the world by October 31, 2008, and selected  fifty-one first-round candidates in December 2008;  fourteen second-round candidates in July 2009; and  five third-round candidates – BLAKE, Grøstl, JH, Keccak  and Skein, on December 9, 2010, to enter the third  and final round of the competition. Status reports for  the first and second rounds were published as NISTIR  7620, Status Report on the First Round of the SHA- 3 Cryptographic Hash Algorithm Competition, and  NISTIR 7764, Status Report on the Second Round of  the SHA-3 Cryptographic Hash Algorithm Competition,  respectively.  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips180-4/fips-180-4.pdf http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips198-1/FIPS-198-1_final.pdf http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips198-1/FIPS-198-1_final.pdf http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/documents/FR_Notice_Nov07.pdf http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/documents/FR_Notice_Nov07.pdf http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/sha-3/Round1/documents/sha3_NISTIR7620.pdf http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/sha-3/Round1/documents/sha3_NISTIR7620.pdf http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/sha-3/Round2/documents/Round2_Report_NISTIR_7764.pdf  35  Submitters of the SHA-3 finalists were allowed to make  minor adjustments to their algorithms by January 16,  2011, and the third round of the competition began  on January 31, 2011, when the final submissions  were posted on NIST’s hash website. A one-year public  review period was provided before NIST hosted the  (last) Third SHA-3 Candidate Conference (URL:  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/sha-3/Round3/  March2012/) in Washington, D.C. on March 22-23,  2012, to receive public feedback on the finalists.  The cryptographic community provided an  enormous amount of expert feedback throughout the  competition. Most of the comments were sent to NIST  and a public hash forum; in addition, many of the  cryptanalysis and performance studies were published  as papers in major cryptographic conferences or  leading cryptographic journals. Based on the public  comments and internal review of the candidates,  NIST announced KECCAK as the SHA-3 winner on October  2, 2012, thus ending the five-year-long competition.  KECCAK was selected because of its large security  margin, good general performance, excellent  efficiency in hardware implementations, flexible  design, and because its design and implementation  properties complement the existing SHA-2 family of  hash algorithms well. The evaluation of the finalists  and the selection process was summarized in a third- round report, which was published as NISTIR 7896 in  early FY2013.  NIST plans to augment the current hash standard,  FIPS 180-4, to include the new SHA-3 algorithm, and  publish a draft FIPS 180-5 for public review. After the  close of the public comment period, NIST will revise  the draft standard, as appropriate, in response to the  public comments that NIST receives. A final review,  approval, and promulgation process will then follow.  http://www.nist.gov/hash-competition  Contact:  Ms. Shu-jen Chang  (301) 975-2940  shu-jen.chang@nist.gov  Hash Algorithm Standards and  Security Guidelines  FIPS 180 is the SHA standard. This standard has had  several revisions. FIPS 180-3 was approved in October  2008 and contained five hash algorithms: SHA-1, SHA- 224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512.  In March 2012, another revision of FIPS 180 was  approved: FIPS 180-4. This revision provides a general  procedure for creating an initialization hash value,  adds two additional secure hash algorithms  (SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256) to the SHA standard,  and removes a restriction that padding must be done  before hash computation begins, which was required  in FIPS 180-3. SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256 are  more efficient alternatives to SHA-224 and SHA-256  on platforms that are optimized for 64-bit operations.  Removing the restriction on the padding operation  in the secure hash algorithms potentially allowed  more flexibility and efficiency in implementing the  secure hash algorithms in many computer network  applications.  General guidelines for using hash functions are  provided in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-107,  Revision 1, Recommendation for Applications Using  Approved Hash Algorithms. This document provides  security guidelines for achieving the desired security  strengths for cryptographic applications that employ  the approved cryptographic hash functions specified in  FIPS 180. SP 800-107 has been revised to address the  security properties of SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256,  the new hash algorithms approved in FIPS 180-4.  Additional security information about Hash Message  Authentication Code (HMAC) has been provided, and  the hash-based key-derivation function section has  been revised to provide updated information about  approved hash-based key-derivation functions that are  specified in many other NIST Special Publications.  A draft of the SP 800-107 revision was issued  for public comment in September 2011 and was  extensively revised to address the received comments  and to include discussions of the security of HMAC  and randomized hashing for digital signatures. The  discussions on hash-based key-derivation functions  were revised to incorporate the “extraction-then-  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  http://www.nist.gov/hash-competition http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/sha-3/Round3/March2012/ http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/sha-3/Round3/March2012/ http://www.nist.gov/hash-competition mailto:shu-jen.chang@nist.gov  36  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  expansion” key-derivation procedure specified in  SP 800-56C, Recommendation for Key Derivation  through Extraction-then-Expansion, and to discuss  different approved hash-based key derivation  functions.

For  example, random numbers are used to generate the  keys needed for encryption and digital signature  applications.  In the late 1990s, a project to develop more rigorous  requirements and specifications for random number  generation (RNG) was initiated in coordination with  the American National Standards Institute’s (ANSI)  Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X9. The  resulting standard (X9.82) is being developed in four  parts: Part 1 provides general information; Part 2  will provide requirements for entropy sources; Part 3  provides specifications for deterministic random bit  generator (DRBG) mechanisms; and Part 4 provides  guidance on constructing random bit generators  (RBGs) from entropy sources and DRBG mechanisms.  Parts 1, 3 and 4 have been completed; Part 2 is nearing  completion.  In March 2007, NIST published SP 800-90,  Recommendation for Random Number Generation  Using Deterministic Random Bit Generators,  which contained the DRBG mechanisms in Part 3  of ANS X9.82, plus an additional DRBG mechanism.  This Recommendation was revised as SP 800-90A,  Recommendation for Random Number Generation  Using Deterministic Random Bit Generators, in  January 2012 to include additional capabilities  identified during the development of Part 4 of ANS  X9.82. The document number for SP 800-90 was  modified so that two additional documents (i.e., SP  800-90B, Recommendation for the Entropy Sources  Used for Random Bit Generation and SP 800-90C,  Recommendation for Random Bit Generator (RBG)  Constructions) could be included in a series on  random number generation. SP 800-90A is available at  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.  SP 800-90B will address the development and  testing of entropy sources, including descriptions  of the validation tests that will be used by NIST’s  Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program to  validate candidate entropy sources. SP 800-90C will  provide basic guidance on the construction of RBGs  from entropy sources and DRBG mechanisms, pointing  to Part 4 of ANS X9.82 for additional constructions and  examples. Both documents have been provided for  public comment at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/  PubsDrafts.html.  NIST’s standards activities in FY2013 will include a  workshop to discuss the drafts of SP 800-90B and C,  and adjudication of the comments received during the  public-comment period and the workshop.

This document, which was  first published in 2006, is being revised to provide  further clarification and additional methods for key  derivation; this revision has been made available for  public comment at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/  PubsDrafts.html and will be completed in FY2013.  A newly approved method for key derivation in  SP 800-56A is specified in SP 800-56C, Recommendation  for Key Derivation through Extraction-then-Expansion,  which was completed in November 2011. SP 800-56C  specifies a two-step key-derivation procedure that  extracts randomness from a shared secret produced  during a key-agreement computation and expands the  result into the required keying material. The procedure  in SP 800-56C is one of the new key-derivation methods  referenced in the revision of SP 800-56A.  Another related publication, SP 800-135,  Recommendation for Existing Application-Specific Key  Derivation Functions, was completed in December  2010 and revised in December 2011; this document  approves existing application-specific key-derivation  functions used in commonly deployed protocols. These  key-derivation functions are among the new key- derivation methods referenced in the revision of SP  800-56A.  Part 1 of SP 800-57, Recommendation for Key  Management: Part 1: General, provides general  key-management guidance. This document was first  published in 2005, and later revised in 2007. This  document has been updated to include information on  and references to recent work performed by the CTG;  the revision was completed in July 2012.  Part 3 of SP 800-57, Recommendation for Key  Management, Part 3 Application-Specific Key  Management Guidance, was first published in  2009; this document provides application-specific  key management guidance and is being revised to  reflect recent work on the applications and protocols  discussed in the document. The revision will also  include an additional section on the Secure Shell (SSH)  protocol. In FY2013, the revision of this document will  be provided for public comment.  SP 800-130, A Framework for Designing Cryptographic  Key Management Systems, is being developed to  provide guidance on the framework of a Cryptographic  Key Management System (CKMS). The first draft of this  document was provided for public comment in 2010  and was discussed in a subsequent workshop at NIST  in late FY2010. A revised draft of this document that  addressed the comments received during the public  comment period and during the workshop was provided  for a second public-comment period in April 2012 and  discussed at a public key management workshop in  September 2012. This document will be completed by  mid FY2013.  SP 800-152, A Profile for U.S. Federal Cryptographic  Key Management Systems (CKMS), is under  development. This document is intended to provide  refinements of the framework requirements in SP 800- 130 that are appropriate for use in a CKMS used by  the federal government, plus guidance on  implementing, procuring, installing, configuring,  and operating a Federal CKMS. A table of proposed  requirements to be included in SP 800-152 was provided  for public comment in August 2012 and discussed at  a key management workshop in September 2012. SP  800-152 will continue to be developed during FY2013,  including refining the requirements provided for public  comment.  SP 800-133, Recommendation for Cryptographic  Key Generation, which discusses the generation of  the keys to be managed and used by NIST’s approved  cryptographic algorithms, was issued for public  comment in August 2011. It addresses the generation  of a key using the output of a random bit generator, the  derivation of a key from another key, the derivation of  a key from a password, and keys generated during the  use of a key-agreement scheme. This document was  completed in November 2012.  A new publication is under development that is  intended to provide guidance on the security strength  of a cryptographic key that is used to protect data  (i.e., a data-protection key), given the manner in  which the key was generated and handled prior to  its use to protect the target data.

A digital  signature is represented in a computer as a string of  bits and is computed using a set of rules and a set  of parameters that allow the identity of the signatory  and the integrity of the data to be verified.  FIPS 186, first published in 1994, has been revised  several times since then, and in April 2012, a list of  changes to the current version of the standard, FIPS  186-3, was provided for public comment. The proposed  changes included a reduction of restrictions on the  use of random number generators and the retention  and use of prime number generation seeds, and  further aligns the FIPS with Public Key Cryptography  Standard (PKCS) #1. The comments received have  been incorporated into the draft of a new version of  the standard, which will be proposed to the Secretary  of Commerce for adoption as FIPS 186-4 in FY2013.  FIPS 186-3 and the proposed changes are provided at  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsFIPS.html  Contacts:  Ms. Elaine Barker Dr. Allen Roginsky  (301) 975-2911 (301) 975-3603  ebarker@nist.gov roginsky@nist.gov  Block Cipher Modes of Operation  The engine for many of the techniques in NIST’s  cryptographic toolkit is a block cipher algorithm, such  as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm  or the Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (TDEA). A  block cipher transforms data of a fixed length, called  the block size, into seemingly random data of the  same length. There are many cryptographic methods  that feature block ciphers to achieve an information  service, such as confidentiality or authentication. Such  a method is called a block cipher mode of operation,  or, simply, a mode.  NIST has formally approved modes in the area of “key  wrapping”, i.e., the protection of the confidentiality  and integrity of cryptographic keys. NIST Special  Publication (SP) 800-38F, Recommendation for Block  Cipher Modes of Operation: Methods for Key Wrapping,  describes existing methods that are approved for  key wrapping, and also specifies three deterministic  authenticated-encryption modes: the AES Key Wrap  (KW) mode, the AES Key Wrap with Padding (KWP)  mode, and one TDEA mode, called TKW.  NIST is also developing a set of modes in the area  of “format preserving encryption” (FPE). A format is  a sequence of decimal digits, such as a credit card  number or a social security number; formats can also  be defined for other sets of characters besides decimal  digits. FPE is expected to be very useful because, in  order to retrofit encryption to existing applications, it  is sometimes necessary for the encrypted data to have  the same format as the original data.  NIST intends to approve three schemes of the  FFX framework for FPE that were submitted for  consideration in recent years: FFX-base, VAES3, and  BPS. (The submission documents are available at  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/BCM/modes_  development.html). A draft SP to specify and approve  these methods is expected to be ready for public  comment in early 2013.

An early breakthrough in this area was  Shor’s algorithm, which demonstrated that quantum  computers could efficiently factor integers and  compute discrete logarithms. These two problems play  an essential role in cryptography: they are believed to  be hard for classical computers, and they are the basis  for nearly all of the public-key cryptosystems that  are in widespread use today. If large-scale quantum  computers are ever built, they will be able to break  the existing public-key infrastructure.  The threat posed by quantum computers appears to  be serious, but not immediate. While there has been  dramatic progress in experimental quantum physics,  the construction of large-scale quantum computers still  seems to be many years away. Moreover, the discovery  of Shor’s algorithm has also motivated researchers  to propose so-called “post-quantum” cryptosystems  – public-key cryptosystems that would be secure  against quantum computers. It is hoped that these  cryptosystems will allow us to maintain the public-key  infrastructure in a world with quantum computers.  For these reasons, NIST has started a project on post- quantum cryptography, with a view to possible future  standards.  The primary focus of this project is to identify  candidate quantum-resistant systems, based on  algebraic codes, lattices, multivariate systems of  equations, cryptographic hash functions, or any other  construct that may be secure against both quantum  and classical computers, as well as the impact that  such post-quantum algorithms will have on current  protocols and security infrastructures. The project  endeavors to establish the viability of algorithms  in these areas, the security of which have yet to  be explained well even in the classical model, and  further, to verify the claims of quantum-resistance as  quantum complexity theory matures. In the event that  no candidate algorithm survives this examination, NIST  intends to establish computer security architectures  that are not dependent upon the classical public-key  cryptographic algorithms, such as the Rivest-Shamir- Adleman (RSA) algorithm or the Elliptic Curve Digital  Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) algorithm.  In FY2012, NIST researchers Stephen Jordan, Yi-Kai  Liu, Ray Perlner, and Daniel Smith-Tone internally  presented preliminary status reports in the areas of  quantum computation, coding-based cryptography,  lattice-based cryptography, and multivariate  cryptography, which included detailed surveys of  the respective fields, as well as security overviews  and specific results. These reports were further  supplemented with a presentation from William Whyte  and John Schanck from NTRU Cryptosystems on April  25, 2012, discussing the specific countermeasures  being deployed in the wake of a serious attack  on NTRUSign. NIST also engaged the international  cryptographic community with presentations and  publications by NIST researchers. At the very end  of FY2011, on September 23, 2011, Stephen Jordan  presented “Complexity Implications of Quantum Field  Theory,” at the Schloss Dagstuhl Workshop on Quantum  Cryptanalysis, discussing evidence that more modern  quantum field theories may not give rise to greater  computational power than the standard quantum  circuit model. In the first quarter of FY2012, Daniel  Smith-Tone published the paper, “On the Differential  Security of Multivariate Cryptosystems,” at the  Fourth International Conference on Post-Quantum  Cryptography, suggesting a new security metric for  multivariate cryptography.  Daniel Smith-Tone also  published, “The TriTon Transformation,” discussing  risky design philosophies in multivariate cryptography  at the Third Workshop on Mathematical Cryptology on  July 9, 2012. On September 28, 2012, at the Quantum  Information Science workshop at the NIST-University  of Maryland (UMD) Joint Quantum Institute, Yi-Kai Liu  gave a talk on “Applications of Quantum Information in  Machine Learning and Cryptography,” which discussed  the role played by quantum information in security  proofs for lattice-based cryptosystems.  In FY2013, NIST will continue to explore the security  capacity of purported quantum-resistant technologies  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  40  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  with the ultimate goal of uncovering the fundamental  mechanisms necessary for efficient, trustworthy, and  cost-effective information assurance in the post- quantum market. Upon the successful completion of  this phase of the project, NIST will be prepared for  possible standardization.

The Beacon  could be used in many applications that require a  secure random value (e.g., for privacy-enhanced  cryptography, multiparty contract bidding, and  tamper-proof voting), but is not intended for  generating values that must remain secret, such as  cryptographic keys. The Beacon will be designed  to provide unpredictability, autonomy, and  consistency. Unpredictability means that users cannot  algorithmically predict bits before they are made  available by the source. Autonomy means that the  source is resistant to attempts by outside parties to  alter the distribution of the random bits. Consistency  means that a set of users can access the source in such  a way that they are confident that they all receive the  same random string.  Strings of bits produced by the Beacon will be posted  in blocks of 512 bits every few seconds, with the  number of seconds being an adjustable parameter  that can vary from one second to a few minutes. Each  such value will be provided as an output packet that is  sequence-numbered, time-stamped, and signed, and  includes the hash of the previous value, in order to  chain the sequence of values together and prevent  an undetected change of an output package, even by  the source. Each packet will be stored for subsequent  online access.  In pursuit of this goal, a prototype implementation  of a public source of randomness is being developed  that is conformant to SP 800-90A, Recommendation  for Random Number Generation Using Deterministic  Random Bit Generators. The Beacon’s engine uses  multiple sources of entropy and leverages recently  developed tests to validate an entropy source.  During FY2012, NIST continued working on  implementing and enhancing the NIST Secure  Randomness Beacon. CSD also initiated collaboration  with NIST’s Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML)  to enhance the input source of entropy for the NIST  Randomness Beacon by integrating at least one  quantum source, also referred to as a “truly random  number.” The joint project, Quantum Randomness  as a Secure Resource, received ITL’s Innovations in  Measurement Science (IMS) award.  The ITL and PML collaborative work toward the  integration of at least one quantum-secure source of  entropy for the NIST Randomness Beacon will continue  in FY2013. A quantum source will be a sequence of  truly random numbers that is guaranteed by the laws of  physics to be unknowable in advance of its generation,  and uncorrelated with anything in the universe. With  such a quantum source, the NIST Randomness Beacon  can be used for a variety of security and privacy  applications that could lead to unprecedented levels of  network security for confidential digital applications,  thus setting the foundation for a trusted common  standard.  http://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/ct/nist_beacon.cfm  http://www.nist.gov/pml/div684/random_numbers_  bell_test.cfm  Contacts:  Dr. Michaela Iorga Dr. Rene Peralta  (301) 975-8431 (301) 975-8702  michaela.iorga@nist.gov rene.peralta@nist.gov  mailto:ray.perlner@nist.gov mailto:dustin.moody@nist.gov http://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/ct/nist_beacon.cfm http://www.nist.gov/pml/div684/random_numbers_bell_test.cfm http://www.nist.gov/pml/div684/random_numbers_bell_test.cfm mailto:michaela.iorga@nist.gov mailto:rene.peralta@nist.gov  41  Pairing-Based Cryptography  Recently, what are known as “pairings” on elliptic  curves have been a very active area of research  in cryptography. A pairing is a function that maps a  pair of points on an elliptic curve into a finite field.  Their unique properties have enabled many new  cryptographic protocols that had not previously been  feasible.  In particular, identity-based encryption (IBE) is a  pairing-based scheme that has received considerable  attention. IBE uses some form of a person (or entity’s)  identification to generate a public key. This could be  an email address, for instance. An IBE scheme allows  a sender to encrypt a message without needing a  receiver’s public key to have been certified and  distributed for subsequent use. Such a scenario is  quite useful if the pre-distribution of public keys is  impractical. Besides IBE, there are a number of other  applications of pairing-based cryptography. These  include many other identity-based cryptosystems  (including signature schemes), key establishment  schemes, functional and attribute-based encryption,  and privacy-enhancing techniques, such as the use of  anonymous credentials.  In 2008, NIST held a workshop on pairing-based  cryptography. While the workshop showed that there  was interest in pairing-based schemes, a common  understanding was that further study was needed  before NIST approved any such schemes. Starting in  2011, members of the Cryptography Technology Group  (CTG) have conducted an extensive study on pairing- based cryptographic schemes. This included topics such  as: the construction of pairing-friendly elliptic curves,  a survey of pairing-based cryptographic schemes,  implementation efficiency with respect to the required  security, standard activities involving pairing-based  schemes, use cases, and practical implications. This  work was summarized in a technical report, presented  in the first quarter of 2012. Throughout 2012, project  members have been identifying use cases for pairing- based cryptography. At the NIST Cryptography for  Emerging Technologies and Applications (CETA)  Workshop in November 2011, there was a public call  for feedback on potential use cases.  Pairing operations appear to be important tools  for various cryptographic schemes used in cloud  computing and privacy-enhancing environments.  Besides IBE, other demanding applications have  also motivated the continuation of this study. Short  signatures and broadcast encryption are examples of  such applications.

There are many ways CSD can develop and standardize  new methods to use cryptography that enhance  privacy. For example, public-key certificates used  for authentication often reveal more personally  identifiable information about the certificate holder  than is required for a given application.  What is often at issue in accessing data or resources  is not the identity of the customer, but whether the  customer is a member of an eligible group. Methods  that allow a user to selectively reveal and prove only  a specific property (such as that the user is at least  21 years old, has a particular place of residence, or  citizenship) are approaching commercial practicality.  Other techniques, such as those that will eventually  allow us to search encrypted databases, are still in  the research stage. However, these techniques are  sufficiently advanced that it behooves us to take  stock of the state of the art at this point. Still other  techniques, such as those that allow us to hold sealed- bid auctions without ever opening the bids, are known  to be practical, yet have received little attention by  those that might benefit from them. Such applications  fall within the scope of what are known as secure  multiparty computations.  In FY2012, NIST held a workshop on Privacy-Enhancing  Cryptographic Techniques to explore processes,  procedures, and potential applications that could  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  mailto:dustin.moody@nist.gov  42  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  benefit from the ability to operate on encrypted  data without decrypting it (see http://www.nist.  gov/itl/csd/ct/pec-workshop.cfm). Participants at  the workshop included scientists, privacy advocates,  and policy experts. Having planted the seeds for  cooperation among these different groups, CSD will  continue to pursue this objective in FY2013.  Another major activity for this project was in support  of the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in  Cyberspace (NSTIC) (see http://www.nist.gov/nstic).  Different cryptographic techniques that may be  important for this initiative are being continuously  evaluated.  Contact:  Dr. Rene Peralta  (301) 975-8702  peralta@nist.gov  Cryptography for Constrained Environments  Pervasive computing is the emerging area in which  many highly constrained devices are interconnected,  typically communicating wirelessly with one another,  and working in concert to accomplish some task. These  systems can be found in a wide variety of fields. Sample  application areas include: sensor networks, medical  devices, distributed control systems, and the Smart  Grid. Security can be very important in all of these  areas. For example, an unauthorized party should not  be able to take control of an insulin pump or the brakes  on a car. There are also privacy concerns, particularly  in the area of Health IT.  Because the majority of the current cryptographic  algorithms were designed for desktop/server  environments, many of these algorithms do not fit  into the constrained resources currently available.  If current algorithms can be made to fit into the  limited resources of constrained environments, their  performance is typically not acceptable. A particular  problem is the use of asymmetric (public key)  algorithms. These algorithms tend to be much more  computational and resource-intensive than can be easily  accommodated in such constrained environments.  As a result, NIST is currently focusing on studying the  NIST-approved symmetric algorithms in constrained  environments. Symmetric algorithms can be used  to perform encryption for confidentiality, as well as  to generate message authentication codes (MAC)  for message authentication. NIST has implemented  the current 256-bit version of the Secure Hash  Algorithm (SHA-256) to provide a Hash-based Message  Authentication Code (HMAC) for authentication.  Additionally, NIST has implemented the Advanced  Encryption Standard (AES) to provide confidentiality, as  well as the cipher-based message authentication code  (CMAC) mode for authentication. An outline of these  plans was provided at the Workshop on Cryptography  for Emerging Technologies and Applications hosted by  NIST in November 2011.  During the next year, NIST will investigate algorithms  other than those currently in its Cryptographic  Toolbox to find algorithms that are optimized for  operating in constrained environments. NIST will  analyze the resource requirements and performance  characteristics of these algorithms, and utilize these  block ciphers as building blocks to perform other  cryptographic functions beyond encryption.  Contact:  Mr. Lawrence Bassham  (301) 975-3292  lbassham@nist.gov  New Research Areas in Cryptographic  Techniques for Emerging Applications  In FY2012, NIST explored a few new research areas  in cryptographic techniques for emerging applications.  In particular, the research focused on stream ciphers,  secure group communications, group signatures, and  circuit complexity.  (1)  Stream Ciphers  Currently, the use of AES in the Output  Feedback Mode (OFB) mode and the counter  (CTR) mode are approved by NIST as block  cipher-based stream ciphers. However,  classical stream ciphers have performance  advantages for software implementations that  satisfy high-throughput requirements, or for  hardware implementations with constrained  http://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/ct/pec-workshop.cfm http://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/ct/pec-workshop.cfm mailto:lbassham@nist.gov mailto:peralta@nist.gov http://www.nist.gov/nstic  43  resources. The security and performance of  some of the well-understood stream ciphers  will be studied during FY2013, with a focus  on stream ciphers designed for constrained  environments.  (2)  Secure Group Communications  Secure group communications has been shown  to be important in public-safety networks,  smart grids, and sensor networks. The existing  schemes proposed in the research literature,  such as multicast encryption schemes and  group key-distribution schemes, have been  considered as general solutions, but are  less scalable for practical applications. In  FY2012, CSD looked into existing results and  explored different application scenarios.  The requirements and the restrictions were  also discussed. In FY2013, NIST will pursue  well-tailored solutions for secure group  communications.  (3)  Group Signatures  Group signatures have been investigated for  more than two decades. In general, a group  signature scheme allows a group member  to generate a signature on behalf of the  group without revealing information about  the specific signer. Numerous schemes  have been proposed and analyzed in the  research literature. Such an anonymity  feature is useful for security applications  in cloud computing. In FY2013, NIST will  further explore the features and underlying  mathematical structures for the existing  schemes.  (4)  Circuit Complexity  Any function can be described as a circuit  with operations modulo 2. If the circuit  contains only additions, then the function is  linear. Nonlinearity, which is fundamental to  cryptographic applications, can be achieved  only by the use of multiplications. The  standard description of the AES S-Box, which  is the nonlinearity component for AES, is that  it does inversion in the field of 256 elements.  The field’s standard measure of nonlinearity  of a function F is the Hamming distance of the  spectrum of F to the closest linear spectrum.  A different measure of nonlinearity is simply  the number of multiplications necessary  and sufficient to compute the function. This  measure is called “multiplicative complexity.”  CSD’s research in Boolean circuit optimization  has yielded circuits with optimal or near- optimal multiplicative complexity for a large  class of functions. The resulting circuits have  large linear components. CSD developed  new  heuristics for reducing the number of  gates in these components. The net result  is a significant reduction in the size and/or  depth of many circuits used in cryptography.  These include a circuit of depth 16 and size  128 for the AES S-Box, as well as reduced size/  depth circuits for high-speed cryptography in  characteristic 2. Additionally, circuits with a  small number of multiplications can be used  to significantly improve the communication  complexity of secure multiparty computations,  as well as the size of non-interactive  zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge.

The purpose of the workshop was to identify the  cryptographic requirements for emerging technologies  and applications.  The workshop provided an opportunity for the  government, industry, research and academic  communities to identify cryptographic challenges  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  mailto:rene.peralta@nist.gov mailto:james.nechvatal@nist.gov mailto:dustin.moody@nist.gov mailto:llchen@nist.gov mailto:meltem.turan@nist.gov  44  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  encountered in their development of emerging  technologies and applications, and to learn about  NIST’s current cryptographic research activities,  programs, and standards development.  In preparation for the workshop, NIST called  for the submission of abstracts that highlight the  cryptographic challenges identified during the  research and development of emerging technologies  and applications. Examples of emerging or evolving  technology spaces include: sensor and building  networks, mobile devices, smart objects/Internet of  things, and cyber physical systems (CPSs). Examples  of cryptographic requirements for emerging sectors  include performance or resource issues, cryptographic  services (such as anonymous or group signatures), or  key management challenges. Abstract submitters were  also encouraged to identify, through their submissions,  other areas of cryptography for emerging technologies  and applications.  NIST received twenty-eight abstracts. Out of these  abstracts, eleven were selected for presentation during  the workshop. In addition to these presentations, the  workshop included two keynote talks, an invited talk,  and six presentations by NIST. An open floor discussion  concluded the workshop. The workshop agenda and its  slide presentations are available at http://www.nist.  gov/itl/csd/ct/ceta-2011-agenda.cfm.

The  standard must be used in designing and implementing  cryptographic modules that federal departments and  agencies operate or are operated for them under  contract.  The current version of the standard is FIPS 140- 2. A proposed revision, FIPS 140-3, will supersede  FIPS 140-2, and is under development as a result of  the reexamination and reaffirmation of FIPS 140-2.  The draft revision of the standard adds new security  requirements that are imposed on cryptographic  modules to reflect the latest advances in technology and  security, and to mirror other new or updated standards  published by NIST in the areas of cryptography and  key management. Additionally, software and firmware  requirements are addressed in a new area dedicated  to software and firmware security, while another new  area specifying requirements to protect against non- invasive attacks is also provided.  Draft FIPS 140-3 provides four increasing qualitative  levels of security that are intended to cover a wide  range of potential applications and environments.  The security requirements cover areas related to the  secure design and implementation of a cryptographic  module. These areas include cryptographic module  specification; cryptographic module physical ports  and logical interfaces; roles, authentication, and  services; software security; operational environment;  physical security; physical security – non-invasive  attacks; sensitive security parameter management;  self-tests; life-cycle assurance; and mitigation of  other attacks. The standard provides users with a  specification of security features that are required  at each of four security levels, flexibility in choosing  security requirements, a guide to ensuring that the  cryptographic modules incorporate necessary security  features, and the assurance that the modules are  compliant with cryptography-based standards.  http://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/ct/ceta-2011-agenda.cfm http://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/ct/ceta-2011-agenda.cfm mailto:michaela.iorga@nist.gov mailto:ebarker@nist.gov  45  During FY2011, the majority of the resolutions to the  public comments received on the second draft were  incorporated in the draft FIPS and provided to NIST  and CSE Canada for a final internal technical review.  In response to comments received on the second  draft, the following possible changes or additions  to the previous draft document were proposed: a  description of the assumed thread models for each  security level; an insertion of missing definitions for  terms and acronyms; changes to the Trusted Channel  requirements; the removal of the Trusted Role;  the inclusion of an identity-based authentication  mechanism that would be allowed at Security Level (SL)  2; the addition of a self-initiated cryptographic output  capability and remote control capability; the inclusion  of additional integrity-technique requirements for the  software components of a cryptographic module; a  restructure of the annexes and enhancement of the  requirements for the allowed operator-authentication  mechanisms; an update of the list of the non-invasive  attacks methods for the security functions; and an  update of the requirements for the allowed modifiable  operating environments.  During the process of addressing the public comments  received on the second draft, NIST determined that  additional feedback would be required from the  public to resolve gaps and inconsistencies between  the comments received for particular sections of the  second draft of FIPS 140-3. As a result, NIST requested  additional public comments in August 2012 on several  clearly identified sections. More details about the  project and a timetable can be found at: http://csrc.  nist.gov/groups/ST/FIPS140_3/.  During FY2013, all received comments on the  identified issues will be addressed and the final FIPS  140-3 document will be prepared for a final internal  review and approval by the Secretary of Commerce.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/FIPS140_3/  Contact:  Dr. Michaela Iorga  (301) 975-8431  michaela.iorga@nist.gov  Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Test Cards  Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)  201, Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal  Employees and Contractors, was published in February  2005 to satisfy policy directives specified in Homeland  Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12). The  majority of federal workers now have Personal Identity  Verification (PIV) cards; however, the PIV card has not  yet been embraced as a mechanism for logical access  to IT resources. The unavailability of test PIV cards has  been identified as an impediment to deployment for  this purpose.  To facilitate the development of applications and  middleware that support the PIV card, CSD developed  a reference set of smart cards. Each set includes  sixteen cards: nine valid cards and seven cards that  contain invalid data. The valid cards differ in terms  of the cryptographic algorithms used to sign the data  objects, the types and sizes of the cardholder’s key  pairs, and in the presence or absence of optional  data objects. The invalid cards include cards that are  expired, cards that have certificates that have been  revoked, and cards with data objects that have invalid  signatures.  This set of test cards includes not only examples  that are similar to cards that are currently issued  today, but also examples of cards with features that  are expected to appear in cards that will be issued  in the future. For example, while the certificates and  data objects on most, if not all, cards issued today are  signed using RSA PKCS #1 v1.5, the set of test cards  includes examples of certificates and data objects  that are signed using each of the algorithms and key  sizes approved for use with PIV cards, including the  RSA Probabilistic Signature Scheme (RSASSA-PSS)  and the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm  (ECDSA). Similarly, the infrastructure supporting  the test cards provides examples of Certificate  Revocation Lists (CRLs) and Online Certificate Status  Protocol (OCSP) responses that are signed using  each of these signature algorithms. The set of test  cards also includes certificates with elliptic curve  cryptography (ECC) subject public keys, in addition to  RSA subject public keys, as is permitted by Table 3-1 of  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/FIPS140_3/ http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/FIPS140_3/ mailto:michaela.iorga@nist.gov http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/FIPS140_3  46  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  Lorie, this image was used in last year’s annual report.  Guess you can use the same image as used last year.  Thanks.  Pat  SP 800-78-3, Interfaces for Personal Identity  Verification. The set of test cards, collectively, also  includes all of the mandatory and optional data  objects listed in Section 3 of SP 800-73-3 Part 1,  except for Cardholder Iris Images. Several of the cards  include a Key History object, along with retired key  management keys. The certificates that appear on  the test cards, both the cardholders’ certificates and  the content signers’ certificates, were issued from a  simple two-level hierarchy.  The initial work of developing the test cards was  performed during FY2011. In early FY2012, CSD created  a few sets of test cards,  which were distributed  to organizations that had  previously volunteered  to serve as beta testers.  During the beta-testing  period, the test cards were  used in a few different  environments, and it was  determined that no changes  needed to be made to the  specifications for the cards.  In late FY2012, NIST began  the production of the final sets of test cards, and the  cards are now available as NIST Special Database 33  (http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/testcards.html).

The OMB policy memorandum defines four levels of  authentication in terms of assurance about the validity  of an asserted identity. SP 800-63-1 gives technical  requirements and examples of authentication  technologies that meet the requirements by making  individuals demonstrate possession and control of  a secret for each of the four levels. In FY2013, NIST  plans to develop a minor revision to the SP 800-63-1  identity-proofing requirements to better accommodate  medical professionals.  In the course of developing the revision to the  Electronic Authentication Guideline, NIST researchers  have come across gaps that prevent large-scale  adoption of secure authentication online. Two such  areas are revocation in complex federated  environments and biometric authentication in  unattended scenarios.  With regard to revocation, a large number of Identity  Management Systems (IDMSs) are being deployed  worldwide that use different technologies for the  population of their users. With the diverse set of  technologies, and the unique business requirements  for organizations to federate, there is no uniform  approach to the federation process. Similarly, there  is no uniform method to revoke credentials or their  associated attribute(s) in a federated community. In  the absence of a uniform revocation method, NIST  researchers have been exploring and developing a  model for revocation of credentials and attributes in  a federated environment, with a particular focus on  identifying missing requirements.  To address the use of biometrics in authentication  for transactions online, NIST is considering high- level requirements for the use of biometrics in a  multi-factor authentication framework, such as  liveness detection (sometimes called biometric  spoof detection), biometric template protection (for  revoking and renewing biometric credentials), and  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/testcards.html mailto:william.polk@nist.gov mailto:david.cooper@nist.gov http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/testcards.html  47  web services standards for securely and uniformly  handling biometric data online. NIST is leading multi- year projects and collaborating with the international  research and standards communities in all three of  these areas.  With respect to liveness detection, NIST is leading the  development of the first standards activity on liveness  detection and held a workshop to discuss a framework  for measurement, interchangeable data, and testing  in March 2012. On the topic of biometric template  protection, a paper on “Criteria Towards Metrics for  Benchmarking Template Protection Algorithms” was  published at this year’s International Conference  on Biometrics, the result of a grant from NIST and  collaboration with researchers in CSD. This work was  followed up with a workshop in July 2012, co-hosted  with Fraunhofer and the Biometrics Institute, at the  Association Française de Normalisation (AFNOR) (co- located with a biometric standards meeting). Finally,  NIST’s continued efforts in the area of biometric web  services have yielded NIST SP 500-288, Specification for  WS-Biometric Devices, and a reference implementation  of the Specification for Web Service Biometric Device  (WS-BD) in both Java and .NET.

In such a heterogeneous network,  a mobile device may switch its connection to the  network between different wireless technologies.  Inter-technology handover has brought many  challenges to existing security solutions, such as  the delays caused by access authentication for each  handover. New trust models for key management are  also required. NIST has conducted intensive research  in the security for media-independent handover and  has actively participated in the IEEE 802 wireless  standard activities. In FY2012, the mechanisms to  provide services for proactive authentications and  key distributions for inter-technology handover have  been standardized in Amendment 2 for the IEEE  802.21 Media Independent Handover Services. The  mechanisms will enable secure media-independent  handover in heterogeneous networks.  In FY2013, NIST will continue to conduct research on  the security mechanisms for next-generation wireless  networks and pursue security solutions for group  management through participation in the standards  activities of the IEEE 802.21d task group.  Contact:  Dr. Lily Chen  (301) 975-6974  llchen@nist.gov  Validation Programs  Î Cryptographic Programs and  Laboratory Accreditation  The Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program  (CAVP) and the Cryptographic Module Validation  Program (CMVP) were developed by NIST to support  the needs of the user community for strong,  independently tested, and commercially available  cryptographic algorithms and modules. Through these  programs, NIST works with private and governmental  sectors and the cryptographic community to achieve  security, interoperability, and assurance of correct  implementation. The goal of these programs is to  promote the use of validated algorithms, modules, and  products and to provide federal agencies with a security  metric to use in procuring cryptographic modules.  The testing carried out by independent third-party  laboratories accredited by the NIST National Voluntary  Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) and the  validations performed by the CMVP and CAVP programs  provide this metric. Federal agencies, industry, and  the public can choose cryptographic modules and/or  products containing cryptographic modules from the  CMVP Validated Modules List and have confidence in  the claimed level of security and assurance of correct  implementation.  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  48  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  Cryptographic algorithm and cryptographic module  testing and validation are based on underlying published  standards and guidance that are developed within the  Computer Security Division (CSD) in collaboration with  many other organizations. As federal agencies are  required to use validated cryptographic modules for  the protection of sensitive nonclassified information,  the validated modules and the validated algorithms  that the modules contain represent the culmination  and delivery of the division’s cryptography-based work  to the end user.  The CAVP and the CMVP are separate, collaborative  programs based on a partnership between NIST’s CSD  and the Communication Security Establishment Canada  (CSEC). The programs provide federal agencies — in the  United States and Canada — confidence that a validated  cryptographic algorithm has been implemented  correctly and that a validated cryptographic module  meets a claimed level of security assurance. The  CAVP and the CMVP validate algorithms and modules  used in a wide variety of products, including secure  Internet browsers, secure radios, smart cards, space- based communications, munitions, security tokens,  storage devices, and products supporting Public Key  Infrastructure (PKI) and electronic commerce. A  module may be a standalone product, such as a virtual  private network (VPN), smart card or toolkit, or one  module may be used in several products; as a result, a  small number of modules may be incorporated within  hundreds of products. Likewise, the CAVP validates  cryptographic algorithms that may be integrated in  one or more cryptographic modules.  The two validation programs (the CAVP and CMVP)  provide documented methodologies for conformance  testing through defined sets of security requirements.  Security requirements for the CAVP are found in the  individual validation system documents containing the  validation test suites that are required to assure that  the algorithm has been implemented correctly. The  validation system documents are designed for each  FIPS-approved and NIST-recommended cryptographic  algorithm. Security requirements for the CMVP are  found in FIPS 140-2, Security Requirements for  Cryptographic Modules, and the associated test metrics  and methods in Derived Test Requirements for FIPS  140-2. Annexes to FIPS 140-2 reference the underlying  cryptographic algorithm standards or methods.  Federal agencies are required to use modules that  were validated as conforming to the provisions of FIPS  140-2. The CMVP developed Derived Test Requirements  associated with FIPS 140-2 to define the security  requirements and the test metrics and methods to  ensure repeatability of tests and equivalency in results  across the testing laboratories.

Likewise, the CAVP reviews the  cryptographic algorithm validation requests submitted  by the accredited laboratories. With these insights, the  CAVP and CMVP can perform research and development  of new test metrics and methods as they evolve.  Based on this research, the CAVP and CMVP publish  implementation guidance to assist vendors, testing  laboratories, and the user community in the latest  0  100  200  300  400  500  600  19 95  19 96  19 97  19 98  19 99  20 00  20 01  20 02  20 03  20 04  20 05  20 06  20 07  20 08  20 09  20 10  20 11  20 12  Projected  Level 4  Level 3  Level 2  Level 1  FIPS 140-1 and FIPS 140-2 Validated  Modules by Year and Level  (November 30, 2012)  programmatic and technical guidance. This guidance  provides clarity, consistency of interpretation, and  insight for successful conformance testing, validation,  and revalidation.  The unique position of the validation programs gives  CMVP the opportunity to acquire insight during the  validation review activities and results in practical,  timely, and up-to-date guidance that is needed by the  testing laboratories and vendors to move their modules  and products out to the user community in a timely  and cost-effective manner and with the assurance  of third-party conformance testing. This knowledge  and insight provide a foundation for future standards  development.  The CAVP and the CMVP have stimulated improved  quality and security assurance of cryptographic  modules. The latest set of statistics, which are collected  quarterly from each of the testing laboratories, shows  that 8 percent of the cryptographic algorithms and  61 percent of the cryptographic modules brought in  for voluntary testing had security flaws that were  corrected during testing. Without this program,  the federal government would have had less than a  50 percent chance of buying correctly implemented  cryptography. To date, over 1,850 cryptographic  module validation certificates have been issued,  representing over 4,275 modules that were validated  by the CMVP. These modules have been developed by  more than 400 domestic and international vendors.  The CAVP issued 2,225 algorithm validations and  the CMVP issued 191 module validation certificates  in FY2012. The number of algorithms and modules  submitted for validation continues to grow, representing  significant growth in the number of validated products  expected to be available in the future.`  FIPS 140-1 and FIPS 140-2 Validation  Certificates by Fiscal Year and Level  ( November 30, 2012)  0  50  100  150  200  250  19 96  19 97  19 98  19 99  20 00  20 01  20 02  20 03  20 04  20 05  20 06  20 07  20 08  20 09  20 10  20 11  20 12  20 13  Level 4  Level 3  Level 2  Level 1  CAVP Validation Status By FYs  0  500  1000  1500  2000  2500  FY 19  96  FY 19  98  FY 20  00  FY 20  02  FY 20  04  FY 20  06  FY 20  08  FY 20  10  FY 20  12  TDES  SJ  SH A  RSA  RNG  KDF  KAS  HM AC  ECDSA  DSA  DRB G  DES  Co mpo ne nt  Te s t  AES  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  50  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  Page 1 of 1  CAVP Validated Implementation Actual Numbers  Updated As Wednesday, October 03, 2012  FiscalYear AES Comp.

Easter Ms. Sharon Keller  (301) 975-4641 (301) 975-2910  randall.easter@nist.gov sharon.keller@nist.gov  Î Automated Security Testing and Test  Suite Development  NIST’s Cryptographic Technology Group (CTG) and  Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP)  work closely throughout the specification and guideline  development process to develop guidance and  specifications for cryptographic-based security that can  be tested at the algorithm level to provide assurance  that the algorithms are implemented correctly.  The  CTG is responsible for developing Federal Information  Processing Standards (FIPS) and Special Publications  (SPs), which contain guidance for cryptographic-based  security. This includes the specification of approved  cryptographic algorithms and the development of  guidelines for using these cryptographic mechanisms  to provide secure and reliable protection for federal  information. NIST’s Cryptographic Algorithm Validation  Program (CAVP) is responsible for providing assurance  that the algorithms are implemented correctly.  The CAVP does this by designing and developing  conformance testing for implementations of these  algorithms.  The conformance tests consist of a suite of validation  tests for each approved cryptographic algorithm.  These tests exercise the mathematical formulas  and the algorithmic requirements detailed in the  algorithm to assure that the detailed specifications  are implemented correctly and completely. If the  implementer deviates from or excludes any part of  these instructions or requirements, the validation test  will fail, indicating that the algorithm implementation  does not function properly or is incomplete.  CAVP developed validation tests are performed by  accredited testing laboratories on a vendor’s algorithm  implementation using automated known-answer  mailto:sharon.keller@nist.gov mailto:randall.easter@nist.gov http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM  51  tests, which compare the result from a cryptographic  operation with a specific input against the expected  result. They provide a uniform way to assure that the  cryptographic algorithm implementation adheres to  the detailed specifications.  There are several types of validation tests, all designed  to satisfy the testing requirements of the cryptographic  algorithms and their specifications. These include, but  are not limited to, Known-Answer Tests, Monte Carlo  Tests, and Multi-Block Message Tests. The Known- Answer Tests are designed to test the conformance  of the implementation under test (IUT) to the various  specifications in the reference document. This involves  testing the components of the algorithm to assure  that they are implemented correctly. The Monte Carlo  Test is designed to exercise the entire IUT. This test  is designed to detect the presence of implementation  flaws that are not detected with the controlled input of  the Known-Answer Tests. The types of implementation  flaws detected by this validation test include pointer  problems, insufficient allocation of space, improper  error handling, and incorrect behavior of the IUT. The  Multi-Block Message Test (MMT) is designed to test the  ability of the implementation to process multi-block  messages, which require the chaining of information  from one block to the next.  Automated security testing and test suite development  are integral components of the CAVP. The CAVP  encompasses validation testing for FIPS-approved  and NIST-recommended cryptographic algorithms.  Cryptographic algorithm validation is a prerequisite to  the cryptographic module validation performed by the  Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP). The  testing of cryptographic algorithm implementations is  performed by independent third-party laboratories.  The CAVP develops and maintains a Cryptographic  Algorithm Validation System (CAVS) tool that automates  the cryptographic algorithm validation testing.  During the last few years, the scope of requirements  within the CTG’s publications has expanded to include  not only an algorithm’s specification, but also how an  algorithm should be used. Many of these requirements  are outside the scope of the algorithm boundary and  therefore cannot be tested at the algorithm level by  the CAVP. Some of the requirements are routinely  tested within NIST’s Cryptographic Module Validation  Program (CMVP), which validates cryptographic  modules. Other requirements could potentially  be tested by the CMVP, while others cannot; in the  latter case, the fulfillment of the requirements is the  responsibility of entities using, installing, or configuring  applications or protocols that use the cryptographic  algorithms. For example, depending on the design of  a cryptographic module, it may not be possible for the  module to determine whether or not a specific key is  used for multiple purposes, a situation that is strongly  discouraged.  The CAVS tool currently has algorithm validation  testing for the following cryptographic algorithms:  Cryptographic  Algorithm/Component  Special Publication or FIPS  Triple Data Encryption  Standard (TDES)  SP 800-67, Recommendation  for the Triple Data Encryption  Algorithm (TDEA) Block  Cipher, and SP 800-38A,  Recommendation for Block  Cipher Modes of Operation–  Methods and Techniques  Advanced Encryption  Standard (AES)  FIPS 197, Advanced Encryption  Standard, and SP 800-38A  Digital Signature  Standard (DSS)  FIPS 186-2, Digital  Signature Standard (DSS),  with change notice 1,  dated October 5, 2001  FIPS 186-3, Digital  Signature Standard (DSS),  dated June 2009  Elliptic Curve Digital Signature  Algorithm (ECDSA)  FIPS 186-2, Digital Signature  Standard (DSS), with change  notice 1, dated October  5, 2001 and ANSI X9.62  FIPS 186-3, Digital Signature  Standard (DSS), dated June  2009 and ANSI X9.62  RSA algorithm ANSI X9.31 and Public Key  Cryptography Standards  (PKCS) #1 v2.1: RSA  Cryptography Standard-2002  FIPS 186-3, Digital Signature  Standard (DSS), dated June  2009 and ANSI X9.31 and  Public Key Cryptography  Standards (PKCS) #1 v2.1: RSA  Cryptography Standard-2002  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  Cryptographic Special Publication Algorithm/Component or FIPS  Hashing algorithms SHA- FIPS 180-4, Secure  1, SHA-224, SHA-256, Hash Standard (SHS),  SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA- dated March 2012  512/224, SHA-512/256  Random number generator FIPS 186-2 Appendix 3.1 and  (RNG) algorithms 3.2; ANSI X9.62 Appendix A.4  Deterministic Random SP 800-90, Recommendation  Bit Generators (DRBG) for Random Number  Generation Using Deterministic  Random Bit Generators  Keyed-Hash Message FIPS 198, The Keyed-Hash  Authentication Code (HMAC) Message Authentication  Code (HMAC)  Counter with Cipher SP 800-38C, Recommendation  Block Chaining-Message for Block Cipher Modes  Authentication Code of Operation: the CCM  (CCM) mode Mode for Authentication  and Confidentiality  Cipher-based Message SP 800-38B, Recommendation  Authentication Code (CMAC) for Block Cipher Modes  Mode for Authentication of Operation: The CMAC  Mode for Authentication  Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) SP 800-38D, Recommendation  GMAC Mode of Operation for Block Cipher Modes of  Operation: Galois/Counter  Mode (GCM) and GMAC,  dated November 2007  XTS Mode of Operation SP800-38E, Recommendation  for Block Cipher Modes of  Operation: The XTS-AES  Mode for Confidentiality  on Block-Oriented Storage  Devices, dated January 2010  Key Agreement Schemes SP 800-56A, Recommendation  and Key Confirmation for Pair-Wise Key  Establishment Schemes  Using Discrete Logarithm  Cryptography, dated  March 2007  All of SP 800-56A except KDF SP 800-56A All sections  except Section 5.8 Key  Derivation Functions for  Key Agreement Schemes  SP 800-56A Section 5.7.1.2 SP 800-56A Section 5.7.1.2  ECC CDH function Elliptic Curve Cryptography  Cofactor Diffie-Hellman (ECC  CDH) Primitive Testing  Key-Based Key Derivation SP800-108, Recommendation  functions (KBKDF) for Key Derivation using  Pseudorandom Functions,  dated October 2009  Cryptographic Special Publication Algorithm/Component or FIPS  Application-Specific Key SP800-135 (Revision 1)  Derivation functions (ASKDF) Recommendation for  (includes KDFs used by IKEv1, Existing Application-Specific  IKEv2, TLS, ANS X9.63-2001, key Derivation Functions,  SSH, SRTP, SNMP, and TPM dated December 2011  Component test – ECDSA FIPS 186-3, Digital Signature  Signature Generation of hash Standard (DSS), dated June  value (This component test 2009 and ANSI X9.62  verifies the signing of a hash- sized input.

These efforts bring consistent testing  of cryptographic modules to the global community.  ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27 WG 3 has progressed on the  revision of ISO/IEC 19790 and the revision of ISO/  IEC 24759 for which Randall J. Easter of CSD is the  editor. The revision of 19790 was completed, and it  was published August 15, 2012. ISO/IEC 19790:2012  was also adopted by the American National Standards  Institute (ANSI). The first Committee Draft (CD) of  24759 was completed in July 2012 and circulated  for national body comment. It is expected that the  revision of 24759 will be published in FY2013.  Work is nearing completion on the Technical Report  document, ISO/IEC 30104 “Physical Security Attacks,  Mitigation Techniques and Security Requirements,”  for which Randall J. Easter of CSD is the editor. A  final draft of 30104 was completed in June 2012 and  circulated for national body comment.  Work is progressing on a new standard document,  ISO/IEC 17825 “Testing methods for the mitigation of  non-invasive attack classes against cryptographic,”  for which Randall J. Easter of CSD is the editor. The  second working draft of 17825 was completed in June  2012 and circulated for national body comment.  National body comments for the above three  documents will be addressed at the 45th SC 27 WG 3  meeting to be held in Rome, Italy, in October 2012.  A new work item was proposed (NWIP) at the 44th  SC 27 WG 3 meeting, which was held in May 2012,  to address “Cryptographic algorithms and security  mechanisms conformance testing.” It is expected to  be approved as a new work item at the 45th SC 27 WG  3 with Randall J.

Conformance testing  is necessary because SCAP is a complex specification  consisting of eleven individual specifications that work  together to meet various use cases. A single error in  product implementation could result in undetected  vulnerabilities or policy noncompliance within agency  and industry networks.  The SCAP Validation Program was created by request  of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to  support the Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC)  and United States Government Configuration Baseline  (USGCB). The program coordinates its work with the  NIST National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation  Program (NVLAP) to set up independent conformance  testing laboratories that conduct the testing based  on draft NISTIR 7511 Revision 3, Security Content  Automation Protocol (SCAP) Version 1.2 Validation  Program Test Requirements. When testing is completed,  the laboratory submits a test report to CSD for review  and approval. SCAP validation testing has been  designed to be inexpensive, yet effective. The SCAP  conformance tests are either easily human-verifiable  or automated through NIST-provided reference tools.  To date, the program has 9 accredited independent  laboratories and has validated 50 products from 32  different vendors.

Expansion  plans include support for United States Government  Configuration Baseline (USGCB) releases, public SCAP  validation test content, and expanded automated  testing capabilities.  http://scap.nist.gov/validation/  Contact:  Ms. Melanie Cook  (301) 975-5259  melanie.cook@nist.gov  Identity Management  Î Personal Identity Verification (PIV)  and FIPS 201 Revision Efforts  In response to Homeland Security Presidential  Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Policy for a Common  Identification Standard for Federal Employees and  Contractors, Federal Information Processing Standard  (FIPS) 201, Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of  Federal Employees and Contractors, was developed  and was approved by the Secretary of Commerce in  February 2005. HSPD-12 calls for the creation of a  new identity credential for federal employees and  contractors. FIPS 201 is the technical specification of  both the PIV identity credential and the PIV system  that produces, manages, and uses the credential. This  work is done in collaboration with the Cryptographic  Technology Group.  CSD activities in FY2012 directly supported the  revision and maintenance of the FIPS 201 standard.  CSD performed the following activities during FY2012  to revise the standard:  �� Drafted and published a second public- comment draft of FIPS 201-2 on July 9,  2012. Revised draft FIPS 201-2 reflects the  disposition of more than 1,000 comments  received from over 40 organizations on  the first public-comment draft of FIPS  201-2. NIST coordinated with the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) and other  U.S. government (USG) stakeholders before  incorporating changes in the revised draft  FIPS 201-2;  �� Organized and facilitated a workshop  to discuss the contents of revised draft  FIPS 201-2. NIST held a one-day workshop  on July 25, 2012, to discuss contents of  revised draft FIPS 201-2. The workshop was  another mechanism to reach out to the PIV  community, to interact with implementers  and vendors, to clarify and explain changes  in revised draft FIPS 201-2 as a result of  comment dispositions, and to encourage the  PIV community to provide formal comments  to NIST; and  �� Processed and analyzed comments received  on revised draft FIPS 201-2. NIST started to  review and process more than 500 comments  received from over 30 organizations.  In FY2013, CSD will be focusing on completing the  revision of draft FIPS 201-2 and updating the relevant  Special Publications (SP) associated with FIPS 201-2. In  addition to updating the relevant publications, CSD will  also develop two new SPs: SP 800-156, Representation  of PIV Chain-of-Trust for Import and Export, and SP  800-157, Guidelines for Personal Identity Verification  (PIV) Derived Credentials. CSD will also continue to  provide technical and strategic inputs to the PIV- related initiatives.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv  Contacts:  Ms. Hildegard Ferraiolo Dr. David Cooper  (301) 975-6972 (301) 975-3194  hildegard.ferraiolo@nist.gov david.cooper@nist.gov  Î NIST Personal Identity Verification  Program (NPIVP)  The objective of the NIST Personal Identity Verification  Program (NPIVP) is to validate PIV components for  conformance to specifications in FIPS 201 and its  companion documents. The two PIV components that  come under the scope of NPIVP are PIV Smart Card  Application and PIV Middleware. All of the tests under  55  NPIVP are handled by third-party laboratories that  are accredited as Cryptographic and Security Testing  (CST) Laboratories by the NIST National Voluntary  Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) and are  called accredited NPIVP test facilities. As of September  2011, there are ten such facilities.  In prior years, CSD published Special Publication  (SP) 800-85A, PIV Card Application and Middleware  Interface Test Guidelines, to facilitate development  of PIV Smart Card Application and PIV Middleware  that conform to interface specifications in SP 800-73,  Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification. CSD also  developed an integrated toolkit called “PIV Interface  Test Runner” for conducting tests on both PIV Card  Application and PIV Middleware products, and provided  the toolkit to accredited NPIVP test facilities.  Throughout FY2012, the versions of the documents  that were used as the basis for NPIVP validation are  the following:  �� Card and Middleware Interface Specification  - SP 800-73-3; and  �� Card Application and Middleware  Conformance Tests - SP 800-85A-2.  In FY2012, six new PIV card application products were  validated for conformance to SP 800-73-3, and were  issued certificates, bringing the total number of NPIVP- validated PIV Card application products to 35. Two PIV  Middleware products were validated for conformance  to SP 800-73-3 and were issued certificates, bringing  the total number of NPIVP-validated PIV Middleware  products to 19.  In addition, NPIVP completed all planning tasks  relating to update of all FIPS 201 companion documents  as well as the PIV Test Runner toolkit consequent on  the expected publication of FIPS 201-2.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/npivp  Contacts:  Dr. Ramaswamy Chandramouli Ms. Hildegard Ferraiolo  (301) 975-5013 (301) 975-6972  mouli@nist.gov hildegard.ferraiolo@nist.gov  Research in Emerging Technologies  Î Cloud Computing and Virtualization  Cloud computing offers the possibility to increase the  efficiency of IT services, to decreased cost in terms  of capital expenses (CAPEX) and operational expenses  (OPEX), and to leverage leading-edge technologies to  meet the information processing needs of the United  States government (USG). However, the change in  control dynamics poses new security challenges for the  cloud computing adopters.  To accelerate the federal government’s secure  adoption of cloud computing, NIST assumed the leading  role in developing standards and guidelines in close  consultation and collaboration with standards bodies,  the private sector, and other stakeholders. NIST’s long- term goal is to provide thought leadership and guidance  around the cloud computing paradigm to catalyze its  use within industry and government. The NIST area of  focus is technology, and specifically, interoperability,  portability, and security requirements, standards, and  guidance.  NIST Cloud Computing Program Support  NIST Cloud Computing Program strategically prioritizes  NIST tactical projects that support USG agencies in  their missions of secure and effective cloud computing  adoption.  During FY2012, the NIST Cloud Computing team  continued to promote the development of national and  international standards and specifications that support  USG’s effective and secure use of cloud computing and  to provide technical guidance to USG  agencies for a  secure and effective cloud computing adoption.  The CSD members of the NIST cloud computing team  contributed to the research and development efforts  of several public working groups which focused their  activities on:  �� Surveying the existing standards landscape  for security, portability, and interoperability  standards/models/studies/etc. relevant to  cloud computing, determining standards  gaps, and identifying standardization  priorities, to develop a NIST Cloud Computing  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  56  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  Standards Roadmap that can be incorporated  into the USG Cloud Computing Technology  Roadmap (the Standards Roadmap Working  Group);  ��Developing a USG Cloud Computing  Technology Roadmap that defines  and prioritizes USG requirements for  interoperability, portability, and security  for effective cloud computing adoption  (the Reference Architecture and Taxonomy  Working Group);  ��Developing a NIST Cloud Computing Security  Reference Architecture – a framework  and methodology for the secure adoption  of cloud computing, which supplements  the NIST Reference Architecture (Security  Working Group);  ��Supporting the cloud computing groups under  the Federal CIO Council, providing technical  advice to the Cloud Computing Executive  Steering Committee, to the Cloud Computing  Advisory Council, to the Information Security  and Identity Management, and the Web 2.0  working group (the Federal Cloud Computing  Standards and Technology Working Group);  and  ��Formulating a strategy for facilitating  the development of high-quality cloud  computing standards and describing a  process for formulating cloud computing use  cases and for judging the extent to which  cloud system interfaces can satisfy them  (the Standards Acceleration to Jumpstart  Adoption of Cloud Computing (SAJACC)  Working Group).  During FY2012, the NIST cloud computing team  supported the fourth Cloud Computing Forum held  in June 2012, at the Department of Commerce in  Washington, D.C.  The cloud computing team contributed to the NIST  Standards Working Group efforts of developing the  draft Special Publication (SP) 500-292, NIST Reference  Architecture, and draft SP 500-293, U.S. Government  Cloud Computing Technology Roadmap (volumes 1, 2,  and 3).  The CSD cloud computing team also led the NIST Security  Working Group’s task of developing the NIST Cloud  Computing - Security Reference Architecture working  document, and contributed to the development of the  white paper “Challenging Security Requirements for  the USG Cloud Computing Adoption.”  In FY2012, the leadership of the SAJACC Public  Working Group, previously provided by CSD, was  transitioned to other members of the Working Group,  while the governance was kept with the NIST Cloud  Computing Program.  In FY2012, the NIST cloud computing team also  presented the results of cloud computing research  and development, introduced the standards and  specifications under development, and provided status  of the NIST Cloud Computing Program in a variety of  conferences and workshops.  Leveraging Access Control for Cloud Computing  In 2012, CSD continued the extensive research and  development of a virtualization-based, enterprise- wide controlled delivery of data services for advanced  cloud computing through Access Control (AC). Data  services (DSs) are capabilities that enable the  reading, manipulation, computation, presentation,  management, and sharing of data. Typical DSs include  applications such as email, workflow management,  enterprise calendar, and records management, as well  as system-level features, such as file, access control,  and identity management. Although access control  currently plays an important role in securing DSs, if  properly envisaged and designed, AC can serve a more  vital role in computing than one might expect. The  Policy Machine (PM), a framework for AC developed  at NIST, was designed with this goal in mind. The PM  has evolved beyond just a concept to a prototype  implementation and is now (FY2012 & FY2013), being  implemented in a virtualized environment providing  cloud-like features.  To appreciate the PM’s advantages in computing, it  is important to recognize the methods in which DSs  are delivered today. Each DS runs in an Operating  Environment (OE) and an OE can be of many types  (e.g., operating systems, web services, middleware,  and database and database applications), each  57  implementing its own routines to enable the execution  of DS-specific operations (e.g., read, send, and view)  on their respective data types (e.g., files, messages,  and fields).  This heterogeneity among OEs introduces a number  of administrative and policy enforcement challenges  and user inconveniences. Administrators must contend  with a multitude of security domains when managing  privileges, and ordinary users and administrators  alike must authenticate to and establish sessions  within different OEs in order to exercise legitimate  DS capabilities. Even if properly coordinated across  OEs, access control policies are not always globally  enforced. An email application may, for example,  distribute files to users regardless of an operating  system’s protection settings on those files. Also, while  researchers, practitioners, and policy makers have  specified a large variety of access control policies to  address real-world security issues, only a relatively  small subset of these policies can be enforced through  off-the-shelf technology, and even a smaller subset  can be enforced by any one OE.  It is the CSD Cloud Computing team’s experience  that the PM can provide an enterprise-wide OE that  dramatically alleviates many of the administrative,  policy enforcement, data interoperability, and  usability issues that enterprises face today.  In particular, the cloud infrastructure is an OE in  which the PM’s functional components run in virtual  machines. In this deployment, users and data objects  can be provisioned, and DSs can be selected by the  subscriber. DSs can be provided as SaaS or PaaS if  they conform to the PM’s API. CSD PM-motivated  cloud differs from other types of clouds in the  properties that it provides—users and objects are  global, the framework is object type agnostic, DSs  naturally interoperate, and AC policies are managed  and enforced comprehensively across all DSs. CSD’s  cloud is also different in the degree of control  that it offers to its subscribers. AC Policies can be  imported from a library of predefined configurations,  or can be configured from scratch by the subscriber,  conferring PM the attributes of a Policy-as-a-Service  (POLICYaaS) provider. POLICYaaS supports a wide  range of policies including well-documented policies  such as Role-based Access Control, Discretionary  Access Control, and Mandatory Access Control, as well  as combinations of those policies. POLICYaaS can also  accommodate separation of duty, conflict-of-interest,  data tracking, and confinement policies, and should  likely accommodate other unanticipated policies of  the future.  The practical advantages of this PM-enabled cloud are  many. Through a single authenticated session, users  are offered capabilities of a variety of DSs to include  office applications, file management, email, workflow,  and records management. Data is naturally protected  across DSs. Instead of deploying and managing different  AC schemes for different DSs, select capabilities (of  different DSs) are delivered to select users, under  combinations of arbitrary, but mission-tailored forms  of discretionary, mandatory, and history-based ACs.  This interoperability property is not achieved through  features or interfaces built into the DS, but rather  through the OE that inherently provides a foundational  basis for interoperability.  Virtualization Security & Leveraging Virtualization  for Security  Virtualization is one of the foundational technologies  that facilitate the use of a computing infrastructure for  cloud computing services. At the core of a virtualized  infrastructure is the virtualized host that provides  abstraction of the hardware (i.e., CPU, memory,  etc.) enabling multiple computing stacks (made up  of O/S, Middleware and Applications) to be run on a  single physical machine. The software that provides  the abstraction features as well as the management  capability to run multiple computing stacks (called  Virtual Machines or VMs) is called the Hypervisor. The  hypervisor also provides functions to define an entirely  software-defined network inside a virtualized host  (called a Virtual Network) for enabling communication  among VMs running inside the virtualized host as well  as to enable connectivity with the enterprise network  outside the host. In addition, virtualization can also  be implemented for the data storage infrastructure as  well.  Taking into account the widespread scope for  virtualization in the IT infrastructure, CSD has taken  a comprehensive view of the security implications of  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  58  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  this technology through a multifaceted approach that  includes the following perspectives.  Perspective 1: Ensuring protection of the core  virtualization module - the Hypervisor through a  combination of architectural choices, configuration  options, and operational practices.  Perspective 2: Ensuring protection of applications and  O/S (called guest O/S) running inside virtual machines  (VMs) through a combination of segmentation of the  virtual network, virtual firewalls, Anti-Virus/Anti- Malware software, and IDS/IPS devices.  Perspective 3: Leveraging virtualization features to  enhance security protection wherever possible.  In support of Perspective 1, in FY2012, NIST has  developed a preliminary draft of NIST IR 7852, Secure  Management Practices for Protection of Hypervisors,  which outlines a set of recommendations for secure  deployment of the complete hypervisor platform.  Looking at security aspects from Perspective 2, one  of the objectives was to identify the differences in  security protection measures for VMs that are available  to stakeholders between virtualized infrastructures  deployed entirely for internal use from the ones  that are used for offering cloud computing services.  Towards this objective, a peer-reviewed conference  paper titled “Security Control Variations between In- house and Cloud-based Virtualized Infrastructures”  was written and presented at the 5th International  Conference of Dependability.  In FY2013, CSD plans to obtain feedback and  comments and publish the final version of NIST IR  7852. The core tasks in the area of virtualization for  FY2013 will consist of security analysis and security  recommendations based on all three perspectives  described above, through the medium of conference  papers and NIST publications, so as to promote secure  adoption of this critical technology.

Although these devices are relatively small and  inexpensive, they can be used not only for voice calls  and simple text messages, but also for many functions  once limited to laptop and desktop computers. Smart  phones and tablet devices have specialized built- in hardware, such as photographic cameras, video  cameras, accelerometers, Global Positioning System  (GPS) receivers, and removable media readers.  Furthermore, they employ a range of wireless  interfaces, including infrared, Wireless Fidelity (Wi- Fi), Bluetooth, Near Field Communications (NFC), and  one or more types of cellular interfaces that provide  network connectivity across the globe. Although  small in terms of form-factor, they can be used for  sending and receiving email, browsing the web, online  banking and commerce, social networking, storing  and modifying documents, remotely accessing data,  recording audio and video, and as navigation aids.  Naturally, just as consumers and business people can  realize productivity gains from these technologies, so  can government agencies.  Like any new technology, smart phones present  new capabilities, but also a number of new security  challenges.

NIST is conducting research in new testing  methodologies for smart phone software (apps) and  is working with industry to bridge the security gaps  present on today’s smart phones. NIST has developed  an online beta App Testing Portal for Android that  examines app functionality with respect to agency  security and privacy guidelines.

The  primary motivations for the development of IPv6  were to increase the number of unique IP addresses  and to handle the needs of new Internet applications  and devices. In addition, IPv6 was designed with the  following goals: increased ease of network management  and configuration; expandable IP headers; improved  mobility and security; and quality of service controls.  IPv6 has been, and continues to be, developed and  defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).  This year was a significant year for the deployment  of IPv6 in the United States government. Office of  Management and Budget’s (OMB) Memo of September  10, 2010, entitled “Transition to IPv6,” required all  government agencies to “upgrade public/external  facing servers and services (e.g., web, email, Domain  Name System [DNS], Internet Service Provider [ISP]  services, etc.) to operationally use native IPv6 by the  end of FY2012.” NIST has been working with the USGv6  Task Force and with individual government agencies  to achieve this goal. NIST has developed an online  monitor to demonstrate which high-level government  domains have met this goal with respect to DNS  services, email, web servers, and DNSSEC. OMB is using  this monitor to measure USGv6 compliance with their  latest milestone.  The NIST IPv6 Test Program, whose goal is to provide  assurance on IPv6 conformance and interoperability of  products, continued to operate. Additional tests were  added, and the Supplier’s Declaration of Conformity  (SDOC), the vehicle used to enable vendors of IPv6  products to report the details of their products  that have successfully executed the United States  Government IPv6 (USGv6) tests, was improved.  In FY2013, NIST will continue to manage and evolve  the USGv6 Test Program, and will update the NIST IPv6  Profile.  http://www.antd.nist.gov/usgv6  Contacts:  Ms. Sheila Frankel Mr. Douglas Montgomery  (301) 975-3297 (301) 975-3630  sheila.frankel@nist.gov dougm@nist.gov  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  60  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  Access Control and Privilege Management  Î Access Control and Privilege  Management Research  With the advance of current computing technologies  and the multifaceted environments the technologies  are applied to, security issues such as situation  awareness, trust management, privacy control for  access control, and privilege management systems  are becoming more complex. However, the research  available on these topics is generally targeted to a  specific system, is incomplete, makes assumptions,  or is ambiguous regarding critical elements. Thus,  practical and conceptual general guidance for these  topics is needed.  In FY2012, CSD completed the development of the  NIST Interagency Report (NISTIR) 7874, Guidelines for  Access Control System Evaluation Metrics; researched  unified enforcement mechanism of data services  from Policy Machine (PM) for Enterprise Computing  environment; enhanced the capabilities of the Access  Control Policy Tool (ACPT); researched new access  control rule verification method using diagraph  algorithms; and started the development of draft NIST  Special Publication (SP) 800-162, Attribute-Based  Access Control (ABAC) Definition and Considerations,  which provides information explaining the applications  as well as formal models of ABAC.  In FY2013, CSD will continue the development of  draft NIST SP 800-162; research unified enforcement  mechanisms of data services from Policy Machine (PM)  for Enterprise Computing environments; enhance the  capabilities of the Access Control Policy Tool (ACPT);  and research diagraph algorithms for policy rule  composition of ABAC.  CSD expects that this project will:  �� Promote (or accelerate) the adoption of  community computing that utilizes the  power of shared resources and common  trust management schemes;  �� Provide a standard evaluation metric in  evaluating or comparing access control  mechanisms for implementing access control  applications;  �� Increase security and safety of static  (connected) distributed systems by applying  the testing and verification tool for the  access control policies; and  �� Assist system architects, security  administrators, and security managers  whose expertise is related to access control  or privilege policy in managing their  systems, and in learning the limitations and  practical approaches for their applications.

Faulty policies,  misconfigurations, or flaws in software implementation  can result in serious vulnerabilities. The specification  of access control policies is often a challenging  problem. Often a system’s privacy and security are  compromised due to the misconfiguration of access  control policies instead of the failure of cryptographic  primitives or protocols. This problem becomes  increasingly severe as software systems become more  and more complex, and are deployed to manage a  large amount of sensitive information and resources  organized into sophisticated structures. Identifying  discrepancies between policy specifications and their  properties (intended function) is crucial because  correct implementation and enforcement of policies  by applications is based on the premise that the  policy specifications are correct. As a result, policy  specifications must undergo rigorous verification and  validation through systematic testing to ensure that  the policy specifications truly encapsulate the desires  of the policy authors.  61  To formally and precisely capture the security  properties that access control should adhere to,  access control models are usually written to bridge  the rather wide gap in abstraction between policy  and mechanism. Thus, an access control model  provides unambiguous and precise expression as  well as reference for design and implementation of  security requirements. Techniques are required for  verifying whether an access control model is correctly  expressed in the access controls policies and whether  the properties are satisfied in the model. In practice,  the same access control policies may express multiple  access control models or express a single model in  addition to extra access control constraints outside of  the model. Ensuring the conformance of access control  models and policies is a nontrivial and critical task.  Started in 2009, CSD developed a prototype system,  Access Control Policy Tool (ACPT), which allows a user  to compose, verify, test, and generate access control  policies.  In FY2012, ACPT was downloaded by 130 users and  organizations. CSD performed Beta testing, enhanced  the capability of ACPT by adding new policy combine  algorithms, applied more stringent and practical user  cases to test ACPT’s performance, and researched  an additional modeling method that is more flexible  than the current one used. CSD also produced a new  user manual that contains examples and detailed  information of ACPT. In addition, CSD published a  research paper related to ACPT.  In FY2013, CSD will continue testing, enhance the  capability of ACPT by adding environmental variable  function, provide model profiles, and resolve  compatibility issues between systems used by ACPT.  CSD will also update ACPT from users’ feedbacks and  suggestions.  This project is expected to:  ��Provide generic paradigm and framework of  access control model/property conformance  testing;  ��Provide templates for specifying access  control rules in popular access control  models such as Attribute Based, Multilevel,  and Workflow models;  ��Provide tools or services for checking  the security and safety of access control  implementation, policy combination, and  XACML policy generation;  ��Promote (or accelerate) the adoption of  combinatorial testing for large-system (such  as access control system) testing; and  ��Assist system architects, security  administrators, and security managers  whose expertise is related to access control  in managing their systems, and to learn the  limitations and practical approaches for  their applications.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/acpt/  Contacts:  Dr. Vincent Hu Mr. Rick Kuhn  (301) 975-4975 (301) 975-3337  vhu@nist.gov kuhn@nist.gov  Î Metrics for Evaluation of Access  Control Systems  Access control (AC) systems come with a wide variety  of features and administrative capabilities, and the  operational impact can be significant. In particular,  this impact can pertain to administrative and user  productivity, as well as to the organization’s ability to  perform its mission. Therefore, it is reasonable to use  a quality metric to verify the mechanical properties of  AC systems. Features that influence the development  of this metric are: 1) administration is the main  consideration of cost; 2) enforcement capabilities  are the requirements for AC applications; 3) the  performance is the major factor for the AC usability;  and 4) support functions allow an AC system to utilize  and connect to related technologies so as to enable  more efficient integration with network and host  service functions. This project provides a metric for  the evaluation of AC systems based on the features  of administration, enforcement, performance, and  support of AC properties.  The ability of an organization to enforce its access  policies determines the degree to which its data may  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  mailto:kuhn@nist.gov mailto:vhu@nist.gov http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/acpt  62  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  be protected and shared among its user community.  The focus on sharing and protecting information is  becoming increasingly acute for many organizations.  Unfortunately, when it comes to AC systems, one  size does not fit all. The quality of administrative  capabilities has an impact on administrative cost, user  downtime between administrative events, and the  abilities of users to perform their duties, as well as the  overall security posture of the enterprise. Currently  no well-accepted metrics exist for measuring the  effectiveness or functional quality of an AC system.  The purpose of this project is to provide federal  agencies with background information on access  control properties, and to help agencies improve the  evaluation of their AC systems. This project provides  information of the administration, enforcement,  performance, and support properties of AC mechanisms  that are embedded in each AC system. Properties  discussed in this project extend to the information in  NISTIR 7316, Assessment of Access Control Systems,  which demonstrates the fundamental concept of  policy, models, and mechanisms of AC systems.  In FY2012, CSD completed the writing of NISTIR  7874, Guidelines for Access Control System Evaluation  Metrics. NISTIR 7874 includes detailed items for AC  system properties, as well as examples to demonstrate  how to use the metric in evaluating and comparing  capabilities for AC systems, which can be applied to  application or research environments.  CSD expects that this project will:  �� Provide detailed information on the  evaluation of AC systems, including policies,  models, and mechanism for AC system  researchers;  �� Help security policy makers and system  administrators in planning and improving  their current and extended future AC  systems;  �� Provide information for AC system developers  in the consideration of architecture,  requirements, and performance of an AC  system; and  �� Provide reference information for AC system- related standards.

Through the creation of flexible, open standards  and international recognition, security automation  will result in IT infrastructure interoperability,  broad acceptance, and adoption, and will create  opportunities for innovation.  Security Content Automation Protocol  (SCAP) / SCAP Specification Development  To support the overarching security automation vision,  it is necessary to have both trusted information and  a standardized means to store and share it. Through  close work with its government and industry partners,  NIST has developed the Security Content Automation  Protocol (SCAP) to provide the standardized technical  mechanisms to share information between systems.  Through the National Vulnerability Database (NVD)  and the National Checklist Program (NCP), NIST is  providing relevant and important information in the  areas of vulnerability and configuration management.  Combined, SCAP and the programs that leverage it are  moving the information assurance industry towards  being able to standardize communications, collect  and store relevant data in standardized formats, and  provide automated means for the assessment and  remediation of systems for both vulnerabilities and  configuration compliance.  63  SCAP is a suite of specifications that use Extensible  Markup Language (XML) to standardize the format and  nomenclature by which security software products  communicate information about software flaws and  security configurations. SCAP includes software flaw  and security configuration standard reference data,  also known as SCAP content. This reference data is  provided by the NVD (http://nvd.nist.gov/).  SCAP is a multipurpose protocol that supports  automated vulnerability checking, technical control  compliance activities, and security measurement. The  U.S. government, in cooperation with academia and  private industry, is adopting SCAP and encourages its  use in support of security automation activities and  initiatives.  At the end of September 2012, SP 800-126  Revision 2, The Technical Specification for the Security  Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2,  was issued as final (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/  nistpubs/800-126-rev2/SP800-126r2.pdf). This document  describes the 11 component specifications composing  SCAP:  ��Languages:  ◦�Extensible Configuration Checklist  Description Format (XCCDF), a language for  authoring security checklists/benchmarks  and for reporting results of evaluating them;  ◦�Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language  (OVAL), a language for representing system  configuration information, assessing machine  state, and reporting assessment results; and  ◦�Open Checklist Interactive Language (OCIL),  a language for representing checks that  collect information from people or from  existing data stores made by other data  collection efforts;  ��Reporting Formats:  ◦�Asset Reporting Format (ARF), a format  for expressing the transport format  of information about assets and the  relationships between assets and reports;  and  ◦�Asset Identification (AI), a format for  uniquely identifying assets based on known  identifiers and/or known information about  the assets;  ��Enumerations:  ◦�Common Platform Enumeration (CPE), a  nomenclature and dictionary of hardware,  operating systems, and applications;  ◦�Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE),  a nomenclature and dictionary of software  security configurations; and  ◦�Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures  (CVE), a nomenclature and dictionary of  security-related software flaws;  ��Measurement and Scoring Systems:  ◦�Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS),  a specification for measuring the relative  severity of software flaw vulnerabilities; and  ◦�Common Configuration Scoring System  (CCSS), a specification for measuring  the relative severity of system security  configuration issues; and  ��Integrity:  ◦�Trust Model for Security Automation Data  (TMSAD), a specification for using digital  signatures in a common trust model applied  to security automation specifications.  SCAP is being widely adopted by major software and  hardware manufacturers and has become a significant  component of information security management and  governance programs. The protocol is expected to  evolve and expand in support of the growing need to  define and measure effective security controls, assess  and monitor ongoing aspects of information security,  remediate noncompliance, and successfully manage  systems in accordance with the Risk Management  Framework described in SP 800-53.  Currently, CSD is leveraging SCAP in multiple areas,  both to support its own mission and to enable other  agencies and private sector entities to meet their  goals. For CSD, SCAP is a critical component of the  SCAP Validation Program, the National Vulnerability  Database (NVD), and the National Checklist Program.

The NVD provides  information regarding security vulnerabilities and  configuration settings, vulnerability impact metrics,  technical assessment methods, and references to  remediation assistance and IT product identification  data. The NVD reference data supports security  automation efforts based on the Security Content  Automation Protocol (SCAP). As of September 2012,  the NVD contained the following resources:  ��Over 53,000 vulnerability advisories with an  average of 8 new vulnerabilities added daily;  ��46 SCAP-expressed checklists containing  thousands of low-level security configuration  checks that can be used by SCAP-validated  security products to perform automated  evaluations of system state;  ��156 non-SCAP security checklists (e.g.,  English prose guidance and configuration  scripts);  ��222 U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness  Team (USCERT) alerts, 2,645 US-CERT  vulnerability summaries, and 8,140 SCAP  machine-readable software flaw checks;  ��Product dictionary with 62,729 operating  system, application, and hardware name  entries; and  ��38,083 vulnerability advisories translated  into Spanish.  NVD is hosted and maintained by NIST and is sponsored  by the Department of Homeland Security’s National  Cyber Security Division.  NVD’s effective reach has been extended by the use of  SCAP data by commercial security products deployed  in thousands of organizations worldwide. Increased  adoption of SCAP is evidenced by the increasing  demand for NVD Extensible Markup Language (XML)  data feeds and SCAP-expressed content from the NVD  website. Concerted outreach efforts over the last year  have resulted in an increase in the number of vendors  providing SCAP-expressed content.  NVD continues to play a pivotal role in the Payment  Card Industry (PCI) efforts to mitigate vulnerabilities  in credit card systems. PCI mandates the use of NVD  vulnerability severity scores in measuring the risk to  payment card servers worldwide and for prioritizing  vulnerability patching. PCI’s use of NVD severity scores  helps enhance credit card transaction security and  protects consumers’ personal information.  Throughout FY2012, NVD continued to provide  access to vulnerability reference data and security  checklists. NVD deployed an enhanced checklist  submission web interface and a web service checklist  submission capability. Additionally, the NVD now hosts  a SCAP Content Validation Tool that can be used by  creators of SCAP content to ensure that their SCAP  content packages conform to Special Publication  (SP) 800-126, The Technical Specification for the  Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP  Version 1.2, guidelines. Finally, NVD now supports  automated SCAP content generation from the Common  Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) vulnerability data  feed. NVD data is a fundamental component of CSD’s  security automation infrastructure and is substantially  increasing the security of networks worldwide. CSD  plans to expand and improve the NVD in FY2013.  http://nvd.nist.gov  Contact:  Mr. Harold Booth  (301) 975-8441  harold.booth@nist.gov  Incident Handling Automation  In recent years, security threats to digital systems  have become more prevalent and more sophisticated.  While some security threats are generic in nature,  others are targeted at specific organizations, assets,  and missions. Although computer security defenses  may forestall many threats, not all can be prevented,  and organizations must therefore develop incident  handling capabilities. Incident handling encompasses  a variety of tasks ranging from preparation prior to an  incident to timely detection and analysis of an incident  to recovery and repair from the effects of an incident  to post-incident learning and improvement. These  http://nvd.nist.gov mailto:harold.booth@nist.gov  65  tasks need to be performed both internally within  specific organizations and externally via coordination  across teams of collaborating organizations.  In the past year, NIST worked with the Department  of Homeland Security’s United States Computer  Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) to develop  Revision 2 of NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-61,  Computer Security Incident Handling Guide. This  document provides guidance on developing incident  handling capabilities. The document explains the  nature of incidents, explains the incident handling  process, explains the structure and operation of  Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs),  and provides guidance on handling an incident and  coordinating with other organizations.  SP 800-61 focuses primarily on manual (human)  processes for incident handling and the effective use  of human judgment, guided by applicable regulation  and law, regarding which incident-related information  is significant and which incident-related information  may be shared. The growing volume of security threats,  however, is driving the need for a more agile incident- handling framework that can operate at differing  scales and speeds as required.  Working in concert with the Department of Homeland  Security, NIST is expanding existing incident handling  guidance to enable coordinated information sharing  across disparate CSIRTs operating at differing scales  and speeds. This work will include the analysis of  standardized incident handling data models and the  incorporation of these data models, as appropriate,  into both CSIRT information sharing processes as  well as incident/threat knowledge repositories. This  work will describe how mature CSIRTs may operate  in a diverse information-sharing network with both  operational and strategic CSIRTs, as well as industry  knowledge repositories. This may include selective use  of security automation where applicable.  In FY2013, this work will develop draft SP 800-150,  Coordinated Computer Security Incident Handling  Guidance.

The  project evolved from the Federal Desktop Core  Configuration (FDCC) mandate originally described in  a March 2007 memorandum from the U.S. White House  Office of Management and Budget (Memorandum M-07- 11). USGCB helps to improve information security  and reduce overall IT operating costs by providing  commonly accepted security configurations for major  operating systems.  Through the National Checklist Program described  in Special Publication (SP) 800-70, National Checklist  Program for IT Products: Guidelines for Checklist Users  and Developers, a baseline submitter may express  interest in submitting a candidate for use in the USGCB  program. CSD works with the Federal CIO Council’s  Technology Infrastructure Subcommittee (TIS) to  consider the candidate, recommend any changes  to the baseline, and coordinate implementation at  federal agencies.  On behalf of the TIS, NIST reviews the SCAP- expressed checklist to ensure that it complies with  the appropriate specifications and to ensure that the  benchmark properly assesses the intended security  configuration. Where possible, virtual images of target  architectures are provided to assist agencies with  testing the content for suitability in their environment.  For example, Windows desktop virtual hard drive  images (VHDs) and Group Policy Object (GPO) files  or Red Hat Enterprise Linux Kickstart Configuration  Scripts may be provided, enabling users to replicate  the target test environment for local validation. Any  identified issues may be posted to the USGCB and FDCC  mail aliases.  CSD provides ongoing support for the USGCB  automation content, including the creation of patch  updates, assisting USGCB users in continuously  monitoring and assessing security compliance of  information systems. This ongoing monitoring element  supports the Risk Management Framework described  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  66  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  in SP 800-37 Revision 1, Guide for Applying the Risk  Management Framework to Federal Information  Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach.  The USGCB Program will continue in FY2013 to provide  ongoing maintenance of the baseline artifacts and to  consider additional applicable platforms.  Contact:  Mr. Stephen Quinn  (301) 975-6967  stephen.quinn@nist.gov  National Checklist Program (NCP)  There are many threats to information technology  (IT), ranging from remotely launched network service  exploits to malicious code spread through infected  emails, websites, and downloaded files. Vulnerabilities  in IT products are discovered daily, and many ready- to-use exploitation techniques are widely available on  the Internet. Because IT products are often intended  for a wide variety of audiences, restrictive security  configuration controls are usually not enabled by  default. As a result, many out-of-the box IT products  are immediately vulnerable. In addition, identifying  a reasonable set of security settings that achieve  balanced risk management is a complicated, arduous,  and time-consuming task, even for experienced system  administrators.  To facilitate development of security configuration  checklists for IT products and to make checklists more  organized and usable, NIST established the National  Checklist Program (NCP) in furtherance of its statutory  responsibilities under the Federal Information Security  Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107- 347, and also under the Cyber Security Research and  Development Act, which tasks NIST to “develop, and  revise as necessary, a checklist setting forth settings  and option selections that minimize the security risks  associated with each computer hardware or software  system that is, or is likely to become widely used  within the federal government.” In February 2008,  revised Part 39 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation  (FAR) was published. Paragraph (d) of section 39.101  states, “In acquiring information technology, agencies  shall include the appropriate IT security policies  and requirements, including use of common security  configurations available from the NIST website  at http://checklists.nist.gov. Agency contracting  officers should consult with the requiring official to  ensure the appropriate standards are incorporated.”  In Memorandum M08-22, Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) mandated the use of SCAP-validated  products for continuous monitoring of Federal Desktop  Core Configuration (FDCC) compliance. The NCP strives  to encourage and make simple agencies’ compliance  with these mandates.  The goals of the NCP are to:  ��Facilitate development and sharing of  checklists by providing a formal framework  for checklist developers to submit checklists  to NIST;  ��Provide guidance to developers to help them  create standardized, high-quality checklists  that conform to common operations  environments;  ��Help developers and users by providing  guidelines for making checklists better  documented and more usable;  ��Encourage software vendors and other  parties to develop checklists;  ��Provide a managed process for the review,  update, and maintenance of checklists;  ��Provide an easy-to-use repository of  checklists; and,  ��Encourage the use of automation  technologies for checklist application such  as SCAP.  There are 234 checklists posted on the website; 39 of  the checklists are SCAP-expressed (see section on SCAP  above) and can be used with SCAP-validated products.  It is anticipated that a minimum of several more  SCAP-expressed checklists will be added in FY2013 as  contributions come from other federal agencies and  product vendors. Organizations can use checklists  obtained from the NCP website (http://checklists.  nist.gov) for automated security configuration patch  assessment. NCP currently hosts SCAP checklists for  Internet Explorer 7.0, Internet Explorer 8.0, Microsoft  Office 2007, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Windows 7,  http:nist.gov http://checklists http:http://checklists.nist.gov mailto:stephen.quinn@nist.gov  67  Windows Vista, Windows XP, and other products.  To assist users in identifying automated checklist  content, NCP groups checklists into tiers, from Tier  I to Tier IV. NCP uses the tiers to rank checklists  according to their automation capability. Tier III and  IV checklists are considered production-ready and  have been validated by the SCAP content validation  tool as conforming to the requirements outlined in SP  800-126, The Technical Specification for the Security  Content Automation Protocol (SCAP). Tier IV checklists  are used in the SCAP Validation Program (see following  section for details) when validating SCAP products.  Tier III checklists are not presently used in the SCAP  Validation Program; however, Tier III checklists should  be compatible with SCAP-validated products. Tier II  checklists document recommended security settings  in a machine-readable, nonstandard format, such as a  proprietary format or a product-specific configuration  script. Tier I checklists are prose-based and contain  no machine-readable content. Users can browse the  checklists based on the checklist tier, IT product, IT  product category, or authority, and also through a  keyword search that searches the checklist name and  summary for userspecified terms. The search results  show the detailed checklist metadata and a link to any  SCAP content for the checklist, as well as links to any  supporting resources associated with the checklist.  To assist checklist developers, the NCP provides  both manual and automated interfaces to facilitate  submission and maintenance processes. The manual  interface consists of a web application that guides the  submitter through the data entry process to ensure  that all of the required information is submitted.  In addition, a web service is also available for a  fully automated submission. In either case, the  submission is validated upon review, and a report is  returned to the submitting organization, verifying  either acceptance or rejection based on the criteria  requirements. For instance, Tier III and Tier IV  checklists require validation using the SCAP Content  Validation Tool (this tool is available for download via  http://scap.nist.gov/revision/1.2/#tools).  The NCP is defined in SP 800-70 Revision 2, National  Checklist Program for IT Products—Guidelines for  Checklist Users and Developers, which can be found at  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/.  http://checklists.nist.gov  Contact:  Mr. Stephen Quinn  (301) 975-6967  stephen.quinn@nist.gov  Î Technical Security Metrics  Security Risk Analysis of Enterprise  Networks Using Attack Graphs  At present, computer networks constitute the core  component of information technology infrastructures  in areas such as power grids, financial data systems,  and emergency communication systems. Protection of  these networks from malicious intrusions is critical to  the economy and security of the nation. Vulnerabilities  are regularly discovered in software applications  which are exploited to stage cyber attacks. Currently,  management of security risk of an enterprise network  is more an art than a science. System administrators  operate by instinct and experience rather than relying  on objective metrics to guide and justify decision  making. The objective of this research is to develop  a standard model for measuring security of computer  networks. A standard model will enable us to answer  questions such as “Are we more secure now than  yesterday?” or “How does the security of one network  configuration compare with another one?” Also, having  a standard model to measure network security will  allow users, vendors, and researchers to evaluate  methodologies and products for network security in a  coherent and consistent manner.  The CSD has approached the challenge of network  security analysis by capturing vulnerability  interdependencies and measuring security in the exact  way that real attackers penetrate the network. CSD’s  methodology for security risk analysis is based on  the model of attack graphs. CSD analyzes all attack  paths through a network, providing a probabilistic  metric of the overall system risk. Through this metric,  CSD analyzes trade-offs between security costs and  security benefits.  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  http://scap.nist.gov/revision/1.2/#tools http://checklists.nist.gov mailto:stephen.quinn@nist.gov http://csrc.nist.gov/publications  68  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  In FY2012, CSD integrated techniques into an attack  graph-based security tool called MULVAL. CSD released  this as an open source system. CSD published a Springer  brief book “Quantitative Security Risk Assessment of  Enterprise Networks” on this topic.  CSD also developed a good model “K Zero Day  Safety” for measuring security risk of a network  against unknown vulnerabilities. CSD prepared a  paper “A Network Security Metric for Measuring and  Improving Computer Network Resistance to Unknown  Vulnerabilities.”  In FY2013, CSD plans to apply attack graphs to study  the effectiveness of moving target defense. CSD also  plans to publish the results as a NIST report and as  white papers in conferences and journals.  http://cs rc.nis t.g o v /g r o ups /S NS /s ecur ity-r is k- analysis-enterprise-networks/  Contact:  Dr. Anoop Singhal  (301) 975-4432  anoop.singhal@nist.gov  Using Attack Graphs in Forensic Examinations  Attack graphs are used to compute potential  attack paths from a system configuration and known  vulnerabilities of a system. Attack graphs can be used  to determine known vulnerability sequences that  were exploited to launch the attack and help forensic  examiners in identifying many potential attack paths.  After an attack happens, forensic analysis, including  linking evidence with attacks, helps further understand  and refine the attack scenario that was launched.  Given that there are anti-forensic tools that can  obfuscate, minimize, or eliminate attack footprints,  forensic analysis becomes harder. In this project, CSD  applied attack graphs to forensic analysis. CSD did so by  including anti-forensic capabilities into attack graphs,  so that the missing evidence can be explained by using  longer attack paths that erase potential evidence.  In FY2012, CSD published a paper, “Using Attack  Graphs in Forensic Examination,” in an IEEE Workshop  on Digital Forensics (WSDF 2012). In FY2013, CSD plans  to enhance this work by mapping Evidence Graphs to  Attack Graphs. CSD also plans to enhance an existing  attack graph generation tool to generate evidence  graphs for forensic examinations. CSD also plans to  publish the results as a NIST report and as papers in  conferences and journals.  Contact:  Dr. Anoop Singhal  (301) 975-4432  anoop.singhal@nist.gov  Î Automated Combinatorial Testing  Software developers often encounter failures that  result from an unexpected interaction between  components. NIST research has shown that most  failures are triggered by one or two parameters, and  progressively fewer by three, four, or more parameters  (see graph on page 69), a relationship that is called  the interaction rule. These results have important  implications for testing. If all faults in a system can be  triggered by a combination of n or fewer parameters,  then testing all n-way combinations of parameters can  provide very strong fault detection efficiency. These  methods are being applied to software and hardware  testing for reliability, safety, and security. CSD’s focus  is on empirical results and real-world problems.  Project highlights for FY2012 included demonstration  of 95 percent reduction in test volume with equivalent  fault detection for interoperability of Internet web  browser software; completion of the first textbook  on combinatorial testing; cooperative work with the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)  Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) Facility  demonstrating the effectiveness of combinatorial  methods for IV&V of space systems; lectures at  conferences and research labs; and leading (jointly  with IBM personnel) the IEEE First International  Conference on Combinatorial Testing, held with the  International Conference on Software Testing.  Tech transfer activities included publication of six  technical papers; release of enhanced covering array,  test prioritization, and fault location tools; plus  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/security-risk-analysis-enterprise-networks/ http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/security-risk-analysis-enterprise-networks/ mailto:anoop.singhal@nist.gov mailto:anoop.singhal@nist.gov  69  seminars and lectures at Carnegie Mellon University,  NASA, Loyola College, information technology  companies, Indian Institute of Technology, and several  conferences.  trustworthiness of the security mechanisms that rely  upon those components. Stronger security assurances  may be possible by grounding security mechanisms in  roots of trust.

Because  roots of trust are inherently trusted, they must be  secure by their design. As such, many roots of trust  are implemented in hardware so that malware cannot  tamper with the functions they provide. Roots of trust  provide a firm foundation from which to build security  and trust in a system.  NIST’s past work on roots of trust has focused on  their use to protect fundamental system firmware,  commonly known as the Basic Input/Output System  (BIOS). NIST has been working with industry on the  use of roots of trust to improve the security of BIOS.  In FY2011, NIST issued SP 800-147, BIOS Protection  to apply combinatorial coverage measurement methods Guidelines, which provides guidelines on protecting  to NASA spacecraft software, following a successful  BIOS in laptop and desktop computers. NIST extended  pilot study in 2012; development of new methods and  these guidelines in FY2012 to cover server-class  tools for fault location; lectures at conferences and systems, and released draft NIST SP 800-147B, BIOS  research labs; and significant enhancement of software  tools for combinatorial coverage measurement, jointly  with Centro Nacional de Metrología, the national  metrology institute of Mexico.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/acts/  Contacts:  Mr. Rick Kuhn Dr. Raghu Kacker  (301) 975-3337 (301) 975-2109  kuhn@nist.gov raghu.kacker@nist.gov  Î Hardware Roots of Trust  Modern computing devices consist of various  hardware, firmware, and software components at  multiple layers of abstraction. Many security and  protection mechanisms are currently rooted in  software that, along with all underlying components,  must be trusted and uncorrupted. A vulnerability  in any of those components could compromise the  Protection Guidelines for Servers, for public comment.  NIST is also developing guidelines on the use of roots of  trust to detect unauthorized changes to BIOS and BIOS  configuration settings. In FY2012, NIST released draft  SP 800-155, BIOS Integrity Measurement Guidelines,  which provides guidelines on mechanisms that measure  and report the state of BIOS.  NIST will continue its efforts to secure BIOS and other  critical firmware in FY2013. CSD will finalize the BIOS  protection and measurement guidelines (i.e., SP 800- 147B and SP 800-155), and will develop new guidelines  for protection of firmware in computer add-on cards.  Future efforts will explore methods to extend trust in  the security of BIOS to provide greater assurance of  the security of the operating system and applications.  A new focus area for NIST’s roots of trust research  will be in mobile devices. For the past year, NIST has  been working with government and industry partners  on guidelines for hardware-rooted security features in  mobile devices. These guidelines will focus on device  integrity, isolation, and protected storage features  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  mailto:raghu.kacker@nist.gov mailto:kuhn@nist.gov http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/acts  70  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  that are supported by roots of trust.

Contact:  Mr. Andrew Regenscheid  (301) 975-5155  andrew.regenscheid@nist.gov  Î Continuous Monitoring Reference  Model  In September 2010, the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS) released the Continuous Asset  Evaluation, Situational Awareness and Risk Scoring  (CAESARS) Reference Architecture Report. This report  identifies commonality and strengths in the custom  approaches used by civilian agencies to provide  solutions that enable the continuous monitoring of IT  systems. This report identifies “essential functional  components of a security risk scoring system,  independent of specific technologies, products, or  vendors.” It describes the use of security automation  specifications, such as the Security Content Automation  Protocol (SCAP), to enable continuous monitoring  solutions.  In October 2010, the Federal Chief Information  Officer Council’s Information Security and Identity  Management Committee’s (ISIMC) subcommittee  on Continuous Monitoring and Risk Scoring saw the  need to create a technical initiative to expand upon  the CAESARS architecture to better scale it to large  enterprises (e.g., the entire U.S. government). A team  of researchers from the National Security Agency’s  (NSA) Information Assurance Directorate (IAD), the  DHS Federal Network Security CAESARS team, and  NIST’s Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) worked  together to respond to this need. The draft CAESARS  Framework Extension (FE) described by the NIST  Interagency Report (NISTIR) 7756, CAESARS Framework  Extension: An Enterprise Continuous Monitoring  Technical Reference Architecture, is the output of  this collaboration.  This report presents an enterprise continuous  monitoring technical reference architecture that  extends the framework provided by the DHS’s  CAESARS architecture. The primary goal of this effort  is to facilitate enterprise continuous monitoring by  presenting a reference architecture that enables  organizations to aggregate collected data from across  a diverse set of security tools, analyze that data,  perform scoring, enable user queries, and provide  overall situational awareness. In support of this goal,  the CAESARS-FE reference architecture describes  additional functionality, provides more granularity  within subsystem specifications, and further leverages  security automation efforts. The model design is  focused on enabling organizations to realize this  capability by leveraging their existing security tools  based on the use of open, consensus-based standards,  to avoid complicated and resource-intensive custom  tool integration efforts.  The data exchange and functional requirements in  CAESARS-FE and referenced specifications provide  organizations with much of the information needed  to bring together diverse security products, and use  those products to compose a hierarchical data  aggregation model that supports a large variety  of continuous monitoring consumers from both  the security disciplines and general information  technology (IT) management domains. CAESARS-FE  minimally defines the required functionality so that  security tool vendors can cost-effectively participate,  while ensuring a necessary level of interoperability  between vendor products.  To advance the state of the art in continuous  monitoring capabilities and to further interoperability  within commercially available tools, CSD is working  within the international standards development  community to establish working groups and to author  and comment on emerging technical standards in  this area. The CAESARS-FE reference architecture is  expected to evolve as greater consensus is developed  around interoperable, standards-based approaches  that enable continuous monitoring of IT systems.

In federated environments,  credential revocation has traditionally been managed  by the credential issuer. In an effort to improve  credential revocation mechanisms across federations  and effectively mitigate credential misuse, NIST  researchers are exploring the broader scope of  credential revocation, where all parties contribute  to and participate in credential revocation. In this  model, service providers give feedback on a credential  reliability score based on detected credential misuse.  The credential holder and Identity Provider, on the  other hand, receive feedback notifications and are  able to immediately suspend or revoke the credential  should the score reach an unacceptable level. Lastly,  other federation services can consult scores and status  to determine the suitability of a presented credential  with an associated reliability score.  In FY2012, NIST scientists published an initial  draft NISTIR 7817 titled A Credential Reliability  and Revocation Model that describes and classifies  the different types of identity providers serving  federations. For each classification, the document  identifies perceived improvements or gaps when the  credentials are used in authentication services and  recommends countermeasures to eliminate some of  the identified gaps. With the countermeasures as the  basis, the document suggests a Universal Credential  Reliability and Revocation Services (URRS) model  that strives to improve authentication services for  federations where all parties contribute to and  participate in credential revocation and where the  service can be tailored to the type of (classification  of) identity providers it accommodates.  After the public comment period, NISTIR 7817 was  further revised to accommodate the comments and  final approval is anticipated in FY2013.

Abstracts for Publications Released in  FY2012  Î Federal Information Processing  Standards (FIPS)  Draft FIPS 201-2, Personal Identity Verification  (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors  This standard specifies the architecture and technical  requirements for a common identification standard  for federal employees and contractors. The overall  goal is to achieve appropriate security assurance  for multiple applications by efficiently verifying the  claimed identity of individuals seeking physical access  to federally controlled government facilities and  electronic access to government information systems.  The standard contains the minimum requirements for  a federal personal identity verification system that  meets the control and security objectives of Homeland  Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), including  identity proofing, registration, and issuance. The  standard also provides detailed specifications that will  support technical interoperability among PIV systems  of federal departments and agencies. It describes the  card elements, system interfaces, and security controls  required to securely store, process, and retrieve  identity credentials from the card. The physical card  characteristics, storage media, and data elements  that make up identity credentials are specified in this  standard.  Other requirements of draft FIPS 201-2 are specified  in the following Special Publications (SPs):  ��SP 800-73, Interfaces for Personal Identity  Verification (interfaces and card architecture  for storing and retrieving identity credentials  from a smart card);  ��SP 800-76, Biometric Data Specification for  Personal Identity Verification (interfaces  and data formats of biometric information);  ��SP 800-78, Cryptographic Algorithms and  Key Sizes for Personal Identity Verification  (requirements for cryptographic algorithms);  ��SP 800-79, Guidelines for the Accreditation  of Personal Identity Verification Card Issuers  (requirements for the accreditation of the  PIV Card issuers);  ��SP 800-87, Codes for the Identification of  Federal and Federally-Assisted Organizations  (unique organizational codes for federal  agencies);  ��SP 800-96, PIV Card to Reader Interoperability  Guidelines (requirements for card readers);  ��SP 800-156, Representation of PIV Chain- of-Trust for Import and Export (format for  encoding the chain-of-trust for import and  export); and  ��SP 800-157, Guidelines for Personal Identity  Verification (PIV) Derived Credentials  (requirements for issuing PIV derived  credentials).  2012 Publications Released and Abstracts  75  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsITLSB.html  76  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  Draft FIPS 201-2 does not specify access control  policies or requirements for federal departments and  agencies.

FIPS  186-3 is used in conjunction with the hash functions  specified in FIPS 180-4, Secure Hash Standard (SHS).  The following revisions to FIPS 186-3 are proposed:  (1) The Use of Random Bit/Number Generators;  (2) Definition Clarification; and  (3) The Reuse of a Prime Number Generation  Seed for RSA Key Pair Generation.  This standard specifies a suite of algorithms that can be  used to generate a digital signature. Digital signatures  are used to detect unauthorized modifications to data  and to authenticate the identity of the signatory. In  addition, the recipient of signed data can use a digital  signature as evidence in demonstrating to a third  party that the signature was, in fact, generated by the  claimed signatory. This is known as non-repudiation,  since the signatory cannot easily repudiate the  signature at a later time.  Contact:  Ms. Elaine Barker  elaine.barker@nist.gov  FIPS 180-4, Secure Hash Standard (SHS)  This standard specifies hash algorithms that can be  used to generate digests of messages. The digests are  used to detect whether messages have been changed  since the digests were generated.

Conformance testing provides developers,  users, and purchasers with increased levels of  confidence in product quality and increases the  probability of successful interoperability. NIST’s  Information Technology Laboratory sponsored the  development of a conformance testing methodology  for ANSI/NIST-ITL 2011, Data Format for the Interchange  of Fingerprint, Facial & Other Biometric Information  (AN-2011) under the NIST/ITL Conformance Testing  Methodology Working Group. This testing methodology  supports the development of conformance test  tools designed to test implementations of AN-2011  transactions and promotes biometrics conformity  assessment efforts. The first release includes  comprehensive tables of AN-2011 requirements and  test assertions for a set of supported AN-2011 Record  Types. The tables of requirements and assertions  indicate which assertions apply to the traditional  encoding format, the National Information Exchange  Model (NIEM)-compliant encoding format, or both  encoding formats. The testing methodology makes use  of specific test assertion syntax to clearly define the  assertions associated with each requirement.

Unauthorized modification of BIOS  firmware constitutes a significant threat because of  the BIOS’s unique and privileged position within the PC  architecture. The document focuses on two scenarios:  detecting changes to the system BIOS code stored on  the system flash, and detecting changes to the system  BIOS configuration. The document is intended for  hardware and software vendors that develop products  that can support secure BIOS integrity measurement  mechanisms, and may also be of use for organizations  developing enterprise procurement or deployment  strategies for these technologies.  Contact:  Mr. Andrew Regenscheid  andrew.regenscheid@nist.gov  SP 800-153, Guidelines for Securing Wireless  Local Area Networks (WLANs)  A wireless local area network (WLAN) is a group of  wireless networking devices within a limited geographic  area, such as an office building, that exchange data  through radio communications. The security of each  WLAN is heavily dependent on how well each WLAN  component—including client devices, access points  (APs), and wireless switches—is secured throughout  the WLAN life cycle, from initial WLAN design and  deployment through ongoing maintenance and  monitoring. The purpose of this publication is to help  organizations improve their WLAN security by providing  recommendations for WLAN security configuration and  monitoring. This publication supplements other NIST  publications by consolidating and strengthening their  key recommendations.  Contact:  Mr. Murugiah Souppaya  murugiah.souppaya@nist.gov  Draft SP 800-152, A Profile for U.S. Federal  Cryptographic Key Management Systems (CKMS)  This publication is being developed for use by  federal agencies and contractors when designing,  implementing, procuring, installing, configuring,  and operating a CKMS. This Profile will be based on  (draft) Special Publication 800-130, A Framework for  Designing Cryptographic Key Management Systems.  The framework covers topics that should be considered  by a product or system designer when designing a  CKMS and specifies requirements for the design and  its documentation. The Profile, however, will cover  not only a CKMS design, but also its procurement,  installation, management, and operation throughout  its lifetime. Requirements will, therefore, be placed  not only on a CKMS product or system, but also on  people (procurement officials, installers, managers,  and operators) while performing specific tasks involving  the CKMS.  Contact:  Ms. Elaine Barker  elaine.barker@nist.gov  Draft SP 800-147B, BIOS Protection  Guidelines for Servers  Modern computers rely on fundamental system  firmware, commonly known as the system Basic Input/  Output System (BIOS), to facilitate the hardware  initialization process and transition control to the  operating system. Unauthorized modification of BIOS  firmware by malicious software constitutes a significant  threat because of the BIOS’s unique and privileged  position within the PC architecture. The guidelines  in this document include requirements on servers to  mitigate the execution of malicious or corrupt BIOS  code. They apply to BIOS firmware stored in the BIOS  flash, including the BIOS code, the cryptographic keys  that are part of the root of trust for update, and  static BIOS data. This guide is intended to provide  server platform vendors with recommendations and  guidelines for a secure BIOS update process.

Cloud computing has been the  subject of a great deal of commentary. Attempts to  describe cloud computing in general terms, however,  have been problematic because cloud computing  is not a single kind of system, but instead spans a  spectrum of underlying technologies, configuration  possibilities, service models, and deployment models.  This document describes cloud systems and discusses  their strengths and weaknesses.  Contacts:  Mr. Mark Lee Badger Mr. Tim Grance  mark.badger@nist.gov grance@nist.gov  Mr. Jeff Voas  jeff.voas@nist.gov  SP 800-144, Guidelines on Security and  Privacy in Public Cloud Computing  Cloud computing can and does mean different things  to different people. The common characteristics  most interpretations share are on-demand scalability  of highly available and reliable pooled computing  resources, secure access to metered services from  nearly anywhere, and displacement of data and  services from inside to outside the organization. While  aspects of these characteristics have been realized  to a certain extent, cloud computing remains a work  in progress. This publication provides an overview  of the security and privacy challenges pertinent to  public cloud computing and points out considerations  organizations should take when outsourcing data,  applications, and infrastructure to a public cloud  environment.  Contact:  Mr. Tim Grance  grance@nist.gov  SP 800-135 Rev. 1, Recommendation  for Existing Application-Specific Key  Derivation Functions  Cryptographic keys are vital to the security of Internet  security applications and protocols. Many widely used  Internet security protocols have their own application- specific Key Derivation Functions (KDFs) that are  used to generate the cryptographic keys required for  their cryptographic functions. This recommendation  provides security requirements for those KDFs.  Contact:  Mr. Quynh Dang  quynh.dang@nist.gov  Draft SP 800-130, A Framework for Designing  Cryptographic Key Management Systems  This Framework for Designing Cryptographic Key  Management Systems (CKMS) contains topics that should  be considered by a CKMS designer when developing a  CKMS design specification. For each topic, there are  one or more documentation requirements that need  to be addressed by the design specification. Thus, any  CKMS that adequately addresses these requirements  would have a design specification that is compliant  with this Framework.

The Personal Identity  Verification (PIV) standard for Federal Employees  and Contractors, FIPS 201, was developed to define  procedures and specifications for issuance and use of  an interoperable identity credential. This document  is a companion document to FIPS 201 and describes  technical acquisition and formatting specifications  for the PIV system, including the PIV Card itself. It  also establishes minimum accuracy specifications  for deployed biometric authentication processes.  The approach is to enumerate procedures and  formats for collection and preparation of fingerprint,  iris and facial data, and to restrict values and  practices included generically in published biometric  standards. The primary design objective behind  these particular specifications is high performance  and universal interoperability. The addition of iris  and face specifications in the 2012 edition adds an  alternative modality for biometric authentication and  extends coverage to persons for whom fingerprinting  is problematic. The addition of on-card comparison  offers an alternative to PIN-mediated card activation  as well as an additional authentication method. For the  preparation of biometric data suitable for the Federal  Bureau of Investigation (FBI) background check, SP  800-76 references FBI documentation, including the  ANSI/NIST Fingerprint Standard and the Electronic  Fingerprint Transmission Specification. This document  does not preclude use of other biometric modalities in  conjunction with the PIV card.

When implemented in an SP 800- 38 series-compliant mode of operation and in a FIPS  140-2-compliant cryptographic module, TDEA may  be used by federal organizations to protect sensitive  unclassified data. Protection of data during transmission  or while in storage may be necessary to maintain  the confidentiality and integrity of the information  represented by the data. This publication defines the  mathematical steps required to cryptographically  protect data using TDEA and to subsequently process  such protected data. TDEA is made available for use  by federal agencies within the context of a total  security program consisting of physical security  procedures, good information management practices,  and computer system/network access controls.

Patches correct security and functionality  problems in software and firmware. There are several  challenges that complicate patch management. If  organizations do not overcome these challenges,  they will be unable to patch systems effectively and  efficiently, leading to easily preventable compromises.  This publication is designed to assist organizations  in understanding the basics of enterprise patch  management technologies. It explains the importance  of patch management and examines the challenges  inherent in performing patch management. It  provides an overview of enterprise patch management  technologies, and it also briefly discusses metrics for  measuring the technologies’ effectiveness and for  comparing the relative importance of patches.

AC is concerned with determining the  allowed activities of legitimate users, mediating every  attempt by a user to access a resource in the system.  AC systems come with a wide variety of features and  administrative capabilities, and their operational  impact can be significant. In particular, this impact  can pertain to administrative and user productivity,  as well as to the organization’s ability to perform its  mission. Therefore, it is reasonable to use quality  metrics to verify the mechanical properties of AC  systems. This document discusses the administration,  enforcement, performance, and support properties of  AC mechanisms that are embedded in each AC system.  Because of the rigorous nature of the metrics and the  knowledge needed to gather them, these metrics are  intended to be used by AC experts who are evaluating  the highest-security AC systems.

A software feature is a functional  capability provided by software. A software feature  misuse vulnerability is a vulnerability in which the  feature also provides an avenue to compromise the  security of a system. Such vulnerabilities are present  when the trust assumptions made when designing  software features can be abused in ways that violate  security. Misuse vulnerabilities allow attackers to use  mailto:david.cooper@nist.gov mailto:vhu@nist.gov mailto:dylan.yaga@nist.gov mailto:fernando.podio@nist.gov  85  for malicious purposes the functionality that  was intended to be beneficial. CMSS can provide  measurement data to assist organizations in making  sound decisions on addressing software feature  misuse vulnerabilities and in conducting quantitative  assessments of the overall security posture of a system.  This report defines proposed measures for CMSS and  equations to be used to combine the measures into  severity scores for each vulnerability. The report also  provides examples of how CMSS measures and scores  would be determined for selected software feature  misuse vulnerabilities.  Contact:  Mr. Peter Mell  mell@nist.gov  Draft NISTIR 7848, Specification for the Asset  Summary Reporting Format 1.0  This specification defines the Asset Summary Reporting  (ASR) format version 1.0, a data model for expressing  the data exchange format of summary information  relative to one or more metrics. ASR reduces the  bandwidth requirement to report information about  assets in the aggregate since it allows for reporting  aggregates relative to metrics, as opposed to reporting  data about each individual asset, which can lead to  a bloated data exchange. ASR is vendor-neutral and  leverages widely adopted, open specifications; it is  flexible, and suited for a wide variety of reporting  applications.

Each CRE entry  represents a unique remediation activity and is  assigned a globally unique CRE identifier (CRE-ID). This  specification describes the core concepts of CRE, the  technical components of a CRE entry, outlines how  CRE entries are created, the technical requirements  for constructing a CRE-ID, and how CRE-IDs may  be assigned. CRE-IDs are intended to be boundary  objects that are broadly useable in enterprise security  management products and information domains that  participate in remediation activities or make assertions  about remediation actions.

With the diverse set of technologies, and  the unique business requirements for organizations  to federate, there is no uniform approach to the  federation process. Similarly, there is no uniform  method to revoke credentials or their associated  attribute(s) in a federated community. In the absence  of a uniform revocation method, this document seeks  to investigate credential and attribute revocation with  a particular focus on identifying missing requirements  for credential and attribute revocation. This document  first introduces and analysis the different types of  digital credentials and recommends missing revocation- related requirements for each model in a federated  environment. As a second goal, and as by-product of  the analysis and recommendations, this paper suggests  a credential reliability and revocation service that  serves to eliminate the missing requirements and  involves all the entities of the federation.

The primary goal of the NIST’s Computer  Security Division (CSD) is to provide standards and  technology that protects information systems against  threats to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability  of information and services. During Fiscal Year 2011  (FY2011), CSD successfully responded to numerous  challenges and opportunities in fulfilling that mission.  Through CSD’s diverse research agenda and engagement  in many national priority initiatives, high-quality,  cost-effective security and privacy mechanisms were  developed and applied that improved information  security across the federal government and the greater  information security community. This annual report  highlights the research agenda and activities in which  CSD was engaged during FY2011.

It focuses on the Asset Management, Configuration,  and Vulnerability data domains. It leverages the  Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) version  1.2 for configuration and vulnerability scan content,  and it dictates reporting results in an SCAP-compliant  format. This specification describes an overview of  the approach to each of the three domains, how they  bind to specific communication protocols, and how  those protocols interact. It then defines the specific  requirements levied upon the various capabilities  of the subsystems defined in draft NISTIR 7799 that  enable each data domain.  Contacts:  Mr. David Waltermire Mr. Peter Mell  david.waltermire@nist.gov mell@nist.gov  Draft NISTIR 7799, Continuous Monitoring  Reference Model Workflow, Subsystem,  and Interface Specifications  This publication provides the technical specifications  for the continuous monitoring (CM) reference model  presented in draft NISTIR 7756, CAESARS Framework  Extension: An Enterprise Continuous Monitoring  Technical Reference Architecture. These specifications  mailto:mell@nist.gov mailto:david.waltermire@nist.gov mailto:kevin.stine@nist.gov mailto:patrick.oreilly@nist.gov mailto:hildegard.ferraiolo@nist.gov  87  enable multi-instance CM implementations,  hierarchical tiers, multi-instance dynamic querying,  sensor tasking, propagation of policy, policy  monitoring, and policy compliance reporting. A  major focus of the specifications is on workflows that  describe the coordinated operation of all subsystems  and components within the model. Another focus  is on subsystem specifications that enable each  subsystem to play its role within the workflows. The  final focus is on interface specifications that supply  communication paths between subsystems. These  three sets of specifications (workflows, subsystems,  and interfaces) are written to be data domain- agnostic, which means that they can be used for CM  regardless of the data domain that is being monitored.  A companion publication, draft NIST IR 7800, Applying  the Continuous Monitoring Technical Reference  Model to the Asset, Configuration, and Vulnerability  Management Domains, binds these specifications to  specific data domains (e.g., asset, configuration,  and vulnerability management). The specifications  provided in this document are detailed enough to  enable product instrumentation and development.  They are also detailed enough to enable product  testing, validation, procurement, and interoperability.  Taken together, the specifications in this document  define an ecosystem where a variety of interoperable  products can be composed together to form effective  CM solutions. If properly adopted, these specifications  will enable teamwork, orchestration, and coordination  among CM products that currently operate distinctly.  For the computer security domain, this will greatly  enhance organizational effectiveness and efficiency in  addressing known vulnerabilities and technical policy  requirements, and decision making.  Contacts:  Mr. David Waltermire Mr. Peter Mell  david.waltermire@nist.gov mell@nist.gov  Draft NISTIR 7756, CAESARS Framework  Extension: An Enterprise Continuous Monitoring  Technical Reference Architecture  This publication and its supporting documents  present an enterprise continuous monitoring  technical reference model that extends the  framework provided by the DHS Federal Network  Security CAESARS architecture. This extension  enables added functionality, defines each subsystem  in more detail, and further leverages security  automation standards. It also extends CAESARS to  allow for large implementations that need a multi-tier  architecture and focuses on the necessary inter-tier  communications. The goal of this document is  to facilitate enterprise continuous monitoring  by presenting a reference model that enables  organizations to aggregate collected data from  across a diverse set of security tools, analyze that  data, perform scoring, enable user queries, and  provide overall situational awareness. The model  design is focused on enabling organizations to realize  this capability by leveraging their existing security  tools and thus avoiding complicated and resource- intensive custom tool integration efforts.

The  Computer Security Division (CSD), a component of the Information Technology Laboratory at the National Institute  of Standards and Technology (NIST) is responsible for developing standards, guidelines, tests, and metrics for the  protection of non-national security federal information and communication infrastructure. These standards,  guidelines, tests, and metrics are also important resources for the private sector.  In 2012, CSD aligned its resources to enable greater development and application of practical, innovative  security technologies and methodologies, and to enhance our ability to address current and future computer and  information security challenges in support of critical national and international priorities.  CSD extended its research and development agenda for high-quality, cost-effective security and privacy  mechanisms to foster improved information security across the federal government and the global information  security community. In 2012, NIST concluded the five-year SHA-3 Cryptographic Hash Algorithm Competition with  the selection of KECCAK for standardization and worldwide adoption. The selection of this cryptographic hash  algorithm, an indispensable component for the information and communication systems that support commerce  in the modern era, confirmed NIST’s well-respected and trusted technical authority in this field.  A strong partnership with industry is vital to the success of our technical programs. In 2012, CSD engaged  the international standards community on emerging technical standards to advance continuous monitoring  capabilities and to further interoperability with commercially available tools. We also devised new security  testing methodologies for smart phone software app functionality. Our research in hardware-enabled security  continued with the development of guidelines on mechanisms that measure and report the security state of BIOS.  Our research also continued to expand into the cybersecurity aspects of cyber-physical and embedded systems,  and the mechanisms for enabling and protecting public safety communications.  Our ability to interact with the broad federal community continues to be critical to our success. This interaction  helps to ensure that our research is consistent with national objectives related to or impacted by information  security. This interaction is most prominent in our strengthened collaborations with the Department of Defense,  the Intelligence Community, and the Committee on National Security Systems to establish a common foundation  for information security across the federal government. The release of Special Publication 800-30, Guide for  Conducting Risk Assessments, developed by the Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative Interagency Working  Group, is not only leading to more consistent ways to assess risks, but is also enabling more effective risk  management and facilitating greater sharing of information across organizational boundaries.  For many years, the Computer Security Division (CSD), in collaboration with our global partners from government,  industry, and academia, has made great contributions to help secure the nation’s critical information and  infrastructure. We look forward to furthering these relationships in 2013 as we lead in  examining the diverse cybersecurity aspects of a broad set of areas, including supply  chain risk management; security analytics; cloud, mobile, and privacy-enhancing  technologies; hardware-enabled security; and cyber-physical and embedded systems.

Overview:  The Cryptographic Technology Group’s (CTG) work  in cryptographic mechanisms addresses topics such  as hash algorithms, symmetric and asymmetric  cryptographic techniques, key management,  authentication, and random number generation.  Strong cryptography is used to improve the security  of information systems and the information they  process. Users then take advantage of the availability  of secure applications in the marketplace made  possible by the appropriate use of standardized, high- quality cryptography.  CTG continued its work in a number of cryptographic  areas, including:  �� Specifying and using cryptographic algorithms;  �� Revising Federal Information Processing  Standard (FIPS) 140-2, Security Requirements  for Cryptographic Modules;  �� Developing hardware roots of trust to support  reliable device authentication and establish  new bases for system measurement;  �� Supporting the Smart Grid Interoperability  Panel by assessing the security of  cryptographic methods used in the security  protocols for the communication and  management networks used by public utility  companies, and in developing security  guidelines for the Smart Grid;  �� Advising the FIPS 140-2 Validation Program  in the validation of cryptographic algorithms  and cryptographic modules; and  �� Supporting NIST’s Personal Identity  Verification (PIV) project that was initiated  in response to the Homeland Security  Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12).  A major highlight of this year is the completion of the  SHA-3 Cryptographic Hash Algorithm Competition and  the selection of KECCAK as the SHA-3 algorithm.  CTG continued to make an impact in the field of  cryptography, both within and outside the federal  government, by collaborating with national and  international agencies, academic and research  organizations, and standards bodies to develop  interoperable security standards and guidelines.  Federal agency collaborators include the National  Security Agency (NSA), the National Telecommunications  and Information Administration (NTIA), the General  Services Administration (GSA), the Election Assistance  Commission (EAC) and the Federal Voting Assistance  Program (FVAP). International agencies include the  Communications Security Establishment of Canada,  and Australia’s Defense Signals Agency and Centrelink.

Group Manager:  Mr. William (Tim) Polk  william.polk@nist.gov  (301) 975-3348  Introduction to Computer Security Division’s 5 Groups  4  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  Security Components and Mechanisms  Group  Mission Statement:  Research, develop, and standardize foundational  security mechanisms, protocols, and services.  Overview:  The Security Components and Mechanisms Group’s  (SCMG) security research focuses on the development  and management of foundational building-block  security mechanisms and techniques that can be  integrated into a wide variety of mission-critical  U.S. information systems. The group’s work spans a  spectrum from near-term hardening and improvement  to the design and analysis of next-generation, leap- ahead security capabilities. Computer security  depends fundamentally on the level of trust that can  be established for computer software and systems.  This work, therefore, focuses strongly on assurance- building activities ranging from the analysis of software  configuration settings to advanced trust architectures  to testing tools that surface flaws in software  modules. Due to the often manual and costly nature  of assurance building using current techniques, this  work focuses strongly on increasing the applicability  and effectiveness of automated techniques wherever  feasible. SCMG conducts research collaboratively with  government, industry, and academia. The outputs of  this research consist of prototype systems, software  tools, demonstrations, NIST Special Publications and  NIST Interagency Reports, conference papers, and  journal papers.  SCMG works on a variety of topics, such as specifications  for the automated exchange of security information  between systems, computer security incident handling  guidelines, formulation of high-assurance software  configuration settings, hardware roots of trust for  mobile devices, combinatorial testing techniques,  conformity assessment of software implementing  biometric standards, and adoption of Internet Protocol  Version 6 and Internet Protocol security extensions.  SCMG collaborates extensively with government,  academia, and the private sector. In the last year,  collaborations have included the University of Texas  Arlington, University of North Texas, University of  Maryland-Baltimore County (UMBC), North Carolina  State University, Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab  (APL), National Aeronautics and Space Administration  (NASA), U.S. Air Force T&E, Massachusetts Institute of  Technology (MIT) Lincoln Labs, the Defense Advanced  Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and Carnegie  Mellon University (CMU).  Example successes from this work include a second  revision of the NIST Special Publication 800-61,  Computer Security Incident Handling Guide, the  Advanced Combinatorial Testing System (ACTS)  software and documentation, the NIST BioCTS 2012  conformance testing tool and test assertions, a design  for continuous monitoring systems, and a continuous  monitoring prototype system.  Group Manager:  Mr. Mark (Lee) Badger  mark.badger@nist.gov  (301) 975-3176  Secure Systems and Applications Group  Mission Statement:  Integrate and apply security technologies, standards,  and guidelines for computing platforms and information  systems.  Overview:  The Secure Systems and Applications Group’s (SSAG)  security research focuses on identifying emerging and  high-priority technologies, and on developing security  solutions that will have a high impact on the U.S.  critical information infrastructure. The group conducts  research and development on behalf of government  and industry from the earliest stages of technology  development through proof-of-concept, reference and  prototype implementations, and demonstrations. SSAG  works to transfer new technologies to industry, produce  new standards and guidance for federal agencies and  industry, and develop tests, test methodologies, and  assurance methods.  5  Some of the many topics the group investigates  include mobile device security, cloud computing  and virtualization, identity management, access  control and authorization management, and software  assurance. This research helps to meet federal  information security requirements that may not be fully  addressed by existing technology. SSAG collaborates  extensively with government, academia, and private  sector entities, including FY2012 collaborations with  the National Security Agency (NSA), the Department  of Defense (DoD), the Defense Advanced Research  Projects Agency (DARPA), the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS), the White House Communications  Agency (WHCA), George Mason University, North  Carolina State University, Microsoft Corporation, VM  Ware, Symantec, Mobile System 7, One Enterprise  Consulting Group, and MITRE.  Example successes from this work include tools  for access control policy testing; new concepts in  access control and policy enforcement; methods for  achieving comprehensive policy enforcement and  data interoperability across enterprise data services;  test methods for mobile device (smart phone)  application security; validation of cryptography for  smart phones, and several government wide technical  exchange meetings on mobile device security. For the  federal government’s cloud computing initiatives,  SSAG led the NIST Security Working Group’s task of  developing the NIST Cloud Computing - Security  Reference Architecture working document, and  contributed to the development of the white paper  “Challenging Security Requirements for the USG  Cloud Computing Adoption.” To improve access to new  technologies, SSAG chaired, edited, and participated  in the development of a wide variety of national and  international security standards.  Group Manager:  Mr. David Ferraiolo  david.ferraiolo@nist.gov  (301) 975-3046  Security Outreach and Integration Group  Mission Statement:  Develop, integrate, and promote the mission- specific application of information security standards,  guidelines, best practices, and technologies.  Overview:  The U.S. economy, citizens, and government rely  on information technology. Protecting information  technology, including its information and the  information infrastructure, is critical for the nation.  As part of the Computer Security Division, the Security  Outreach and Integration Group (SOIG) leverages its  broad cybersecurity and risk management expertise to  develop, integrate, and promote security standards,  guidelines, tools, technologies, methodologies, tests,  and measurements to address critical cybersecurity  needs in many areas of national and international  importance.  Major initiatives in this area include the development  of standards, guidelines, tools, technologies, and  methodologies to enable the security and risk  management of the Information and Communications  Technologies (ICT) supply chain; Smart Grid; Electronic  Voting; Cyber Physical and Industrial Control Systems;  Health Information Technology; National Public Safety  Broadband Network, and the Federal Information  Security Management Act (FISMA) implementation  program. The group also serves as lead for the National  Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE), and  provides extended outreach initiatives to stakeholders  across federal, state, and local governments, industry,  academia, small businesses, and the public.  Key to the group’s success is the ability to interact  with a broad constituency – government, industry,  academia, and the public – in order to ensure that  SOIG’s program is consistent with national objectives  related to or impacted by information security.  Through collaboration, cooperation, and open and  transparent public engagement, SOIG works to address  these critical cybersecurity challenges, enable greater  U.S. industrial competitiveness, and facilitate the  practical implementation of scalable and sustainable  information security standards and practices.  Group Manager:  Mr. Kevin Stine  kevin.stine@nist.gov  (301) 975-4483  Introduction to Computer Security Division’s 5 Groups  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  Security Testing, Validation, and  Measurement Group  Mission Statement:  Advance information security testing, measurement  science, and conformance.  Overview:  Federal agencies, industry, and the public rely on  cryptography for the protection of information and  communications used in electronic commerce, critical  infrastructure, and other application areas. At the  core of all products offering cryptographic services  is the cryptographic module. Cryptographic modules,  which contain cryptographic algorithms, are used in  products and systems to provide security services  such as confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.  Although cryptography is used to provide security,  weaknesses such as poor design or weak algorithms can  render a product insecure and place highly sensitive  information at risk. When protecting their sensitive  data, federal government agencies require a minimum  level of assurance that cryptographic products meet  their security requirements. Also, federal agencies are  required to use only tested and validated cryptographic  modules. Adequate testing and validation of the  cryptographic module and its underlying cryptographic  algorithms against established standards is essential to  provide security assurance.  The group’s testing-focused activities include  validating cryptographic algorithm implementations,  cryptographic modules, and Security Content  Automation Protocol (SCAP)-compliant products;  developing test suites and test methods; providing  implementation guidance and technical support to  industry forums; and conducting education, training,  and outreach programs.  All of the Security Testing, Validation, and  Measurement Group’s validation programs work  together with independent Cryptographic and Security  Testing laboratories that are accredited by the NIST  National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program  (NVLAP). Based on the independent laboratory test  report and test evidence, the Validation Program  then validates the implementation under test. The  validations awarded to vendor implementations are  publicly posted on the NIST website.  Group Manager:  Mr. Michael Cooper  michael.cooper@nist.gov  (301) 975-8077  66  mailto:michael.cooper@nist.gov  The CSD Implements FISMA of 2002The Computer Security Division Implements the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002  The E-Government Act, Public Law 107-347, passed by  the 107th Congress and signed into law by the President in  December 2002, recognized the importance of information  security to the economic and national security interests  of the United States. Title III of the E-Government Act,  entitled the Federal Information Security Management  Act (FISMA) of 2002, included duties and responsibilities  for the National Institute of Standards and Technology,  Information Technology Laboratory, Computer Security  Division (CSD). In 2012, CSD addressed its assignments  through the following activities:  ��Issued one final and two draft Federal Information  Processing Standards (FIPS) that specify hash  algorithms used to generate message digests,  algorithms used to generate digital signatures,  and technical requirements for a common  identification standard for federal employees  and contractors;  ��Issued 28 draft and final NIST Special Publications  (SPs) that provide management, operational,  and technical security guidelines in areas such  as BIOS management and measurement, key  management and derivation, media sanitization,  electronic authentication, security automation,  Bluetooth and wireless protocols, incident  handling and intrusion detection, malware,  cloud computing, public key infrastructure,  and risk assessments. In addition, 12 draft and  final NIST Interagency Reports were issued on  a variety of topics including supply chain risk  management, personal identity verification,  access control, security automation and  continuous monitoring, and the Smart Grid  Advanced Metering Infrastructure;  ��Produced guidelines concerning the handling of  information security incidents to help agencies  analyze incident-related data and determine  the appropriate response to each incident;  ��Continued the successful collaboration with the  Office of the Director of National Intelligence,  the Committee on National Security Systems,  and the Department of Defense to establish a  common foundation for information security  across the federal government, including a  structured, yet flexible approach for managing  information security risk across an organization.  In 2012, this collaboration produced foundational  guidelines for conducting risk assessments, and  updated guidelines for selecting and specifying  security controls for federal information systems  and organizations;  ��Provided assistance to agencies and the  private sector: conducted ongoing, substantial  reimbursable and non-reimbursable assistance  to the government and private sector, including  many outreach efforts through the Federal  Information Systems Security Educators’  Association (FISSEA), the Federal Computer  Security Program Managers’ Forum, and the  Small Business Information Security Corner;  ��Reviewed security policies and technologies  from the private sector and national security  systems for potential federal agency use:  hosted a repository of federal agency security  practices, public/private security practices,  and security configuration checklists for IT  products. Continued to lead, in conjunction with  the Government of Canada’s Communications  Security Establishment, the Cryptographic  Module Validation Program (CMVP). The Common  Criteria Evaluation and Validation Scheme  (CCEVS) and CMVP facilitate security testing of  IT products usable by the federal government;  ��Solicited recommendations of the Information  Security and Privacy Advisory Board (ISPAB)  on draft standards and guidelines, and on  information security and privacy issues;  ��Conducted workshops, awareness briefings,  and outreach to CSD customers to ensure  comprehension of standards and guidelines, to  share ongoing and planned activities, and to aid  in scoping guidelines in a collaborative, open,  and transparent manner. CSD also held workshops  on diverse information security and technology  topics including security automation, identity  management, information and communications  technologies supply chain risk management,  information security awareness and training,  cybersecurity of cyber physical systems,  technical aspects of botnets, health information  security, and mobile computing; and  ��Produced an annual report as a NIST Special  Publication (SP).

The Computer Security Division Implements FISMA of 2002  77  http://csrc.nist.gov  8  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  CSD Work in National and International  Standards  CSD’s Part in National and International  ISO Security Standards Processes  Figure 1 (below) shows the many national and  international standards-developing organizations  (SDOs) involved in cybersecurity standardization.  CSD participates in many cybersecurity standards  activities in many of these organizations, either in  leadership positions or as editors and contributors.  Many of CSD’s publications have been the basis for  both national and international standards projects.  This section discusses CSD standards activities  in conjunction with InterNational Committee for  Information Technology Standards (INCITS) Technical  Committee Cyber Security (CS) 1, where Dan Benigni  serves as Chair and U.S. Head of Delegation to SC 27.  The International Organization for  Standardization  The International Organization for Standardization  (ISO) is a network of the national standards  institutes of 148 countries, with the representation  of one member per country. The scope of ISO covers  standardization in all fields except electrical and  electronic engineering standards, which are the  responsibility of the International Electrotechnical  Commission (IEC).  The IEC prepares and publishes international  standards for all electrical, electronic, and related  technologies, including electronics, magnetics and  electromagnetics, electroacoustics, multimedia,  telecommunication, and energy production and  distribution, as well as associated general disciplines  such as terminology and symbols, electromagnetic  compatibility, measurement and performance,  dependability, design and development, safety, and  the environment.  CSD’s Programs/Projects for FY2012CSD’s Programs/Projects for FY2012  Figure 1: SDOs involved in Cybersecurity  9  Joint Technical Committee 1 (JTC 1) was formed  by ISO and IEC to be responsible for international  standardization in the field of Information Technology.  It develops, maintains, promotes, and facilitates  IT standards required by global markets, meeting  business and user requirements concerning—  ��Design and development of IT systems and  tools;  ��Performance and quality of IT products and  systems;  ��Security of IT systems and information;  ��Portability of application programs;  ��Interoperability of IT products and systems;  ��Unified tools and environments;  ��Harmonized IT vocabulary; and  ��User-friendly and ergonomically designed  user interfaces.  JTC 1 consists of a number of subcommittees (SCs)  and working groups that address specific technologies.  SCs that produce standards relating to IT security  include:  ��SC 06 - Telecommunications and Information  Exchange Between Systems;  ��SC 17 - Cards and Personal Identification;  ��SC 27 - IT Security Techniques; and  ��SC 37 – Biometrics (Fernando Podio of NIST  serves as Chair).  JTC1 also has—  ��Technical Committee 68 – Financial Services;  ��SC 2 - Operations and Procedures including  Security;  ��SC 4 – Securities;  ��SC 6 - Financial Transaction Cards, Related  Media and Operations; and  ��SC 7 – Software and Systems Engineering.  The American National Standards  Institute  The American National Standards Institute (ANSI)  is a private, nonprofit organization (501(c)(3)) that  administers and coordinates the U.S. voluntary  standardization and conformity assessment system.  ANSI facilitates the development of American National  Standards (ANSs) by accrediting the procedures of  standards-developing organizations (SDOs). The  InterNational Committee for Information Technology  Standards (INCITS) is accredited by ANSI.  ANSI promotes the use of U.S. standards  internationally, advocates U.S. policy and technical  positions in international and regional standards  organizations, and encourages the adoption of  international standards as national standards where  they meet the needs of the user community. ANSI is  the sole U.S. representative and dues-paying member  of the two major non-treaty international standards  organizations, ISO and, via the United States National  Committee (USNC), the IEC.  INCITS serves as the ANSI Technical Advisory Group  (TAG) for ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1. INCITS  is sponsored by the Information Technology Industry  (ITI) Council, a trade association representing the  leading U.S. providers of information technology  products and services. INCITS currently has more than  975 published standards.  INCITS is organized into Technical Committees that  focus on the creation of standards for different  technology areas. Technical committees that focus  on IT security and IT security-related technologies, or  that may require separate security standards include:  ��B10 – Identification Cards and Related  Devices (Sal Francomacaro, Chair Task  Group B10.12, Integrated Circuit Cards with  Contacts);  ��CS1 – Cyber Security (Dan Benigni, Chair  and Richard Kissel, NIST Principal voting  member);  ��E22 – Item Authentication;  ��M1 – Biometrics (Fernando Podio, Chair);  ��T3 – Open Distributed Processing (ODP);  ��T6 – Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)  Technology;  ��CGIT1 – Corporate Governance of IT (Richard  Kissel, NIST Principal voting member and  International Representative); and  ��DAPS38 – Distributed Application Platforms  and Services.  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  10  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  As a technical committee of INCITS, CS1 develops  United States, national, ANSI-accredited standards in  the area of cybersecurity. Its scope encompasses—  ��Management of information security and  systems;  ��Management of third-party information  security service providers;  ��Intrusion detection;  ��Network security;  ��Cloud computing security;  ��Supply chain risk management;  ��Incident handling;  ��IT security evaluation and assurance;  ��Security assessment of operational systems;  ��Security requirements for cryptographic  modules;  ��Protection profiles;  ��Role-based access control;  ��Security checklists;  ��Security metrics;  ��Cryptographic and non-cryptographic  techniques and mechanisms including  confidentiality, entity authentication,  non-repudiation, key management, data  integrity, message authentication, hash  functions, and digital signatures;  ��Future service and applications standards  supporting the implementation of control  objectives and controls as defined in ISO  27001, in the areas of business continuity,  and outsourcing;  ��Identity management, including identity  management framework, role-based access  control, and single sign-on; and  ��Privacy technologies, including privacy  framework, privacy reference architecture,  privacy infrastructure, anonymity and  credentials, and specific privacy-enhancing  technologies.  The scope of CS1 explicitly excludes the areas of  work on cybersecurity standardization presently  under way in INCITS B10, M1, T3, T10, and T11, as  well as other standard groups, such as the Alliance  for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS), the  Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.  (IEEE), the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF),  the Travel Industry Association of America (TIAA), and  Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X9. The CS1  scope of work includes standardization in most of the  same cybersecurity areas as are covered in the NIST  CSD.  As the U.S. TAG to ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27, CS1 contributes  to the SC 27 program of work on IT Security Techniques  in terms of comments and contributions on SC 27  standards projects; votes on SC 27 standards documents  at various stages of development; and nominates U.S.  experts to work on various SC 27 projects as editors,  coeditors, or in other SC 27 leadership positions.  Currently a number of CS1 members are serving as SC  27 document editors or coeditors on various standards  projects, including CSD staff Randy Easter and Richard  Kissel.  All input from CS1 is processed through INCITS to ANSI,  then to SC 27. It is also a conduit for getting U.S. - based  new work item proposals and U.S.-developed national  standards into the international SC 27 standards  development process. In its international efforts, CS1  responded to all calls for U.S. contributions and/or  voting positions on all international security standards  projects in ISO/IEC JTC1 SC 27 in a consistent, efficient,  and timely manner.  NIST contributes to many of CS1’s national and  international IT security standards efforts through its  membership on CS1, where Dan Benigni serves as the  nonvoting chair and Richard Kissel as the NIST Principal  voting member. Internationally, there are over 100  published standards, and almost all have been adopted  as U.S. national standards. There are more than 100  current international standards projects.  CSD’s Role in Cybersecurity Standardization  CSD’s cybersecurity research also plays a direct role  in the Cybersecurity Standardization efforts of CS1 at  the national level. During FY2012:  ��Through the CS1 Ad hoc Group on Role-Based  Access Control (RBAC), ANSI has published  three national standards:  11  �◦ “Requirements for the Implementation  and Interoperability of Role Based Access  Control”;  �◦ “Revision of INCITS 359 – 2004, Role Based  Access Control (RBAC)”; and  �◦ “Information technology -- Role Based Access  Control – Policy Enhanced” and Project 2214- D.  NIST originally authored RBAC, and Rick Kuhn is the  NIST lead in the Ad hoc group.  �� The NIST Policy Machine research and  development has resulted in three ongoing  national standards projects in CS1 in the  early stages of development. They include:  �◦ “Next Generation Access Control  -Implementation Requirements, Protocols  and API Definitions (NGAC-IRPADS).” Its  assigned project number is 2193-D;  �◦ Just published “Next Generation Access  Control –Functional Architecture (NGAC- FA).” Its assigned project number is 2194-D;  David Ferraiolo of NIST is editor; and  �◦ “Next Generation Access Control – Generic  Operations & Abstract Data Structures  (NGAC-GOADS).” Its assigned project  number is 2195-D, and Serban Gavrila of  NIST is editor.  Within CS1, liaisons are maintained with nearly 20  organizations. They include the following:  �� Open Group;  �� IEEE P1700 and P1619;  �� Forum of Incident Response and Security  Teams (FIRST);  �� American Bar Association (ABA), section on  Science and Technology;  �� ABA Federated Identity Management Legal  (IdM Legal) Task Force;  �� INCITS T11, M1, CGIT1, DAPS38, and PL22;  �� Internet Security Alliance;  �� Trusted Computing Group;  �� Kantara Initiative Identity Assurance Working  Group (IAWG);  �� Cloud Security Alliance;  �� SC 7 TAG;  �� Scientific Working Group on Digital Evidence  (SWGDE); and  �� The Storage Networking Industry Association  (SNIA).

CSD staff also serves as  the U.S. Head of delegation to Working Group 4 and  Working Group 11 of the International Organization  for Standardization / International Electrotechnical  Commission (ISO/IEC) Joint Technical Committee (JTC)  1 Subcommittee 17.  In addition to chairing the B10.12 committee,  CSD provides technical and editorial support in the  development of national and international standards.  Specifically, CSD staff serves as the technical editor  of ANSI 504-1, Generic Identity Command Set (GICS).  GICS provides for Personal Identity Verification (PIV),  PIV-I (PIV-Interoperable) and Common Access Card  (CAC) card applications (but not limited to these  applications) to be built from a single platform.  GICS defines an open platform where identity  applications can be instantiated, deployed, and used  in an interoperable way between the credential  issuers and credential users. CSD staff also provides  significant input to standards of major interest to  U.S. government agencies and U.S. markets. CSD  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  12  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  influences the development and revision of ISO/IEC  7816 (Identification Cards, Integrated Circuit Cards),  ISO/IEC 24727 (Identification Cards, Integrated Circuit  Card Programming Interfaces), and ISO/IEC 24787  (Biometrics ‘Match On Card’ Comparison).  During FY2012, many of these standards reached  important milestones: ANSI 504 was published; ISO/IEC  24727 amendments to part 2, 3, and 4 were published;  ISO/IEC 7816 part 4 was updated to add significant  functionality: several modifications requested by the  U.S. delegation are now part of this standard. CSD  provides contributions and feedback on many other  INCITS B10 standards projects that support identity  management.  CSD’s investment in this section is motivated by  the “new technical ideas” that are supported by  these standards. For example, ANSI 504 (GICS) is an  ID platform that leverages the existing FIPS 201 (PIV)  infrastructure to offer support to a larger number  of initiatives for both government agencies and  enterprises. In particular, it aims to support initiatives  like the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in  Cyberspace (NSTIC). ISO/IEC 24727 aims to create  an interoperability framework to increase resilience  and scalability of identity management solutions  and provide interoperability domestically and  internationally.

During 2011-2012, CSD strengthened its collaboration  with the Department of Defense, the Intelligence  Community, and the Committee on National Security  Systems, in partnership with the Joint Task Force  Transformation Initiative, which continues to  develop key cybersecurity guidelines for protecting  federal information and information systems for the  Unified Information Security Framework. Previously,  the Joint Task Force developed common security  guidance in the critical areas of security controls  for information systems and organizations, security  assessment procedures to demonstrate security  control effectiveness, security authorizations for risk  acceptance decisions, and continuous monitoring  activities to ensure that decision makers receive  the most up-to-date information on the security  state of their information systems. In addition, CSD  worked with the General Services Administration’s  (GSAs), Federal Risk and Authorization Management  Program to identify security assessment requirements,  1  and prototype a process for approving Third-Party  Assessment Organizations (3PAOs) that demonstrate  capability in assessing Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)  information systems for conformance to NIST standards  and guidelines.  In FY2012,  initiatives:  CSD worked on the following three  (i) Risk Management and Risk Assessment  Guidelines: Developed a comprehensive  risk assessment guideline examining the  relationships among key risk factors including  threats, vulnerabilities, impact, and likelihood.  NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-30, Revision  1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments, is  the fifth in the series of risk management and  information security guidelines being developed  by the Joint Task Force. This revision changes the  focus of SP 800-30, originally published as a risk  management guideline, to focus exclusively on  conducting risk assessments. The risk assessment  guidance in SP 800-30 has been significantly  expanded to include more in-depth information  on a wide variety of risk factors essential to  determining information security risk (e.g.,  threat sources and events, vulnerabilities and  predisposing conditions, impact, and likelihood  of threat occurrence). A three-step process is  described including key activities to prepare  for risk assessments, activities to successfully  conduct risk assessments, and approaches to  maintain the currency of assessment results.  In addition to providing a comprehensive  process for assessing information security  risk, this publication also describes how to  apply the process at the three tiers in the risk  management hierarchy—the organization level,  the mission/business process level, and the  information system level. To facilitate ease  of use for individuals or groups conducting  risk assessments within organizations, this  publication also provides a set of exemplary  templates, tables, and assessment scales for  common risk factors. The templates, tables, and  assessment scales give maximum flexibility in  designing risk assessments based on the express  GENERIC RISK MODEL WITH KEY RISK FACTORS  producing  initiates exploits causing  Threat  Source  Threat  Predisposing  Conditions  Event Vulnerability  with Risk  as a combination of  Impact and Likelihood  with Severity  In the context of  Inputs from Risk Framing Step  (Risk Management Strategy or Approach)  Influencing and Potentially Modifying  Key Risk Factors  with  Characteristics  (e.g., Capability, Intent, and  Targeting for Adversarial Threats)  with  Sequence  of actions, activities,  or scenarios  with  Likelihood  of Initiation  with  Likelihood  of Success  with  Degree  with  Pervasiveness  with  Effectiveness  Security Controls  Planned / Implemented  ORGANIZATIONAL RISK  To organizational operations (mission, functions,  image, reputation), organizational assets,  individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.

The Figure 2 on  previous page illustrates a generic risk model  with key risk factors.  (ii)  Criteria and Guidelines for Recognizing  Security Assessment Provider Organizations:  CSD developed proficiency tests and capability  demonstration requirements for evaluating the  capability of security assessment organizations  to conduct security assessments of information  systems security controls for compliance to  NIST standards and guidelines. The technical  capability requirements were derived from  draft NIST Interagency Report (NISTIR) 7328,  Security Assessment Provider Requirements and  Customer Responsibilities: Building a Security  Assessment Credentialing Program for Federal  Information Systems.  (iii) FISMA Outreach Activity to Public and  Private Sector Organizations: CSD conducted  cybersecurity outreach briefings and provided  support to state and local governments as  well as private sector organizations on topics  of interest, such as effective implementation  of the NIST Risk Management Framework. In  addition, CSD conducted outreach activities with  academic institutions, providing information on  NIST’s security standards and guidelines and  exploring new areas of cybersecurity research  and development.  In FY2012, CSD completed the following activities:  ��Developed NIST SP 800-30, Revision 1, Guide  for Conducting Risk Assessments;  ��Developed draft SP 800-53, Revision 4,  Recommended Security Controls for Federal  Information Systems and Organizations;  ��Released example security assessment cases  for  assessment procedures in SP 800-53A,  Revision 1, Guide for Security Assessment  of Federal Information Systems and  Organizations: Building Effective Security  Assessment Plans; and  ��Collaborated with the ITL Software and  Systems Division and the NIST Standards  Coordination Office using the International  Standard ISO/IEC 17020:2008 General  criteria for the operation of various types of  bodies performing inspections, in support of  GSA in establishing a process for qualifying  Third Party Assessment Organizations  (3PAOs) to conduct security assessments of  Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) information  systems consistent with GSA requirements  based on NIST standards and guidelines.  In FY2013, CSD intends to:  ��Finalize SP 800-53, Revision 4, Recommended  Security Controls for Federal Information  Systems and Organizations;  ��Develop SP 800-53A, Revision 2, Guide for  Assessing the Security and Privacy Controls  in Federal Information Systems and  Organizations;  ��Develop draft SP 800-18, Revision 2, Guide  for Developing Security Plans for Federal  Information Systems and Organizations;  ��Develop an information system security and  engineering guideline; and  ��Expand cybersecurity outreach to  include additional state, local, and tribal  governments as well as private sector  organizations and academic institutions.  Additionally, the outreach program will  continue to support federal agencies in  effective implementation of the NIST Risk  Management Framework.  http://csrc.nist.gov/sec-cert  Contacts:  Dr. Ron Ross Ms. Pat Toth  (301) 975-5390 (301) 975-5140  ron.ross@nist.gov patricia.toth@nist.gov  Mr. Arnold Johnson Ms. Kelley Dempsey  (301) 975-3247 (301) 975-2827  arnold.johnson@nist.gov kelley.dempsey@nist.gov  Ms. Peggy Himes  (301) 975-2489  peggy.himes@nist.gov  mailto:peggy.himes%40nist.gov?subject= mailto:kelley.dempsey@nist.gov mailto:arnold.johnson@nist.gov mailto:patricia.toth@nist.gov mailto:ron.ross@nist.gov http://csrc.nist.gov/sec-cert  15  Biometric Standards and Associated  Conformity Assessment Testing Tools  CSD staff responds to government, industry, and  market requirements for open systems standards by:  �� Accelerating development of formal  biometric standards;  �� Providing effective leadership and technical  participation in the development of these  standards;  �� Developing Conformance Test Architectures  and Test Suites designed to test  implementations of biometric standards;  �� Supporting harmonization of biometric,  tokens, and security standards;  �� Promoting biometric standards adoption;  and  �� Promoting conformity assessment efforts.  CSD continues to work in close partnership with  government agencies, industry, and academic  institutions to achieve the project goals delineated  above. CSD actively participates in a number  of biometric standards development projects,  contributes to the development of biometric  standards, and leads national and international  biometric standards bodies. Nationally, CSD’s staff  leads InterNational Committee for Information  Technology Standards (INCITS) Technical Committee  1 (M1) – Biometrics; international efforts include Joint  Technical Committee 1 (JTC 1) of the International  Standards Organization (ISO) and the International  Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Subcommittee  SC 37 - Biometrics - JTC 1/SC 37. CSD plans to continue  this work in FY2013.  During FY2012, CSD developed and publicly released  one advanced Conformance Test Architecture (CTA)  designed to test implementations of the International  Standards Organization/International Electrotechnical  Commission (ISO/IEC) biometric standards called  BioCTS2012 for ISO/IEC and another CTA designed  to test implementations of the American National  Standards Institute (ANSI)/NIST-ITL 1-2011 (AN-2011)  standard.1 This architecture is called BioCTS2012 for  ANSI/NIST 2011.  Eight Conformance Test Suites (CTSs) to test  implementations of binary-encoded data formats were  developed and released. These test implementations  of the first and second generation of binary-encoded  data formats developed by the Joint Technical  Commission 1 Subcommittee 37 – Biometrics  (JTC 1/SC 37) (finger minutiae and finger image,  face, and iris image data formats). The CTS  set also includes two CTSs designed to support  testing of on-card and off-card Personal Identity  Verification (PIV) iris data format profiles specified  in draft NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-76-2,  Biometric Data Specification for Personal Identity  Verification (released June 2012). These CTSs run  under BioCTS 2012 for ISO/IEC.  BioCTS2012 for AN-2011 incorporates over 1,200  test assertions designed to test the requirements  of selected Record Types of AN-2011. Other Record  Types included in AN-2011 Transactions are detected  and their length and location in the transactions are  reported. The test assertions implemented in code  for BioCTS2012 for AN-2011 are documented in NIST  SP 500-295, Conformance Testing Methodology for  ANSI/NIST-ITL 2011, American National Standard  for Information Systems, Data Format for the  Interchange of Fingerprint, Facial & Other Biometric  Information (September 2012), developed by the  NIST/ITL AN-2011 Conformance Testing Methodology  Working Group.  These tools were designed to achieve significant  functionality, usability, and performance. NIST  Interagency Report (NISTIR) 7877, BioCTS 2012:  Advanced Conformance Test Architectures and Test  Suites for Biometric Data Interchange Formats and  Biometric Information Records (September 2012),  and a presentation delivered at the last Biometric  Consortium conference2 discussed these test tools and  provided technical implementation details. This work  is sponsored, in part, by DHS/US-VISIT.  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  16  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  In FY2013, CSD plans to develop additional CTSs to  test implementations of international biometric data  interchange formats under development in JTC 1/SC 37  for both binary and Extensible Markup Language (XML)  data-encoded formats as well as extending BioCTS  for AN-2011 to other record types (for Traditional and  XML encoding). CSD plans to research handling large  number of files concurrently to increase still further  test report capabilities and analysis. CSD will also  continue researching and developing additional test  environments support (such as web services and tools  in the cloud).  A more detailed discussion on the need for  conformance testing and roadmaps of conformance  test tools development for the following period can  be found in NISTIR 7877 and two related presentations  delivered during 20123, 4. CSD is currently evaluating  the users’ needs for conformance test tools to support  testing of additional biometric standard profile  implementations.  CSD cochaired the Biometric Consortium conferences  and developed the conference technical programs in  cooperation with a member of the National Security  Agency’s staff. The 2012 annual conference, held  September 18-20, 2012 in Tampa, Florida, included  nearly 1,700 attendees from 30 countries representing  government, industry, and academia. The four- track conference included presentations given by  internationally recognized experts in biometric  technologies, system and application developers, IT  business strategists, and government and commercial  officers. It focused on biometric technologies for  homeland security, identity management, border  crossing, electronic commerce, and other applications.  Dr. Charles H. Romine, Director of the Information  Technology Laboratory at NIST, was a keynote speaker.  Other keynote and featured speakers were Mr. Steven  Martinez, Executive Assistant Director, Science and  Technology Branch, Federal Bureau of Investigation;  Mr. Peter F. Verga, Chief of Staff for the Under  17  Secretary of Defense for Policy; Dr. Husni Fahmi, Chief  of Sub-directorate Population Administration, Head of  the e-KPT Technical Team, Ministry of Home Affairs,  Indonesia; Mr. Stephen Dennis, Technical Director  HSARPA (Homeland Security Advanced Research  Projects Agency), Science and Technology Directorate,  Department of Homeland Security; Mr. Duane  Blackburn, Multi-Discipline Systems Engineer, MITRE;  and Mr. R. S. Sharma, Director General and Mission  Director, Unique Identification Authority of India.  The conference program included sessions on  federal government programs, advances on  biometric technologies (e.g., face recognition, rapid  DNA [Deoxyribonucleic acid], iris) and standards,  Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  (IEEE) Biometrics - Identity and Security (BIdS)  research, international biometric programs, and  an Armed Forces Communications and Electronics  Association (AFCEA) Identity Management session.  NIST’s session highlighted achievements and ongoing  biometric research, testing, and standards projects  delivered by experts from the NIST Information  Access and Computer Security Divisions, the  Standards Coordination Office, and the Office of  Law Enforcement Standards. In addition, a number  of workshops and special sessions were held  addressing topics such as biometric security,  large-scale  identity solutions, Organization for the Advancement  of Structured Information Standards (OASIS)  biometrics, the role of biometrics in the National  Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC)  identity ecosystem, a new biometrics domain for  XML, and biometrics in a cloud computing  environment. Over 135 speakers participated in  the program. CSD coordinated NIST’s booth at the  Technology Expo presented by AFCEA, which was  collocated with the conference. The NIST booth  showcased NIST/ITL ongoing projects and provided  attendees with technology demonstrations and  technical information on these projects. CSD plans  to continue supporting the Biometric Consortium at  its 2013 annual conference scheduled for September  17–19 in Tampa, Florida.

The Computer Security Division (CSD)  has provided leadership and expertise to the Smart  Grid Interoperability Panel’s Cyber Security Working  Group. Leveraging CSD’s broad expertise in relevant  areas, CSD is now looking at the cybersecurity needs  of the broader landscape of cyber-physical systems.  Cyber-physical systems (CPS), hybrid networked  cyber and engineered physical elements codesigned  to create adaptive and predictive systems for  enhanced performance, are commonly used in the  nation’s critical infrastructure. Such systems control  the electrical grid, provide clean water, produce  chemicals, and underlie transportation systems. CPS  are gaining in capability as advances are made in  technology, and they are critical to future engines of  growth such as advanced manufacturing, as well as  safety initiatives such as autonomous driving cars.  Cybersecurity is an important cross-cutting discipline  that is critical to provide confidence that CPS and  their information and supporting communications and  information infrastructure are adequately safeguarded.  CPS have many unique characteristics, including  the need for real-time response and extremely high  availability, predictability, and reliability. However,  despite the ubiquity and criticality of CPS, little  thought has been given so far to secure design. As a  result, there have been successful and major attacks  such as Stuxnet, Duqu, Flame, and Gauss that target  CPS controlling critical infrastructure.  In April 2012, CSD hosted a two-day workshop  to explore CPS cybersecurity needs, with a focus  on research results and real-world deployment  experiences across multiple industries, including  healthcare, manufacturing, automotive, and the  electric Smart Grid. The goals of the workshop were  to gain a better understanding of the cybersecurity  challenges faced by CPS across multiple industries, and  to determine if there are security requirements that  are unique to CPS as opposed to strictly cyber or physical  systems. More information on this workshop, including  the agenda, session abstracts, and slides, is available at  http://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/cyberphysical-workshop.cfm.  In 2013, CSD plans to host a workshop to identify and  evaluate the current and needed CPS standards and  practices, as well as tools, technologies, and safeguards  that protect CPS. CSD, in conjunction with NIST’s  Engineering Laboratory, will also be updating SP 800- 82, Guide to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security.  CSD will continue participating with the International  Society of Automation (ISA) 99 Committee, which  develops and establishes standards, recommended  practices, technical reports, and related information  that define procedures for implementing electronically  secure industrial automation and control systems and  security practices, and for assessing electronic security  performance.

CSD remained committed to the value  of communicating its R&D efforts to other federal  colleagues and identifying the opportunities to support  the R&D efforts of federal colleagues throughout the  federal government.  The NITRD Program operates under the aegis of the  NITRD Subcommittee of the National Science and  Technology Council (NSTC) Committee on Technology.  The Subcommittee, made up of representatives from  each of NITRD's member agencies, provides overall  coordination for NITRD activities.  Federal IT R&D, which launched and fueled the digital  revolution, continues to drive innovation in scientific  research, national security, communication, and  commerce to sustain U.S. technological leadership.  The NITRD agencies' collaborative efforts increase the  19  overall effectiveness and productivity of these federal  R&D investments, leveraging strengths, avoiding  duplication, and increasing interoperability of R&D  products.  The NITRD Program has its focus on the following  research areas:  ��Big Data (BD);  ��Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS);  ��Cyber Security and Information Assurance  (CSIA);  ��Health Information Technology Research and  Development (Health IT R&D);  ��Human Computer Interaction and Information  Management (HCI&IM);  ��High-Confidence Software and Systems  (HCSS);  ��High-End Computing (HEC);  ��Large-Scale Networking (LSN);  ��Software Design and Productivity (SDP);  ��Social, Economic, and Workforce Implications  of IT and IT Workforce Development (SEW);  and  ��Wireless Spectrum Research and  Development (WSRD).  CSD maintains a strong presence in many of these  groups with leadership roles in the CSIA Interagency  Working Group (IWG) cochaired by Bill Newhouse  and the SEW Education Team cochaired by Dr. Ernest  McDuffie. Colleagues from other divisions within  the Information Technology Laboratory maintain  leadership roles in Faster Administration of Science  and Technology Education and Research (FASTER)  Community of Practice (CoP), HCI&IM, and SDP. NIST  colleagues from the Engineering Laboratory have  leadership roles in HCSS and the Senior Steering Group  for Cyber-Physical Systems.  The CSIA IWG used its monthly meetings to explore the  themes and thrusts expressed in the Strategic Plan for  the Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development.1  This plan represents the culmination of focused  interactions with academia and industry on  forward-thinking concepts and was published by the  CSIA IWG in December 2011. The plan introduces  1http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/  fed_cybersecurity_rd_strategic_plan_2011.pdf  four game-changing themes (Tailored Trustworthy  Spaces, Moving Target, Cyber Economic Incentives,  and Designed-In Security); describes the need to  develop Scientific Foundations which minimize  future cybersecurity problems by developing the  science of security; identifies the relevant national  priorities where CSD can maximize research impact by  catalyzing coordination, collaboration, and integration  of research activities across federal agencies for  maximum effectiveness; and accelerates Transition  to Practice by expediting improvements in cyberspace  from research findings through focused transition  programs.  The breadth of CSD’s work was shared over the course  of the year’s monthly meetings. Specific briefings  were given on CSD’s efforts in the area of Continuous  Monitoring, Smart Grid, and Healthcare IT Security.  In addition to coordination via the NITRD programs,  CSD is a regular participant in the coordination  activities of the Federal Special Cyber Operations  Research and Engineering (SCORE) Committee, which  was established based on recognition by the architects  of the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative  (CNCI) that expanded R&D coordination was vital to  allow the nation to leap ahead of today’s cybersecurity  challenges.  On behalf of SCORE, CSD hosted an October 2011  cybersecurity “assumption buster” workshop focused  on cloud computing. It was the fourth in a series  of workshops designed to explore the assumptions  that cyber space is an adversarial domain, and the  adversary is tenacious, clever, and capable. By  reexamining cybersecurity solutions in the context of  these assumptions, the workshops aimed to identify  key insights that will lead to novel solutions for some  of the nation’s needs.  The SCORE committee interacts with CNCI leadership.  CSD not only represents the breadth of its work to this  committee, but also shares the progress and relevance  of research initiatives from other divisions across  NIST’s Information Technology Laboratory (ITL), such as  Foundations of Measurement Science for Information  System (Applied and Computational Mathematics  Division) and Usability (Information Access Division).

HAVA established the Election  Assistance Commission (EAC) and the Technical  Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC), chaired  by the Director of NIST. HAVA calls on NIST to provide  technical support to the EAC and TGDC in efforts  related to human factors, security, and laboratory  accreditation. As part of NIST’s efforts, CSD supports  the activities of the EAC and the TGDC related to  voting equipment security.  In the past year, CSD supported the EAC in updating  the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG), VVSG  1.1, by assisting the EAC with the development of a  new draft of the guidelines for public comment. The  security guidelines were updated to improve the  auditability of voting systems, to provide greater  software integrity protections, to expand and improve  access control requirements, and to help ensure that  cryptographic security mechanisms are implemented  properly. In addition, CSD supported the efforts of the  EAC and the Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP)  of the Department of Defense (DoD) to improve the  voting process for citizens under the Uniformed and  Overseas Citizens Voting Act (UOCAVA) by leveraging  electronic technologies. CSD worked with the TDCG’s  UOCAVA Working Group to develop a narrative risk  analysis on current UOCAVA voting processes, including  vote-by-mail and electronic ballot delivery. CSD’s work  on voting technologies has also spun off interesting  research topics, including the Rabin Beacon project  that is discussed separately in this annual report.  In FY2013, CSD will assist the EAC in developing  responses to public comments and provide updates  to VVSG 1.1 and the associated security test suites.  CSD will continue to support the efforts for the EAC  and FVAP to improve the voting process for UOCAVA  voters. CSD will also continue to expand on research  activities, particularly in the areas of risks to voting  systems and innovative voting system architectures.  In addition, CSD will support the NIST National  Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP)  efforts to accredit voting system test laboratories by  developing proficiency tests and testing artifacts, and  by updating Handbook 150-22 used to accredit voting  system test laboratories. CSD plans to engage voting  system manufacturers, voting system test laboratories,  state election officials, and the academic community  to explore ways to increase voting system security and  transparency.  http://vote.nist.gov/  Contacts:  Dr. Nelson Hastings Mr. Andrew Regenscheid  (301) 975-5237 (301) 975-5155  nelson.hastings@nist.gov andrew.regenscheid@nist.gov  Mr. Joshua Franklin  (301) 975-8463  joshua.franklin@nist.gov  21  Health Information Technology Security  Health information technology (HIT) makes it possible  for healthcare providers to better manage patient care  through secure use and sharing of health information,  leading to improvements in healthcare quality, reduced  medical errors, increased efficiencies in care delivery  and administration, and improved population health.  Central to reaching these goals is the assurance of the  confidentiality, integrity, and availability of health  information. CSD works actively with government,  industry, academia, and others to provide security  tools, technologies, and methodologies that provide  for the security and privacy of health information.  In FY2012, NIST issued the Health Insurance  Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Security  Rule self-assessment toolkit to help organizations  better understand the requirements of the HIPAA  Security Rule, implement those requirements, and  assess those implementations in their operational  environment. This project enabled NIST to leverage  security automation specifications within the context  of the healthcare use case.  NIST continued its HIT security outreach efforts. NIST  and the Department of Health and Human Services’  (DHHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) cohosted the fifth  annual HIPAA Security Rule conference, “Safeguarding  Health Information: Building Assurance through HIPAA  Security,” in June 2012 at the Ronald Reagan Building  and International Trade Center in Washington, D.C.  The conference offered important sessions that  focused on broad topics of interest to the healthcare  and health IT security community. Over 500 attendees  from federal, state, and local governments, academia,  HIPAA-covered entities and business associates,  industry groups, and vendors heard from, and  interacted with, healthcare, security, and privacy  experts on technologies and methodologies for  safeguarding health information and for implementing  the requirements of the HIPAA Security Rule.  Presentations covered a variety of current topics  including updates on OCR’s health information  privacy and security audit and enforcement activities;  establishing an access audit program; securing mobile  devices; securing health information in the Cloud;  improving the usability and accessibility of HIT;  managing breaches of health information; and the  relationship between the HIPAA Security Rule and  Meaningful Use.  In FY2013, NIST plans to issue a draft revision to  Special Publication (SP) 800-66, An Introductory  Resource Guide for Implementing the HIPAA Security  Rule. As part of its continued outreach efforts, NIST  also plans to host the sixth annual “Safeguarding  Health Information” conference with OCR.  http://www.nist.gov/healthcare/security/index.cfm  Contacts:  Mr. Kevin Stine Mr. Matthew Scholl  (301) 975-4483 (301) 975-2941  kevin.stine@nist.gov matthew.scholl@nist.gov  ICT Supply Chain Risk Management  Federal agency information systems are increasingly  at risk of both intentional and unintentional supply  chain compromise due to the growing sophistication  of information and communications technologies  (ICT) and the growing speed and scale of a complex,  distributed global supply chain. A lack of visibility into,  and control over, the ICT supply chain increases the risk  technologies will be vulnerable to a variety of threats,  including counterfeit materials, malicious software,  disruption in logistics, and makes it increasingly difficult  for federal agencies to understand their exposure and  manage the associated supply chain risks.  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  22  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  The ICT Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM)  project seeks to provide federal agencies with a  standardized, repeatable, and feasible toolkit of  technical and intelligence resources to strategically  manage supply chain risk throughout the entire life  cycle of ICT products, systems and services.  In 2012, CSD continued to collaborate with several  industry, standards, academic, and government  organizations in order to learn about their efforts  related to SCRM, and provide technical input as  appropriate. NIST’s CSD issued draft NISTIR 7622,  Notional Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for  Federal Information Systems, in FY2012. This draft  document provides an initial set of means and methods  for reducing the risk associated with ICT supply  chain vulnerabilities. It also seeks to equip federal  departments and agencies with implementation  guidance as well as offer a set of practices acquiring  organizations can implement to increase their  understanding of, and visibility throughout, the supply  chain.  With a grant issued by NIST, the University of Maryland  (UMD), Robert H. Smith School of Business, Supply  Chain Management Center published a report which  inventories the proliferating array of existing public  and private sector ICT supply chain initiatives across  diverse ICT segment and formulates a framework  for defining various initiative within a single SCRM  architecture. This framework has three tiers:  enterprise risk governance, system integration, and  operations. Within each tier, the report defines a core  set of attributes or distinct organizational capabilities  to facilitate the identification and assessment of gaps  in coverage in the ICT SCRM community.  CSD also awarded a grant to UMD’s Supply Chain  Management Center to develop a prototype web  portal, which will include:  ��Enterprise Risk Assessments: Three-tier  risk score-carding system based on the ICT  SCRM Community Framework Reference  Architecture: Strategic Assessment/  Organizational Readiness, Practices from  NISTIR 7622, and composite network  vulnerability map of physical and cyber hubs  and nodes, with CVSS ratings;  ��Collaboration / Crowdsourcing: User- documented ICT SCRM use/abuse cases and  real-time polling about vulnerabilities and  responses;  ��ICT SCRM Initiatives: A dynamic matrix  of current industry and public sector ICT  SCRM best practices, standards, and policy  reform initiatives which can be updated by  appropriate individuals from across industry,  academia, and government; and  ��ICT SCRM Digital Library: An online repository  of policy and academic documents related  to ICT SCRM.  In FY2013, CSD will continue to research and develop  tools and guidance to help agencies more effectively  manage their ICT supply chain risk. In October 2013,  CSD intends to publish final NISTIR 7622, Notional  Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Federal  Information Systems.  CSD also plans to host a workshop in October 2012  to bring together a varied group of stakeholders  and thought leaders from industry, academia and  government to future NIST/CSD efforts relating to ICT  SCRM. Outputs from this workshop will include:  ��Fundamental underpinnings of ICT SCRM  (terms, definitions, characterizations);  ��Current and needed commercially reasonable  ICT SCRM-related standards and practices  (need, scope, and development approach);  ��Current and needed ICT SCRM tools,  technology and techniques useful in securing  the ICT supply chain; and  ��Current and needed research and resources.  CSD plans to use the proceedings of this workshop to  transition into producing a draft Special Publication (SP)  800-161 to provide federal departments and agencies  guidance on managing the risk to their ICT supply chains.  In addition, a number of small forums with academia,  industry, and government stakeholders will also be used  to inform the development of draft SP 800-161.  23  Contacts:  Mr. Jon Boyens Ms. Celia Paulsen  ICT SCRM Project Lead (301) 975-5981  (301) 975-5549 celia.paulsen@nist.gov  jon.boyens@nist.gov  Nationwide Public Safety Broadband  Network (NPSBN) Security  In February 2012, Congress passed the Middle  Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act. One portion  of this legislation calls for the  establishment of a nationwide,  interoperable public safety  broadband network based on  Long-Term Evolution (LTE)  technology to be deployed and  operated by the First Responder  Network Authority (FirstNet). The  planned National Public Safety  Broadband Network (NPSBN) is  intended to “create a much- needed nationwide interoperable  broadband network that will help police, firefighters,  emergency medical service professionals and other  public safety officials stay safe and do their jobs.”  (http://www.ntia.doc.gov/category/public-safety).  In addition, the Director of NIST is called upon to  establish a list of certified devices and components to  be adhered to when interacting with the nationwide  network for the use of public safety officials, vendors,  and other interested parties; and to conduct research  and development that supports the acceleration and  advancement of the nationwide network.  In FY2012, CSD advised the National  Telecommunications and Information Administration  (NTIA) and NIST’s Engineering Laboratory on the  security of the proposed NPSBN.  NTIA is helping the National Public Safety  Telecommunications Council (NPSTC) develop a  Statement of Requirements (SoR) to submit to FirstNet  that will describe, in increasing levels of detail, the  technical requirements of the NPSBN infrastructure,  equipment, and communications. This undertaking  has required the involvement of representatives of  numerous professional communities and a wide variety  of disciplines, including federal, state, local, and  tribal officials; public safety and other First Responder  personnel; mobile carrier operators; and mobile  device vendors. CSD commented and contributed text  for the security-related aspects of the SoR.  In FY2013, CSD plans to continue supporting the  development and refinement of the NPSTC SoR and  represent public safety in international standardization  efforts, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force  (IETF) and the 3rd Generation Partnership Project  (3GPP), that impact their communication requirements.  In addition, CSD will identify gaps between NIST  security guidelines and NPSBN security requirements  as well as relevant 3GPP LTE specifications. CSD also  plans to research some of the currently unresolved  issues and risks related to public safety security.

Key to the successful deployment  of the Smart Grid infrastructure is the development  of the cybersecurity strategy for the Smart Grid. In  fact, cybersecurity needs to be designed into the  deploying systems that support Smart Grid, and added  into existing systems. The electric grid is critical to  the economic and physical well-being of the nation,  and emerging cyber threats targeting power systems  highlight the need to integrate advanced security to  protect critical assets.

The CSWG has  more than 750 participants worldwide from the  private sector (including utilities, vendors, and  service providers),  academia, regulatory  organizations, state  and local government,  and U.S. federal  agencies. Membership  in the CSWG has been  free and open to all  since its inception. Many members participate from  around the world by monitoring the minutes and email  conversations of the subgroups.  1NIST Special Publication 1108R2, NIST Framework and Roadmap  for Smart Grid Interoperability Standards, Release 2.0 Available at  ht t p://www.nist .gov/sma rt grid/ uploa d/ NIST_ Fra me work _  Release_2-0_corr.pdf.  The CSWG membership collaborated to deliver the  NIST Interagency Report (NISTIR) 7628, Guidelines  for Smart Grid Cyber Security, in August 2010. Since  then the group has focused on specific topics such as  risk management processes, key management in the  Smart Grid, the Smart Grid security architecture,  security testing and certification, Advanced Metering  Infrastructure (AMI) security, and privacy in the Smart  Grid. In addition, the group is conducting security  reviews of many Smart Grid-related standards and  beginning to develop a User’s Guide for NISTIR 7628.  To complete the work, there are seven subgroups  that focus on specific topics. During the development  of NISTIR 7628, the subgroups performed detailed  technical analyses on an array of security-related  topics, and then documented the research, issues,  and guidance in specific sections. The approach  that has been taken by all subgroups is an open and  collaborative process in which any CSWG member is  welcome to participate and contribute.

Since the NISTIR 7628 publication,  some of the CSWG subgroups have merged, while  others are regrouping as they determine their next set  of tasks. The CSWG currently consists of the following  subgroups:  ��The Architecture subgroup focuses on  the enhancement of the logical security  architecture for the Smart Grid. This group’s  work is used as input to the SGIP Architecture  Committee;  ��The High-Level Requirements subgroup  addresses the procedural and technical  security requirements of the Smart Grid to  be addressed by stakeholders in Smart Grid  security. To create the initial set of security  requirements in NISTIR 7628, this subgroup  adapted industry-accepted security source  documents for the Smart Grid;  ��The NISTIR 7628 User’s Guide subgroup  will provide an easy-to-understand tool  that utilities and other entities involved in  implementing Smart Grid-based systems can  use to navigate NISTIR 7628 to identify and  select the security requirements needed to  help protect those systems;  ��The Privacy subgroup continues to  investigate privacy concerns between  utilities, consumers, and nonutility third  parties;  ��The Standards subgroup assesses standards  and other documents with respect to the  cybersecurity and privacy requirements  from NISTIR 7628. These assessments are  performed on the standards contained  in NIST Special Publication (SP) 1108,  Framework and Roadmap for Smart Grid  Interoperability Standards, or in support of  the SGIP’s Priority Action Plans (PAPs). The  group has reviewed over 75 documents to  date; and  ��The Testing and Certification subgroup  establishes guidance and methodologies for  cybersecurity testing of Smart Grid systems,  subsystems, and components.  During the past year, members of the CSWG  collaborated with the Department of Energy (DOE) and  the North American Electric Reliability Corporation  (NERC) to develop a harmonized electricity sector  enterprise-wide risk management process. This was  published by DOE as “Electricity Subsector Cybersecurity  Risk Management Process Guideline” in May 2012. The  CSWG also collaborated with the National Electric  Sector Cybersecurity Organization Resource (NESCOR)  to develop a technical white paper on Smart Energy  Profile (SEP) 1.0 and 1.1. The CSWG Lead, Marianne  Swanson, also served as a subject-matter expert on  the DOE Electricity Subsector Cybersecurity Capability  Maturity Model (ES-C2M2) project.  Members of the CSWG produced a white paper on  automating Smart Grid security in December 2011. The  group produced a mapping between the NERC Critical  Infrastructure Protection standards, version 5, and the  high-level security requirements found in NISTIR 7628.  For the SGIP’s second version of the Interoperability  Process Reference Manual, the group produced a  chapter on cybersecurity testing. The group also  developed an SGIP document, Guide for Testing the  NISTIR 7628 High-level Security Requirements, in order  to help utilities and other Smart Grid organizations  assess how well they are meeting those high-level  security requirements.  The CSWG’s Privacy subgroup developed customizable  train-the-trainer privacy briefings for utilities,  public utility commissions, and those dealing with  consumers. This subgroup also developed a set of  recommended practices for how third parties should  protect consumers’ privacy when handling customer  energy usage data received from a source other than a  utility (e.g., an in-home device).  CSD also supports CSWG by assessing the security of  cryptographic methods used in security protocols for  utilities’ communication and management networks  and by developing cryptographic security guidelines  for the Smart Grid. During the past year, CSD reviewed  and analyzed cryptographic techniques in the  Smart Energy Profile (SEP) standards, and provided  guidance to the CSWG. The EAX’ block cipher mode of  operation, specified in the ANSI C12.22-2008 standard,  26  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  was intended by industry to serve as a solution for  cybersecurity needs in smart meters. CSD reviewed  the EAX’ scheme, submitted by members of the ANSI  C11.22 SC 17 Committee, and decided not to include  it in the toolkit of NIST-approved algorithms. CSD  also reviewed the IEC 62541-6 standard (OPC unified  architecture - Part 6: Mappings)2 and identified issues  with the cryptographic methods used in the standard  that could potentially create a substantial security  risk for communication networks running the standard  protocol. CSD provided recommendations to improve  the security and performance of this standard.  CSD also represented the CSWG, in collaboration  with the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)  and Department of Energy/NESCOR, in identifying  requirements, features, and capabilities for a  cryptographic key-management system for an  Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). This is an  ongoing work project.  Future work includes working with the SGIP — the  Committees, the Domain Expert Working Groups, and  the Priority Action Plans — to integrate cybersecurity  into their work efforts. Collaboration will continue  with DOE and NERC to produce a cybersecurity risk  management process use case for the electricity sector  to accompany the Risk Management Process document.  Reviewing and updating NISTIR 7628 will occur in the  next year. This will result in the issuance of NISTIR  7628 Revision 1. Afterwards, the group will update the  Guide for Testing the NISTIR 7628 High-level Security  Requirements to reflect any changes in the high- level security requirements from NISTIR 7628 Rev. 1.  Members of the group will produce a white paper on  cloud computing and the Smart Grid, as well as the  NISTIR 7628 User’s Guide. The Standards subgroup will  continue to review documents for the SGIP. CSD will  continue to support the CSWG in the evaluation of the  cryptographic methods used in security protocols for  the communication and management networks used  by utility companies.  2Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) for Process Control  http://collaborate.nist.gov/twiki-sggrid/bin/view/  SmartGrid/WebHome  Contacts:  Ms. Marianne Swanson Ms. Tanya Brewer  (301) 975-3293 (301) 975-4534  marianne.swanson@nist.gov tbrewer@nist.gov  Mr. Quynh Dang  (301) 975-3610  qdang@nist.gov  Cybersecurity Awareness, Training,  Education, and Outreach  Î National Initiative for  Cybersecurity Education (NICE)  NIST became the lead for the National Initiative  for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) in 2010 based  on a recommendation of the Information and  Communications Infrastructure – Interagency Policy  Committee (ICI-IPC). This recommendation was built  out of chapter two of the May 2009 Cyberspace Policy  Review titled “Building Capacity for a Digital Nation”  and is responsive to President Obama’s declaration that  the “cyber threat is one of the most serious economic  and national security challenges we face as a nation”  and that “America’s economic prosperity in the 21st  century will depend on cybersecurity.”  The goal of NICE is to enhance the overall cybersecurity  posture of the United States by accelerating the  availability of educational and training resources  designed to improve the cyber behavior, skills, and  knowledge of every segment of the population,  enabling a safer cyberspace for all. NICE addresses this  challenging goal by:  �� Raising national awareness about risks in  cyberspace;  �� Broadening the pool of individuals prepared  to enter the cybersecurity workforce; and  �� Cultivating a globally competitive  cybersecurity workforce.  http://collaborate.nist.gov/twiki-sggrid/bin/view/SmartGrid/WebHome http://collaborate.nist.gov/twiki-sggrid/bin/view/SmartGrid/WebHome  27  This initiative comprises four component areas:  1) National Cybersecurity Awareness; 2) Formal  Cybersecurity Education; 3) Cybersecurity Workforce  Structure; and 4) Cybersecurity Workforce Training  and Professional Development.  The Computer Security Division (CSD) is home to the  NIST NICE Leadership Team (NNLT), and they focus on  the following activities for NICE:  ��Developing planning documents, and  building consensus on the strategy and  implementation activities of NICE;  ��Facilitating cross-functional cooperation  among NICE component lead agencies;  ��Fostering communication between the  component lead agencies by coordinating  meetings, facilitating discussions, and  disseminating information;  ��Promoting the initiative and its efforts  by representing NICE and speaking at  cybersecurity events nationwide;  ��Planning and hosting an annual workshop to  promote and support the evolving issues in  cybersecurity education;  ��Coordinating with other federal initiatives  and efforts related to NICE; and  ��Maintaining and updating the NICE website.  In FY2012, NIST updated the draft NICE Strategic Plan  and stewarded the National Cybersecurity Workforce  Framework, developed within NICE’s Cybersecurity  Workforce Training and Professional Development  Component, through government-wide review. Both  documents can be found on the NICE website, http://  csrc.nist.gov/nice/.  NIST organized and planned to host the third annual  NICE Workshop, “Shaping the Future of Cybersecurity  Education, Connecting the Dots in Cyberspace,”  from October 30 – November 1, 2012. However, the  workshop was cancelled due to Hurricane Sandy. The  next NICE workshop will be held in the fall of 2013  and will serve as a forum to develop the connections  within the cybersecurity and education communities  to make progress on the strategic goals and objectives  of NICE.  The NNLT attended more than 100 events, symposia,  forums, competitions, educational outreach  meetings, and workshops to promote the activities  within NICE. In FY2012, the National Cybersecurity  Education Council was established with the signing  of a Memorandum of Understanding between the  Department of Education, NIST, and over 50 private  sector organizations convened by the National Cyber  Security Alliance.  In FY2013, the NNLT plans to develop innovative  strategies to support the Office of Personnel  Management (OPM) issuance and the governmentwide  adoption of cybersecurity function codes that  will, for the first time, allow agencies to identify  their cybersecurity workforce. The NNLT will also  demonstrate the value of framework adoption to  government agencies and private sector organizations  who are formalizing their cybersecurity training needs.  The NNLT will be identifying opportunities to tie the  framework to existing and new training initiatives.  The NNLT has cultivated the trust of the Component  lead agencies. In FY2013, NNLT will use that trust to  best support the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) development of the National Initiative for  Cybersecurity Careers and Studies (NICCS) web portal.  All of the Components have identified deliverables and  milestones, and the NNLT will work to publicize the  accomplishments of the Components.  http://www.nist.gov/nice/  Contacts:  Dr. Ernest McDuffie Mr. Bill Newhouse  NICE Project Lead NICE Program Lead  (301) 975-8897 (301) 975-2869  ernest.mcduffie@nist.gov william.newhouse@nist.gov  Ms. Magdalena Benitez Ms. Pat Toth  (301) 975-6182 (301) 975-5140  mbenitez@nist.gov ptoth@nist.gov  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  mailto:ptoth@nist.gov mailto:mbenitez@nist.gov mailto:william.newhouse@nist.gov mailto:ernest.mcduffie@nist.gov http://www.nist.gov/nice  28  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  Î Computer Security Resource  Center (CSRC)  The Computer Security Resource Center (CSRC), CSD’s  website, is one of the most visited websites at NIST.

The Forum, which serves more  than 1,100 members, strives to provide an ongoing  opportunity for managers of federal information  security programs to exchange information security  materials in a timely manner, build upon the  experiences of other programs, and reduce possible  duplication of effort. It provides a mechanism for  NIST to share information directly with federal agency  information security program managers in fulfillment  of NIST’s leadership mandate under FISMA. It also assists  NIST in establishing and maintaining relationships with  other individuals or organizations that are actively  addressing information security issues within the  federal government. NIST serves as the Secretariat  of the Forum, providing necessary administrative  and logistical support. Kevin Stine serves as the  Chairperson for the Forum. Participation in Forum  meetings is open to federal government employees  who participate in the management of their  organization’s information security program as well  as their designated support contractors. There are no  membership dues.  The Forum maintains an extensive email list, holds  bimonthly meetings and an annual two-day conference  to discuss current issues and developments of  interest to those responsible for protecting sensitive  (unclassified) federal systems. The Forum plays a  valuable role in helping NIST and other federal agencies  to develop and maintain a strong, proactive stance in  the identification and resolution of new strategic and  tactical IT security issues as they emerge.  Topics of discussion at Forum meetings in FY2012  included briefings from various federal agencies on  a telework reference architecture; National Archives  and Records Administration’s (NARA) Controlled  Unclassified Information (CUI) Implementation  Guidance for Executive Order 13556; Federal Public  Key Infrastructure (PKI) Security Profile; Combinatorial  Methods in Software Testing; NIST SP 800-63-1,  Electronic Authentication Guide; Federal Risk and  Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP);  Treasury’s PIV Program Implementation; and Electricity  Subsector Cybersecurity Risk Management.

NIST’s plan includes a graceful transition to  a NIST program supported by the current Executive  Board, and include direct and formal connections with  the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education  (NICE).  FISSEA membership is open to information systems  security professionals, professional trainers and  educators, and managers responsible for information  systems security training programs in federal agencies,  as well as contractors of these agencies and faculty  members of accredited educational institutions who  are involved in information security training and  education. There are no membership fees to join  FISSEA; all that is required is a willingness to share  products, information, and experiences. Business is  administered by a working group that meets monthly.  FISSEA maintains a website, a mailing list, and  participates in a social networking site as a means of  improving communication for its members. NIST assists  FISSEA with its operations by providing staff support  for several of its activities and by being FISSEA’s host  agency.  FISSEA membership in 2012 spanned federal agencies,  industry, military, contractors, state governments,  academia, the press, and foreign organizations to  reach over 1,295 members in a total of ten countries.  The 700 federal agency members represent 89  agencies from the executive and legislative branches  of government.  The 2012 FISSEA conference returned to NIST on  March 27-29, 2012, and the theme was “A New Era  in Cybersecurity Awareness, Training, and Education.”  The theme was chosen to reflect current projects,  trends, and initiatives that provide pathways to future  solutions. Approximately 184 information systems  security professionals and trainers from federal  agencies, academia, and industry attended. Attendees  received an update on NICE activities, gained new  techniques for developing and conducting training, as  well as awareness and training ideas, resources, and  contacts. Presenters represented NIST, the Department  of Homeland Security (DHS), the Defense Intelligence  Agency (DIA), the U.S. Department of State (DOS),  the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of  Defense (DoD), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA),  the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  (NASA), the National Security Agency (NSA), the  Department of Interior, the Bureau of the Public Debt  (BPD), and the Library of Congress. Presenters also  represented private industry and academia. Attendees  had an opportunity to visit 22 vendors on the second  day.  Another bonus of attending the FISSEA conference  is networking.  The conference continues to be a valuable  forum in which individuals from government,  industry, and academia involved with information  systems/cybersecurity workforce development –  awareness, training, education, certification, and  professionalization – may learn of ongoing and planned  training and education programs and initiatives.  At each annual conference, an award is presented to  a candidate selected as FISSEA Educator of the Year;  this award honors distinguished accomplishments  in information systems security training programs.  Susan Hansche, Avaya Government Solutions/U.S.  Department of State was awarded the Educator of  the Year for 2011 at the 2012 FISSEA Conference.  The annual FISSEA Security Awareness, Training and  Education Contest consists of five categories from one  of FISSEA’s three key areas of Awareness, Training, and  Education. The categories are: (1) awareness poster,  (2) motivational item (aka: trinkets - pens, stress  relief items, t-shirts, etc.), (3) awareness website, (4)  awareness newsletter, and (5) role-based training and  education. Winning entries for the security awareness  contest are posted to the FISSEA website. The winners  for the FY2012 contest were:  ��David Kurtz and Bruce Sharp, Bureau of the  Public Debt, U.S. Treasury Department won  the Poster Contest;  ��Maureen Moore, Sara Fitzgerald, Kimberly  Conway, and Mechelle Munn, Food and Drug  Administration, was selected as winners for  their Security Motivation Item as well as for  their Security Newsletter; and  31  ��Shelly Tzoumas, U.S. House of  Representatives, had the winning security  website and was selected as the Role-Based  Training Contest winner.  New in FY 2012 was a poster session which provided  an opportunity to share and tell about their specific  awareness and training programs. During the poster  session, conference attendees voted for their favorite  selection in each category to select the “Peer’s Choice”  award. Attendees selected the same newsletter,  motivational item, and security training winners as the  contest judging committee. However, peers selected  the poster submitted by Terri Cinnamon, Department  of Veterans Affairs, and Alexis Benjamin, Department  of State, as the peer’s choice for website.  The 2013 FISSEA conference is being planned for  March 19-21, 2013, at NIST.  http://csrc.nist.gov/fissea  fisseamembership@nist.gov  Contacts:  Ms. Patricia Toth Ms. Peggy Himes  (301) 975-5140 (301) 975-2489  patricia.toth@nist.gov peggy.himes@nist.gov  Î Information Security and Privacy  Advisory Board (ISPAB)  The Information Security and Privacy Advisory  Board (ISPAB) is a federal advisory committee. It  brings together senior professionals from industry,  government, and academia to advise NIST, the Office  of Management and Budget (OMB), the Secretary of  Commerce, and appropriate committees of the U.S.  Congress about information security and privacy  issues pertaining to unclassified federal government  information systems.  In accordance with 15 U.S.C. 278g-4, the ISPAB is  rechartered by the Secretary of Commerce for 2012- 2013 in pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee  Act, 5 U.S.C. App. The scope and objectives of the  Board are to—  ��Identify emerging managerial, technical,  administrative, and physical safeguard issues  relative to information security and privacy;  ��Advise NIST, the Secretary of Commerce, and  the Director of OMB on information security  and privacy issues pertaining to federal  government information systems, including  thorough review of proposed standards and  guidelines developed by NIST; and  ��Annually submit a report to the Secretary  of Commerce, the Director of OMB, the  Director of the National Security Agency, and  the appropriate committees of the Congress.  The charter (http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/ispab/  documents/ispab_charter-2012-2014.pdf) defines that  the Board’s membership consists of twelve members  and a Chairperson. The Chairperson is appointed by  the Secretary of Commerce, and the Board members  are selected for their preeminence in the information  technology industry or related disciplines. The term of  office for each board member is four years. The ISPAB  Board members are:  ��Daniel Chenok (Chair), IBM Center for The  Business of Government;  ��Julie Boughn, Center for Medicare and  Medicaid Innovation, Department of Human  Health and Services, Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (DHHS/CMS);  ��Christopher Boyer, AT&T;  ��Kevin Fu, University of Massachusetts  Amherst;  ��Gregory Garcia, Garcia Cyber Partners;  ��Brian Gouker, National Security Agency (NSA)  - U.S. Army War College;  ��Toby Levin, (retired);  ��Edward Roback, U.S. Department of the  Treasury;  ��Phyllis Schneck, McAfee, Inc.;  ��Gale Stone, Social Security Administration;  ��Matthew Thomlinson, Microsoft; and  ��Peter Weinberger, Google, Inc.

The  members’ careers cover government, industry, and  academia. Members have worked in the executive and  legislative branches of the federal government, civil  service, senior executive service, the military, some  of the largest corporations worldwide, small  and medium-size businesses, and some of the  top universities in the nation. The members’  experience, likewise, covers a broad spectrum of  activities including many different engineering  disciplines, computer programming, systems analysis,  mathematics, management, information technology  auditing, privacy, and law. Members also have an  extensive history of professional publications and  professional journalism. Members have worked (and  in many cases, continue to work) on the development  and evolution of some of the most important pieces  of information security and privacy legislation in the  federal government, including the Privacy Act of 1974,  the Computer Security Act of 1987, the E-Government  Act (including FISMA), and other e-government services  and initiatives.  In FY2012, the board lost a valuable member, Joseph  Guirreri, who had diligently served the Board for the  past six years. In the same year, F. Lynn McNulty, a board  member (2005-2011) and a significant contributor to  information security in the government, passed away  on June 4th.  The Board usually meets three times per year and  meetings are open to the public. NIST provides the  Board with its Secretariat and meetings are usually  located in Washington, D.C. In June 2012, NIST  requested to host ISPAB at NIST and showcased a range  of research for the Board’s discussion. The Board has  received numerous briefings from federal and private  sector representatives on a wide range of privacy and  security topics in the past year. Areas of interest that  the Board followed in FY2011-FY2012 were:  ��Special Publication (SP) 800-53 Revision 4,  Security and Privacy Controls for Federal  Information Systems and Organizations, and  its appendices;  ��Federal Communications Commission (FCC)  and technology;  33  ��Cyber defense;  ��Prospects for and content of cyber  legislature;  ��Consumer privacy;  ��Security in the next generation mobility;  ��Cloud Computing - data location, data  storage, and data sovereignty;  ��Legislature and security;  ��Derived credentials;  ��Economic incentives for medical device  cybersecurity;  ��Cyber ecosystem and automated cyber  indicator sharing;  ��Key Management;  ��Defense Industrial Base (DIB) pilot and  its potential application to other private  sectors;  ��Progress for modernizing federal desktop  platforms;  ��Trustworthy cyberspace: Strategic Plan for  the Federal Cybersecurity Research and  Development Program; and  ��Federal initiatives such as:  ◦�National Initiative for Cybersecurity  Education (NICE);  ◦�National Strategy for Trusted Identities in  Cyberspace (NSTIC);  ◦�Federal Risk and Authorization Management  Pilot program (FedRAMP);  ◦�United States Computer Emergency  Readiness Team (US-CERT);  ◦�Homeland Security Presidential Directive  (HSPD) 12;  ◦�Draft FIPS 201-2, Personal Identity  Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and  Contractors;  ◦�National Cybersecurity and Communications  Integration Center (NCCIC) and Cyber Storm  - Automated Indicator Sharing;  ◦�Continuous Monitoring;  ◦�IT System Performance and Conformity;  ◦�Federal Guide to Privacy and Security of  Health;  ◦�Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  Security Breach Notification;  ◦�Federal Information Security Management  Act (FISMA); and  ◦�NIST’s outreach, research, and strategies.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/ispab/index.html  Contact:  Ms. Annie Sokol  (301) 975-2006  annie.sokol@nist.gov  Î Small and Medium-Size Business (SMB)  Outreach  What do business  invoices have in  common with email?  If both are done on  the same computer,  the business owner  may want to think more about computer security  information – payroll records, proprietary information,  client or employee data – as essential to a business’s  success. A computer failure or system breach could  cost a business anything from its reputation to damages  and recovery costs. The small business owner who  recognizes the threat of computer crime and takes  steps to deter inappropriate activities is less likely to  become a victim.  The vulnerability of any one small business may  not seem significant to many people, other than the  owner and employees of that business. However,  over 25 million U.S. businesses, comprising more  than 99 percent of all U.S. businesses, are small and  medium-size businesses (SMBs) of 500 employees  or less (http://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/  us11_0.pdf). Therefore, a vulnerability common to a  large percentage of SMBs could pose a threat to the  nation’s information infrastructure and economic  base. SMBs frequently cannot justify the employment  of an extensive security program or a full-time expert.  Nonetheless, they confront serious security challenges.

Such businesses also need to  become more educated in terms of security so that  limited resources are well applied to meet the most  relevant and serious threats. To address this need,  NIST, the Small Business Administration (SBA), and the  Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are cosponsoring  a series of training workshops on computer security for  small businesses. The purpose of the workshops is to  provide an overview of information security threats,  vulnerabilities, and corresponding protective tools  and techniques, with a special emphasis on providing  useful information that small business personnel can  apply directly.  In FY2012, twenty-five SMB outreach workshops were  provided in twenty-four cities: Tulsa, Oklahoma;  Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Lake Charles, Louisiana;  Lafayette, Louisiana; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Slidell,  Louisiana; New Orleans, Louisiana; Denver, Colorado;  Nashua, New Hampshire; New Haven, Connecticut;  Rochester, Minnesota; St Paul, Minnesota; St Cloud,  Minnesota; Austin, Texas; San Antonio, Texas; San Diego,  California; Los Angeles, California; Albuquerque, New  Mexico; Indianapolis, Indiana; Sacramento, California;  Cincinnati, Ohio; Dayton, Ohio; Columbus, Ohio; and  Chillicothe, Ohio.  In collaboration with the SBA and the FBI, planning  is under way to identify locations for small business  information security workshops in FY2013.  http://sbc.nist.gov  Contact:  Mr. Richard Kissel  (301) 975-5017  richard.kissel@nist.gov  Cryptographic Technology  Î Crypto Standards Program  Hash Algorithms and the Secure Hash  Algorithm (SHA-3) Competition  The Cryptographic Technology Group (CTG) is  responsible for the maintenance and development  of the Secure Hash Standard (SHS), FIPS 180. A hash  algorithm processes a message, which can be very  large, and produces a condensed representation of  the message, called a message digest. A cryptographic  hash algorithm is a fundamental component of many  cryptographic functions, such as digital signature  algorithms, key-derivation functions, keyed-hash  message authentication codes (HMAC), or random  number generators. Cryptographic hash algorithms  are frequently used in Internet protocols or in other  security applications.  In 2005, researchers developed an attack method  that threatened the security of the Secure Hash  Algorithm-1 (SHA-1), a NIST-approved hash algorithm.  Researchers at NIST and elsewhere also discovered  several generic limitations in the basic Merkle- Damgard construct that is used in SHA-1 and most  other existing hash algorithms. To address these  vulnerabilities, NIST opened a public competition in  November 2007 to develop a new cryptographic hash  algorithm, which would be called “SHA-3,” and would  augment the Secure Hash Standard by adding the new  hash algorithm.  NIST received sixty-four entries from cryptographers  around the world by October 31, 2008, and selected  fifty-one first-round candidates in December 2008;  fourteen second-round candidates in July 2009; and  five third-round candidates – BLAKE, Grøstl, JH, Keccak  and Skein, on December 9, 2010, to enter the third  and final round of the competition. Status reports for  the first and second rounds were published as NISTIR  7620, Status Report on the First Round of the SHA- 3 Cryptographic Hash Algorithm Competition, and  NISTIR 7764, Status Report on the Second Round of  the SHA-3 Cryptographic Hash Algorithm Competition,  respectively.  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips180-4/fips-180-4.pdf http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips198-1/FIPS-198-1_final.pdf http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips198-1/FIPS-198-1_final.pdf http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/documents/FR_Notice_Nov07.pdf http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/documents/FR_Notice_Nov07.pdf http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/sha-3/Round1/documents/sha3_NISTIR7620.pdf http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/sha-3/Round1/documents/sha3_NISTIR7620.pdf http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/sha-3/Round2/documents/Round2_Report_NISTIR_7764.pdf  35  Submitters of the SHA-3 finalists were allowed to make  minor adjustments to their algorithms by January 16,  2011, and the third round of the competition began  on January 31, 2011, when the final submissions  were posted on NIST’s hash website. A one-year public  review period was provided before NIST hosted the  (last) Third SHA-3 Candidate Conference (URL:  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/sha-3/Round3/  March2012/) in Washington, D.C. on March 22-23,  2012, to receive public feedback on the finalists.  The cryptographic community provided an  enormous amount of expert feedback throughout the  competition. Most of the comments were sent to NIST  and a public hash forum; in addition, many of the  cryptanalysis and performance studies were published  as papers in major cryptographic conferences or  leading cryptographic journals. Based on the public  comments and internal review of the candidates,  NIST announced KECCAK as the SHA-3 winner on October  2, 2012, thus ending the five-year-long competition.  KECCAK was selected because of its large security  margin, good general performance, excellent  efficiency in hardware implementations, flexible  design, and because its design and implementation  properties complement the existing SHA-2 family of  hash algorithms well. The evaluation of the finalists  and the selection process was summarized in a third- round report, which was published as NISTIR 7896 in  early FY2013.  NIST plans to augment the current hash standard,  FIPS 180-4, to include the new SHA-3 algorithm, and  publish a draft FIPS 180-5 for public review. After the  close of the public comment period, NIST will revise  the draft standard, as appropriate, in response to the  public comments that NIST receives. A final review,  approval, and promulgation process will then follow.  http://www.nist.gov/hash-competition  Contact:  Ms. Shu-jen Chang  (301) 975-2940  shu-jen.chang@nist.gov  Hash Algorithm Standards and  Security Guidelines  FIPS 180 is the SHA standard. This standard has had  several revisions. FIPS 180-3 was approved in October  2008 and contained five hash algorithms: SHA-1, SHA- 224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512.  In March 2012, another revision of FIPS 180 was  approved: FIPS 180-4. This revision provides a general  procedure for creating an initialization hash value,  adds two additional secure hash algorithms  (SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256) to the SHA standard,  and removes a restriction that padding must be done  before hash computation begins, which was required  in FIPS 180-3. SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256 are  more efficient alternatives to SHA-224 and SHA-256  on platforms that are optimized for 64-bit operations.  Removing the restriction on the padding operation  in the secure hash algorithms potentially allowed  more flexibility and efficiency in implementing the  secure hash algorithms in many computer network  applications.  General guidelines for using hash functions are  provided in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-107,  Revision 1, Recommendation for Applications Using  Approved Hash Algorithms. This document provides  security guidelines for achieving the desired security  strengths for cryptographic applications that employ  the approved cryptographic hash functions specified in  FIPS 180. SP 800-107 has been revised to address the  security properties of SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256,  the new hash algorithms approved in FIPS 180-4.  Additional security information about Hash Message  Authentication Code (HMAC) has been provided, and  the hash-based key-derivation function section has  been revised to provide updated information about  approved hash-based key-derivation functions that are  specified in many other NIST Special Publications.  A draft of the SP 800-107 revision was issued  for public comment in September 2011 and was  extensively revised to address the received comments  and to include discussions of the security of HMAC  and randomized hashing for digital signatures. The  discussions on hash-based key-derivation functions  were revised to incorporate the “extraction-then-  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  http://www.nist.gov/hash-competition http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/sha-3/Round3/March2012/ http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/sha-3/Round3/March2012/ http://www.nist.gov/hash-competition mailto:shu-jen.chang@nist.gov  36  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  expansion” key-derivation procedure specified in  SP 800-56C, Recommendation for Key Derivation  through Extraction-then-Expansion, and to discuss  different approved hash-based key derivation  functions.

For  example, random numbers are used to generate the  keys needed for encryption and digital signature  applications.  In the late 1990s, a project to develop more rigorous  requirements and specifications for random number  generation (RNG) was initiated in coordination with  the American National Standards Institute’s (ANSI)  Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X9. The  resulting standard (X9.82) is being developed in four  parts: Part 1 provides general information; Part 2  will provide requirements for entropy sources; Part 3  provides specifications for deterministic random bit  generator (DRBG) mechanisms; and Part 4 provides  guidance on constructing random bit generators  (RBGs) from entropy sources and DRBG mechanisms.  Parts 1, 3 and 4 have been completed; Part 2 is nearing  completion.  In March 2007, NIST published SP 800-90,  Recommendation for Random Number Generation  Using Deterministic Random Bit Generators,  which contained the DRBG mechanisms in Part 3  of ANS X9.82, plus an additional DRBG mechanism.  This Recommendation was revised as SP 800-90A,  Recommendation for Random Number Generation  Using Deterministic Random Bit Generators, in  January 2012 to include additional capabilities  identified during the development of Part 4 of ANS  X9.82. The document number for SP 800-90 was  modified so that two additional documents (i.e., SP  800-90B, Recommendation for the Entropy Sources  Used for Random Bit Generation and SP 800-90C,  Recommendation for Random Bit Generator (RBG)  Constructions) could be included in a series on  random number generation. SP 800-90A is available at  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.  SP 800-90B will address the development and  testing of entropy sources, including descriptions  of the validation tests that will be used by NIST’s  Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program to  validate candidate entropy sources. SP 800-90C will  provide basic guidance on the construction of RBGs  from entropy sources and DRBG mechanisms, pointing  to Part 4 of ANS X9.82 for additional constructions and  examples. Both documents have been provided for  public comment at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/  PubsDrafts.html.  NIST’s standards activities in FY2013 will include a  workshop to discuss the drafts of SP 800-90B and C,  and adjudication of the comments received during the  public-comment period and the workshop.

This document, which was  first published in 2006, is being revised to provide  further clarification and additional methods for key  derivation; this revision has been made available for  public comment at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/  PubsDrafts.html and will be completed in FY2013.  A newly approved method for key derivation in  SP 800-56A is specified in SP 800-56C, Recommendation  for Key Derivation through Extraction-then-Expansion,  which was completed in November 2011. SP 800-56C  specifies a two-step key-derivation procedure that  extracts randomness from a shared secret produced  during a key-agreement computation and expands the  result into the required keying material. The procedure  in SP 800-56C is one of the new key-derivation methods  referenced in the revision of SP 800-56A.  Another related publication, SP 800-135,  Recommendation for Existing Application-Specific Key  Derivation Functions, was completed in December  2010 and revised in December 2011; this document  approves existing application-specific key-derivation  functions used in commonly deployed protocols. These  key-derivation functions are among the new key- derivation methods referenced in the revision of SP  800-56A.  Part 1 of SP 800-57, Recommendation for Key  Management: Part 1: General, provides general  key-management guidance. This document was first  published in 2005, and later revised in 2007. This  document has been updated to include information on  and references to recent work performed by the CTG;  the revision was completed in July 2012.  Part 3 of SP 800-57, Recommendation for Key  Management, Part 3 Application-Specific Key  Management Guidance, was first published in  2009; this document provides application-specific  key management guidance and is being revised to  reflect recent work on the applications and protocols  discussed in the document. The revision will also  include an additional section on the Secure Shell (SSH)  protocol. In FY2013, the revision of this document will  be provided for public comment.  SP 800-130, A Framework for Designing Cryptographic  Key Management Systems, is being developed to  provide guidance on the framework of a Cryptographic  Key Management System (CKMS). The first draft of this  document was provided for public comment in 2010  and was discussed in a subsequent workshop at NIST  in late FY2010. A revised draft of this document that  addressed the comments received during the public  comment period and during the workshop was provided  for a second public-comment period in April 2012 and  discussed at a public key management workshop in  September 2012. This document will be completed by  mid FY2013.  SP 800-152, A Profile for U.S. Federal Cryptographic  Key Management Systems (CKMS), is under  development. This document is intended to provide  refinements of the framework requirements in SP 800- 130 that are appropriate for use in a CKMS used by  the federal government, plus guidance on  implementing, procuring, installing, configuring,  and operating a Federal CKMS. A table of proposed  requirements to be included in SP 800-152 was provided  for public comment in August 2012 and discussed at  a key management workshop in September 2012. SP  800-152 will continue to be developed during FY2013,  including refining the requirements provided for public  comment.  SP 800-133, Recommendation for Cryptographic  Key Generation, which discusses the generation of  the keys to be managed and used by NIST’s approved  cryptographic algorithms, was issued for public  comment in August 2011. It addresses the generation  of a key using the output of a random bit generator, the  derivation of a key from another key, the derivation of  a key from a password, and keys generated during the  use of a key-agreement scheme. This document was  completed in November 2012.  A new publication is under development that is  intended to provide guidance on the security strength  of a cryptographic key that is used to protect data  (i.e., a data-protection key), given the manner in  which the key was generated and handled prior to  its use to protect the target data.

A digital  signature is represented in a computer as a string of  bits and is computed using a set of rules and a set  of parameters that allow the identity of the signatory  and the integrity of the data to be verified.  FIPS 186, first published in 1994, has been revised  several times since then, and in April 2012, a list of  changes to the current version of the standard, FIPS  186-3, was provided for public comment. The proposed  changes included a reduction of restrictions on the  use of random number generators and the retention  and use of prime number generation seeds, and  further aligns the FIPS with Public Key Cryptography  Standard (PKCS) #1. The comments received have  been incorporated into the draft of a new version of  the standard, which will be proposed to the Secretary  of Commerce for adoption as FIPS 186-4 in FY2013.

A  block cipher transforms data of a fixed length, called  the block size, into seemingly random data of the  same length. There are many cryptographic methods  that feature block ciphers to achieve an information  service, such as confidentiality or authentication. Such  a method is called a block cipher mode of operation,  or, simply, a mode.  NIST has formally approved modes in the area of “key  wrapping”, i.e., the protection of the confidentiality  and integrity of cryptographic keys. NIST Special  Publication (SP) 800-38F, Recommendation for Block  Cipher Modes of Operation: Methods for Key Wrapping,  describes existing methods that are approved for  key wrapping, and also specifies three deterministic  authenticated-encryption modes: the AES Key Wrap  (KW) mode, the AES Key Wrap with Padding (KWP)  mode, and one TDEA mode, called TKW.  NIST is also developing a set of modes in the area  of “format preserving encryption” (FPE). A format is  a sequence of decimal digits, such as a credit card  number or a social security number; formats can also  be defined for other sets of characters besides decimal  digits. FPE is expected to be very useful because, in  order to retrofit encryption to existing applications, it  is sometimes necessary for the encrypted data to have  the same format as the original data.  NIST intends to approve three schemes of the  FFX framework for FPE that were submitted for  consideration in recent years: FFX-base, VAES3, and  BPS. (The submission documents are available at  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/BCM/modes_  development.html). A draft SP to specify and approve  these methods is expected to be ready for public  comment in early 2013.

An early breakthrough in this area was  Shor’s algorithm, which demonstrated that quantum  computers could efficiently factor integers and  compute discrete logarithms. These two problems play  an essential role in cryptography: they are believed to  be hard for classical computers, and they are the basis  for nearly all of the public-key cryptosystems that  are in widespread use today. If large-scale quantum  computers are ever built, they will be able to break  the existing public-key infrastructure.  The threat posed by quantum computers appears to  be serious, but not immediate. While there has been  dramatic progress in experimental quantum physics,  the construction of large-scale quantum computers still  seems to be many years away. Moreover, the discovery  of Shor’s algorithm has also motivated researchers  to propose so-called “post-quantum” cryptosystems  – public-key cryptosystems that would be secure  against quantum computers. It is hoped that these  cryptosystems will allow us to maintain the public-key  infrastructure in a world with quantum computers.  For these reasons, NIST has started a project on post- quantum cryptography, with a view to possible future  standards.  The primary focus of this project is to identify  candidate quantum-resistant systems, based on  algebraic codes, lattices, multivariate systems of  equations, cryptographic hash functions, or any other  construct that may be secure against both quantum  and classical computers, as well as the impact that  such post-quantum algorithms will have on current  protocols and security infrastructures. The project  endeavors to establish the viability of algorithms  in these areas, the security of which have yet to  be explained well even in the classical model, and  further, to verify the claims of quantum-resistance as  quantum complexity theory matures. In the event that  no candidate algorithm survives this examination, NIST  intends to establish computer security architectures  that are not dependent upon the classical public-key  cryptographic algorithms, such as the Rivest-Shamir- Adleman (RSA) algorithm or the Elliptic Curve Digital  Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) algorithm.  In FY2012, NIST researchers Stephen Jordan, Yi-Kai  Liu, Ray Perlner, and Daniel Smith-Tone internally  presented preliminary status reports in the areas of  quantum computation, coding-based cryptography,  lattice-based cryptography, and multivariate  cryptography, which included detailed surveys of  the respective fields, as well as security overviews  and specific results. These reports were further  supplemented with a presentation from William Whyte  and John Schanck from NTRU Cryptosystems on April  25, 2012, discussing the specific countermeasures  being deployed in the wake of a serious attack  on NTRUSign. NIST also engaged the international  cryptographic community with presentations and  publications by NIST researchers. At the very end  of FY2011, on September 23, 2011, Stephen Jordan  presented “Complexity Implications of Quantum Field  Theory,” at the Schloss Dagstuhl Workshop on Quantum  Cryptanalysis, discussing evidence that more modern  quantum field theories may not give rise to greater  computational power than the standard quantum  circuit model. In the first quarter of FY2012, Daniel  Smith-Tone published the paper, “On the Differential  Security of Multivariate Cryptosystems,” at the  Fourth International Conference on Post-Quantum  Cryptography, suggesting a new security metric for  multivariate cryptography.  Daniel Smith-Tone also  published, “The TriTon Transformation,” discussing  risky design philosophies in multivariate cryptography  at the Third Workshop on Mathematical Cryptology on  July 9, 2012. On September 28, 2012, at the Quantum  Information Science workshop at the NIST-University  of Maryland (UMD) Joint Quantum Institute, Yi-Kai Liu  gave a talk on “Applications of Quantum Information in  Machine Learning and Cryptography,” which discussed  the role played by quantum information in security  proofs for lattice-based cryptosystems.  In FY2013, NIST will continue to explore the security  capacity of purported quantum-resistant technologies  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  40  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  with the ultimate goal of uncovering the fundamental  mechanisms necessary for efficient, trustworthy, and  cost-effective information assurance in the post- quantum market. Upon the successful completion of  this phase of the project, NIST will be prepared for  possible standardization.

The Beacon  could be used in many applications that require a  secure random value (e.g., for privacy-enhanced  cryptography, multiparty contract bidding, and  tamper-proof voting), but is not intended for  generating values that must remain secret, such as  cryptographic keys. The Beacon will be designed  to provide unpredictability, autonomy, and  consistency. Unpredictability means that users cannot  algorithmically predict bits before they are made  available by the source. Autonomy means that the  source is resistant to attempts by outside parties to  alter the distribution of the random bits. Consistency  means that a set of users can access the source in such  a way that they are confident that they all receive the  same random string.  Strings of bits produced by the Beacon will be posted  in blocks of 512 bits every few seconds, with the  number of seconds being an adjustable parameter  that can vary from one second to a few minutes. Each  such value will be provided as an output packet that is  sequence-numbered, time-stamped, and signed, and  includes the hash of the previous value, in order to  chain the sequence of values together and prevent  an undetected change of an output package, even by  the source. Each packet will be stored for subsequent  online access.  In pursuit of this goal, a prototype implementation  of a public source of randomness is being developed  that is conformant to SP 800-90A, Recommendation  for Random Number Generation Using Deterministic  Random Bit Generators. The Beacon’s engine uses  multiple sources of entropy and leverages recently  developed tests to validate an entropy source.  During FY2012, NIST continued working on  implementing and enhancing the NIST Secure  Randomness Beacon. CSD also initiated collaboration  with NIST’s Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML)  to enhance the input source of entropy for the NIST  Randomness Beacon by integrating at least one  quantum source, also referred to as a “truly random  number.” The joint project, Quantum Randomness  as a Secure Resource, received ITL’s Innovations in  Measurement Science (IMS) award.  The ITL and PML collaborative work toward the  integration of at least one quantum-secure source of  entropy for the NIST Randomness Beacon will continue  in FY2013. A quantum source will be a sequence of  truly random numbers that is guaranteed by the laws of  physics to be unknowable in advance of its generation,  and uncorrelated with anything in the universe. With  such a quantum source, the NIST Randomness Beacon  can be used for a variety of security and privacy  applications that could lead to unprecedented levels of  network security for confidential digital applications,  thus setting the foundation for a trusted common  standard.  http://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/ct/nist_beacon.cfm  http://www.nist.gov/pml/div684/random_numbers_  bell_test.cfm  Contacts:  Dr. Michaela Iorga Dr. Rene Peralta  (301) 975-8431 (301) 975-8702  michaela.iorga@nist.gov rene.peralta@nist.gov  mailto:ray.perlner@nist.gov mailto:dustin.moody@nist.gov http://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/ct/nist_beacon.cfm http://www.nist.gov/pml/div684/random_numbers_bell_test.cfm http://www.nist.gov/pml/div684/random_numbers_bell_test.cfm mailto:michaela.iorga@nist.gov mailto:rene.peralta@nist.gov  41  Pairing-Based Cryptography  Recently, what are known as “pairings” on elliptic  curves have been a very active area of research  in cryptography. A pairing is a function that maps a  pair of points on an elliptic curve into a finite field.  Their unique properties have enabled many new  cryptographic protocols that had not previously been  feasible.  In particular, identity-based encryption (IBE) is a  pairing-based scheme that has received considerable  attention. IBE uses some form of a person (or entity’s)  identification to generate a public key. This could be  an email address, for instance. An IBE scheme allows  a sender to encrypt a message without needing a  receiver’s public key to have been certified and  distributed for subsequent use. Such a scenario is  quite useful if the pre-distribution of public keys is  impractical. Besides IBE, there are a number of other  applications of pairing-based cryptography. These  include many other identity-based cryptosystems  (including signature schemes), key establishment  schemes, functional and attribute-based encryption,  and privacy-enhancing techniques, such as the use of  anonymous credentials.  In 2008, NIST held a workshop on pairing-based  cryptography. While the workshop showed that there  was interest in pairing-based schemes, a common  understanding was that further study was needed  before NIST approved any such schemes. Starting in  2011, members of the Cryptography Technology Group  (CTG) have conducted an extensive study on pairing- based cryptographic schemes. This included topics such  as: the construction of pairing-friendly elliptic curves,  a survey of pairing-based cryptographic schemes,  implementation efficiency with respect to the required  security, standard activities involving pairing-based  schemes, use cases, and practical implications. This  work was summarized in a technical report, presented  in the first quarter of 2012. Throughout 2012, project  members have been identifying use cases for pairing- based cryptography. At the NIST Cryptography for  Emerging Technologies and Applications (CETA)  Workshop in November 2011, there was a public call  for feedback on potential use cases.  Pairing operations appear to be important tools  for various cryptographic schemes used in cloud  computing and privacy-enhancing environments.  Besides IBE, other demanding applications have  also motivated the continuation of this study. Short  signatures and broadcast encryption are examples of  such applications.

There are many ways CSD can develop and standardize  new methods to use cryptography that enhance  privacy. For example, public-key certificates used  for authentication often reveal more personally  identifiable information about the certificate holder  than is required for a given application.  What is often at issue in accessing data or resources  is not the identity of the customer, but whether the  customer is a member of an eligible group. Methods  that allow a user to selectively reveal and prove only  a specific property (such as that the user is at least  21 years old, has a particular place of residence, or  citizenship) are approaching commercial practicality.  Other techniques, such as those that will eventually  allow us to search encrypted databases, are still in  the research stage. However, these techniques are  sufficiently advanced that it behooves us to take  stock of the state of the art at this point. Still other  techniques, such as those that allow us to hold sealed- bid auctions without ever opening the bids, are known  to be practical, yet have received little attention by  those that might benefit from them. Such applications  fall within the scope of what are known as secure  multiparty computations.  In FY2012, NIST held a workshop on Privacy-Enhancing  Cryptographic Techniques to explore processes,  procedures, and potential applications that could  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  mailto:dustin.moody@nist.gov  42  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  benefit from the ability to operate on encrypted  data without decrypting it (see http://www.nist.  gov/itl/csd/ct/pec-workshop.cfm). Participants at  the workshop included scientists, privacy advocates,  and policy experts. Having planted the seeds for  cooperation among these different groups, CSD will  continue to pursue this objective in FY2013.  Another major activity for this project was in support  of the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in  Cyberspace (NSTIC) (see http://www.nist.gov/nstic).  Different cryptographic techniques that may be  important for this initiative are being continuously  evaluated.  Contact:  Dr. Rene Peralta  (301) 975-8702  peralta@nist.gov  Cryptography for Constrained Environments  Pervasive computing is the emerging area in which  many highly constrained devices are interconnected,  typically communicating wirelessly with one another,  and working in concert to accomplish some task. These  systems can be found in a wide variety of fields. Sample  application areas include: sensor networks, medical  devices, distributed control systems, and the Smart  Grid. Security can be very important in all of these  areas. For example, an unauthorized party should not  be able to take control of an insulin pump or the brakes  on a car. There are also privacy concerns, particularly  in the area of Health IT.  Because the majority of the current cryptographic  algorithms were designed for desktop/server  environments, many of these algorithms do not fit  into the constrained resources currently available.  If current algorithms can be made to fit into the  limited resources of constrained environments, their  performance is typically not acceptable. A particular  problem is the use of asymmetric (public key)  algorithms. These algorithms tend to be much more  computational and resource-intensive than can be easily  accommodated in such constrained environments.  As a result, NIST is currently focusing on studying the  NIST-approved symmetric algorithms in constrained  environments. Symmetric algorithms can be used  to perform encryption for confidentiality, as well as  to generate message authentication codes (MAC)  for message authentication. NIST has implemented  the current 256-bit version of the Secure Hash  Algorithm (SHA-256) to provide a Hash-based Message  Authentication Code (HMAC) for authentication.  Additionally, NIST has implemented the Advanced  Encryption Standard (AES) to provide confidentiality, as  well as the cipher-based message authentication code  (CMAC) mode for authentication. An outline of these  plans was provided at the Workshop on Cryptography  for Emerging Technologies and Applications hosted by  NIST in November 2011.  During the next year, NIST will investigate algorithms  other than those currently in its Cryptographic  Toolbox to find algorithms that are optimized for  operating in constrained environments. NIST will  analyze the resource requirements and performance  characteristics of these algorithms, and utilize these  block ciphers as building blocks to perform other  cryptographic functions beyond encryption.  Contact:  Mr. Lawrence Bassham  (301) 975-3292  lbassham@nist.gov  New Research Areas in Cryptographic  Techniques for Emerging Applications  In FY2012, NIST explored a few new research areas  in cryptographic techniques for emerging applications.  In particular, the research focused on stream ciphers,  secure group communications, group signatures, and  circuit complexity.  (1)  Stream Ciphers  Currently, the use of AES in the Output  Feedback Mode (OFB) mode and the counter  (CTR) mode are approved by NIST as block  cipher-based stream ciphers. However,  classical stream ciphers have performance  advantages for software implementations that  satisfy high-throughput requirements, or for  hardware implementations with constrained  http://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/ct/pec-workshop.cfm http://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/ct/pec-workshop.cfm mailto:lbassham@nist.gov mailto:peralta@nist.gov http://www.nist.gov/nstic  43  resources. The security and performance of  some of the well-understood stream ciphers  will be studied during FY2013, with a focus  on stream ciphers designed for constrained  environments.  (2)  Secure Group Communications  Secure group communications has been shown  to be important in public-safety networks,  smart grids, and sensor networks. The existing  schemes proposed in the research literature,  such as multicast encryption schemes and  group key-distribution schemes, have been  considered as general solutions, but are  less scalable for practical applications. In  FY2012, CSD looked into existing results and  explored different application scenarios.  The requirements and the restrictions were  also discussed. In FY2013, NIST will pursue  well-tailored solutions for secure group  communications.  (3)  Group Signatures  Group signatures have been investigated for  more than two decades. In general, a group  signature scheme allows a group member  to generate a signature on behalf of the  group without revealing information about  the specific signer. Numerous schemes  have been proposed and analyzed in the  research literature. Such an anonymity  feature is useful for security applications  in cloud computing. In FY2013, NIST will  further explore the features and underlying  mathematical structures for the existing  schemes.  (4)  Circuit Complexity  Any function can be described as a circuit  with operations modulo 2. If the circuit  contains only additions, then the function is  linear. Nonlinearity, which is fundamental to  cryptographic applications, can be achieved  only by the use of multiplications. The  standard description of the AES S-Box, which  is the nonlinearity component for AES, is that  it does inversion in the field of 256 elements.  The field’s standard measure of nonlinearity  of a function F is the Hamming distance of the  spectrum of F to the closest linear spectrum.  A different measure of nonlinearity is simply  the number of multiplications necessary  and sufficient to compute the function. This  measure is called “multiplicative complexity.”  CSD’s research in Boolean circuit optimization  has yielded circuits with optimal or near- optimal multiplicative complexity for a large  class of functions. The resulting circuits have  large linear components. CSD developed  new  heuristics for reducing the number of  gates in these components. The net result  is a significant reduction in the size and/or  depth of many circuits used in cryptography.  These include a circuit of depth 16 and size  128 for the AES S-Box, as well as reduced size/  depth circuits for high-speed cryptography in  characteristic 2. Additionally, circuits with a  small number of multiplications can be used  to significantly improve the communication  complexity of secure multiparty computations,  as well as the size of non-interactive  zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge.

The purpose of the workshop was to identify the  cryptographic requirements for emerging technologies  and applications.  The workshop provided an opportunity for the  government, industry, research and academic  communities to identify cryptographic challenges  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  mailto:rene.peralta@nist.gov mailto:james.nechvatal@nist.gov mailto:dustin.moody@nist.gov mailto:llchen@nist.gov mailto:meltem.turan@nist.gov  44  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  encountered in their development of emerging  technologies and applications, and to learn about  NIST’s current cryptographic research activities,  programs, and standards development.  In preparation for the workshop, NIST called  for the submission of abstracts that highlight the  cryptographic challenges identified during the  research and development of emerging technologies  and applications. Examples of emerging or evolving  technology spaces include: sensor and building  networks, mobile devices, smart objects/Internet of  things, and cyber physical systems (CPSs). Examples  of cryptographic requirements for emerging sectors  include performance or resource issues, cryptographic  services (such as anonymous or group signatures), or  key management challenges. Abstract submitters were  also encouraged to identify, through their submissions,  other areas of cryptography for emerging technologies  and applications.  NIST received twenty-eight abstracts. Out of these  abstracts, eleven were selected for presentation during  the workshop. In addition to these presentations, the  workshop included two keynote talks, an invited talk,  and six presentations by NIST. An open floor discussion  concluded the workshop. The workshop agenda and its  slide presentations are available at http://www.nist.  gov/itl/csd/ct/ceta-2011-agenda.cfm.

The  standard must be used in designing and implementing  cryptographic modules that federal departments and  agencies operate or are operated for them under  contract.  The current version of the standard is FIPS 140- 2. A proposed revision, FIPS 140-3, will supersede  FIPS 140-2, and is under development as a result of  the reexamination and reaffirmation of FIPS 140-2.  The draft revision of the standard adds new security  requirements that are imposed on cryptographic  modules to reflect the latest advances in technology and  security, and to mirror other new or updated standards  published by NIST in the areas of cryptography and  key management. Additionally, software and firmware  requirements are addressed in a new area dedicated  to software and firmware security, while another new  area specifying requirements to protect against non- invasive attacks is also provided.  Draft FIPS 140-3 provides four increasing qualitative  levels of security that are intended to cover a wide  range of potential applications and environments.  The security requirements cover areas related to the  secure design and implementation of a cryptographic  module. These areas include cryptographic module  specification; cryptographic module physical ports  and logical interfaces; roles, authentication, and  services; software security; operational environment;  physical security; physical security – non-invasive  attacks; sensitive security parameter management;  self-tests; life-cycle assurance; and mitigation of  other attacks. The standard provides users with a  specification of security features that are required  at each of four security levels, flexibility in choosing  security requirements, a guide to ensuring that the  cryptographic modules incorporate necessary security  features, and the assurance that the modules are  compliant with cryptography-based standards.  http://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/ct/ceta-2011-agenda.cfm http://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/ct/ceta-2011-agenda.cfm mailto:michaela.iorga@nist.gov mailto:ebarker@nist.gov  45  During FY2011, the majority of the resolutions to the  public comments received on the second draft were  incorporated in the draft FIPS and provided to NIST  and CSE Canada for a final internal technical review.  In response to comments received on the second  draft, the following possible changes or additions  to the previous draft document were proposed: a  description of the assumed thread models for each  security level; an insertion of missing definitions for  terms and acronyms; changes to the Trusted Channel  requirements; the removal of the Trusted Role;  the inclusion of an identity-based authentication  mechanism that would be allowed at Security Level (SL)  2; the addition of a self-initiated cryptographic output  capability and remote control capability; the inclusion  of additional integrity-technique requirements for the  software components of a cryptographic module; a  restructure of the annexes and enhancement of the  requirements for the allowed operator-authentication  mechanisms; an update of the list of the non-invasive  attacks methods for the security functions; and an  update of the requirements for the allowed modifiable  operating environments.  During the process of addressing the public comments  received on the second draft, NIST determined that  additional feedback would be required from the  public to resolve gaps and inconsistencies between  the comments received for particular sections of the  second draft of FIPS 140-3. As a result, NIST requested  additional public comments in August 2012 on several  clearly identified sections. More details about the  project and a timetable can be found at: http://csrc.  nist.gov/groups/ST/FIPS140_3/.  During FY2013, all received comments on the  identified issues will be addressed and the final FIPS  140-3 document will be prepared for a final internal  review and approval by the Secretary of Commerce.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/FIPS140_3/  Contact:  Dr. Michaela Iorga  (301) 975-8431  michaela.iorga@nist.gov  Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Test Cards  Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)  201, Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal  Employees and Contractors, was published in February  2005 to satisfy policy directives specified in Homeland  Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12). The  majority of federal workers now have Personal Identity  Verification (PIV) cards; however, the PIV card has not  yet been embraced as a mechanism for logical access  to IT resources. The unavailability of test PIV cards has  been identified as an impediment to deployment for  this purpose.  To facilitate the development of applications and  middleware that support the PIV card, CSD developed  a reference set of smart cards. Each set includes  sixteen cards: nine valid cards and seven cards that  contain invalid data. The valid cards differ in terms  of the cryptographic algorithms used to sign the data  objects, the types and sizes of the cardholder’s key  pairs, and in the presence or absence of optional  data objects. The invalid cards include cards that are  expired, cards that have certificates that have been  revoked, and cards with data objects that have invalid  signatures.  This set of test cards includes not only examples  that are similar to cards that are currently issued  today, but also examples of cards with features that  are expected to appear in cards that will be issued  in the future. For example, while the certificates and  data objects on most, if not all, cards issued today are  signed using RSA PKCS #1 v1.5, the set of test cards  includes examples of certificates and data objects  that are signed using each of the algorithms and key  sizes approved for use with PIV cards, including the  RSA Probabilistic Signature Scheme (RSASSA-PSS)  and the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm  (ECDSA). Similarly, the infrastructure supporting  the test cards provides examples of Certificate  Revocation Lists (CRLs) and Online Certificate Status  Protocol (OCSP) responses that are signed using  each of these signature algorithms. The set of test  cards also includes certificates with elliptic curve  cryptography (ECC) subject public keys, in addition to  RSA subject public keys, as is permitted by Table 3-1 of  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/FIPS140_3/ http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/FIPS140_3/ mailto:michaela.iorga@nist.gov http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/FIPS140_3  46  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  Lorie, this image was used in last year’s annual report.  Guess you can use the same image as used last year.  Thanks.  Pat  SP 800-78-3, Interfaces for Personal Identity  Verification. The set of test cards, collectively, also  includes all of the mandatory and optional data  objects listed in Section 3 of SP 800-73-3 Part 1,  except for Cardholder Iris Images. Several of the cards  include a Key History object, along with retired key  management keys. The certificates that appear on  the test cards, both the cardholders’ certificates and  the content signers’ certificates, were issued from a  simple two-level hierarchy.  The initial work of developing the test cards was  performed during FY2011. In early FY2012, CSD created  a few sets of test cards,  which were distributed  to organizations that had  previously volunteered  to serve as beta testers.  During the beta-testing  period, the test cards were  used in a few different  environments, and it was  determined that no changes  needed to be made to the  specifications for the cards.  In late FY2012, NIST began  the production of the final sets of test cards, and the  cards are now available as NIST Special Database 33  (http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/testcards.html).

The OMB policy memorandum defines four levels of  authentication in terms of assurance about the validity  of an asserted identity. SP 800-63-1 gives technical  requirements and examples of authentication  technologies that meet the requirements by making  individuals demonstrate possession and control of  a secret for each of the four levels. In FY2013, NIST  plans to develop a minor revision to the SP 800-63-1  identity-proofing requirements to better accommodate  medical professionals.  In the course of developing the revision to the  Electronic Authentication Guideline, NIST researchers  have come across gaps that prevent large-scale  adoption of secure authentication online. Two such  areas are revocation in complex federated  environments and biometric authentication in  unattended scenarios.  With regard to revocation, a large number of Identity  Management Systems (IDMSs) are being deployed  worldwide that use different technologies for the  population of their users. With the diverse set of  technologies, and the unique business requirements  for organizations to federate, there is no uniform  approach to the federation process. Similarly, there  is no uniform method to revoke credentials or their  associated attribute(s) in a federated community. In  the absence of a uniform revocation method, NIST  researchers have been exploring and developing a  model for revocation of credentials and attributes in  a federated environment, with a particular focus on  identifying missing requirements.  To address the use of biometrics in authentication  for transactions online, NIST is considering high- level requirements for the use of biometrics in a  multi-factor authentication framework, such as  liveness detection (sometimes called biometric  spoof detection), biometric template protection (for  revoking and renewing biometric credentials), and  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/testcards.html mailto:william.polk@nist.gov mailto:david.cooper@nist.gov http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/testcards.html  47  web services standards for securely and uniformly  handling biometric data online. NIST is leading multi- year projects and collaborating with the international  research and standards communities in all three of  these areas.  With respect to liveness detection, NIST is leading the  development of the first standards activity on liveness  detection and held a workshop to discuss a framework  for measurement, interchangeable data, and testing  in March 2012. On the topic of biometric template  protection, a paper on “Criteria Towards Metrics for  Benchmarking Template Protection Algorithms” was  published at this year’s International Conference  on Biometrics, the result of a grant from NIST and  collaboration with researchers in CSD. This work was  followed up with a workshop in July 2012, co-hosted  with Fraunhofer and the Biometrics Institute, at the  Association Française de Normalisation (AFNOR) (co- located with a biometric standards meeting). Finally,  NIST’s continued efforts in the area of biometric web  services have yielded NIST SP 500-288, Specification for  WS-Biometric Devices, and a reference implementation  of the Specification for Web Service Biometric Device  (WS-BD) in both Java and .NET.

In such a heterogeneous network,  a mobile device may switch its connection to the  network between different wireless technologies.  Inter-technology handover has brought many  challenges to existing security solutions, such as  the delays caused by access authentication for each  handover. New trust models for key management are  also required. NIST has conducted intensive research  in the security for media-independent handover and  has actively participated in the IEEE 802 wireless  standard activities. In FY2012, the mechanisms to  provide services for proactive authentications and  key distributions for inter-technology handover have  been standardized in Amendment 2 for the IEEE  802.21 Media Independent Handover Services. The  mechanisms will enable secure media-independent  handover in heterogeneous networks.  In FY2013, NIST will continue to conduct research on  the security mechanisms for next-generation wireless  networks and pursue security solutions for group  management through participation in the standards  activities of the IEEE 802.21d task group.

Through these  programs, NIST works with private and governmental  sectors and the cryptographic community to achieve  security, interoperability, and assurance of correct  implementation. The goal of these programs is to  promote the use of validated algorithms, modules, and  products and to provide federal agencies with a security  metric to use in procuring cryptographic modules.  The testing carried out by independent third-party  laboratories accredited by the NIST National Voluntary  Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) and the  validations performed by the CMVP and CAVP programs  provide this metric. Federal agencies, industry, and  the public can choose cryptographic modules and/or  products containing cryptographic modules from the  CMVP Validated Modules List and have confidence in  the claimed level of security and assurance of correct  implementation.  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  48  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  Cryptographic algorithm and cryptographic module  testing and validation are based on underlying published  standards and guidance that are developed within the  Computer Security Division (CSD) in collaboration with  many other organizations. As federal agencies are  required to use validated cryptographic modules for  the protection of sensitive nonclassified information,  the validated modules and the validated algorithms  that the modules contain represent the culmination  and delivery of the division’s cryptography-based work  to the end user.  The CAVP and the CMVP are separate, collaborative  programs based on a partnership between NIST’s CSD  and the Communication Security Establishment Canada  (CSEC). The programs provide federal agencies — in the  United States and Canada — confidence that a validated  cryptographic algorithm has been implemented  correctly and that a validated cryptographic module  meets a claimed level of security assurance. The  CAVP and the CMVP validate algorithms and modules  used in a wide variety of products, including secure  Internet browsers, secure radios, smart cards, space- based communications, munitions, security tokens,  storage devices, and products supporting Public Key  Infrastructure (PKI) and electronic commerce. A  module may be a standalone product, such as a virtual  private network (VPN), smart card or toolkit, or one  module may be used in several products; as a result, a  small number of modules may be incorporated within  hundreds of products. Likewise, the CAVP validates  cryptographic algorithms that may be integrated in  one or more cryptographic modules.  The two validation programs (the CAVP and CMVP)  provide documented methodologies for conformance  testing through defined sets of security requirements.  Security requirements for the CAVP are found in the  individual validation system documents containing the  validation test suites that are required to assure that  the algorithm has been implemented correctly. The  validation system documents are designed for each  FIPS-approved and NIST-recommended cryptographic  algorithm. Security requirements for the CMVP are  found in FIPS 140-2, Security Requirements for  Cryptographic Modules, and the associated test metrics  and methods in Derived Test Requirements for FIPS  140-2. Annexes to FIPS 140-2 reference the underlying  cryptographic algorithm standards or methods.  Federal agencies are required to use modules that  were validated as conforming to the provisions of FIPS  140-2. The CMVP developed Derived Test Requirements  associated with FIPS 140-2 to define the security  requirements and the test metrics and methods to  ensure repeatability of tests and equivalency in results  across the testing laboratories.

Likewise, the CAVP reviews the  cryptographic algorithm validation requests submitted  by the accredited laboratories. With these insights, the  CAVP and CMVP can perform research and development  of new test metrics and methods as they evolve.  Based on this research, the CAVP and CMVP publish  implementation guidance to assist vendors, testing  laboratories, and the user community in the latest  0  100  200  300  400  500  600  19 95  19 96  19 97  19 98  19 99  20 00  20 01  20 02  20 03  20 04  20 05  20 06  20 07  20 08  20 09  20 10  20 11  20 12  Projected  Level 4  Level 3  Level 2  Level 1  FIPS 140-1 and FIPS 140-2 Validated  Modules by Year and Level  (November 30, 2012)  programmatic and technical guidance. This guidance  provides clarity, consistency of interpretation, and  insight for successful conformance testing, validation,  and revalidation.  The unique position of the validation programs gives  CMVP the opportunity to acquire insight during the  validation review activities and results in practical,  timely, and up-to-date guidance that is needed by the  testing laboratories and vendors to move their modules  and products out to the user community in a timely  and cost-effective manner and with the assurance  of third-party conformance testing. This knowledge  and insight provide a foundation for future standards  development.  The CAVP and the CMVP have stimulated improved  quality and security assurance of cryptographic  modules. The latest set of statistics, which are collected  quarterly from each of the testing laboratories, shows  that 8 percent of the cryptographic algorithms and  61 percent of the cryptographic modules brought in  for voluntary testing had security flaws that were  corrected during testing. Without this program,  the federal government would have had less than a  50 percent chance of buying correctly implemented  cryptography. To date, over 1,850 cryptographic  module validation certificates have been issued,  representing over 4,275 modules that were validated  by the CMVP. These modules have been developed by  more than 400 domestic and international vendors.  The CAVP issued 2,225 algorithm validations and  the CMVP issued 191 module validation certificates  in FY2012. The number of algorithms and modules  submitted for validation continues to grow, representing  significant growth in the number of validated products  expected to be available in the future.`  FIPS 140-1 and FIPS 140-2 Validation  Certificates by Fiscal Year and Level  ( November 30, 2012)  0  50  100  150  200  250  19 96  19 97  19 98  19 99  20 00  20 01  20 02  20 03  20 04  20 05  20 06  20 07  20 08  20 09  20 10  20 11  20 12  20 13  Level 4  Level 3  Level 2  Level 1  CAVP Validation Status By FYs  0  500  1000  1500  2000  2500  FY 19  96  FY 19  98  FY 20  00  FY 20  02  FY 20  04  FY 20  06  FY 20  08  FY 20  10  FY 20  12  TDES  SJ  SH A  RSA  RNG  KDF  KAS  HM AC  ECDSA  DSA  DRB G  DES  Co mpo ne nt  Te s t  AES  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  50  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  Page 1 of 1  CAVP Validated Implementation Actual Numbers  Updated As Wednesday, October 03, 2012  FiscalYear AES Comp.

Easter Ms. Sharon Keller  (301) 975-4641 (301) 975-2910  randall.easter@nist.gov sharon.keller@nist.gov  Î Automated Security Testing and Test  Suite Development  NIST’s Cryptographic Technology Group (CTG) and  Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP)  work closely throughout the specification and guideline  development process to develop guidance and  specifications for cryptographic-based security that can  be tested at the algorithm level to provide assurance  that the algorithms are implemented correctly.  The  CTG is responsible for developing Federal Information  Processing Standards (FIPS) and Special Publications  (SPs), which contain guidance for cryptographic-based  security. This includes the specification of approved  cryptographic algorithms and the development of  guidelines for using these cryptographic mechanisms  to provide secure and reliable protection for federal  information. NIST’s Cryptographic Algorithm Validation  Program (CAVP) is responsible for providing assurance  that the algorithms are implemented correctly.  The CAVP does this by designing and developing  conformance testing for implementations of these  algorithms.  The conformance tests consist of a suite of validation  tests for each approved cryptographic algorithm.  These tests exercise the mathematical formulas  and the algorithmic requirements detailed in the  algorithm to assure that the detailed specifications  are implemented correctly and completely. If the  implementer deviates from or excludes any part of  these instructions or requirements, the validation test  will fail, indicating that the algorithm implementation  does not function properly or is incomplete.  CAVP developed validation tests are performed by  accredited testing laboratories on a vendor’s algorithm  implementation using automated known-answer  mailto:sharon.keller@nist.gov mailto:randall.easter@nist.gov http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM  51  tests, which compare the result from a cryptographic  operation with a specific input against the expected  result. They provide a uniform way to assure that the  cryptographic algorithm implementation adheres to  the detailed specifications.  There are several types of validation tests, all designed  to satisfy the testing requirements of the cryptographic  algorithms and their specifications. These include, but  are not limited to, Known-Answer Tests, Monte Carlo  Tests, and Multi-Block Message Tests. The Known- Answer Tests are designed to test the conformance  of the implementation under test (IUT) to the various  specifications in the reference document. This involves  testing the components of the algorithm to assure  that they are implemented correctly. The Monte Carlo  Test is designed to exercise the entire IUT. This test  is designed to detect the presence of implementation  flaws that are not detected with the controlled input of  the Known-Answer Tests. The types of implementation  flaws detected by this validation test include pointer  problems, insufficient allocation of space, improper  error handling, and incorrect behavior of the IUT. The  Multi-Block Message Test (MMT) is designed to test the  ability of the implementation to process multi-block  messages, which require the chaining of information  from one block to the next.  Automated security testing and test suite development  are integral components of the CAVP. The CAVP  encompasses validation testing for FIPS-approved  and NIST-recommended cryptographic algorithms.  Cryptographic algorithm validation is a prerequisite to  the cryptographic module validation performed by the  Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP). The  testing of cryptographic algorithm implementations is  performed by independent third-party laboratories.  The CAVP develops and maintains a Cryptographic  Algorithm Validation System (CAVS) tool that automates  the cryptographic algorithm validation testing.  During the last few years, the scope of requirements  within the CTG’s publications has expanded to include  not only an algorithm’s specification, but also how an  algorithm should be used. Many of these requirements  are outside the scope of the algorithm boundary and  therefore cannot be tested at the algorithm level by  the CAVP. Some of the requirements are routinely  tested within NIST’s Cryptographic Module Validation  Program (CMVP), which validates cryptographic  modules. Other requirements could potentially  be tested by the CMVP, while others cannot; in the  latter case, the fulfillment of the requirements is the  responsibility of entities using, installing, or configuring  applications or protocols that use the cryptographic  algorithms. For example, depending on the design of  a cryptographic module, it may not be possible for the  module to determine whether or not a specific key is  used for multiple purposes, a situation that is strongly  discouraged.  The CAVS tool currently has algorithm validation  testing for the following cryptographic algorithms:  Cryptographic  Algorithm/Component  Special Publication or FIPS  Triple Data Encryption  Standard (TDES)  SP 800-67, Recommendation  for the Triple Data Encryption  Algorithm (TDEA) Block  Cipher, and SP 800-38A,  Recommendation for Block  Cipher Modes of Operation–  Methods and Techniques  Advanced Encryption  Standard (AES)  FIPS 197, Advanced Encryption  Standard, and SP 800-38A  Digital Signature  Standard (DSS)  FIPS 186-2, Digital  Signature Standard (DSS),  with change notice 1,  dated October 5, 2001  FIPS 186-3, Digital  Signature Standard (DSS),  dated June 2009  Elliptic Curve Digital Signature  Algorithm (ECDSA)  FIPS 186-2, Digital Signature  Standard (DSS), with change  notice 1, dated October  5, 2001 and ANSI X9.62  FIPS 186-3, Digital Signature  Standard (DSS), dated June  2009 and ANSI X9.62  RSA algorithm ANSI X9.31 and Public Key  Cryptography Standards  (PKCS) #1 v2.1: RSA  Cryptography Standard-2002  FIPS 186-3, Digital Signature  Standard (DSS), dated June  2009 and ANSI X9.31 and  Public Key Cryptography  Standards (PKCS) #1 v2.1: RSA  Cryptography Standard-2002  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  Cryptographic Special Publication Algorithm/Component or FIPS  Hashing algorithms SHA- FIPS 180-4, Secure  1, SHA-224, SHA-256, Hash Standard (SHS),  SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA- dated March 2012  512/224, SHA-512/256  Random number generator FIPS 186-2 Appendix 3.1 and  (RNG) algorithms 3.2; ANSI X9.62 Appendix A.4  Deterministic Random SP 800-90, Recommendation  Bit Generators (DRBG) for Random Number  Generation Using Deterministic  Random Bit Generators  Keyed-Hash Message FIPS 198, The Keyed-Hash  Authentication Code (HMAC) Message Authentication  Code (HMAC)  Counter with Cipher SP 800-38C, Recommendation  Block Chaining-Message for Block Cipher Modes  Authentication Code of Operation: the CCM  (CCM) mode Mode for Authentication  and Confidentiality  Cipher-based Message SP 800-38B, Recommendation  Authentication Code (CMAC) for Block Cipher Modes  Mode for Authentication of Operation: The CMAC  Mode for Authentication  Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) SP 800-38D, Recommendation  GMAC Mode of Operation for Block Cipher Modes of  Operation: Galois/Counter  Mode (GCM) and GMAC,  dated November 2007  XTS Mode of Operation SP800-38E, Recommendation  for Block Cipher Modes of  Operation: The XTS-AES  Mode for Confidentiality  on Block-Oriented Storage  Devices, dated January 2010  Key Agreement Schemes SP 800-56A, Recommendation  and Key Confirmation for Pair-Wise Key  Establishment Schemes  Using Discrete Logarithm  Cryptography, dated  March 2007  All of SP 800-56A except KDF SP 800-56A All sections  except Section 5.8 Key  Derivation Functions for  Key Agreement Schemes  SP 800-56A Section 5.7.1.2 SP 800-56A Section 5.7.1.2  ECC CDH function Elliptic Curve Cryptography  Cofactor Diffie-Hellman (ECC  CDH) Primitive Testing  Key-Based Key Derivation SP800-108, Recommendation  functions (KBKDF) for Key Derivation using  Pseudorandom Functions,  dated October 2009  Cryptographic Special Publication Algorithm/Component or FIPS  Application-Specific Key SP800-135 (Revision 1)  Derivation functions (ASKDF) Recommendation for  (includes KDFs used by IKEv1, Existing Application-Specific  IKEv2, TLS, ANS X9.63-2001, key Derivation Functions,  SSH, SRTP, SNMP, and TPM dated December 2011  Component test – ECDSA FIPS 186-3, Digital Signature  Signature Generation of hash Standard (DSS), dated June  value (This component test 2009 and ANSI X9.62  verifies the signing of a hash- sized input.

These efforts bring consistent testing  of cryptographic modules to the global community.  ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27 WG 3 has progressed on the  revision of ISO/IEC 19790 and the revision of ISO/  IEC 24759 for which Randall J. Easter of CSD is the  editor. The revision of 19790 was completed, and it  was published August 15, 2012. ISO/IEC 19790:2012  was also adopted by the American National Standards  Institute (ANSI). The first Committee Draft (CD) of  24759 was completed in July 2012 and circulated  for national body comment. It is expected that the  revision of 24759 will be published in FY2013.  Work is nearing completion on the Technical Report  document, ISO/IEC 30104 “Physical Security Attacks,  Mitigation Techniques and Security Requirements,”  for which Randall J. Easter of CSD is the editor. A  final draft of 30104 was completed in June 2012 and  circulated for national body comment.  Work is progressing on a new standard document,  ISO/IEC 17825 “Testing methods for the mitigation of  non-invasive attack classes against cryptographic,”  for which Randall J. Easter of CSD is the editor. The  second working draft of 17825 was completed in June  2012 and circulated for national body comment.  National body comments for the above three  documents will be addressed at the 45th SC 27 WG 3  meeting to be held in Rome, Italy, in October 2012.  A new work item was proposed (NWIP) at the 44th  SC 27 WG 3 meeting, which was held in May 2012,  to address “Cryptographic algorithms and security  mechanisms conformance testing.” It is expected to  be approved as a new work item at the 45th SC 27 WG  3 with Randall J. Easter of CSD appointed as editor.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/  Contact:  Mr. Randall J. Easter  (301) 975-4641  randall.easter@nist.gov  Î Security Content Automation Protocol  (SCAP) Validation Program  The SCAP Validation Program performs conformance  testing to ensure that products correctly implement  SCAP as defined in SP 800-126, The Technical  Specification for the Security Content Automation  Protocol (SCAP): SCAP  Version 1.2. Conformance testing  is necessary because SCAP is a complex specification  consisting of eleven individual specifications that work  together to meet various use cases. A single error in  product implementation could result in undetected  vulnerabilities or policy noncompliance within agency  and industry networks.  The SCAP Validation Program was created by request  of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to  support the Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC)  and United States Government Configuration Baseline  (USGCB). The program coordinates its work with the  NIST National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation  Program (NVLAP) to set up independent conformance  testing laboratories that conduct the testing based  on draft NISTIR 7511 Revision 3, Security Content  Automation Protocol (SCAP) Version 1.2 Validation  Program Test Requirements. When testing is completed,  the laboratory submits a test report to CSD for review  and approval. SCAP validation testing has been  designed to be inexpensive, yet effective. The SCAP  conformance tests are either easily human-verifiable  or automated through NIST-provided reference tools.  To date, the program has 9 accredited independent  laboratories and has validated 50 products from 32  different vendors.  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  mailto:randall.easter@nist.gov http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp  54  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  The SCAP Validation Program will expand in FY2013 to  provide enhanced testing support, and will evolve to  include new technologies as SCAP matures. Expansion  plans include support for United States Government  Configuration Baseline (USGCB) releases, public SCAP  validation test content, and expanded automated  testing capabilities.  http://scap.nist.gov/validation/  Contact:  Ms. Melanie Cook  (301) 975-5259  melanie.cook@nist.gov  Identity Management  Î Personal Identity Verification (PIV)  and FIPS 201 Revision Efforts  In response to Homeland Security Presidential  Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Policy for a Common  Identification Standard for Federal Employees and  Contractors, Federal Information Processing Standard  (FIPS) 201, Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of  Federal Employees and Contractors, was developed  and was approved by the Secretary of Commerce in  February 2005. HSPD-12 calls for the creation of a  new identity credential for federal employees and  contractors. FIPS 201 is the technical specification of  both the PIV identity credential and the PIV system  that produces, manages, and uses the credential. This  work is done in collaboration with the Cryptographic  Technology Group.  CSD activities in FY2012 directly supported the  revision and maintenance of the FIPS 201 standard.  CSD performed the following activities during FY2012  to revise the standard:  �� Drafted and published a second public- comment draft of FIPS 201-2 on July 9,  2012. Revised draft FIPS 201-2 reflects the  disposition of more than 1,000 comments  received from over 40 organizations on  the first public-comment draft of FIPS  201-2. NIST coordinated with the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) and other  U.S. government (USG) stakeholders before  incorporating changes in the revised draft  FIPS 201-2;  �� Organized and facilitated a workshop  to discuss the contents of revised draft  FIPS 201-2. NIST held a one-day workshop  on July 25, 2012, to discuss contents of  revised draft FIPS 201-2. The workshop was  another mechanism to reach out to the PIV  community, to interact with implementers  and vendors, to clarify and explain changes  in revised draft FIPS 201-2 as a result of  comment dispositions, and to encourage the  PIV community to provide formal comments  to NIST; and  �� Processed and analyzed comments received  on revised draft FIPS 201-2. NIST started to  review and process more than 500 comments  received from over 30 organizations.  In FY2013, CSD will be focusing on completing the  revision of draft FIPS 201-2 and updating the relevant  Special Publications (SP) associated with FIPS 201-2. In  addition to updating the relevant publications, CSD will  also develop two new SPs: SP 800-156, Representation  of PIV Chain-of-Trust for Import and Export, and SP  800-157, Guidelines for Personal Identity Verification  (PIV) Derived Credentials. CSD will also continue to  provide technical and strategic inputs to the PIV- related initiatives.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv  Contacts:  Ms. Hildegard Ferraiolo Dr. David Cooper  (301) 975-6972 (301) 975-3194  hildegard.ferraiolo@nist.gov david.cooper@nist.gov  Î NIST Personal Identity Verification  Program (NPIVP)  The objective of the NIST Personal Identity Verification  Program (NPIVP) is to validate PIV components for  conformance to specifications in FIPS 201 and its  companion documents. The two PIV components that  come under the scope of NPIVP are PIV Smart Card  Application and PIV Middleware. All of the tests under  55  NPIVP are handled by third-party laboratories that  are accredited as Cryptographic and Security Testing  (CST) Laboratories by the NIST National Voluntary  Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) and are  called accredited NPIVP test facilities. As of September  2011, there are ten such facilities.  In prior years, CSD published Special Publication  (SP) 800-85A, PIV Card Application and Middleware  Interface Test Guidelines, to facilitate development  of PIV Smart Card Application and PIV Middleware  that conform to interface specifications in SP 800-73,  Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification. CSD also  developed an integrated toolkit called “PIV Interface  Test Runner” for conducting tests on both PIV Card  Application and PIV Middleware products, and provided  the toolkit to accredited NPIVP test facilities.  Throughout FY2012, the versions of the documents  that were used as the basis for NPIVP validation are  the following:  �� Card and Middleware Interface Specification  - SP 800-73-3; and  �� Card Application and Middleware  Conformance Tests - SP 800-85A-2.  In FY2012, six new PIV card application products were  validated for conformance to SP 800-73-3, and were  issued certificates, bringing the total number of NPIVP- validated PIV Card application products to 35. Two PIV  Middleware products were validated for conformance  to SP 800-73-3 and were issued certificates, bringing  the total number of NPIVP-validated PIV Middleware  products to 19.  In addition, NPIVP completed all planning tasks  relating to update of all FIPS 201 companion documents  as well as the PIV Test Runner toolkit consequent on  the expected publication of FIPS 201-2.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/npivp  Contacts:  Dr. Ramaswamy Chandramouli Ms. Hildegard Ferraiolo  (301) 975-5013 (301) 975-6972  mouli@nist.gov hildegard.ferraiolo@nist.gov  Research in Emerging Technologies  Î Cloud Computing and Virtualization  Cloud computing offers the possibility to increase the  efficiency of IT services, to decreased cost in terms  of capital expenses (CAPEX) and operational expenses  (OPEX), and to leverage leading-edge technologies to  meet the information processing needs of the United  States government (USG). However, the change in  control dynamics poses new security challenges for the  cloud computing adopters.  To accelerate the federal government’s secure  adoption of cloud computing, NIST assumed the leading  role in developing standards and guidelines in close  consultation and collaboration with standards bodies,  the private sector, and other stakeholders. NIST’s long- term goal is to provide thought leadership and guidance  around the cloud computing paradigm to catalyze its  use within industry and government. The NIST area of  focus is technology, and specifically, interoperability,  portability, and security requirements, standards, and  guidance.  NIST Cloud Computing Program Support  NIST Cloud Computing Program strategically prioritizes  NIST tactical projects that support USG agencies in  their missions of secure and effective cloud computing  adoption.  During FY2012, the NIST Cloud Computing team  continued to promote the development of national and  international standards and specifications that support  USG’s effective and secure use of cloud computing and  to provide technical guidance to USG  agencies for a  secure and effective cloud computing adoption.  The CSD members of the NIST cloud computing team  contributed to the research and development efforts  of several public working groups which focused their  activities on:  �� Surveying the existing standards landscape  for security, portability, and interoperability  standards/models/studies/etc. relevant to  cloud computing, determining standards  gaps, and identifying standardization  priorities, to develop a NIST Cloud Computing  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  56  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  Standards Roadmap that can be incorporated  into the USG Cloud Computing Technology  Roadmap (the Standards Roadmap Working  Group);  ��Developing a USG Cloud Computing  Technology Roadmap that defines  and prioritizes USG requirements for  interoperability, portability, and security  for effective cloud computing adoption  (the Reference Architecture and Taxonomy  Working Group);  ��Developing a NIST Cloud Computing Security  Reference Architecture – a framework  and methodology for the secure adoption  of cloud computing, which supplements  the NIST Reference Architecture (Security  Working Group);  ��Supporting the cloud computing groups under  the Federal CIO Council, providing technical  advice to the Cloud Computing Executive  Steering Committee, to the Cloud Computing  Advisory Council, to the Information Security  and Identity Management, and the Web 2.0  working group (the Federal Cloud Computing  Standards and Technology Working Group);  and  ��Formulating a strategy for facilitating  the development of high-quality cloud  computing standards and describing a  process for formulating cloud computing use  cases and for judging the extent to which  cloud system interfaces can satisfy them  (the Standards Acceleration to Jumpstart  Adoption of Cloud Computing (SAJACC)  Working Group).  During FY2012, the NIST cloud computing team  supported the fourth Cloud Computing Forum held  in June 2012, at the Department of Commerce in  Washington, D.C.  The cloud computing team contributed to the NIST  Standards Working Group efforts of developing the  draft Special Publication (SP) 500-292, NIST Reference  Architecture, and draft SP 500-293, U.S. Government  Cloud Computing Technology Roadmap (volumes 1, 2,  and 3).  The CSD cloud computing team also led the NIST Security  Working Group’s task of developing the NIST Cloud  Computing - Security Reference Architecture working  document, and contributed to the development of the  white paper “Challenging Security Requirements for  the USG Cloud Computing Adoption.”  In FY2012, the leadership of the SAJACC Public  Working Group, previously provided by CSD, was  transitioned to other members of the Working Group,  while the governance was kept with the NIST Cloud  Computing Program.  In FY2012, the NIST cloud computing team also  presented the results of cloud computing research  and development, introduced the standards and  specifications under development, and provided status  of the NIST Cloud Computing Program in a variety of  conferences and workshops.  Leveraging Access Control for Cloud Computing  In 2012, CSD continued the extensive research and  development of a virtualization-based, enterprise- wide controlled delivery of data services for advanced  cloud computing through Access Control (AC). Data  services (DSs) are capabilities that enable the  reading, manipulation, computation, presentation,  management, and sharing of data. Typical DSs include  applications such as email, workflow management,  enterprise calendar, and records management, as well  as system-level features, such as file, access control,  and identity management. Although access control  currently plays an important role in securing DSs, if  properly envisaged and designed, AC can serve a more  vital role in computing than one might expect. The  Policy Machine (PM), a framework for AC developed  at NIST, was designed with this goal in mind. The PM  has evolved beyond just a concept to a prototype  implementation and is now (FY2012 & FY2013), being  implemented in a virtualized environment providing  cloud-like features.  To appreciate the PM’s advantages in computing, it  is important to recognize the methods in which DSs  are delivered today. Each DS runs in an Operating  Environment (OE) and an OE can be of many types  (e.g., operating systems, web services, middleware,  and database and database applications), each  57  implementing its own routines to enable the execution  of DS-specific operations (e.g., read, send, and view)  on their respective data types (e.g., files, messages,  and fields).  This heterogeneity among OEs introduces a number  of administrative and policy enforcement challenges  and user inconveniences. Administrators must contend  with a multitude of security domains when managing  privileges, and ordinary users and administrators  alike must authenticate to and establish sessions  within different OEs in order to exercise legitimate  DS capabilities. Even if properly coordinated across  OEs, access control policies are not always globally  enforced. An email application may, for example,  distribute files to users regardless of an operating  system’s protection settings on those files. Also, while  researchers, practitioners, and policy makers have  specified a large variety of access control policies to  address real-world security issues, only a relatively  small subset of these policies can be enforced through  off-the-shelf technology, and even a smaller subset  can be enforced by any one OE.  It is the CSD Cloud Computing team’s experience  that the PM can provide an enterprise-wide OE that  dramatically alleviates many of the administrative,  policy enforcement, data interoperability, and  usability issues that enterprises face today.  In particular, the cloud infrastructure is an OE in  which the PM’s functional components run in virtual  machines. In this deployment, users and data objects  can be provisioned, and DSs can be selected by the  subscriber. DSs can be provided as SaaS or PaaS if  they conform to the PM’s API. CSD PM-motivated  cloud differs from other types of clouds in the  properties that it provides—users and objects are  global, the framework is object type agnostic, DSs  naturally interoperate, and AC policies are managed  and enforced comprehensively across all DSs. CSD’s  cloud is also different in the degree of control  that it offers to its subscribers. AC Policies can be  imported from a library of predefined configurations,  or can be configured from scratch by the subscriber,  conferring PM the attributes of a Policy-as-a-Service  (POLICYaaS) provider. POLICYaaS supports a wide  range of policies including well-documented policies  such as Role-based Access Control, Discretionary  Access Control, and Mandatory Access Control, as well  as combinations of those policies. POLICYaaS can also  accommodate separation of duty, conflict-of-interest,  data tracking, and confinement policies, and should  likely accommodate other unanticipated policies of  the future.  The practical advantages of this PM-enabled cloud are  many. Through a single authenticated session, users  are offered capabilities of a variety of DSs to include  office applications, file management, email, workflow,  and records management. Data is naturally protected  across DSs. Instead of deploying and managing different  AC schemes for different DSs, select capabilities (of  different DSs) are delivered to select users, under  combinations of arbitrary, but mission-tailored forms  of discretionary, mandatory, and history-based ACs.  This interoperability property is not achieved through  features or interfaces built into the DS, but rather  through the OE that inherently provides a foundational  basis for interoperability.  Virtualization Security & Leveraging Virtualization  for Security  Virtualization is one of the foundational technologies  that facilitate the use of a computing infrastructure for  cloud computing services. At the core of a virtualized  infrastructure is the virtualized host that provides  abstraction of the hardware (i.e., CPU, memory,  etc.) enabling multiple computing stacks (made up  of O/S, Middleware and Applications) to be run on a  single physical machine. The software that provides  the abstraction features as well as the management  capability to run multiple computing stacks (called  Virtual Machines or VMs) is called the Hypervisor. The  hypervisor also provides functions to define an entirely  software-defined network inside a virtualized host  (called a Virtual Network) for enabling communication  among VMs running inside the virtualized host as well  as to enable connectivity with the enterprise network  outside the host. In addition, virtualization can also  be implemented for the data storage infrastructure as  well.  Taking into account the widespread scope for  virtualization in the IT infrastructure, CSD has taken  a comprehensive view of the security implications of  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  58  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  this technology through a multifaceted approach that  includes the following perspectives.  Perspective 1: Ensuring protection of the core  virtualization module - the Hypervisor through a  combination of architectural choices, configuration  options, and operational practices.  Perspective 2: Ensuring protection of applications and  O/S (called guest O/S) running inside virtual machines  (VMs) through a combination of segmentation of the  virtual network, virtual firewalls, Anti-Virus/Anti- Malware software, and IDS/IPS devices.  Perspective 3: Leveraging virtualization features to  enhance security protection wherever possible.  In support of Perspective 1, in FY2012, NIST has  developed a preliminary draft of NIST IR 7852, Secure  Management Practices for Protection of Hypervisors,  which outlines a set of recommendations for secure  deployment of the complete hypervisor platform.  Looking at security aspects from Perspective 2, one  of the objectives was to identify the differences in  security protection measures for VMs that are available  to stakeholders between virtualized infrastructures  deployed entirely for internal use from the ones  that are used for offering cloud computing services.  Towards this objective, a peer-reviewed conference  paper titled “Security Control Variations between In- house and Cloud-based Virtualized Infrastructures”  was written and presented at the 5th International  Conference of Dependability.  In FY2013, CSD plans to obtain feedback and  comments and publish the final version of NIST IR  7852. The core tasks in the area of virtualization for  FY2013 will consist of security analysis and security  recommendations based on all three perspectives  described above, through the medium of conference  papers and NIST publications, so as to promote secure  adoption of this critical technology.

Although these devices are relatively small and  inexpensive, they can be used not only for voice calls  and simple text messages, but also for many functions  once limited to laptop and desktop computers. Smart  phones and tablet devices have specialized built- in hardware, such as photographic cameras, video  cameras, accelerometers, Global Positioning System  (GPS) receivers, and removable media readers.  Furthermore, they employ a range of wireless  interfaces, including infrared, Wireless Fidelity (Wi- Fi), Bluetooth, Near Field Communications (NFC), and  one or more types of cellular interfaces that provide  network connectivity across the globe. Although  small in terms of form-factor, they can be used for  sending and receiving email, browsing the web, online  banking and commerce, social networking, storing  and modifying documents, remotely accessing data,  recording audio and video, and as navigation aids.  Naturally, just as consumers and business people can  realize productivity gains from these technologies, so  can government agencies.  Like any new technology, smart phones present  new capabilities, but also a number of new security  challenges. Moreover, as the pace of the technology  life cycles continues to increase, current Information  http://collaborate.nist.gov/twiki-cloud-computing/bin/view/CloudComputing/WebHome http://collaborate.nist.gov/twiki-cloud-computing/bin/view/CloudComputing/WebHome mailto:mouli@nist.gov mailto:david.ferraiolo@nist.gov mailto:michaela.iorga@nist.gov http://www.nist.gov/itl/cloud  59  Assurance standards and processes must be updated  and new technologies developed to transition from the  use of specialized Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS)  products to Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products  to allow government users to employ the latest and  greatest technologies that consumers can use without  sacrificing any privacy and security.  NIST is conducting research in new testing  methodologies for smart phone software (apps) and  is working with industry to bridge the security gaps  present on today’s smart phones. NIST has developed  an online beta App Testing Portal for Android that  examines app functionality with respect to agency  security and privacy guidelines.  NIST will be publishing the following Special  Publications (SP) in FY2013:  �� SP 800-124, Guidelines for Managing and  Securing Mobile Devices in the Enterprise;  �� SP 800-164, Guidelines on Hardware-Rooted  Security in Mobile Devices; and  �� SP 800-163, Guidelines for Testing and  Vetting Mobile Applications.

The  primary motivations for the development of IPv6  were to increase the number of unique IP addresses  and to handle the needs of new Internet applications  and devices. In addition, IPv6 was designed with the  following goals: increased ease of network management  and configuration; expandable IP headers; improved  mobility and security; and quality of service controls.  IPv6 has been, and continues to be, developed and  defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).  This year was a significant year for the deployment  of IPv6 in the United States government. Office of  Management and Budget’s (OMB) Memo of September  10, 2010, entitled “Transition to IPv6,” required all  government agencies to “upgrade public/external  facing servers and services (e.g., web, email, Domain  Name System [DNS], Internet Service Provider [ISP]  services, etc.) to operationally use native IPv6 by the  end of FY2012.” NIST has been working with the USGv6  Task Force and with individual government agencies  to achieve this goal. NIST has developed an online  monitor to demonstrate which high-level government  domains have met this goal with respect to DNS  services, email, web servers, and DNSSEC. OMB is using  this monitor to measure USGv6 compliance with their  latest milestone.  The NIST IPv6 Test Program, whose goal is to provide  assurance on IPv6 conformance and interoperability of  products, continued to operate. Additional tests were  added, and the Supplier’s Declaration of Conformity  (SDOC), the vehicle used to enable vendors of IPv6  products to report the details of their products  that have successfully executed the United States  Government IPv6 (USGv6) tests, was improved.  In FY2013, NIST will continue to manage and evolve  the USGv6 Test Program, and will update the NIST IPv6  Profile.  http://www.antd.nist.gov/usgv6  Contacts:  Ms. Sheila Frankel Mr. Douglas Montgomery  (301) 975-3297 (301) 975-3630  sheila.frankel@nist.gov dougm@nist.gov  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  60  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  Access Control and Privilege Management  Î Access Control and Privilege  Management Research  With the advance of current computing technologies  and the multifaceted environments the technologies  are applied to, security issues such as situation  awareness, trust management, privacy control for  access control, and privilege management systems  are becoming more complex. However, the research  available on these topics is generally targeted to a  specific system, is incomplete, makes assumptions,  or is ambiguous regarding critical elements. Thus,  practical and conceptual general guidance for these  topics is needed.  In FY2012, CSD completed the development of the  NIST Interagency Report (NISTIR) 7874, Guidelines for  Access Control System Evaluation Metrics; researched  unified enforcement mechanism of data services  from Policy Machine (PM) for Enterprise Computing  environment; enhanced the capabilities of the Access  Control Policy Tool (ACPT); researched new access  control rule verification method using diagraph  algorithms; and started the development of draft NIST  Special Publication (SP) 800-162, Attribute-Based  Access Control (ABAC) Definition and Considerations,  which provides information explaining the applications  as well as formal models of ABAC.  In FY2013, CSD will continue the development of  draft NIST SP 800-162; research unified enforcement  mechanisms of data services from Policy Machine (PM)  for Enterprise Computing environments; enhance the  capabilities of the Access Control Policy Tool (ACPT);  and research diagraph algorithms for policy rule  composition of ABAC.  CSD expects that this project will:  �� Promote (or accelerate) the adoption of  community computing that utilizes the  power of shared resources and common  trust management schemes;  �� Provide a standard evaluation metric in  evaluating or comparing access control  mechanisms for implementing access control  applications;  �� Increase security and safety of static  (connected) distributed systems by applying  the testing and verification tool for the  access control policies; and  �� Assist system architects, security  administrators, and security managers  whose expertise is related to access control  or privilege policy in managing their  systems, and in learning the limitations and  practical approaches for their applications.

Faulty policies,  misconfigurations, or flaws in software implementation  can result in serious vulnerabilities. The specification  of access control policies is often a challenging  problem. Often a system’s privacy and security are  compromised due to the misconfiguration of access  control policies instead of the failure of cryptographic  primitives or protocols. This problem becomes  increasingly severe as software systems become more  and more complex, and are deployed to manage a  large amount of sensitive information and resources  organized into sophisticated structures. Identifying  discrepancies between policy specifications and their  properties (intended function) is crucial because  correct implementation and enforcement of policies  by applications is based on the premise that the  policy specifications are correct. As a result, policy  specifications must undergo rigorous verification and  validation through systematic testing to ensure that  the policy specifications truly encapsulate the desires  of the policy authors.  61  To formally and precisely capture the security  properties that access control should adhere to,  access control models are usually written to bridge  the rather wide gap in abstraction between policy  and mechanism. Thus, an access control model  provides unambiguous and precise expression as  well as reference for design and implementation of  security requirements. Techniques are required for  verifying whether an access control model is correctly  expressed in the access controls policies and whether  the properties are satisfied in the model. In practice,  the same access control policies may express multiple  access control models or express a single model in  addition to extra access control constraints outside of  the model. Ensuring the conformance of access control  models and policies is a nontrivial and critical task.  Started in 2009, CSD developed a prototype system,  Access Control Policy Tool (ACPT), which allows a user  to compose, verify, test, and generate access control  policies.  In FY2012, ACPT was downloaded by 130 users and  organizations. CSD performed Beta testing, enhanced  the capability of ACPT by adding new policy combine  algorithms, applied more stringent and practical user  cases to test ACPT’s performance, and researched  an additional modeling method that is more flexible  than the current one used. CSD also produced a new  user manual that contains examples and detailed  information of ACPT. In addition, CSD published a  research paper related to ACPT.  In FY2013, CSD will continue testing, enhance the  capability of ACPT by adding environmental variable  function, provide model profiles, and resolve  compatibility issues between systems used by ACPT.  CSD will also update ACPT from users’ feedbacks and  suggestions.  This project is expected to:  ��Provide generic paradigm and framework of  access control model/property conformance  testing;  ��Provide templates for specifying access  control rules in popular access control  models such as Attribute Based, Multilevel,  and Workflow models;  ��Provide tools or services for checking  the security and safety of access control  implementation, policy combination, and  XACML policy generation;  ��Promote (or accelerate) the adoption of  combinatorial testing for large-system (such  as access control system) testing; and  ��Assist system architects, security  administrators, and security managers  whose expertise is related to access control  in managing their systems, and to learn the  limitations and practical approaches for  their applications.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/acpt/  Contacts:  Dr. Vincent Hu Mr. Rick Kuhn  (301) 975-4975 (301) 975-3337  vhu@nist.gov kuhn@nist.gov  Î Metrics for Evaluation of Access  Control Systems  Access control (AC) systems come with a wide variety  of features and administrative capabilities, and the  operational impact can be significant. In particular,  this impact can pertain to administrative and user  productivity, as well as to the organization’s ability to  perform its mission. Therefore, it is reasonable to use  a quality metric to verify the mechanical properties of  AC systems. Features that influence the development  of this metric are: 1) administration is the main  consideration of cost; 2) enforcement capabilities  are the requirements for AC applications; 3) the  performance is the major factor for the AC usability;  and 4) support functions allow an AC system to utilize  and connect to related technologies so as to enable  more efficient integration with network and host  service functions. This project provides a metric for  the evaluation of AC systems based on the features  of administration, enforcement, performance, and  support of AC properties.  The ability of an organization to enforce its access  policies determines the degree to which its data may  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  mailto:kuhn@nist.gov mailto:vhu@nist.gov http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/acpt  62  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  be protected and shared among its user community.  The focus on sharing and protecting information is  becoming increasingly acute for many organizations.  Unfortunately, when it comes to AC systems, one  size does not fit all. The quality of administrative  capabilities has an impact on administrative cost, user  downtime between administrative events, and the  abilities of users to perform their duties, as well as the  overall security posture of the enterprise. Currently  no well-accepted metrics exist for measuring the  effectiveness or functional quality of an AC system.  The purpose of this project is to provide federal  agencies with background information on access  control properties, and to help agencies improve the  evaluation of their AC systems. This project provides  information of the administration, enforcement,  performance, and support properties of AC mechanisms  that are embedded in each AC system. Properties  discussed in this project extend to the information in  NISTIR 7316, Assessment of Access Control Systems,  which demonstrates the fundamental concept of  policy, models, and mechanisms of AC systems.  In FY2012, CSD completed the writing of NISTIR  7874, Guidelines for Access Control System Evaluation  Metrics. NISTIR 7874 includes detailed items for AC  system properties, as well as examples to demonstrate  how to use the metric in evaluating and comparing  capabilities for AC systems, which can be applied to  application or research environments.  CSD expects that this project will:  �� Provide detailed information on the  evaluation of AC systems, including policies,  models, and mechanism for AC system  researchers;  �� Help security policy makers and system  administrators in planning and improving  their current and extended future AC  systems;  �� Provide information for AC system developers  in the consideration of architecture,  requirements, and performance of an AC  system; and  �� Provide reference information for AC system- related standards.

Through the creation of flexible, open standards  and international recognition, security automation  will result in IT infrastructure interoperability,  broad acceptance, and adoption, and will create  opportunities for innovation.  Security Content Automation Protocol  (SCAP) / SCAP Specification Development  To support the overarching security automation vision,  it is necessary to have both trusted information and  a standardized means to store and share it. Through  close work with its government and industry partners,  NIST has developed the Security Content Automation  Protocol (SCAP) to provide the standardized technical  mechanisms to share information between systems.  Through the National Vulnerability Database (NVD)  and the National Checklist Program (NCP), NIST is  providing relevant and important information in the  areas of vulnerability and configuration management.  Combined, SCAP and the programs that leverage it are  moving the information assurance industry towards  being able to standardize communications, collect  and store relevant data in standardized formats, and  provide automated means for the assessment and  remediation of systems for both vulnerabilities and  configuration compliance.  63  SCAP is a suite of specifications that use Extensible  Markup Language (XML) to standardize the format and  nomenclature by which security software products  communicate information about software flaws and  security configurations. SCAP includes software flaw  and security configuration standard reference data,  also known as SCAP content. This reference data is  provided by the NVD (http://nvd.nist.gov/).  SCAP is a multipurpose protocol that supports  automated vulnerability checking, technical control  compliance activities, and security measurement. The  U.S. government, in cooperation with academia and  private industry, is adopting SCAP and encourages its  use in support of security automation activities and  initiatives.  At the end of September 2012, SP 800-126  Revision 2, The Technical Specification for the Security  Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2,  was issued as final (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/  nistpubs/800-126-rev2/SP800-126r2.pdf). This document  describes the 11 component specifications composing  SCAP:  ��Languages:  ◦�Extensible Configuration Checklist  Description Format (XCCDF), a language for  authoring security checklists/benchmarks  and for reporting results of evaluating them;  ◦�Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language  (OVAL), a language for representing system  configuration information, assessing machine  state, and reporting assessment results; and  ◦�Open Checklist Interactive Language (OCIL),  a language for representing checks that  collect information from people or from  existing data stores made by other data  collection efforts;  ��Reporting Formats:  ◦�Asset Reporting Format (ARF), a format  for expressing the transport format  of information about assets and the  relationships between assets and reports;  and  ◦�Asset Identification (AI), a format for  uniquely identifying assets based on known  identifiers and/or known information about  the assets;  ��Enumerations:  ◦�Common Platform Enumeration (CPE), a  nomenclature and dictionary of hardware,  operating systems, and applications;  ◦�Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE),  a nomenclature and dictionary of software  security configurations; and  ◦�Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures  (CVE), a nomenclature and dictionary of  security-related software flaws;  ��Measurement and Scoring Systems:  ◦�Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS),  a specification for measuring the relative  severity of software flaw vulnerabilities; and  ◦�Common Configuration Scoring System  (CCSS), a specification for measuring  the relative severity of system security  configuration issues; and  ��Integrity:  ◦�Trust Model for Security Automation Data  (TMSAD), a specification for using digital  signatures in a common trust model applied  to security automation specifications.  SCAP is being widely adopted by major software and  hardware manufacturers and has become a significant  component of information security management and  governance programs. The protocol is expected to  evolve and expand in support of the growing need to  define and measure effective security controls, assess  and monitor ongoing aspects of information security,  remediate noncompliance, and successfully manage  systems in accordance with the Risk Management  Framework described in SP 800-53.  Currently, CSD is leveraging SCAP in multiple areas,  both to support its own mission and to enable other  agencies and private sector entities to meet their  goals. For CSD, SCAP is a critical component of the  SCAP Validation Program, the National Vulnerability  Database (NVD), and the National Checklist Program.

The NVD provides  information regarding security vulnerabilities and  configuration settings, vulnerability impact metrics,  technical assessment methods, and references to  remediation assistance and IT product identification  data. The NVD reference data supports security  automation efforts based on the Security Content  Automation Protocol (SCAP). As of September 2012,  the NVD contained the following resources:  ��Over 53,000 vulnerability advisories with an  average of 8 new vulnerabilities added daily;  ��46 SCAP-expressed checklists containing  thousands of low-level security configuration  checks that can be used by SCAP-validated  security products to perform automated  evaluations of system state;  ��156 non-SCAP security checklists (e.g.,  English prose guidance and configuration  scripts);  ��222 U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness  Team (USCERT) alerts, 2,645 US-CERT  vulnerability summaries, and 8,140 SCAP  machine-readable software flaw checks;  ��Product dictionary with 62,729 operating  system, application, and hardware name  entries; and  ��38,083 vulnerability advisories translated  into Spanish.  NVD is hosted and maintained by NIST and is sponsored  by the Department of Homeland Security’s National  Cyber Security Division.  NVD’s effective reach has been extended by the use of  SCAP data by commercial security products deployed  in thousands of organizations worldwide. Increased  adoption of SCAP is evidenced by the increasing  demand for NVD Extensible Markup Language (XML)  data feeds and SCAP-expressed content from the NVD  website. Concerted outreach efforts over the last year  have resulted in an increase in the number of vendors  providing SCAP-expressed content.  NVD continues to play a pivotal role in the Payment  Card Industry (PCI) efforts to mitigate vulnerabilities  in credit card systems. PCI mandates the use of NVD  vulnerability severity scores in measuring the risk to  payment card servers worldwide and for prioritizing  vulnerability patching. PCI’s use of NVD severity scores  helps enhance credit card transaction security and  protects consumers’ personal information.  Throughout FY2012, NVD continued to provide  access to vulnerability reference data and security  checklists. NVD deployed an enhanced checklist  submission web interface and a web service checklist  submission capability. Additionally, the NVD now hosts  a SCAP Content Validation Tool that can be used by  creators of SCAP content to ensure that their SCAP  content packages conform to Special Publication  (SP) 800-126, The Technical Specification for the  Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP  Version 1.2, guidelines. Finally, NVD now supports  automated SCAP content generation from the Common  Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) vulnerability data  feed. NVD data is a fundamental component of CSD’s  security automation infrastructure and is substantially  increasing the security of networks worldwide. CSD  plans to expand and improve the NVD in FY2013.  http://nvd.nist.gov  Contact:  Mr. Harold Booth  (301) 975-8441  harold.booth@nist.gov  Incident Handling Automation  In recent years, security threats to digital systems  have become more prevalent and more sophisticated.  While some security threats are generic in nature,  others are targeted at specific organizations, assets,  and missions. Although computer security defenses  may forestall many threats, not all can be prevented,  and organizations must therefore develop incident  handling capabilities. Incident handling encompasses  a variety of tasks ranging from preparation prior to an  incident to timely detection and analysis of an incident  to recovery and repair from the effects of an incident  to post-incident learning and improvement. These  http://nvd.nist.gov mailto:harold.booth@nist.gov  65  tasks need to be performed both internally within  specific organizations and externally via coordination  across teams of collaborating organizations.  In the past year, NIST worked with the Department  of Homeland Security’s United States Computer  Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) to develop  Revision 2 of NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-61,  Computer Security Incident Handling Guide. This  document provides guidance on developing incident  handling capabilities. The document explains the  nature of incidents, explains the incident handling  process, explains the structure and operation of  Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs),  and provides guidance on handling an incident and  coordinating with other organizations.  SP 800-61 focuses primarily on manual (human)  processes for incident handling and the effective use  of human judgment, guided by applicable regulation  and law, regarding which incident-related information  is significant and which incident-related information  may be shared. The growing volume of security threats,  however, is driving the need for a more agile incident- handling framework that can operate at differing  scales and speeds as required.  Working in concert with the Department of Homeland  Security, NIST is expanding existing incident handling  guidance to enable coordinated information sharing  across disparate CSIRTs operating at differing scales  and speeds. This work will include the analysis of  standardized incident handling data models and the  incorporation of these data models, as appropriate,  into both CSIRT information sharing processes as  well as incident/threat knowledge repositories. This  work will describe how mature CSIRTs may operate  in a diverse information-sharing network with both  operational and strategic CSIRTs, as well as industry  knowledge repositories. This may include selective use  of security automation where applicable.  In FY2013, this work will develop draft SP 800-150,  Coordinated Computer Security Incident Handling  Guidance.

The  project evolved from the Federal Desktop Core  Configuration (FDCC) mandate originally described in  a March 2007 memorandum from the U.S. White House  Office of Management and Budget (Memorandum M-07- 11). USGCB helps to improve information security  and reduce overall IT operating costs by providing  commonly accepted security configurations for major  operating systems.  Through the National Checklist Program described  in Special Publication (SP) 800-70, National Checklist  Program for IT Products: Guidelines for Checklist Users  and Developers, a baseline submitter may express  interest in submitting a candidate for use in the USGCB  program. CSD works with the Federal CIO Council’s  Technology Infrastructure Subcommittee (TIS) to  consider the candidate, recommend any changes  to the baseline, and coordinate implementation at  federal agencies.  On behalf of the TIS, NIST reviews the SCAP- expressed checklist to ensure that it complies with  the appropriate specifications and to ensure that the  benchmark properly assesses the intended security  configuration. Where possible, virtual images of target  architectures are provided to assist agencies with  testing the content for suitability in their environment.  For example, Windows desktop virtual hard drive  images (VHDs) and Group Policy Object (GPO) files  or Red Hat Enterprise Linux Kickstart Configuration  Scripts may be provided, enabling users to replicate  the target test environment for local validation. Any  identified issues may be posted to the USGCB and FDCC  mail aliases.  CSD provides ongoing support for the USGCB  automation content, including the creation of patch  updates, assisting USGCB users in continuously  monitoring and assessing security compliance of  information systems. This ongoing monitoring element  supports the Risk Management Framework described  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  66  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  in SP 800-37 Revision 1, Guide for Applying the Risk  Management Framework to Federal Information  Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach.  The USGCB Program will continue in FY2013 to provide  ongoing maintenance of the baseline artifacts and to  consider additional applicable platforms.  Contact:  Mr. Stephen Quinn  (301) 975-6967  stephen.quinn@nist.gov  National Checklist Program (NCP)  There are many threats to information technology  (IT), ranging from remotely launched network service  exploits to malicious code spread through infected  emails, websites, and downloaded files. Vulnerabilities  in IT products are discovered daily, and many ready- to-use exploitation techniques are widely available on  the Internet. Because IT products are often intended  for a wide variety of audiences, restrictive security  configuration controls are usually not enabled by  default. As a result, many out-of-the box IT products  are immediately vulnerable. In addition, identifying  a reasonable set of security settings that achieve  balanced risk management is a complicated, arduous,  and time-consuming task, even for experienced system  administrators.  To facilitate development of security configuration  checklists for IT products and to make checklists more  organized and usable, NIST established the National  Checklist Program (NCP) in furtherance of its statutory  responsibilities under the Federal Information Security  Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107- 347, and also under the Cyber Security Research and  Development Act, which tasks NIST to “develop, and  revise as necessary, a checklist setting forth settings  and option selections that minimize the security risks  associated with each computer hardware or software  system that is, or is likely to become widely used  within the federal government.” In February 2008,  revised Part 39 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation  (FAR) was published. Paragraph (d) of section 39.101  states, “In acquiring information technology, agencies  shall include the appropriate IT security policies  and requirements, including use of common security  configurations available from the NIST website  at http://checklists.nist.gov. Agency contracting  officers should consult with the requiring official to  ensure the appropriate standards are incorporated.”  In Memorandum M08-22, Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) mandated the use of SCAP-validated  products for continuous monitoring of Federal Desktop  Core Configuration (FDCC) compliance. The NCP strives  to encourage and make simple agencies’ compliance  with these mandates.  The goals of the NCP are to:  ��Facilitate development and sharing of  checklists by providing a formal framework  for checklist developers to submit checklists  to NIST;  ��Provide guidance to developers to help them  create standardized, high-quality checklists  that conform to common operations  environments;  ��Help developers and users by providing  guidelines for making checklists better  documented and more usable;  ��Encourage software vendors and other  parties to develop checklists;  ��Provide a managed process for the review,  update, and maintenance of checklists;  ��Provide an easy-to-use repository of  checklists; and,  ��Encourage the use of automation  technologies for checklist application such  as SCAP.  There are 234 checklists posted on the website; 39 of  the checklists are SCAP-expressed (see section on SCAP  above) and can be used with SCAP-validated products.  It is anticipated that a minimum of several more  SCAP-expressed checklists will be added in FY2013 as  contributions come from other federal agencies and  product vendors. Organizations can use checklists  obtained from the NCP website (http://checklists.  nist.gov) for automated security configuration patch  assessment. NCP currently hosts SCAP checklists for  Internet Explorer 7.0, Internet Explorer 8.0, Microsoft  Office 2007, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Windows 7,  http:nist.gov http://checklists http:http://checklists.nist.gov mailto:stephen.quinn@nist.gov  67  Windows Vista, Windows XP, and other products.  To assist users in identifying automated checklist  content, NCP groups checklists into tiers, from Tier  I to Tier IV. NCP uses the tiers to rank checklists  according to their automation capability. Tier III and  IV checklists are considered production-ready and  have been validated by the SCAP content validation  tool as conforming to the requirements outlined in SP  800-126, The Technical Specification for the Security  Content Automation Protocol (SCAP). Tier IV checklists  are used in the SCAP Validation Program (see following  section for details) when validating SCAP products.  Tier III checklists are not presently used in the SCAP  Validation Program; however, Tier III checklists should  be compatible with SCAP-validated products. Tier II  checklists document recommended security settings  in a machine-readable, nonstandard format, such as a  proprietary format or a product-specific configuration  script. Tier I checklists are prose-based and contain  no machine-readable content. Users can browse the  checklists based on the checklist tier, IT product, IT  product category, or authority, and also through a  keyword search that searches the checklist name and  summary for userspecified terms. The search results  show the detailed checklist metadata and a link to any  SCAP content for the checklist, as well as links to any  supporting resources associated with the checklist.  To assist checklist developers, the NCP provides  both manual and automated interfaces to facilitate  submission and maintenance processes. The manual  interface consists of a web application that guides the  submitter through the data entry process to ensure  that all of the required information is submitted.  In addition, a web service is also available for a  fully automated submission. In either case, the  submission is validated upon review, and a report is  returned to the submitting organization, verifying  either acceptance or rejection based on the criteria  requirements. For instance, Tier III and Tier IV  checklists require validation using the SCAP Content  Validation Tool (this tool is available for download via  http://scap.nist.gov/revision/1.2/#tools).  The NCP is defined in SP 800-70 Revision 2, National  Checklist Program for IT Products—Guidelines for  Checklist Users and Developers, which can be found at  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/.  http://checklists.nist.gov  Contact:  Mr. Stephen Quinn  (301) 975-6967  stephen.quinn@nist.gov  Î Technical Security Metrics  Security Risk Analysis of Enterprise  Networks Using Attack Graphs  At present, computer networks constitute the core  component of information technology infrastructures  in areas such as power grids, financial data systems,  and emergency communication systems. Protection of  these networks from malicious intrusions is critical to  the economy and security of the nation. Vulnerabilities  are regularly discovered in software applications  which are exploited to stage cyber attacks. Currently,  management of security risk of an enterprise network  is more an art than a science. System administrators  operate by instinct and experience rather than relying  on objective metrics to guide and justify decision  making. The objective of this research is to develop  a standard model for measuring security of computer  networks. A standard model will enable us to answer  questions such as “Are we more secure now than  yesterday?” or “How does the security of one network  configuration compare with another one?” Also, having  a standard model to measure network security will  allow users, vendors, and researchers to evaluate  methodologies and products for network security in a  coherent and consistent manner.  The CSD has approached the challenge of network  security analysis by capturing vulnerability  interdependencies and measuring security in the exact  way that real attackers penetrate the network. CSD’s  methodology for security risk analysis is based on  the model of attack graphs. CSD analyzes all attack  paths through a network, providing a probabilistic  metric of the overall system risk. Through this metric,  CSD analyzes trade-offs between security costs and  security benefits.  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  http://scap.nist.gov/revision/1.2/#tools http://checklists.nist.gov mailto:stephen.quinn@nist.gov http://csrc.nist.gov/publications  68  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  In FY2012, CSD integrated techniques into an attack  graph-based security tool called MULVAL. CSD released  this as an open source system. CSD published a Springer  brief book “Quantitative Security Risk Assessment of  Enterprise Networks” on this topic.  CSD also developed a good model “K Zero Day  Safety” for measuring security risk of a network  against unknown vulnerabilities. CSD prepared a  paper “A Network Security Metric for Measuring and  Improving Computer Network Resistance to Unknown  Vulnerabilities.”  In FY2013, CSD plans to apply attack graphs to study  the effectiveness of moving target defense. CSD also  plans to publish the results as a NIST report and as  white papers in conferences and journals.  http://cs rc.nis t.g o v /g r o ups /S NS /s ecur ity-r is k- analysis-enterprise-networks/  Contact:  Dr. Anoop Singhal  (301) 975-4432  anoop.singhal@nist.gov  Using Attack Graphs in Forensic Examinations  Attack graphs are used to compute potential  attack paths from a system configuration and known  vulnerabilities of a system. Attack graphs can be used  to determine known vulnerability sequences that  were exploited to launch the attack and help forensic  examiners in identifying many potential attack paths.  After an attack happens, forensic analysis, including  linking evidence with attacks, helps further understand  and refine the attack scenario that was launched.  Given that there are anti-forensic tools that can  obfuscate, minimize, or eliminate attack footprints,  forensic analysis becomes harder. In this project, CSD  applied attack graphs to forensic analysis. CSD did so by  including anti-forensic capabilities into attack graphs,  so that the missing evidence can be explained by using  longer attack paths that erase potential evidence.  In FY2012, CSD published a paper, “Using Attack  Graphs in Forensic Examination,” in an IEEE Workshop  on Digital Forensics (WSDF 2012). In FY2013, CSD plans  to enhance this work by mapping Evidence Graphs to  Attack Graphs. CSD also plans to enhance an existing  attack graph generation tool to generate evidence  graphs for forensic examinations. CSD also plans to  publish the results as a NIST report and as papers in  conferences and journals.  Contact:  Dr. Anoop Singhal  (301) 975-4432  anoop.singhal@nist.gov  Î Automated Combinatorial Testing  Software developers often encounter failures that  result from an unexpected interaction between  components. NIST research has shown that most  failures are triggered by one or two parameters, and  progressively fewer by three, four, or more parameters  (see graph on page 69), a relationship that is called  the interaction rule. These results have important  implications for testing. If all faults in a system can be  triggered by a combination of n or fewer parameters,  then testing all n-way combinations of parameters can  provide very strong fault detection efficiency. These  methods are being applied to software and hardware  testing for reliability, safety, and security. CSD’s focus  is on empirical results and real-world problems.  Project highlights for FY2012 included demonstration  of 95 percent reduction in test volume with equivalent  fault detection for interoperability of Internet web  browser software; completion of the first textbook  on combinatorial testing; cooperative work with the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)  Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) Facility  demonstrating the effectiveness of combinatorial  methods for IV&V of space systems; lectures at  conferences and research labs; and leading (jointly  with IBM personnel) the IEEE First International  Conference on Combinatorial Testing, held with the  International Conference on Software Testing.  Tech transfer activities included publication of six  technical papers; release of enhanced covering array,  test prioritization, and fault location tools; plus  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/security-risk-analysis-enterprise-networks/ http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/security-risk-analysis-enterprise-networks/ mailto:anoop.singhal@nist.gov mailto:anoop.singhal@nist.gov  69  seminars and lectures at Carnegie Mellon University,  NASA, Loyola College, information technology  companies, Indian Institute of Technology, and several  conferences.  trustworthiness of the security mechanisms that rely  upon those components. Stronger security assurances  may be possible by grounding security mechanisms in  roots of trust.  Roots of trust are highly reliable and secure  hardware, firmware, and software components that  C um  ul at  iv e  p er  ce nt  o f  so ft  w ar  e  fa  ilu re  s  100  90  80  70  60  50  40  30  20  10  0  Medical  Devices  Browser  Server  NASA  Network  Security  1 2 3 4 5 6  Interactions  (Kuhn, Wallace, Gallo, 2004)  Plans for FY2013 include a new project with the NASA  Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) Facility  perform specific, critical security functions. Because  roots of trust are inherently trusted, they must be  secure by their design. As such, many roots of trust  are implemented in hardware so that malware cannot  tamper with the functions they provide. Roots of trust  provide a firm foundation from which to build security  and trust in a system.  NIST’s past work on roots of trust has focused on  their use to protect fundamental system firmware,  commonly known as the Basic Input/Output System  (BIOS). NIST has been working with industry on the  use of roots of trust to improve the security of BIOS.  In FY2011, NIST issued SP 800-147, BIOS Protection  to apply combinatorial coverage measurement methods Guidelines, which provides guidelines on protecting  to NASA spacecraft software, following a successful  BIOS in laptop and desktop computers. NIST extended  pilot study in 2012; development of new methods and  these guidelines in FY2012 to cover server-class  tools for fault location; lectures at conferences and systems, and released draft NIST SP 800-147B, BIOS  research labs; and significant enhancement of software  tools for combinatorial coverage measurement, jointly  with Centro Nacional de Metrología, the national  metrology institute of Mexico.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/acts/  Contacts:  Mr. Rick Kuhn Dr. Raghu Kacker  (301) 975-3337 (301) 975-2109  kuhn@nist.gov raghu.kacker@nist.gov  Î Hardware Roots of Trust  Modern computing devices consist of various  hardware, firmware, and software components at  multiple layers of abstraction. Many security and  protection mechanisms are currently rooted in  software that, along with all underlying components,  must be trusted and uncorrupted. A vulnerability  in any of those components could compromise the  Protection Guidelines for Servers, for public comment.  NIST is also developing guidelines on the use of roots of  trust to detect unauthorized changes to BIOS and BIOS  configuration settings. In FY2012, NIST released draft  SP 800-155, BIOS Integrity Measurement Guidelines,  which provides guidelines on mechanisms that measure  and report the state of BIOS.  NIST will continue its efforts to secure BIOS and other  critical firmware in FY2013. CSD will finalize the BIOS  protection and measurement guidelines (i.e., SP 800- 147B and SP 800-155), and will develop new guidelines  for protection of firmware in computer add-on cards.  Future efforts will explore methods to extend trust in  the security of BIOS to provide greater assurance of  the security of the operating system and applications.  A new focus area for NIST’s roots of trust research  will be in mobile devices. For the past year, NIST has  been working with government and industry partners  on guidelines for hardware-rooted security features in  mobile devices. These guidelines will focus on device  integrity, isolation, and protected storage features  Computer Security Division’s Programs and Projects for FY 2012  mailto:raghu.kacker@nist.gov mailto:kuhn@nist.gov http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/acts  70  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  that are supported by roots of trust.

Contact:  Mr. Andrew Regenscheid  (301) 975-5155  andrew.regenscheid@nist.gov  Î Continuous Monitoring Reference  Model  In September 2010, the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS) released the Continuous Asset  Evaluation, Situational Awareness and Risk Scoring  (CAESARS) Reference Architecture Report. This report  identifies commonality and strengths in the custom  approaches used by civilian agencies to provide  solutions that enable the continuous monitoring of IT  systems. This report identifies “essential functional  components of a security risk scoring system,  independent of specific technologies, products, or  vendors.” It describes the use of security automation  specifications, such as the Security Content Automation  Protocol (SCAP), to enable continuous monitoring  solutions.  In October 2010, the Federal Chief Information  Officer Council’s Information Security and Identity  Management Committee’s (ISIMC) subcommittee  on Continuous Monitoring and Risk Scoring saw the  need to create a technical initiative to expand upon  the CAESARS architecture to better scale it to large  enterprises (e.g., the entire U.S. government). A team  of researchers from the National Security Agency’s  (NSA) Information Assurance Directorate (IAD), the  DHS Federal Network Security CAESARS team, and  NIST’s Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) worked  together to respond to this need. The draft CAESARS  Framework Extension (FE) described by the NIST  Interagency Report (NISTIR) 7756, CAESARS Framework  Extension: An Enterprise Continuous Monitoring  Technical Reference Architecture, is the output of  this collaboration.  This report presents an enterprise continuous  monitoring technical reference architecture that  extends the framework provided by the DHS’s  CAESARS architecture. The primary goal of this effort  is to facilitate enterprise continuous monitoring by  presenting a reference architecture that enables  organizations to aggregate collected data from across  a diverse set of security tools, analyze that data,  perform scoring, enable user queries, and provide  overall situational awareness. In support of this goal,  the CAESARS-FE reference architecture describes  additional functionality, provides more granularity  within subsystem specifications, and further leverages  security automation efforts. The model design is  focused on enabling organizations to realize this  capability by leveraging their existing security tools  based on the use of open, consensus-based standards,  to avoid complicated and resource-intensive custom  tool integration efforts.  The data exchange and functional requirements in  CAESARS-FE and referenced specifications provide  organizations with much of the information needed  to bring together diverse security products, and use  those products to compose a hierarchical data  aggregation model that supports a large variety  of continuous monitoring consumers from both  the security disciplines and general information  technology (IT) management domains. CAESARS-FE  minimally defines the required functionality so that  security tool vendors can cost-effectively participate,  while ensuring a necessary level of interoperability  between vendor products.  To advance the state of the art in continuous  monitoring capabilities and to further interoperability  within commercially available tools, CSD is working  within the international standards development  community to establish working groups and to author  and comment on emerging technical standards in  this area. The CAESARS-FE reference architecture is  expected to evolve as greater consensus is developed  around interoperable, standards-based approaches  that enable continuous monitoring of IT systems.

In federated environments,  credential revocation has traditionally been managed  by the credential issuer. In an effort to improve  credential revocation mechanisms across federations  and effectively mitigate credential misuse, NIST  researchers are exploring the broader scope of  credential revocation, where all parties contribute  to and participate in credential revocation. In this  model, service providers give feedback on a credential  reliability score based on detected credential misuse.  The credential holder and Identity Provider, on the  other hand, receive feedback notifications and are  able to immediately suspend or revoke the credential  should the score reach an unacceptable level. Lastly,  other federation services can consult scores and status  to determine the suitability of a presented credential  with an associated reliability score.  In FY2012, NIST scientists published an initial  draft NISTIR 7817 titled A Credential Reliability  and Revocation Model that describes and classifies  the different types of identity providers serving  federations. For each classification, the document  identifies perceived improvements or gaps when the  credentials are used in authentication services and  recommends countermeasures to eliminate some of  the identified gaps. With the countermeasures as the  basis, the document suggests a Universal Credential  Reliability and Revocation Services (URRS) model  that strives to improve authentication services for  federations where all parties contribute to and  participate in credential revocation and where the  service can be tailored to the type of (classification  of) identity providers it accommodates.  After the public comment period, NISTIR 7817 was  further revised to accommodate the comments and  final approval is anticipated in FY2013.

Abstracts for Publications Released in  FY2012  Î Federal Information Processing  Standards (FIPS)  Draft FIPS 201-2, Personal Identity Verification  (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors  This standard specifies the architecture and technical  requirements for a common identification standard  for federal employees and contractors. The overall  goal is to achieve appropriate security assurance  for multiple applications by efficiently verifying the  claimed identity of individuals seeking physical access  to federally controlled government facilities and  electronic access to government information systems.  The standard contains the minimum requirements for  a federal personal identity verification system that  meets the control and security objectives of Homeland  Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), including  identity proofing, registration, and issuance. The  standard also provides detailed specifications that will  support technical interoperability among PIV systems  of federal departments and agencies. It describes the  card elements, system interfaces, and security controls  required to securely store, process, and retrieve  identity credentials from the card. The physical card  characteristics, storage media, and data elements  that make up identity credentials are specified in this  standard.  Other requirements of draft FIPS 201-2 are specified  in the following Special Publications (SPs):  ��SP 800-73, Interfaces for Personal Identity  Verification (interfaces and card architecture  for storing and retrieving identity credentials  from a smart card);  ��SP 800-76, Biometric Data Specification for  Personal Identity Verification (interfaces  and data formats of biometric information);  ��SP 800-78, Cryptographic Algorithms and  Key Sizes for Personal Identity Verification  (requirements for cryptographic algorithms);  ��SP 800-79, Guidelines for the Accreditation  of Personal Identity Verification Card Issuers  (requirements for the accreditation of the  PIV Card issuers);  ��SP 800-87, Codes for the Identification of  Federal and Federally-Assisted Organizations  (unique organizational codes for federal  agencies);  ��SP 800-96, PIV Card to Reader Interoperability  Guidelines (requirements for card readers);  ��SP 800-156, Representation of PIV Chain- of-Trust for Import and Export (format for  encoding the chain-of-trust for import and  export); and  ��SP 800-157, Guidelines for Personal Identity  Verification (PIV) Derived Credentials  (requirements for issuing PIV derived  credentials).  2012 Publications Released and Abstracts  75  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsITLSB.html  76  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 2012  Draft FIPS 201-2 does not specify access control  policies or requirements for federal departments and  agencies.  Contacts:  Ms. Hildegard Ferraiolo Mr. David Cooper  hildegard.ferraiolo@nist.gov david.cooper@nist.gov  Draft FIPS 186-3, Proposed Change Notice  for Digital Signature Standard (DSS)  FIPS 186-3, Digital Signature Standard (DSS), specifies  three techniques for the generation and verification of  digital signatures that can be used for the protection  of data: the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA), the  Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA),  and the Rivest-Shamir-Adelman (RSA) algorithm. FIPS  186-3 is used in conjunction with the hash functions  specified in FIPS 180-4, Secure Hash Standard (SHS).  The following revisions to FIPS 186-3 are proposed:  (1) The Use of Random Bit/Number Generators;  (2) Definition Clarification; and  (3) The Reuse of a Prime Number Generation  Seed for RSA Key Pair Generation.  This standard specifies a suite of algorithms that can be  used to generate a digital signature. Digital signatures  are used to detect unauthorized modifications to data  and to authenticate the identity of the signatory. In  addition, the recipient of signed data can use a digital  signature as evidence in demonstrating to a third  party that the signature was, in fact, generated by the  claimed signatory. This is known as non-repudiation,  since the signatory cannot easily repudiate the  signature at a later time.  Contact:  Ms. Elaine Barker  elaine.barker@nist.gov  FIPS 180-4, Secure Hash Standard (SHS)  This standard specifies hash algorithms that can be  used to generate digests of messages. The digests are  used to detect whether messages have been changed  since the digests were generated.

Conformance testing provides developers,  users, and purchasers with increased levels of  confidence in product quality and increases the  probability of successful interoperability. NIST’s  Information Technology Laboratory sponsored the  development of a conformance testing methodology  for ANSI/NIST-ITL 2011, Data Format for the Interchange  of Fingerprint, Facial & Other Biometric Information  (AN-2011) under the NIST/ITL Conformance Testing  Methodology Working Group. This testing methodology  supports the development of conformance test  tools designed to test implementations of AN-2011  transactions and promotes biometrics conformity  assessment efforts. The first release includes  comprehensive tables of AN-2011 requirements and  test assertions for a set of supported AN-2011 Record  Types. The tables of requirements and assertions  indicate which assertions apply to the traditional  encoding format, the National Information Exchange  Model (NIEM)-compliant encoding format, or both  encoding formats. The testing methodology makes use  of specific test assertion syntax to clearly define the  assertions associated with each requirement.

Unauthorized modification of BIOS  firmware constitutes a significant threat because of  the BIOS’s unique and privileged position within the PC  architecture. The document focuses on two scenarios:  detecting changes to the system BIOS code stored on  the system flash, and detecting changes to the system  BIOS configuration. The document is intended for  hardware and software vendors that develop products  that can support secure BIOS integrity measurement  mechanisms, and may also be of use for organizations  developing enterprise procurement or deployment  strategies for these technologies.  Contact:  Mr. Andrew Regenscheid  andrew.regenscheid@nist.gov  SP 800-153, Guidelines for Securing Wireless  Local Area Networks (WLANs)  A wireless local area network (WLAN) is a group of  wireless networking devices within a limited geographic  area, such as an office building, that exchange data  through radio communications. The security of each  WLAN is heavily dependent on how well each WLAN  component—including client devices, access points  (APs), and wireless switches—is secured throughout  the WLAN life cycle, from initial WLAN design and  deployment through ongoing maintenance and  monitoring. The purpose of this publication is to help  organizations improve their WLAN security by providing  recommendations for WLAN security configuration and  monitoring. This publication supplements other NIST  publications by consolidating and strengthening their  key recommendations.  Contact:  Mr. Murugiah Souppaya  murugiah.souppaya@nist.gov  Draft SP 800-152, A Profile for U.S. Federal  Cryptographic Key Management Systems (CKMS)  This publication is being developed for use by  federal agencies and contractors when designing,  implementing, procuring, installing, configuring,  and operating a CKMS. This Profile will be based on  (draft) Special Publication 800-130, A Framework for  Designing Cryptographic Key Management Systems.  The framework covers topics that should be considered  by a product or system designer when designing a  CKMS and specifies requirements for the design and  its documentation. The Profile, however, will cover  not only a CKMS design, but also its procurement,  installation, management, and operation throughout  its lifetime. Requirements will, therefore, be placed  not only on a CKMS product or system, but also on  people (procurement officials, installers, managers,  and operators) while performing specific tasks involving  the CKMS.  Contact:  Ms. Elaine Barker  elaine.barker@nist.gov  Draft SP 800-147B, BIOS Protection  Guidelines for Servers  Modern computers rely on fundamental system  firmware, commonly known as the system Basic Input/  Output System (BIOS), to facilitate the hardware  initialization process and transition control to the  operating system. Unauthorized modification of BIOS  firmware by malicious software constitutes a significant  threat because of the BIOS’s unique and privileged  position within the PC architecture. The guidelines  in this document include requirements on servers to  mitigate the execution of malicious or corrupt BIOS  code. They apply to BIOS firmware stored in the BIOS  flash, including the BIOS code, the cryptographic keys  that are part of the root of trust for update, and  static BIOS data. This guide is intended to provide  server platform vendors with recommendations and  guidelines for a secure BIOS update process.

Cloud computing has been the  subject of a great deal of commentary. Attempts to  describe cloud computing in general terms, however,  have been problematic because cloud computing  is not a single kind of system, but instead spans a  spectrum of underlying technologies, configuration  possibilities, service models, and deployment models.  This document describes cloud systems and discusses  their strengths and weaknesses.  Contacts:  Mr. Mark Lee Badger Mr. Tim Grance  mark.badger@nist.gov grance@nist.gov  Mr. Jeff Voas  jeff.voas@nist.gov  SP 800-144, Guidelines on Security and  Privacy in Public Cloud Computing  Cloud computing can and does mean different things  to different people. The common characteristics  most interpretations share are on-demand scalability  of highly available and reliable pooled computing  resources, secure access to metered services from  nearly anywhere, and displacement of data and  services from inside to outside the organization. While  aspects of these characteristics have been realized  to a certain extent, cloud computing remains a work  in progress. This publication provides an overview  of the security and privacy challenges pertinent to  public cloud computing and points out considerations  organizations should take when outsourcing data,  applications, and infrastructure to a public cloud  environment.  Contact:  Mr. Tim Grance  grance@nist.gov  SP 800-135 Rev. 1, Recommendation  for Existing Application-Specific Key  Derivation Functions  Cryptographic keys are vital to the security of Internet  security applications and protocols. Many widely used  Internet security protocols have their own application- specific Key Derivation Functions (KDFs) that are  used to generate the cryptographic keys required for  their cryptographic functions. This recommendation  provides security requirements for those KDFs.  Contact:  Mr. Quynh Dang  quynh.dang@nist.gov  Draft SP 800-130, A Framework for Designing  Cryptographic Key Management Systems  This Framework for Designing Cryptographic Key  Management Systems (CKMS) contains topics that should  be considered by a CKMS designer when developing a  CKMS design specification. For each topic, there are  one or more documentation requirements that need  to be addressed by the design specification. Thus, any  CKMS that adequately addresses these requirements  would have a design specification that is compliant  with this Framework.  Contact:  Ms. Elaine Barker  elaine.barker@nist.gov  Draft SP 800-124 Rev. 1, Guidelines  for Managing and Securing Mobile  Devices in the Enterprise  Mobile devices, such as smart phones and tablets,  typically need to support multiple security objectives:  confidentiality, integrity, and availability. To achieve  these objectives, mobile devices should be secured  against a variety of threats. The purpose of this  publication is to help organizations centrally manage  and secure mobile devices. Laptops are out of the  scope of this publication, as are mobile devices with  minimal computing capability, such as basic cell  mailto:elaine.barker@nist.gov mailto:quynh.dang@nist.gov mailto:grance@nist.gov  79  phones. This publication provides recommendations  for selecting, implementing, and using centralized  management technologies, and it explains the  security concerns inherent in mobile device use  and provides recommendations for securing mobile  devices throughout their life cycles. The scope of  this publication includes securing both organization- provided and personally owned (bring your own device)  mobile devices.

Contact:  Mr. Murugiah Souppaya  murugiah.souppaya@nist.gov  Draft SP 800-76-2, Biometric Data Specification  for Personal Identity Verification  Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD-12)  called for new standards to be adopted governing  interoperable use of identity credentials to allow  physical and logical access to federal government  locations and systems. The Personal Identity  Verification (PIV) standard for Federal Employees  and Contractors, FIPS 201, was developed to define  procedures and specifications for issuance and use of  an interoperable identity credential. This document  is a companion document to FIPS 201 and describes  technical acquisition and formatting specifications  for the PIV system, including the PIV Card itself. It  also establishes minimum accuracy specifications  for deployed biometric authentication processes.  The approach is to enumerate procedures and  formats for collection and preparation of fingerprint,  iris and facial data, and to restrict values and  practices included generically in published biometric  standards. The primary design objective behind  these particular specifications is high performance  and universal interoperability. The addition of iris  and face specifications in the 2012 edition adds an  alternative modality for biometric authentication and  extends coverage to persons for whom fingerprinting  is problematic. The addition of on-card comparison  offers an alternative to PIN-mediated card activation  as well as an additional authentication method. For the  preparation of biometric data suitable for the Federal  Bureau of Investigation (FBI) background check, SP  800-76 references FBI documentation, including the  ANSI/NIST Fingerprint Standard and the Electronic  Fingerprint Transmission Specification. This document  does not preclude use of other biometric modalities in  conjunction with the PIV card.

When implemented in an SP 800- 38 series-compliant mode of operation and in a FIPS  140-2-compliant cryptographic module, TDEA may  be used by federal organizations to protect sensitive  unclassified data. Protection of data during transmission  or while in storage may be necessary to maintain  the confidentiality and integrity of the information  represented by the data. This publication defines the  mathematical steps required to cryptographically  protect data using TDEA and to subsequently process  such protected data. TDEA is made available for use  by federal agencies within the context of a total  security program consisting of physical security  procedures, good information management practices,  and computer system/network access controls.

Patches correct security and functionality  problems in software and firmware. There are several  challenges that complicate patch management. If  organizations do not overcome these challenges,  they will be unable to patch systems effectively and  efficiently, leading to easily preventable compromises.  This publication is designed to assist organizations  in understanding the basics of enterprise patch  management technologies. It explains the importance  of patch management and examines the challenges  inherent in performing patch management. It  provides an overview of enterprise patch management  technologies, and it also briefly discusses metrics for  measuring the technologies’ effectiveness and for  comparing the relative importance of patches.

AC is concerned with determining the  allowed activities of legitimate users, mediating every  attempt by a user to access a resource in the system.  AC systems come with a wide variety of features and  administrative capabilities, and their operational  impact can be significant. In particular, this impact  can pertain to administrative and user productivity,  as well as to the organization’s ability to perform its  mission. Therefore, it is reasonable to use quality  metrics to verify the mechanical properties of AC  systems. This document discusses the administration,  enforcement, performance, and support properties of  AC mechanisms that are embedded in each AC system.  Because of the rigorous nature of the metrics and the  knowledge needed to gather them, these metrics are  intended to be used by AC experts who are evaluating  the highest-security AC systems.

A software feature is a functional  capability provided by software. A software feature  misuse vulnerability is a vulnerability in which the  feature also provides an avenue to compromise the  security of a system. Such vulnerabilities are present  when the trust assumptions made when designing  software features can be abused in ways that violate  security. Misuse vulnerabilities allow attackers to use  mailto:david.cooper@nist.gov mailto:vhu@nist.gov mailto:dylan.yaga@nist.gov mailto:fernando.podio@nist.gov  85  for malicious purposes the functionality that  was intended to be beneficial. CMSS can provide  measurement data to assist organizations in making  sound decisions on addressing software feature  misuse vulnerabilities and in conducting quantitative  assessments of the overall security posture of a system.  This report defines proposed measures for CMSS and  equations to be used to combine the measures into  severity scores for each vulnerability. The report also  provides examples of how CMSS measures and scores  would be determined for selected software feature  misuse vulnerabilities.  Contact:  Mr. Peter Mell  mell@nist.gov  Draft NISTIR 7848, Specification for the Asset  Summary Reporting Format 1.0  This specification defines the Asset Summary Reporting  (ASR) format version 1.0, a data model for expressing  the data exchange format of summary information  relative to one or more metrics. ASR reduces the  bandwidth requirement to report information about  assets in the aggregate since it allows for reporting  aggregates relative to metrics, as opposed to reporting  data about each individual asset, which can lead to  a bloated data exchange. ASR is vendor-neutral and  leverages widely adopted, open specifications; it is  flexible, and suited for a wide variety of reporting  applications.

CRE is part  of a suite of enterprise remediation specifications  that enable automation and enhanced correlation  of enterprise remediation activities. Each CRE entry  represents a unique remediation activity and is  assigned a globally unique CRE identifier (CRE-ID). This  specification describes the core concepts of CRE, the  technical components of a CRE entry, outlines how  CRE entries are created, the technical requirements  for constructing a CRE-ID, and how CRE-IDs may  be assigned. CRE-IDs are intended to be boundary  objects that are broadly useable in enterprise security  management products and information domains that  participate in remediation activities or make assertions  about remediation actions.

With the diverse set of technologies, and  the unique business requirements for organizations  to federate, there is no uniform approach to the  federation process. Similarly, there is no uniform  method to revoke credentials or their associated  attribute(s) in a federated community. In the absence  of a uniform revocation method, this document seeks  to investigate credential and attribute revocation with  a particular focus on identifying missing requirements  for credential and attribute revocation. This document  first introduces and analysis the different types of  digital credentials and recommends missing revocation- related requirements for each model in a federated  environment. As a second goal, and as by-product of  the analysis and recommendations, this paper suggests  a credential reliability and revocation service that  serves to eliminate the missing requirements and  involves all the entities of the federation.

The primary goal of the NIST’s Computer  Security Division (CSD) is to provide standards and  technology that protects information systems against  threats to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability  of information and services. During Fiscal Year 2011  (FY2011), CSD successfully responded to numerous  challenges and opportunities in fulfilling that mission.  Through CSD’s diverse research agenda and engagement  in many national priority initiatives, high-quality,  cost-effective security and privacy mechanisms were  developed and applied that improved information  security across the federal government and the greater  information security community. This annual report  highlights the research agenda and activities in which  CSD was engaged during FY2011.

It focuses on the Asset Management, Configuration,  and Vulnerability data domains. It leverages the  Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) version  1.2 for configuration and vulnerability scan content,  and it dictates reporting results in an SCAP-compliant  format. This specification describes an overview of  the approach to each of the three domains, how they  bind to specific communication protocols, and how  those protocols interact. It then defines the specific  requirements levied upon the various capabilities  of the subsystems defined in draft NISTIR 7799 that  enable each data domain.  Contacts:  Mr. David Waltermire Mr. Peter Mell  david.waltermire@nist.gov mell@nist.gov  Draft NISTIR 7799, Continuous Monitoring  Reference Model Workflow, Subsystem,  and Interface Specifications  This publication provides the technical specifications  for the continuous monitoring (CM) reference model  presented in draft NISTIR 7756, CAESARS Framework  Extension: An Enterprise Continuous Monitoring  Technical Reference Architecture. These specifications  mailto:mell@nist.gov mailto:david.waltermire@nist.gov mailto:kevin.stine@nist.gov mailto:patrick.oreilly@nist.gov mailto:hildegard.ferraiolo@nist.gov  87  enable multi-instance CM implementations,  hierarchical tiers, multi-instance dynamic querying,  sensor tasking, propagation of policy, policy  monitoring, and policy compliance reporting. A  major focus of the specifications is on workflows that  describe the coordinated operation of all subsystems  and components within the model. Another focus  is on subsystem specifications that enable each  subsystem to play its role within the workflows. The  final focus is on interface specifications that supply  communication paths between subsystems. These  three sets of specifications (workflows, subsystems,  and interfaces) are written to be data domain- agnostic, which means that they can be used for CM  regardless of the data domain that is being monitored.  A companion publication, draft NIST IR 7800, Applying  the Continuous Monitoring Technical Reference  Model to the Asset, Configuration, and Vulnerability  Management Domains, binds these specifications to  specific data domains (e.g., asset, configuration,  and vulnerability management). The specifications  provided in this document are detailed enough to  enable product instrumentation and development.  They are also detailed enough to enable product  testing, validation, procurement, and interoperability.  Taken together, the specifications in this document  define an ecosystem where a variety of interoperable  products can be composed together to form effective  CM solutions. If properly adopted, these specifications  will enable teamwork, orchestration, and coordination  among CM products that currently operate distinctly.  For the computer security domain, this will greatly  enhance organizational effectiveness and efficiency in  addressing known vulnerabilities and technical policy  requirements, and decision making.  Contacts:  Mr. David Waltermire Mr. Peter Mell  david.waltermire@nist.gov mell@nist.gov  Draft NISTIR 7756, CAESARS Framework  Extension: An Enterprise Continuous Monitoring  Technical Reference Architecture  This publication and its supporting documents  present an enterprise continuous monitoring  technical reference model that extends the  framework provided by the DHS Federal Network  Security CAESARS architecture. This extension  enables added functionality, defines each subsystem  in more detail, and further leverages security  automation standards. It also extends CAESARS to  allow for large implementations that need a multi-tier  architecture and focuses on the necessary inter-tier  communications. The goal of this document is  to facilitate enterprise continuous monitoring  by presenting a reference model that enables  organizations to aggregate collected data from  across a diverse set of security tools, analyze that  data, perform scoring, enable user queries, and  provide overall situational awareness. The model  design is focused on enabling organizations to realize  this capability by leveraging their existing security  tools and thus avoiding complicated and resource- intensive custom tool integration efforts.

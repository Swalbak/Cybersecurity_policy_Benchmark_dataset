This report covers the incidents that occurred in 2016 and it gives an aggregated analysis of the incident reports  about severe outages across the EU. This report does not include details about individual countries or providers.  The aim of the incident reporting scheme is to provide transparency to society and to learn from past incidents in  the electronic communications sector in order to systematically improve the security of the networks and services.  This report provides an overview on an aggregated level of what services and network assets are impacted and the  root causes of the incidents. Conclusions on the main patterns of incidents are drawn, contributing to discussions at  policy level on strategic measures to improve the security in the electronic communications sector.  The main conclusions from this year’s incident reporting are the following:   158 major incidents reported: This year 24 countries, including two EFTA countries, reported 158 significant  incidents that occurred in 2016, while 6 countries reported they had no significant incidents. 102 incidents  were above the informal EU thresholds.   Mobile internet most affected service: In 2016 most incidents affected mobile internet (48% of all reported  incidents). Mobile internet and mobile telephony were the predominant affected services in the previous  years also, except for 2014 where fixed telephony was the most affected.   System failures are the dominant root cause of incidents: Most incidents were caused by system failures  or technical failures (almost 73% of the incidents) as a root cause. This has been the dominant root cause  for all the reporting years so far. In the system failures root category, software bugs and hardware failures  were the most common causes affecting core network equipment.   System failures affected on average more user connections per incident: In 2016 system failures was the  root cause category involving most users affected per incident (around 2 million user connections on average  per incident). The second place was taken by malicious actions with 1.2 million user connections on average  per incident.   Malicious actions along with natural phenomena are not among the main root causes creating disruptions:  the total number of incidents caused by malicious actions was 5.1%; double compared to previous year  (2.5% in 2015).   Malware caused the longest lasting incidents this year: Incidents caused by malware, although there were  not too many of them, had most impact in terms of duration and user hours lost.   Emergency services are affected by incidents: Same as last year, 20 % of the incidents affected the 112  emergency services, a considerably high percentage.   Mobile base stations and controllers the most affected assets: Overall, mobile base stations and controllers  and mobile switches were the network components most affected by incidents (7% and 6% respectively).  The analysis of annual incident reports the last six years has revealed specific trends and patterns of root causes,  detailed causes and affected services. These assets and threats need particular attention when carrying out risk and  vulnerability assessments in the electronic communications sector.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  05  ENISA is permanently analysing the current threat environment and develops projects that address particular  technical or policy related topics directly linked to the electronic communications sector. In the context of Article13a  efforts, ENISA has been conducting many supporting activities in order to provide a holistic and in-depth view to  providers that need to assess risks, take appropriate security measures, and report about significant security  incidents.  Based on the annual summary reporting of previous years, ENISA analysed power supply dependencies1, and issued  recommendations regarding the sector’s ability to withstand and act efficiently after power cuts. ENISA also studied  in 2013 national roaming for increased resilience in mobile networks2. Last year, based on the annual summary  reporting of 2012 and 2013 incidents, ENISA has issued recommendations for providers3 about how to manage  security requirements for vendors of ICT equipment and outsourced services used for core operations. Based on the  2012 and 2013 summary reporting ENISA has also studied national initiatives to reduce the number of underground  cable breaks caused by mistakes4.  ENISA has developed studies in order to facilitate NRAs as well as telco providers to incorporate these  recommendations to their security activities. Recently developed a study on security measures implemented by  electronic communication providers5, and alternative indicators for measuring impact in electronic communications  services6.  Furthermore, in 2015, ENISA developed an impact evaluation of the Art. 13a provisions7, with the purpose of  assessing the changes in outcome that can directly be attributed to the article, the effects caused by this particular  set of obligations within the Telecom Package.  1 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/power-supply-dependencies/  2 See http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/using-national-roaming-to-mitigate-mobile-network-outages201d- new-report-by-eu-cyber-security-agency-enisa  3 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/requirements-ecomms-vendors  4 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/protection-of-underground- infrastructure  5 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-measures  6 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-incidents-indicators  7 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/impact-evaluation-article13a  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/power-supply-dependencies/ http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/using-national-roaming-to-mitigate-mobile-network-outages201d-new-report-by-eu-cyber-security-agency-enisa http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/using-national-roaming-to-mitigate-mobile-network-outages201d-new-report-by-eu-cyber-security-agency-enisa https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/requirements-ecomms-vendors https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/protection-of-underground-infrastructure https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/protection-of-underground-infrastructure https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-measures https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-incidents-indicators https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/impact-evaluation-article13a  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  06  1. Introduction  The current document represents  the sixth iteration of the report “Annual Incident Reports”, which summarises  significant outage incidents in the telecom sector reported to ENISA and the European Commission (EC), under  Article 13a of the Framework Directive (2009/140/EC)8, an article introduced in the 2009 reform of the EU regulatory  framework for electronic communications9. This year ENISA and EC received 158 incident reports from NRAs, about  severe outages in the EU’s electronic communication networks and/or services which occurred in 2016. This report  provides an aggregate analysis of these 158 incidents.  Please note that in this document we do not provide details from the individual incident reports. The analysis is only  an aggregation in terms of averages and percentages across the EU and EFTA countries, and it does not contain  references to specific countries or specific providers. Individual incidents are discussed in more detail with the NRAs  in the Article 13a Expert Group10.  This document is structured as follows: Section 2 and Section 3 briefly summarize Article 13a and the details of the  technical implementation of Article 13a, as agreed in the Article 13a Expert Group by the different NRAs of the EU  Member States. Section 4 analyses the incidents from 2016 which were reported to ENISA and the Commission and  provides examples of incidents. Section 5 provides the conclusions.  In the separate document of Annex (Annexes A-D) we show graphs with the trend over the years to allow for the  reader to make a comparison with data from previous years. This comparison should however be done with caution,  as the methodology for details in the reporting has been improved over the years and the thresholds have been  lowered year by year allowing for more incidents to be reported.  8 See http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT  9  See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/Copy of Regulatory Framework for Electonic  Communications 2013 NO CROPS.pdf  10 See http://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/Copy%20of%20Regulatory%20Framework%20for%20Electonic%20Communications%202013%20NO%20CROPS.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/Copy%20of%20Regulatory%20Framework%20for%20Electonic%20Communications%202013%20NO%20CROPS.pdf http://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  07  2. Article 13a of the Framework Directive: ‘Security and Integrity’  The reform of the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications9, which was adopted in 2009 and was  transposed by most EU countries around May 2011, added Article 13a to the Framework Directive8. Article 13a  addresses the security and integrity11 of public electronic communications networks and services. The legislation  concerns National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) and providers of public electronic communications networks and  services (providers).  Article 13a states:   Providers of public electronic communications networks and services should take measures to guarantee  security and integrity of their networks.   Providers must notify competent national authorities about breaches of security or loss of integrity that have  had significant impact on the operation of networks or services.   National Regulatory Authorities should notify ENISA and national authorities abroad when necessary, for  example in case of incidents with cross-border impact.   Annually, National Regulatory Authorities should submit a summary report to ENISA and the European  Commission about the incidents.  These incident reporting flows (incident notification and annual reporting) are shown in the diagram below. This  document analyses the incidents from 2015 that have been reported to ENISA (the black dashed arrow).

A public consultation concerning the evaluation and review of the current regulatory framework was  ended in December 2015. In this context, ENISA along with the Article 13a Expert Group submitted an opinion on  11 Here integrity means network integrity, which is often called availability or continuity in information security literature.  12https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/public-consultation-evaluation-and-review-regulatory-framework- electronic-communications  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/public-consultation-evaluation-and-review-regulatory-framework-electronic-communications https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/public-consultation-evaluation-and-review-regulatory-framework-electronic-communications  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  08  the evaluation and review of Article 13a and 13b of the Framework Directive, an area which is at the core of ENISA  expertise and competence.  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  09  3. Article 13a Expert Group and Incident Reporting Procedure  In 2010, ENISA, Ministries and NRAs initiated a series of meetings (workshops, conference calls) to achieve a  harmonised implementation of Article 13a of the Framework directive. In these meetings, a group of experts from  NRAs, called the Article 13a Expert Group, reached agreement on two non-binding technical documents providing  guidance to the NRAs in the EU Member States:   Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting13   Technical Guideline on Security Measures14  Later on, in 2014, the group of experts agreed on the third non-binding technical document:   Technical Guideline on Threats and Assets15  The Article 13a Expert Group continues to meet several times a year to develop the technical guidelines and to  discuss the implementation of Article 13a (for example, on how to supervise the electronic communications sector)  and to share knowledge and exchange views about past incidents, and how to address them.  Incident reporting procedure  In spring 2012, the EC agreed with the EU Member States (in meetings of the Communications Committee, COCOM)  to do the first round of annual summary reporting on the 2011 incidents impacting the continuity of supply of  electronic communications services. The decision included a recommendation to use the reporting template agreed  within the Article 13a Expert Group and published by ENISA.  Following the COCOM meeting, ENISA implemented  the technical procedure by deploying a basic electronic form based on the Article 13a Technical Guideline on Incident  Reporting. There was also an agreement that in the coming years, annual reporting would be carried out by the end  of February each year.  In autumn 2012, ENISA developed an online incident reporting tool (called CIRAS), which replaces the electronic  forms exchanged by email. CIRAS allows NRAs to exert greater control over the data reported and provides the NRAs  with better access to data about incidents reported across the EU. Since 2015 ENISA is providing the possibility for  the NRAs to extract graphs from CIRAS based on their search results.  We briefly explain the main features of the incident reporting procedure, as described in the Article 13a Technical  Guideline on Incident Reporting, which was developed in collaboration with the NRAs.  3.1.1 Services in scope  Although the focus of this report is still on the main 4 types of classic services, due to latest technological and legal  advancements, we have decided to extend the number of services. As some of those services become more and  more important in the EU digital market, and some countries already cover them through their national level  regulations, their inclusion in ENISA’s annual report is a must as preparatory work needs to be done to cover them  in the future.  13 See https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting  14 See https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-minimum-security-measures  15 See https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-minimum-security-measures https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  10  Besides the four main services (aka. classic services), others were added as follows:  CLASSIC SERVICES OTHER SERVICES (SINCE 2016)  Fixed telephony  Mobile telephony  Fixed Internet access  Mobile Internet access  SMS  MMS  Satellite TV  International roaming  RADIO broadcasting  TV broadcasting  Cable TV  IPTV  Video on demand  Public WIFI  Web based voice services  Web-based messaging services  Public email services  Table 1: Services in scope  3.1.2 Security incidents in scope  NRAs are required to report security incidents, which had a significant impact on the continuity of supply of  electronic communications services. As explained, not all types of incidents are reportable under the Art. 13a  provisions. Depending on the national implementation of Art. 13a, if one incident does not affect the continuity of  the service (availability), although confidentiality or integrity might be affected, the incident does not need to be  reported.  3.1.3 National user base  NRAs should provide estimates of the total number of users of each service in their country. The national user base  is used for determining the significance of incidents, in cases where the threshold is relative to the national user  base.   For fixed telephony and Internet, NRAs should use the number of subscribers or access lines in their country.   For mobile telephony, NRAs should use the number of active telephony SIM cards.   For mobile Internet, NRAs should sum up16:  1. The number of standard mobile subscriptions, which offer both telephony and Internet access, and  which have been used for Internet access recently (e.g. in the past 3 months).  2. The number of subscriptions dedicated for mobile Internet access, which are purchased separately,  either standalone or on top of an existing voice subscription.   For other types of services that are still in an experimental phase no national user base was collected at this  point.  16 Reference is made to the definition agreed in the COCOM meetings.  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  11  3.1.4 Thresholds  Art. 13a provisions state that Member States (MS) shall ensure that electronic communication providers will “notify  the competent national regulatory authority of a breach of security or loss of integrity that has had a significant  impact on the operation of networks or services”. However, the thresholds for defining significant incidents were  not established through the Directive and the EC has not issued any implementing measures in this sense leaving  the matter open for discussions and unrestricted for national implementation. At this point the activities of ENISA  and Art. 13a expert group have proved to be very useful by defining a set of informal and non-binding EU thresholds  to help Member States in reporting or setting up their own national level thresholds. In this respect a set of EU  thresholds were adopted by the Art. 13a expert group that are known and accepted by every country, but it has  remained at the discretion of each Member State to adopt its own national thresholds. All incidents reported within  the annual report to ENISA and EC, and presented within this report, are based on the thresholds established at  national levels, which can be above or below (in most of the cases they are below) the EU thresholds. For an analysis  of incidents based on the informal EU level thresholds see Section 3.1.5.  The EU thresholds for the annual summary reporting are based on the duration and the number of users of a service  affected as a percentage of the national user base of the service.  NRAs should send an incident report, as part of the annual summary reporting, if the incident:   lasts more than an hour, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 15 %,   lasts more than 2 hours, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 10 %,   lasts more than 4 hours, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 5 %,   lasts more than 6 hours, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 2 %, or if it   lasts more than 8 hours, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 1 %.  1 h  <...<2 h  2 h  <...<4 h  4 h  <...<6 h  6 h  <...<8 h  >8 h  1%<...< 2% of user base  2%<...< 5% of user base  5%<...< 10% of user base  10%<...< 15% of user base  > 15% of user base  Table 2: Threshold for annual summary reporting based on a combination of duration and the percentage of the national user base.  The threshold should be understood on a “per service” basis. In other words, if an incident impacts multiple services,  then for one of the services the threshold should be passed in order to trigger the reporting mechanism. NRAs have  the discretion to also report incidents with impact graded below the threshold.  Since 2013, we introduced a new optional threshold for annual summary reporting, based on absolute impact, in  order to allow for NRAs in large Member States to include larger incidents but that would not exceed the relative  thresholds. This absolute threshold has been lowered for 2014 and has now become mandatory. NRAs should  include incidents when the product of duration and number of user connections affected exceeds 60 million user  minutes, or 1 million user hours. Note that the introduction of this mandatory and lowered absolute threshold has  led to an increase in the number of reported incidents to ENISA and the Commission.  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  12  In case of the services that deviate from the four main services no thresholds were established. Member states could  report incidents that they consider significant.  3.1.5 EU thresholds vs. national level thresholds  Art. 13a provisions state that member states shall ensure that electronic communication providers will “notify the  competent national regulatory authority of a breach of security or loss of integrity that has had a significant impact  on the operation of networks or services”. But the thresholds for defining significant incidents were not established  through the Directive and the EC has not issued any implementing measures in this sense leaving the matter open  for discussions and unrestricted as regards the national implementation. At this point the activities of ENISA and Art.  13a expert group have proved to be very useful by defining a set of informal and non-binding EU thresholds to help  member states in reporting or setting up their own national level thresholds. In this respect a set of EU thresholds  were adopted by the Art. 13a expert group that are known and accepted by every country, but it has remained at  the discretion of each Member State to adopt its own national thresholds. All incidents reported within the annual  report to ENISA and EC, and presented within this report, are based on the thresholds established at national levels,  which can be above or below (in most of the cases they are below) the EU thresholds. This section presents a short  analysis of incidents based on the informal EU level thresholds.  Figure 2: Total incidents in annual reports vs. Total incidents above thresholds  According to our estimations more than half of the EU member states have thresholds below the ones defined by  ENISA while others use the same thresholds.  3.1.6 Root cause categories  In the incident reports four categories of root causes have been outlined plus one category that is used in conjunction  with one of the other four categories.   Natural phenomena – This category includes incidents caused by severe weather, earthquakes, floods,  pandemic diseases, wildfires, wildlife, and so on.   Human errors - This category includes incidents caused by errors committed by employees of the provider  or outside the provider, during the operation of equipment or facilities, the use of tools, the execution of  procedures, etc. E.g. an excavator cutting off a cable.   Malicious attacks - This category includes incidents caused by a deliberate act by someone or some  organisation, e.g. a Denial of Service attack disrupting the service, or a cable theft.   System failures – This category includes incidents caused by technical failures of a system, for example  caused by hardware failures, software bugs or flaws in manuals, procedures or policies.  21  69 78  93 91 102  51  79 90  137 138  158  2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016  Total incidents above EU thresholds Total incidents in annual reports  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  13   Third party failures – This category includes incidents caused by a failure or incident at a third party. The  category is used in conjunctions with one of the other four root cause categories.  3.1.7 Detailed causes  In the incident reports, detailed causes are specified in terms of “initial cause” and “subsequent cause”.  “Initial  cause” is the event or factor that triggered the incident. Often incidents involve a chain of events or factors, and by  specifying a “subsequent cause” NRAs may indicate a cause that subsequently played a role in the incident. In the  ENISA annual reports the initial and subsequent causes are equally presented in the graphs of the detailed causes.  These detailed causes are referred to as “threats” in the Article 13a Technical Guideline on Threats and Assets15. In  the report, which is used by the NRAs as a guide for the annual summary reporting, the causes/threats are listed and  described.  3.1.8 Assets affected  Optionally NRAs may indicate what network assets were affected by the incidents, e.g. HLRs, routers and switches,  underground cables etc. These assets are listed and described in the Article 13a Technical Guideline on Threats and  Assets.  3.1.9 Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme  As several years have passed since the publication and implementation of the Framework Directive including Art.  13a, an impact evaluation of the new article was the proper thing to do. This was done by ENISA along with the  Article 13a Expert Group in 2015. The evaluation had the purpose of assessing the changes in outcome that can  directly be attributed to the provision of Art. 13a, the effects caused by this particular set of obligations within the  Telecom Package. The evaluation focused on 5 key areas, where we tried to identify possible outcomes:   The new security measures implemented in the member states;   The transparency resulting from the incident reporting process;   The learning process resulting from incidents;   The level of collaboration between the stakeholders;   The harmonization of the procedures within the European Union.  The evaluation done within this project has brought to light some important outcomes that have definitely  contributed to increasing the resilience and security of the telecommunications infrastructures in Europe. In a  European Union which was highly diversified in terms of security measures, Art. 13a brought a certain amount of  uniformity in the approach taken regarding security of telecommunication services, but more importantly  contributed to strengthening the European telecom infrastructure’s resilience and services availability across the  EU. The role of ENISA, especially in the coordination of Art. 13a expert group, was most beneficial as it helped  considerably in bringing more harmonization within the implementation process and collaboration among  stakeholders (NRAs and providers). Findings and conclusions of the Impact evaluation on the implementation of  Article 13a incident reporting scheme17 have served as an input to the EU Commission in the telecom framework  evaluation process.  17 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/impact-evaluation-article13a  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/impact-evaluation-article13a  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  14  4. Analysis of the incidents  In total, all 28 EU Member States and 2 EFTA country participated in this process. Of these, 22 Member States and  2 EFTA countries reported in total 158 significant incidents and 6 countries reported there were no significant  incidents. An increase from previous year where 21 countries reported significant incidents.  Figure 3: Countries involved in the annual summary reporting in 2015.  In this section, the 158 reported incidents are aggregated and analysed. First, the impact per service is analysed (in  Section 4.1), then the impact per root cause category is analysed (Section 4.2), and in Section 4.3 detailed causes  are examined. In Section 4.3.5 the impact, as a product of user connections affected and duration of the incidents,  is analysed, and in Section 4.4 the components or assets affected by the incidents are considered. Throughout the  text we provide anonymized descriptions (in blue italic) of actual large-scale incidents which occurred in 2015. In  annex A-D we show graphs including the previous two years to allow the reader to make a comparison. This  comparison should however be done with caution, see below.  Note about statistical conclusions: Readers should be cautious when drawing conclusions from the statistics in this  report. In particular, they should take into account that:  1. The scope of reporting major security incidents is restricted to incidents with an impact on the continuity of  public electronic communication services and networks. There are many other types of incidents with an  impact on security of services and networks which are not in scope of annual reporting. For example, if  attackers would wiretap undersea cables without causing any outages, then such a security incident would  not be included in the annual reporting.  2. The scope of reporting includes major, or significant, incidents scoring above the agreed reporting  thresholds (Table 2). Smaller incidents are not reported at EU level, meaning that the view is skewed towards  the larger incidents.  3. Year by year we are in collaboration with the NRAs and in some cases the thresholds that define the  significance of incidents are modified. This may cause the number of reported incidents to fluctuate. Until  now the thresholds have only been lowered, causing in some years an increase in the number of incidents.  This doesn’t necessarily mean that the number of incidents throughout the EU is increasing.  4. We are continuously working in collaboration with the NRAs for improved quality in the incident reporting.  There are still changes, more details and improvements in the way national and EU reporting is being  implemented, including the lowering of reporting thresholds and refinements of parameters for reporting.  Statistical conclusions about multi-annual trends should therefore be drawn with caution.  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  15  5. All incidents reported within the annual report to ENISA and EC, and presented within this report, are based  on the thresholds established at national levels, which can be above or below (in most of the cases they are  below) the EU thresholds. For an analysis of incidents based on the informal EU level thresholds see Section  3.1.5.  Impact of incidents  First we look at the electronic communications services and compare them with each other in terms of incidents.  4.1.1 Impact per service  For third year in a row most of the reported incidents affected mobile internet. Both mobile internet and mobile  telephony services had an increase on incidents compared to last year’s results. In 2014 the most affected service  was fixed telephony (see Annex A).  Figure 4: Incidents per classic services (percentage)  Note that most reported incidents usually have an impact on more than one service in the same incident (which is  why the percentages in the chart add up to more than 100 %).  A system failure affected mobile internet to fail for millions of users (duration: hours, connections: millions,  cause: software bug): A software bug occurred  in the Internal system component SDM leading to the degradation  of user authorization mobile data and mobile voice. As a result end users had difficulties to access mobile services,  both voice and data locally and also abroad (roaming services). Mobile switches and mobile user registerss were  affected by this bug. Provider removed the obstacles in accessing the services  and for the prevention of similar  incidents in the future, a mitigation plan was created in collaboration with software vendors.  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  16  Other services  Apart from the four main services, the most affected services are SMS (16,5), Cable TV (7,6%) and MMS (7%).  Figure 5: Incidents per other service (percentage)  4.1.2 Number of user connections affected  Mobile Internet outages affected most user connections compared to the other services, with an average of 1.3  million user connections affected per reported incident. Also in past reporting years mobile internet failures  affected most user connections, and mobile telephony failures came in second place, see Annex A.  Note that the averages in these diagrams include both small and large countries, so EU averages shown in the  diagram above are not necessarily representative for the size of incidents occurring nationally. The average size of  Figure 6: Average number of user connections affected per incident per classic service (1000s).  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  17  national incidents can be very different, depending on the size of the population and the national network  topology. What is interesting to note is the comparison between the affected services in terms of affected user  connections.  The evolution of the number of affected connections can be seen in Annex A.  4.1.3 Percentage of the national user base affected  Mobile Internet outages impacted on average 14% of the national user base for mobile Internet user connections,  which is a slight increase compared to the previous years, see annex A.3. All five years, mobile Internet has been  reported to suffer the most impact in terms of percentage of its national user base compared to the other services.  Other services  The average number of connections affected for Radio broadcasting  is 2 million. As for MMS (1.3 million) and  SMS (1.2 million) services is in the same range as mobile telephony/mobile internet underlining the  interconnection between the two.  Figure 7: Average number of user connections affected (1000s) - other services  Figure 8: Percentage of national user base affected on average per incident per service.  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  18  4.1.4 Impact on emergency services  In more than 20% of incidents reported, emergency calls were impacted - i.e. the possibility for users to contact  emergency call-centres using the emergency number 112.  4.1.5 Impact on interconnections  In 7 % of incidents reported there was an impact on interconnections between providers.  Compared to previous  year also this figure has decreased, see Annex A.  Figure 9: Impact on emergency calls.  Figure 10: Impact on interconnections (percentage)  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  19  Root cause categories  In this section we look at the main root cause categories of reported incidents. For a description of the root cause  categories, see section 3.1.5.  4.2.1 Incidents per root cause category  This year, almost 73% of the reported incidents were caused by system failures or technical failures, a ratio which  is consistent compared to all the previous years, see Annex B. For all reporting years, system failures has been the  most common root cause category. In second place, for this year is root cause of human errors 11,4% of the  reported incidents, also consistent with previous years. Malicious actions and natural phenomena caused the least  of the incidents (both with 5,1%).  System failure caused disruption in all classic services and SMS/ MMS services affecting millions of users (duration:  hours, connections: millions, cause: hardware failure):  System failure caused outage of network components using  technology for DSL in the subscriber access network. Provider raised the capacities of network components in order  to provide electronic communications service. As a next step a software upgrade of several selected network  components was applied.  4.2.2 Third party failures  About 22.5% of the incidents reported were categorized as third party failures, a significant increase compared to  the previous year (14.8%), see Annex B.  Figure 11: Incidents per root cause category (percentage).  Figure 12: Third party failures and non-third party failures of all incidents (percentages).  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  20  4.2.3 Root cause categories per service  In this section we look at the root causes for each of the four services separately: fixed telephony, fixed Internet  access, mobile telephony and mobile Internet access.  As in 2015, also in 2016, system failures was the dominant root cause for all services, scoring more than half of the  incidents reported per service. For mobile telephony and mobile internet, this was the case also in the previous  years, whereas the dominant root cause for fixed telephony and fixed internet oscillated in the previous years  between natural phenomena and system failures, see Annex B.  4.2.3.1 Fixed Telephony  4.2.3.2 Fixed Internet  Figure 13: Root cause categories for fixed telephony (percentage).  Figure 14: Root cause categories for fixed Internet (percentage).  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  21  4.2.3.3 Mobile telephony  4.2.3.4 Mobile internet  4.2.3.5 Other services  System failures is also the main root cause for other services besides the classic services, with a percentage of  approximately 71%.  Figure 16: Root cause categories for mobile Internet (percentage).  Figure 15: Root cause categories for mobile telephony (percentage).  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  22  4.2.4 Average number of user connections affected per root cause category  Also this year, system failures affected most user connections, on average about 2.0 million user connections per  incident. In the previous year, system failures affected on average 1.6 million user connections.  4.2.5 Average duration of incidents per root cause category  The reported incidents caused by natural phenomena had the longest recovery time on average per incident (400  hours). Excluding last year’s result where malicious action was the root cause with the longest incidents on average,  natural phenomena tend to cause the longest incidents in terms of duration.  For the evolution in time of the average  duration pls. check Annex B.  Figure 18: Average number of user connections affected per incident per root cause (1000s)  Figure 17: Root cause categories for other services (percentage).  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  23  4.2.6 User hours lost per root cause category  Figure 19: Average duration of incidents per root cause category (hours).  Figure 20: User hours lost per root cause category (hours).  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  24  Detailed causes  Root cause categories are rather broad but give a good summary of the most common types of incidents. In this  section we break down the root cause categories in predefined detailed causes of incidents.  An incident is often not only triggered by one cause but often by multiple causes and a chain of causes. For instance,  an incident may initially be triggered by heavy winds, which tear down power supply infrastructure causing a power  cut, which in turn leads to an outage. For this incident both heavy winds and power cut are detailed causes. These  detailed causes are equally represented in the statistics, because both causes may be addressed by the provider in  terms of security measures.  4.3.1 Detailed causes of all incidents  In 2016, the most common causes of incidents were hardware failures and software bugs. This can now be  considered a trend as this has been the case all the previous years, with the first position being occupied by one or  the other. Also power cuts and cable cuts seem to slightly decrease and leave their place from the top four causes  of the last four years. Many detailed causes of incidents reports do not fall under a specific category and form the  category of “Other” which has a significant position in the overall chart. However, analysing further these detailed  causes we see that most of them describe a cause that resulted to a system failure. Even though most of the causes  in Other category in generic terms fall either under Software bug or Faulty software change/update, we detail some  that seem interesting: billing platform failure, connectivity failure, maintenance, scheduled work failure, STP error,  redundancy failure, etc.  Hardware failure resulted in unavailability of services for more than a million users (duration: hours, connections:  millions, causes: system failure): Outage of network components using technology for DSL in the subscriber access  network resulted to disruption of all classic services as well as SMS and MMS services.  Provider responded to the incident by raising the capacities of network components in order to provide elelctronic  communications service. Followed a software upgrade of several selected network components to resolve the issue  completely.  Figure 21: Detailed causes of reported incidents (percentage)  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  25  4.3.2 Detailed causes per service  In this section we show the detailed causes of incidents for each of the main four services (fixed telephony, fixed  Internet, mobile telephony and mobile Internet) and for the other services. As in the previous year, also this year,  Hardware failures were the most common causes for failures in all the main four services and for the other services  as well.  4.3.2.1 Fixed Telephony  4.3.2.2 Fixed Internet  Figure 23: Detailed causes for fixed Internet (percentage).  Figure 22: Detailed causes for fixed telephony (percentage).  2011  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  26  4.3.2.3 Mobile Telephony  4.3.2.4 Mobile Internet  4.3.2.5 Other services  More than 50% of the incidents affecting other services, except the four main services, were caused by Hardware  failures, Power cuts and Cable cuts, with 26%, 16% and 12% respectively. Cable cuts and Software bugs had the  same percentage in this case.  Figure 24: Detailed causes for mobile telephony (percentage).  Figure 25: Detailed causes for mobile Internet (percentage).

Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  28  4.3.3 Average duration of incidents per detailed cause category  4.3.4 User hours lost per detailed cause  An attempt at malware infection coming from a malicious action caused outage on fixed internet, fixed telephony,  IPTV and DNS services for more than three days: (duration: days, connections: thousands, cause: Malicious action  ):  A worldwide attack of a botnet attempted to infect maintenance interfaces of customer premises equipments  with a malware. This attempt failed but caused a restricted access to electronic communications services. Provider  mitigated this attack by implementing filtering measures in order to prevent further malicious attacks of this kind.  Provider updated remotely the firmware in customer premises equipments (CPEs)  and asked affected customers to  disconnect CPEs from the power supply, and switch them on in order to finalise the update.  Figure 29: User hours lost per detailed cause (hours).  Figure 28: Average duration of incidents per detailed cause category (hours).  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  29  Analysis of arising cybersecurity trends/issues  For the reporting years 2012-2016, annual reports included in total 614 incident reports with 425 incident reports  (69% of total incident reports) coming from system failures. On the other side, only 34 incident reports (5,5% of total  incident reports) are a result of malicious actions. Approximately 76,5% of the malicious actions consist of  cybersecurity attacks, namely Denial of Service attacks, malware / viruses and network hijacks, while the rest  concern deliberate damages to physical infrastructure. During all the reporting years only 3 reported incidents were  caused by malware. The proportion of malicious actions (especially cybersecurity related incidents) among the total  number of incidents reported remains low due to the focus of the current regulation on the “availability” of services  and networks, meaning mostly disruptions.  Considering the above we may conclude that malicious actions (especially cyber-attacks) are not necessarily focused  on creating disruptions in Telecom, a conclusion that has already been presented in previous versions of this report.  But, what we also can conclude is that, under the current form of Art. 13a within the Electronic Telecommunication  Framework Directive, we do not have a very good overview of the cyber-attacks affecting the telecommunication  infrastructure in EU. Although the present incident reporting scheme currently does not allow us to see the whole  picture, external sources (public reports, statistics, online articles etc.) on Telecom incidents confirm an increasing  trend as regards cyber-attacks. According to PwC’s Global State of Information Security, 2016 18, IT security incidents  in the telecom sector increased 45% in 2015 compared to the year before.  However, for the first time in the six year analysis of annual incident reports we see malware as the detailed cause,  with the most impact in terms of average duration and user hours lost. Interestingly, the same terms of impact were  trending in last year’s report but for root cause of malicious actions. It is of high importance to underline that  cybersecurity related detailed causes appeared to result the most user hours lost for both years of 2015 and 2016.  According to Gartner, 8.4 billion connected things will be in use worldwide in 2017, an increase of 31 percent  compared to 2016, and it is estimated that connected devices will reach 20.4 billion by 2020. The increasing spread  of digital technologies, the burst of emerging technologies, such as Software Defined Networks (SDN), Network  Function Virtualization (NFV) and IoT can lead to a growth in the number of cybersecurity attacks. The DSM strategy  19 recognizes the importance of the paradigm shifts the digital sector is undergoing and aims to tackle regulatory  fragmentation and build a more effective regulatory institutional framework.  In the light of the DSM strategy for Europe and based on the objective of ensuring a high-level of security of networks  and services in telecommunication, the European Commission has drafted a new Proposal for the European  Electronic Communications Code (EECC)20. The new proposal of EECC will extend the incident reporting mechanism  and will cover the entire threat landscape of telecommunications in EU by introducing:  a) a comprehensive definition of security in telecom. The revised definition of security puts in scope, apart from the  availability, also the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of services and networks.  18 See http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/cyber-security/information-security-survey.html  19 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/digital-single-market-commission-calls-swift-adoption-key- proposals-and-maps-out-challenges  20 See http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52016PC0590&from=EN  http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/cyber-security/information-security-survey.html https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/digital-single-market-commission-calls-swift-adoption-key-proposals-and-maps-out-challenges https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/digital-single-market-commission-calls-swift-adoption-key-proposals-and-maps-out-challenges http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52016PC0590&from=EN  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  30  b) a wider scope to include also number-independent interpersonal communications services,also called Over-The-  Top (OTTs), and  c) new parameters for measuring significance of incidents. Parameters to determine significant incidents, expand  from user connections affected by the breach and duration of the breach, also to geographical spread, the extent to  which the functioning service is disrupted, and to societal and economic impact.  The new EECC is expected to be adopted in 2018.  Additionally, regulations with substantial improvements on security that facilitate the coverage of the entire  spectrum of the rapidly changing digital society have been adopted recently.  The NIS Directive and GDPR will affect the regulatory obligations in the Telecom sector, requiring new procedures  and more dimensions of information security compliance. The NIS Directive will introduce new requirements in the  area of security measures and incident notification for Digital Service Providers (DSP) and Essential Services  Operators (ESO). The NIS Directive and the new EECC converge on the incident reporting as many cloud services of  DSPs and digital infrastructure of ESOs share common resources coming from telecom providers.  The ePrivacy Directive and the GDPR, which provide together the legal framework to ensure digital privacy for EU  citizens, will also affect the electronic communications sector.  The harmonisation level between all relevant security related EU level regulations has certainly increased in recent  years. The providers will have to consider all these three legal acts when building their cyber security and compliance  policies.  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  31  Assets affected  Also this year we received reports from NRAs about which components or assets of the electronic communications  networks were affected by the incidents. This provides some more information about the nature of the outages  and what assets of the infrastructure that were primarily involved in them.  4.5.1 Assets affected overall  In 2016, mobile base stations and controllers, mobile switches and switches and routers were the assets most  affected by incidents. For more details on the timeline of assets affected please see Annex D.  4.5.2 Affected assets in system failures  As for all previous reporting years, system failures (or technical failures), was the most common root cause  category in 2016. In these system failures, the most common assets that failed were mobile switches, switches and  routers and other uncategorised assets. Also the previous year mobile switches, and switches and routers were the  most common assets to fail in this root cause category.  Figure 30: Assets affected by the incidents (percentage).  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  32  Figure 31: Assets affected by system failures (percentages).  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  33  5. Conclusions  In this report ENISA summarized and analysed the outage incidents that were sent by the National Regulatory  Authorities (NRAs) from member states and EFTA countries to ENISA and the European Commission in 2017  concerning incidents in 2016, as mandated by Article 13a of the Framework Directive (2009/140/EC)8.  In 2016, analysing the 158 significant incidents reported to ENISA and the EU Commission, the following conclusions  can be drawn, first looking at services and network assets affected and then at the causes of the incidents.   Mobile internet remains the most affected service: In 2016 most incidents affected mobile internet (48%  of all reported incidents). Mobile internet and mobile telephony were the predominant affected services in  the previous years also, except for 2014 where fixed telephony was the most affected.   Mobile services outages have affected in average more users than other: Incidents affecting mobile  Internet or mobile telephony affected most users (around 1.3 million users and 1.1 million users respectively  per incident). On average 14% of national user base was affected by incidents on mobile internet services.   System failures are the dominant root cause of incidents affecting availability: Most incidents were caused  by system failures or technical failures (more than 70 % of the incidents) as a root cause. This has been the  dominant root cause for all the reporting years so far. System failures was also the most common root cause  for all the main services when looking at them separately and also the main root cause for all services, both  classic and other services. In the system failures category, software bugs and hardware failures were the  most common causes. The assets most often affected by system failures were switches and routers, and  mobile base stations.   Third party failures continue to affect a considerable part of the total number of incidents: 21.5% of all  incidents were caused by third party failures, a significant increase from last year (15,2%). Third party failure  incidents are of high importance as they represent incidents completely out of the control of the provider.  Therefore, such kind of incidents are complex and difficult to tackle. System failures followed by human  errors were the most common cause category for third party failures also.   Malware is causing increasingly long lasting incidents: In last year’s analysis incidents caused by malicious  actions (e.g. malware and DDoS), although we didn’t have too many of them, had most impact in terms of  duration. This year, a single incident of malware caused the most impact in terms of average duration and  user-hours lost. This change is strongly related to large DDoS attacks of last year. Last 2 years of reporting  have certainly showed that cyber-attacks can also aim at creating long lasting disruptions in Telecom.  As the legal landscape affecting the Telecom industry has undergone recent updates, it is our opinion that the new  improvements will certainly contribute to a more secured and harmonised telecommunications environment across  Europe21. Covering a wider range of threats and types of incidents that can affect telecommunications can be key in  better understanding the challenges within the sector, and dealing with their main causes. The electronic  telecommunication industry has reached a certain level of maturity among other IT related sectors, but the threat  level is still high, maintained by the importance of the sector, as an infrastructure provider for the digital economy.  21 https://www.dotmagazine.online/issues/connecting-the-world-whats-it-worth/challenges-in-eu-telecom-security  https://www.dotmagazine.online/issues/connecting-the-world-whats-it-worth/challenges-in-eu-telecom-security  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  34  ENISA, in the context of the Article 13a Expert Group10, will continue discussing specific incidents in more detail with  the NRAs, and if needed, discuss and agree on mitigating measures. ENISA will also continue to give support to other  sectors that are developing network and information security incident reporting schemes.  ENISA would like to take this opportunity to thank the NRAs, Ministries and the European Commission for a fruitful  collaboration and we look forward to leveraging this kind of reporting to further improve the security and resilience  of the electronic communications sector in the EU and more generally for supervision of security also in other critical  sectors.

This report covers the incidents that occurred in 2016 and it gives an aggregated analysis of the incident reports  about severe outages across the EU. This report does not include details about individual countries or providers.  The aim of the incident reporting scheme is to provide transparency to society and to learn from past incidents in  the electronic communications sector in order to systematically improve the security of the networks and services.  This report provides an overview on an aggregated level of what services and network assets are impacted and the  root causes of the incidents. Conclusions on the main patterns of incidents are drawn, contributing to discussions at  policy level on strategic measures to improve the security in the electronic communications sector.  The main conclusions from this year’s incident reporting are the following:   158 major incidents reported: This year 24 countries, including two EFTA countries, reported 158 significant  incidents that occurred in 2016, while 6 countries reported they had no significant incidents. 102 incidents  were above the informal EU thresholds.   Mobile internet most affected service: In 2016 most incidents affected mobile internet (48% of all reported  incidents). Mobile internet and mobile telephony were the predominant affected services in the previous  years also, except for 2014 where fixed telephony was the most affected.   System failures are the dominant root cause of incidents: Most incidents were caused by system failures  or technical failures (almost 73% of the incidents) as a root cause. This has been the dominant root cause  for all the reporting years so far. In the system failures root category, software bugs and hardware failures  were the most common causes affecting core network equipment.   System failures affected on average more user connections per incident: In 2016 system failures was the  root cause category involving most users affected per incident (around 2 million user connections on average  per incident). The second place was taken by malicious actions with 1.2 million user connections on average  per incident.   Malicious actions along with natural phenomena are not among the main root causes creating disruptions:  the total number of incidents caused by malicious actions was 5.1%; double compared to previous year  (2.5% in 2015).   Malware caused the longest lasting incidents this year: Incidents caused by malware, although there were  not too many of them, had most impact in terms of duration and user hours lost.   Emergency services are affected by incidents: Same as last year, 20 % of the incidents affected the 112  emergency services, a considerably high percentage.   Mobile base stations and controllers the most affected assets: Overall, mobile base stations and controllers  and mobile switches were the network components most affected by incidents (7% and 6% respectively).  The analysis of annual incident reports the last six years has revealed specific trends and patterns of root causes,  detailed causes and affected services. These assets and threats need particular attention when carrying out risk and  vulnerability assessments in the electronic communications sector.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  05  ENISA is permanently analysing the current threat environment and develops projects that address particular  technical or policy related topics directly linked to the electronic communications sector. In the context of Article13a  efforts, ENISA has been conducting many supporting activities in order to provide a holistic and in-depth view to  providers that need to assess risks, take appropriate security measures, and report about significant security  incidents.  Based on the annual summary reporting of previous years, ENISA analysed power supply dependencies1, and issued  recommendations regarding the sector’s ability to withstand and act efficiently after power cuts. ENISA also studied  in 2013 national roaming for increased resilience in mobile networks2. Last year, based on the annual summary  reporting of 2012 and 2013 incidents, ENISA has issued recommendations for providers3 about how to manage  security requirements for vendors of ICT equipment and outsourced services used for core operations. Based on the  2012 and 2013 summary reporting ENISA has also studied national initiatives to reduce the number of underground  cable breaks caused by mistakes4.  ENISA has developed studies in order to facilitate NRAs as well as telco providers to incorporate these  recommendations to their security activities. Recently developed a study on security measures implemented by  electronic communication providers5, and alternative indicators for measuring impact in electronic communications  services6.  Furthermore, in 2015, ENISA developed an impact evaluation of the Art. 13a provisions7, with the purpose of  assessing the changes in outcome that can directly be attributed to the article, the effects caused by this particular  set of obligations within the Telecom Package.  1 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/power-supply-dependencies/  2 See http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/using-national-roaming-to-mitigate-mobile-network-outages201d- new-report-by-eu-cyber-security-agency-enisa  3 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/requirements-ecomms-vendors  4 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/protection-of-underground- infrastructure  5 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-measures  6 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-incidents-indicators  7 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/impact-evaluation-article13a  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/power-supply-dependencies/ http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/using-national-roaming-to-mitigate-mobile-network-outages201d-new-report-by-eu-cyber-security-agency-enisa http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/using-national-roaming-to-mitigate-mobile-network-outages201d-new-report-by-eu-cyber-security-agency-enisa https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/requirements-ecomms-vendors https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/protection-of-underground-infrastructure https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/protection-of-underground-infrastructure https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-measures https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-incidents-indicators https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/impact-evaluation-article13a  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  06  1. Introduction  The current document represents  the sixth iteration of the report “Annual Incident Reports”, which summarises  significant outage incidents in the telecom sector reported to ENISA and the European Commission (EC), under  Article 13a of the Framework Directive (2009/140/EC)8, an article introduced in the 2009 reform of the EU regulatory  framework for electronic communications9. This year ENISA and EC received 158 incident reports from NRAs, about  severe outages in the EU’s electronic communication networks and/or services which occurred in 2016. This report  provides an aggregate analysis of these 158 incidents.  Please note that in this document we do not provide details from the individual incident reports. The analysis is only  an aggregation in terms of averages and percentages across the EU and EFTA countries, and it does not contain  references to specific countries or specific providers. Individual incidents are discussed in more detail with the NRAs  in the Article 13a Expert Group10.  This document is structured as follows: Section 2 and Section 3 briefly summarize Article 13a and the details of the  technical implementation of Article 13a, as agreed in the Article 13a Expert Group by the different NRAs of the EU  Member States. Section 4 analyses the incidents from 2016 which were reported to ENISA and the Commission and  provides examples of incidents. Section 5 provides the conclusions.  In the separate document of Annex (Annexes A-D) we show graphs with the trend over the years to allow for the  reader to make a comparison with data from previous years. This comparison should however be done with caution,  as the methodology for details in the reporting has been improved over the years and the thresholds have been  lowered year by year allowing for more incidents to be reported.  8 See http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT  9  See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/Copy of Regulatory Framework for Electonic  Communications 2013 NO CROPS.pdf  10 See http://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/Copy%20of%20Regulatory%20Framework%20for%20Electonic%20Communications%202013%20NO%20CROPS.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/Copy%20of%20Regulatory%20Framework%20for%20Electonic%20Communications%202013%20NO%20CROPS.pdf http://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  07  2. Article 13a of the Framework Directive: ‘Security and Integrity’  The reform of the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications9, which was adopted in 2009 and was  transposed by most EU countries around May 2011, added Article 13a to the Framework Directive8. Article 13a  addresses the security and integrity11 of public electronic communications networks and services. The legislation  concerns National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) and providers of public electronic communications networks and  services (providers).  Article 13a states:   Providers of public electronic communications networks and services should take measures to guarantee  security and integrity of their networks.   Providers must notify competent national authorities about breaches of security or loss of integrity that have  had significant impact on the operation of networks or services.   National Regulatory Authorities should notify ENISA and national authorities abroad when necessary, for  example in case of incidents with cross-border impact.   Annually, National Regulatory Authorities should submit a summary report to ENISA and the European  Commission about the incidents.  These incident reporting flows (incident notification and annual reporting) are shown in the diagram below. This  document analyses the incidents from 2015 that have been reported to ENISA (the black dashed arrow).

A public consultation concerning the evaluation and review of the current regulatory framework was  ended in December 2015. In this context, ENISA along with the Article 13a Expert Group submitted an opinion on  11 Here integrity means network integrity, which is often called availability or continuity in information security literature.  12https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/public-consultation-evaluation-and-review-regulatory-framework- electronic-communications  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/public-consultation-evaluation-and-review-regulatory-framework-electronic-communications https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/public-consultation-evaluation-and-review-regulatory-framework-electronic-communications  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  08  the evaluation and review of Article 13a and 13b of the Framework Directive, an area which is at the core of ENISA  expertise and competence.  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  09  3. Article 13a Expert Group and Incident Reporting Procedure  In 2010, ENISA, Ministries and NRAs initiated a series of meetings (workshops, conference calls) to achieve a  harmonised implementation of Article 13a of the Framework directive. In these meetings, a group of experts from  NRAs, called the Article 13a Expert Group, reached agreement on two non-binding technical documents providing  guidance to the NRAs in the EU Member States:   Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting13   Technical Guideline on Security Measures14  Later on, in 2014, the group of experts agreed on the third non-binding technical document:   Technical Guideline on Threats and Assets15  The Article 13a Expert Group continues to meet several times a year to develop the technical guidelines and to  discuss the implementation of Article 13a (for example, on how to supervise the electronic communications sector)  and to share knowledge and exchange views about past incidents, and how to address them.  Incident reporting procedure  In spring 2012, the EC agreed with the EU Member States (in meetings of the Communications Committee, COCOM)  to do the first round of annual summary reporting on the 2011 incidents impacting the continuity of supply of  electronic communications services. The decision included a recommendation to use the reporting template agreed  within the Article 13a Expert Group and published by ENISA.  Following the COCOM meeting, ENISA implemented  the technical procedure by deploying a basic electronic form based on the Article 13a Technical Guideline on Incident  Reporting. There was also an agreement that in the coming years, annual reporting would be carried out by the end  of February each year.  In autumn 2012, ENISA developed an online incident reporting tool (called CIRAS), which replaces the electronic  forms exchanged by email. CIRAS allows NRAs to exert greater control over the data reported and provides the NRAs  with better access to data about incidents reported across the EU. Since 2015 ENISA is providing the possibility for  the NRAs to extract graphs from CIRAS based on their search results.  We briefly explain the main features of the incident reporting procedure, as described in the Article 13a Technical  Guideline on Incident Reporting, which was developed in collaboration with the NRAs.  3.1.1 Services in scope  Although the focus of this report is still on the main 4 types of classic services, due to latest technological and legal  advancements, we have decided to extend the number of services. As some of those services become more and  more important in the EU digital market, and some countries already cover them through their national level  regulations, their inclusion in ENISA’s annual report is a must as preparatory work needs to be done to cover them  in the future.  13 See https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting  14 See https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-minimum-security-measures  15 See https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-minimum-security-measures https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  10  Besides the four main services (aka. classic services), others were added as follows:  CLASSIC SERVICES OTHER SERVICES (SINCE 2016)  Fixed telephony  Mobile telephony  Fixed Internet access  Mobile Internet access  SMS  MMS  Satellite TV  International roaming  RADIO broadcasting  TV broadcasting  Cable TV  IPTV  Video on demand  Public WIFI  Web based voice services  Web-based messaging services  Public email services  Table 1: Services in scope  3.1.2 Security incidents in scope  NRAs are required to report security incidents, which had a significant impact on the continuity of supply of  electronic communications services. As explained, not all types of incidents are reportable under the Art. 13a  provisions. Depending on the national implementation of Art. 13a, if one incident does not affect the continuity of  the service (availability), although confidentiality or integrity might be affected, the incident does not need to be  reported.  3.1.3 National user base  NRAs should provide estimates of the total number of users of each service in their country. The national user base  is used for determining the significance of incidents, in cases where the threshold is relative to the national user  base.   For fixed telephony and Internet, NRAs should use the number of subscribers or access lines in their country.   For mobile telephony, NRAs should use the number of active telephony SIM cards.   For mobile Internet, NRAs should sum up16:  1. The number of standard mobile subscriptions, which offer both telephony and Internet access, and  which have been used for Internet access recently (e.g. in the past 3 months).  2. The number of subscriptions dedicated for mobile Internet access, which are purchased separately,  either standalone or on top of an existing voice subscription.   For other types of services that are still in an experimental phase no national user base was collected at this  point.  16 Reference is made to the definition agreed in the COCOM meetings.  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  11  3.1.4 Thresholds  Art. 13a provisions state that Member States (MS) shall ensure that electronic communication providers will “notify  the competent national regulatory authority of a breach of security or loss of integrity that has had a significant  impact on the operation of networks or services”. However, the thresholds for defining significant incidents were  not established through the Directive and the EC has not issued any implementing measures in this sense leaving  the matter open for discussions and unrestricted for national implementation. At this point the activities of ENISA  and Art. 13a expert group have proved to be very useful by defining a set of informal and non-binding EU thresholds  to help Member States in reporting or setting up their own national level thresholds. In this respect a set of EU  thresholds were adopted by the Art. 13a expert group that are known and accepted by every country, but it has  remained at the discretion of each Member State to adopt its own national thresholds. All incidents reported within  the annual report to ENISA and EC, and presented within this report, are based on the thresholds established at  national levels, which can be above or below (in most of the cases they are below) the EU thresholds. For an analysis  of incidents based on the informal EU level thresholds see Section 3.1.5.  The EU thresholds for the annual summary reporting are based on the duration and the number of users of a service  affected as a percentage of the national user base of the service.  NRAs should send an incident report, as part of the annual summary reporting, if the incident:   lasts more than an hour, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 15 %,   lasts more than 2 hours, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 10 %,   lasts more than 4 hours, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 5 %,   lasts more than 6 hours, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 2 %, or if it   lasts more than 8 hours, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 1 %.  1 h  <...<2 h  2 h  <...<4 h  4 h  <...<6 h  6 h  <...<8 h  >8 h  1%<...< 2% of user base  2%<...< 5% of user base  5%<...< 10% of user base  10%<...< 15% of user base  > 15% of user base  Table 2: Threshold for annual summary reporting based on a combination of duration and the percentage of the national user base.  The threshold should be understood on a “per service” basis. In other words, if an incident impacts multiple services,  then for one of the services the threshold should be passed in order to trigger the reporting mechanism. NRAs have  the discretion to also report incidents with impact graded below the threshold.  Since 2013, we introduced a new optional threshold for annual summary reporting, based on absolute impact, in  order to allow for NRAs in large Member States to include larger incidents but that would not exceed the relative  thresholds. This absolute threshold has been lowered for 2014 and has now become mandatory. NRAs should  include incidents when the product of duration and number of user connections affected exceeds 60 million user  minutes, or 1 million user hours. Note that the introduction of this mandatory and lowered absolute threshold has  led to an increase in the number of reported incidents to ENISA and the Commission.  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  12  In case of the services that deviate from the four main services no thresholds were established. Member states could  report incidents that they consider significant.  3.1.5 EU thresholds vs. national level thresholds  Art. 13a provisions state that member states shall ensure that electronic communication providers will “notify the  competent national regulatory authority of a breach of security or loss of integrity that has had a significant impact  on the operation of networks or services”. But the thresholds for defining significant incidents were not established  through the Directive and the EC has not issued any implementing measures in this sense leaving the matter open  for discussions and unrestricted as regards the national implementation. At this point the activities of ENISA and Art.  13a expert group have proved to be very useful by defining a set of informal and non-binding EU thresholds to help  member states in reporting or setting up their own national level thresholds. In this respect a set of EU thresholds  were adopted by the Art. 13a expert group that are known and accepted by every country, but it has remained at  the discretion of each Member State to adopt its own national thresholds. All incidents reported within the annual  report to ENISA and EC, and presented within this report, are based on the thresholds established at national levels,  which can be above or below (in most of the cases they are below) the EU thresholds. This section presents a short  analysis of incidents based on the informal EU level thresholds.  Figure 2: Total incidents in annual reports vs. Total incidents above thresholds  According to our estimations more than half of the EU member states have thresholds below the ones defined by  ENISA while others use the same thresholds.  3.1.6 Root cause categories  In the incident reports four categories of root causes have been outlined plus one category that is used in conjunction  with one of the other four categories.   Natural phenomena – This category includes incidents caused by severe weather, earthquakes, floods,  pandemic diseases, wildfires, wildlife, and so on.   Human errors - This category includes incidents caused by errors committed by employees of the provider  or outside the provider, during the operation of equipment or facilities, the use of tools, the execution of  procedures, etc. E.g. an excavator cutting off a cable.   Malicious attacks - This category includes incidents caused by a deliberate act by someone or some  organisation, e.g. a Denial of Service attack disrupting the service, or a cable theft.   System failures – This category includes incidents caused by technical failures of a system, for example  caused by hardware failures, software bugs or flaws in manuals, procedures or policies.  21  69 78  93 91 102  51  79 90  137 138  158  2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016  Total incidents above EU thresholds Total incidents in annual reports  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  13   Third party failures – This category includes incidents caused by a failure or incident at a third party. The  category is used in conjunctions with one of the other four root cause categories.  3.1.7 Detailed causes  In the incident reports, detailed causes are specified in terms of “initial cause” and “subsequent cause”.  “Initial  cause” is the event or factor that triggered the incident. Often incidents involve a chain of events or factors, and by  specifying a “subsequent cause” NRAs may indicate a cause that subsequently played a role in the incident. In the  ENISA annual reports the initial and subsequent causes are equally presented in the graphs of the detailed causes.  These detailed causes are referred to as “threats” in the Article 13a Technical Guideline on Threats and Assets15. In  the report, which is used by the NRAs as a guide for the annual summary reporting, the causes/threats are listed and  described.  3.1.8 Assets affected  Optionally NRAs may indicate what network assets were affected by the incidents, e.g. HLRs, routers and switches,  underground cables etc. These assets are listed and described in the Article 13a Technical Guideline on Threats and  Assets.  3.1.9 Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme  As several years have passed since the publication and implementation of the Framework Directive including Art.  13a, an impact evaluation of the new article was the proper thing to do. This was done by ENISA along with the  Article 13a Expert Group in 2015. The evaluation had the purpose of assessing the changes in outcome that can  directly be attributed to the provision of Art. 13a, the effects caused by this particular set of obligations within the  Telecom Package. The evaluation focused on 5 key areas, where we tried to identify possible outcomes:   The new security measures implemented in the member states;   The transparency resulting from the incident reporting process;   The learning process resulting from incidents;   The level of collaboration between the stakeholders;   The harmonization of the procedures within the European Union.  The evaluation done within this project has brought to light some important outcomes that have definitely  contributed to increasing the resilience and security of the telecommunications infrastructures in Europe. In a  European Union which was highly diversified in terms of security measures, Art. 13a brought a certain amount of  uniformity in the approach taken regarding security of telecommunication services, but more importantly  contributed to strengthening the European telecom infrastructure’s resilience and services availability across the  EU. The role of ENISA, especially in the coordination of Art. 13a expert group, was most beneficial as it helped  considerably in bringing more harmonization within the implementation process and collaboration among  stakeholders (NRAs and providers). Findings and conclusions of the Impact evaluation on the implementation of  Article 13a incident reporting scheme17 have served as an input to the EU Commission in the telecom framework  evaluation process.  17 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/impact-evaluation-article13a  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/impact-evaluation-article13a  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  14  4. Analysis of the incidents  In total, all 28 EU Member States and 2 EFTA country participated in this process. Of these, 22 Member States and  2 EFTA countries reported in total 158 significant incidents and 6 countries reported there were no significant  incidents. An increase from previous year where 21 countries reported significant incidents.  Figure 3: Countries involved in the annual summary reporting in 2015.  In this section, the 158 reported incidents are aggregated and analysed. First, the impact per service is analysed (in  Section 4.1), then the impact per root cause category is analysed (Section 4.2), and in Section 4.3 detailed causes  are examined. In Section 4.3.5 the impact, as a product of user connections affected and duration of the incidents,  is analysed, and in Section 4.4 the components or assets affected by the incidents are considered. Throughout the  text we provide anonymized descriptions (in blue italic) of actual large-scale incidents which occurred in 2015. In  annex A-D we show graphs including the previous two years to allow the reader to make a comparison. This  comparison should however be done with caution, see below.  Note about statistical conclusions: Readers should be cautious when drawing conclusions from the statistics in this  report. In particular, they should take into account that:  1. The scope of reporting major security incidents is restricted to incidents with an impact on the continuity of  public electronic communication services and networks. There are many other types of incidents with an  impact on security of services and networks which are not in scope of annual reporting. For example, if  attackers would wiretap undersea cables without causing any outages, then such a security incident would  not be included in the annual reporting.  2. The scope of reporting includes major, or significant, incidents scoring above the agreed reporting  thresholds (Table 2). Smaller incidents are not reported at EU level, meaning that the view is skewed towards  the larger incidents.  3. Year by year we are in collaboration with the NRAs and in some cases the thresholds that define the  significance of incidents are modified. This may cause the number of reported incidents to fluctuate. Until  now the thresholds have only been lowered, causing in some years an increase in the number of incidents.  This doesn’t necessarily mean that the number of incidents throughout the EU is increasing.  4. We are continuously working in collaboration with the NRAs for improved quality in the incident reporting.  There are still changes, more details and improvements in the way national and EU reporting is being  implemented, including the lowering of reporting thresholds and refinements of parameters for reporting.  Statistical conclusions about multi-annual trends should therefore be drawn with caution.  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  15  5. All incidents reported within the annual report to ENISA and EC, and presented within this report, are based  on the thresholds established at national levels, which can be above or below (in most of the cases they are  below) the EU thresholds. For an analysis of incidents based on the informal EU level thresholds see Section  3.1.5.  Impact of incidents  First we look at the electronic communications services and compare them with each other in terms of incidents.  4.1.1 Impact per service  For third year in a row most of the reported incidents affected mobile internet. Both mobile internet and mobile  telephony services had an increase on incidents compared to last year’s results. In 2014 the most affected service  was fixed telephony (see Annex A).  Figure 4: Incidents per classic services (percentage)  Note that most reported incidents usually have an impact on more than one service in the same incident (which is  why the percentages in the chart add up to more than 100 %).  A system failure affected mobile internet to fail for millions of users (duration: hours, connections: millions,  cause: software bug): A software bug occurred  in the Internal system component SDM leading to the degradation  of user authorization mobile data and mobile voice. As a result end users had difficulties to access mobile services,  both voice and data locally and also abroad (roaming services). Mobile switches and mobile user registerss were  affected by this bug. Provider removed the obstacles in accessing the services  and for the prevention of similar  incidents in the future, a mitigation plan was created in collaboration with software vendors.  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  16  Other services  Apart from the four main services, the most affected services are SMS (16,5), Cable TV (7,6%) and MMS (7%).  Figure 5: Incidents per other service (percentage)  4.1.2 Number of user connections affected  Mobile Internet outages affected most user connections compared to the other services, with an average of 1.3  million user connections affected per reported incident. Also in past reporting years mobile internet failures  affected most user connections, and mobile telephony failures came in second place, see Annex A.  Note that the averages in these diagrams include both small and large countries, so EU averages shown in the  diagram above are not necessarily representative for the size of incidents occurring nationally. The average size of  Figure 6: Average number of user connections affected per incident per classic service (1000s).  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  17  national incidents can be very different, depending on the size of the population and the national network  topology. What is interesting to note is the comparison between the affected services in terms of affected user  connections.  The evolution of the number of affected connections can be seen in Annex A.  4.1.3 Percentage of the national user base affected  Mobile Internet outages impacted on average 14% of the national user base for mobile Internet user connections,  which is a slight increase compared to the previous years, see annex A.3. All five years, mobile Internet has been  reported to suffer the most impact in terms of percentage of its national user base compared to the other services.  Other services  The average number of connections affected for Radio broadcasting  is 2 million. As for MMS (1.3 million) and  SMS (1.2 million) services is in the same range as mobile telephony/mobile internet underlining the  interconnection between the two.  Figure 7: Average number of user connections affected (1000s) - other services  Figure 8: Percentage of national user base affected on average per incident per service.  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  18  4.1.4 Impact on emergency services  In more than 20% of incidents reported, emergency calls were impacted - i.e. the possibility for users to contact  emergency call-centres using the emergency number 112.  4.1.5 Impact on interconnections  In 7 % of incidents reported there was an impact on interconnections between providers.  Compared to previous  year also this figure has decreased, see Annex A.  Figure 9: Impact on emergency calls.  Figure 10: Impact on interconnections (percentage)  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  19  Root cause categories  In this section we look at the main root cause categories of reported incidents. For a description of the root cause  categories, see section 3.1.5.  4.2.1 Incidents per root cause category  This year, almost 73% of the reported incidents were caused by system failures or technical failures, a ratio which  is consistent compared to all the previous years, see Annex B. For all reporting years, system failures has been the  most common root cause category. In second place, for this year is root cause of human errors 11,4% of the  reported incidents, also consistent with previous years. Malicious actions and natural phenomena caused the least  of the incidents (both with 5,1%).  System failure caused disruption in all classic services and SMS/ MMS services affecting millions of users (duration:  hours, connections: millions, cause: hardware failure):  System failure caused outage of network components using  technology for DSL in the subscriber access network. Provider raised the capacities of network components in order  to provide electronic communications service. As a next step a software upgrade of several selected network  components was applied.  4.2.2 Third party failures  About 22.5% of the incidents reported were categorized as third party failures, a significant increase compared to  the previous year (14.8%), see Annex B.  Figure 11: Incidents per root cause category (percentage).  Figure 12: Third party failures and non-third party failures of all incidents (percentages).  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  20  4.2.3 Root cause categories per service  In this section we look at the root causes for each of the four services separately: fixed telephony, fixed Internet  access, mobile telephony and mobile Internet access.  As in 2015, also in 2016, system failures was the dominant root cause for all services, scoring more than half of the  incidents reported per service. For mobile telephony and mobile internet, this was the case also in the previous  years, whereas the dominant root cause for fixed telephony and fixed internet oscillated in the previous years  between natural phenomena and system failures, see Annex B.  4.2.3.1 Fixed Telephony  4.2.3.2 Fixed Internet  Figure 13: Root cause categories for fixed telephony (percentage).  Figure 14: Root cause categories for fixed Internet (percentage).  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  21  4.2.3.3 Mobile telephony  4.2.3.4 Mobile internet  4.2.3.5 Other services  System failures is also the main root cause for other services besides the classic services, with a percentage of  approximately 71%.  Figure 16: Root cause categories for mobile Internet (percentage).  Figure 15: Root cause categories for mobile telephony (percentage).  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  22  4.2.4 Average number of user connections affected per root cause category  Also this year, system failures affected most user connections, on average about 2.0 million user connections per  incident. In the previous year, system failures affected on average 1.6 million user connections.  4.2.5 Average duration of incidents per root cause category  The reported incidents caused by natural phenomena had the longest recovery time on average per incident (400  hours). Excluding last year’s result where malicious action was the root cause with the longest incidents on average,  natural phenomena tend to cause the longest incidents in terms of duration.  For the evolution in time of the average  duration pls. check Annex B.  Figure 18: Average number of user connections affected per incident per root cause (1000s)  Figure 17: Root cause categories for other services (percentage).  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  23  4.2.6 User hours lost per root cause category  Figure 19: Average duration of incidents per root cause category (hours).  Figure 20: User hours lost per root cause category (hours).  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  24  Detailed causes  Root cause categories are rather broad but give a good summary of the most common types of incidents. In this  section we break down the root cause categories in predefined detailed causes of incidents.  An incident is often not only triggered by one cause but often by multiple causes and a chain of causes. For instance,  an incident may initially be triggered by heavy winds, which tear down power supply infrastructure causing a power  cut, which in turn leads to an outage. For this incident both heavy winds and power cut are detailed causes. These  detailed causes are equally represented in the statistics, because both causes may be addressed by the provider in  terms of security measures.  4.3.1 Detailed causes of all incidents  In 2016, the most common causes of incidents were hardware failures and software bugs. This can now be  considered a trend as this has been the case all the previous years, with the first position being occupied by one or  the other. Also power cuts and cable cuts seem to slightly decrease and leave their place from the top four causes  of the last four years. Many detailed causes of incidents reports do not fall under a specific category and form the  category of “Other” which has a significant position in the overall chart. However, analysing further these detailed  causes we see that most of them describe a cause that resulted to a system failure. Even though most of the causes  in Other category in generic terms fall either under Software bug or Faulty software change/update, we detail some  that seem interesting: billing platform failure, connectivity failure, maintenance, scheduled work failure, STP error,  redundancy failure, etc.  Hardware failure resulted in unavailability of services for more than a million users (duration: hours, connections:  millions, causes: system failure): Outage of network components using technology for DSL in the subscriber access  network resulted to disruption of all classic services as well as SMS and MMS services.  Provider responded to the incident by raising the capacities of network components in order to provide elelctronic  communications service. Followed a software upgrade of several selected network components to resolve the issue  completely.  Figure 21: Detailed causes of reported incidents (percentage)  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  25  4.3.2 Detailed causes per service  In this section we show the detailed causes of incidents for each of the main four services (fixed telephony, fixed  Internet, mobile telephony and mobile Internet) and for the other services. As in the previous year, also this year,  Hardware failures were the most common causes for failures in all the main four services and for the other services  as well.  4.3.2.1 Fixed Telephony  4.3.2.2 Fixed Internet  Figure 23: Detailed causes for fixed Internet (percentage).  Figure 22: Detailed causes for fixed telephony (percentage).  2011  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  26  4.3.2.3 Mobile Telephony  4.3.2.4 Mobile Internet  4.3.2.5 Other services  More than 50% of the incidents affecting other services, except the four main services, were caused by Hardware  failures, Power cuts and Cable cuts, with 26%, 16% and 12% respectively. Cable cuts and Software bugs had the  same percentage in this case.  Figure 24: Detailed causes for mobile telephony (percentage).  Figure 25: Detailed causes for mobile Internet (percentage).

Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  28  4.3.3 Average duration of incidents per detailed cause category  4.3.4 User hours lost per detailed cause  An attempt at malware infection coming from a malicious action caused outage on fixed internet, fixed telephony,  IPTV and DNS services for more than three days: (duration: days, connections: thousands, cause: Malicious action  ):  A worldwide attack of a botnet attempted to infect maintenance interfaces of customer premises equipments  with a malware. This attempt failed but caused a restricted access to electronic communications services. Provider  mitigated this attack by implementing filtering measures in order to prevent further malicious attacks of this kind.  Provider updated remotely the firmware in customer premises equipments (CPEs)  and asked affected customers to  disconnect CPEs from the power supply, and switch them on in order to finalise the update.  Figure 29: User hours lost per detailed cause (hours).  Figure 28: Average duration of incidents per detailed cause category (hours).  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  29  Analysis of arising cybersecurity trends/issues  For the reporting years 2012-2016, annual reports included in total 614 incident reports with 425 incident reports  (69% of total incident reports) coming from system failures. On the other side, only 34 incident reports (5,5% of total  incident reports) are a result of malicious actions. Approximately 76,5% of the malicious actions consist of  cybersecurity attacks, namely Denial of Service attacks, malware / viruses and network hijacks, while the rest  concern deliberate damages to physical infrastructure. During all the reporting years only 3 reported incidents were  caused by malware. The proportion of malicious actions (especially cybersecurity related incidents) among the total  number of incidents reported remains low due to the focus of the current regulation on the “availability” of services  and networks, meaning mostly disruptions.  Considering the above we may conclude that malicious actions (especially cyber-attacks) are not necessarily focused  on creating disruptions in Telecom, a conclusion that has already been presented in previous versions of this report.  But, what we also can conclude is that, under the current form of Art. 13a within the Electronic Telecommunication  Framework Directive, we do not have a very good overview of the cyber-attacks affecting the telecommunication  infrastructure in EU. Although the present incident reporting scheme currently does not allow us to see the whole  picture, external sources (public reports, statistics, online articles etc.) on Telecom incidents confirm an increasing  trend as regards cyber-attacks. According to PwC’s Global State of Information Security, 2016 18, IT security incidents  in the telecom sector increased 45% in 2015 compared to the year before.  However, for the first time in the six year analysis of annual incident reports we see malware as the detailed cause,  with the most impact in terms of average duration and user hours lost. Interestingly, the same terms of impact were  trending in last year’s report but for root cause of malicious actions. It is of high importance to underline that  cybersecurity related detailed causes appeared to result the most user hours lost for both years of 2015 and 2016.  According to Gartner, 8.4 billion connected things will be in use worldwide in 2017, an increase of 31 percent  compared to 2016, and it is estimated that connected devices will reach 20.4 billion by 2020. The increasing spread  of digital technologies, the burst of emerging technologies, such as Software Defined Networks (SDN), Network  Function Virtualization (NFV) and IoT can lead to a growth in the number of cybersecurity attacks. The DSM strategy  19 recognizes the importance of the paradigm shifts the digital sector is undergoing and aims to tackle regulatory  fragmentation and build a more effective regulatory institutional framework.  In the light of the DSM strategy for Europe and based on the objective of ensuring a high-level of security of networks  and services in telecommunication, the European Commission has drafted a new Proposal for the European  Electronic Communications Code (EECC)20. The new proposal of EECC will extend the incident reporting mechanism  and will cover the entire threat landscape of telecommunications in EU by introducing:  a) a comprehensive definition of security in telecom. The revised definition of security puts in scope, apart from the  availability, also the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of services and networks.  18 See http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/cyber-security/information-security-survey.html  19 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/digital-single-market-commission-calls-swift-adoption-key- proposals-and-maps-out-challenges  20 See http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52016PC0590&from=EN  http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/cyber-security/information-security-survey.html https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/digital-single-market-commission-calls-swift-adoption-key-proposals-and-maps-out-challenges https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/digital-single-market-commission-calls-swift-adoption-key-proposals-and-maps-out-challenges http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52016PC0590&from=EN  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  30  b) a wider scope to include also number-independent interpersonal communications services,also called Over-The-  Top (OTTs), and  c) new parameters for measuring significance of incidents. Parameters to determine significant incidents, expand  from user connections affected by the breach and duration of the breach, also to geographical spread, the extent to  which the functioning service is disrupted, and to societal and economic impact.  The new EECC is expected to be adopted in 2018.  Additionally, regulations with substantial improvements on security that facilitate the coverage of the entire  spectrum of the rapidly changing digital society have been adopted recently.  The NIS Directive and GDPR will affect the regulatory obligations in the Telecom sector, requiring new procedures  and more dimensions of information security compliance. The NIS Directive will introduce new requirements in the  area of security measures and incident notification for Digital Service Providers (DSP) and Essential Services  Operators (ESO). The NIS Directive and the new EECC converge on the incident reporting as many cloud services of  DSPs and digital infrastructure of ESOs share common resources coming from telecom providers.  The ePrivacy Directive and the GDPR, which provide together the legal framework to ensure digital privacy for EU  citizens, will also affect the electronic communications sector.  The harmonisation level between all relevant security related EU level regulations has certainly increased in recent  years. The providers will have to consider all these three legal acts when building their cyber security and compliance  policies.  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  31  Assets affected  Also this year we received reports from NRAs about which components or assets of the electronic communications  networks were affected by the incidents. This provides some more information about the nature of the outages  and what assets of the infrastructure that were primarily involved in them.  4.5.1 Assets affected overall  In 2016, mobile base stations and controllers, mobile switches and switches and routers were the assets most  affected by incidents. For more details on the timeline of assets affected please see Annex D.  4.5.2 Affected assets in system failures  As for all previous reporting years, system failures (or technical failures), was the most common root cause  category in 2016. In these system failures, the most common assets that failed were mobile switches, switches and  routers and other uncategorised assets. Also the previous year mobile switches, and switches and routers were the  most common assets to fail in this root cause category.  Figure 30: Assets affected by the incidents (percentage).  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  32  Figure 31: Assets affected by system failures (percentages).  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  33  5. Conclusions  In this report ENISA summarized and analysed the outage incidents that were sent by the National Regulatory  Authorities (NRAs) from member states and EFTA countries to ENISA and the European Commission in 2017  concerning incidents in 2016, as mandated by Article 13a of the Framework Directive (2009/140/EC)8.  In 2016, analysing the 158 significant incidents reported to ENISA and the EU Commission, the following conclusions  can be drawn, first looking at services and network assets affected and then at the causes of the incidents.   Mobile internet remains the most affected service: In 2016 most incidents affected mobile internet (48%  of all reported incidents). Mobile internet and mobile telephony were the predominant affected services in  the previous years also, except for 2014 where fixed telephony was the most affected.   Mobile services outages have affected in average more users than other: Incidents affecting mobile  Internet or mobile telephony affected most users (around 1.3 million users and 1.1 million users respectively  per incident). On average 14% of national user base was affected by incidents on mobile internet services.   System failures are the dominant root cause of incidents affecting availability: Most incidents were caused  by system failures or technical failures (more than 70 % of the incidents) as a root cause. This has been the  dominant root cause for all the reporting years so far. System failures was also the most common root cause  for all the main services when looking at them separately and also the main root cause for all services, both  classic and other services. In the system failures category, software bugs and hardware failures were the  most common causes. The assets most often affected by system failures were switches and routers, and  mobile base stations.   Third party failures continue to affect a considerable part of the total number of incidents: 21.5% of all  incidents were caused by third party failures, a significant increase from last year (15,2%). Third party failure  incidents are of high importance as they represent incidents completely out of the control of the provider.  Therefore, such kind of incidents are complex and difficult to tackle. System failures followed by human  errors were the most common cause category for third party failures also.   Malware is causing increasingly long lasting incidents: In last year’s analysis incidents caused by malicious  actions (e.g. malware and DDoS), although we didn’t have too many of them, had most impact in terms of  duration. This year, a single incident of malware caused the most impact in terms of average duration and  user-hours lost. This change is strongly related to large DDoS attacks of last year. Last 2 years of reporting  have certainly showed that cyber-attacks can also aim at creating long lasting disruptions in Telecom.  As the legal landscape affecting the Telecom industry has undergone recent updates, it is our opinion that the new  improvements will certainly contribute to a more secured and harmonised telecommunications environment across  Europe21. Covering a wider range of threats and types of incidents that can affect telecommunications can be key in  better understanding the challenges within the sector, and dealing with their main causes. The electronic  telecommunication industry has reached a certain level of maturity among other IT related sectors, but the threat  level is still high, maintained by the importance of the sector, as an infrastructure provider for the digital economy.  21 https://www.dotmagazine.online/issues/connecting-the-world-whats-it-worth/challenges-in-eu-telecom-security  https://www.dotmagazine.online/issues/connecting-the-world-whats-it-worth/challenges-in-eu-telecom-security  Annual Incident Reports 2016  June 2017  34  ENISA, in the context of the Article 13a Expert Group10, will continue discussing specific incidents in more detail with  the NRAs, and if needed, discuss and agree on mitigating measures. ENISA will also continue to give support to other  sectors that are developing network and information security incident reporting schemes.  ENISA would like to take this opportunity to thank the NRAs, Ministries and the European Commission for a fruitful  collaboration and we look forward to leveraging this kind of reporting to further improve the security and resilience  of the electronic communications sector in the EU and more generally for supervision of security also in other critical  sectors.

First, it has been developed to enable the Agency to fully exploit its permanent mandate  and fulfil all the tasks given to it by the EU Cybersecurity Act (CSA), while taking into  account all other changes in the EU’s regulatory framework. All the activities and  outputs in this work programme stem from, and are clearly derived from, the statutory  obligations of the Agency; none of the statutory tasks is neglected.  Moreover, the planning document also makes full use of the different statutory bodies  set up by the CSA (such as the National Liaison Officers (NLO) Network) and EU law to  guide and help the Agency to design and validate the specific deliverables that the Agency  will produce across the activities anticipated in this SPD. This will ensure that the activities  undertaken in accordance with this SPD will be carried out in cooperation and in synergy  with all relevant actors at EU and national levels.  The new SPD is fully aligned with and incorporates the changes introduced to the  design and set-up of the SPDs of EU bodies, as adopted by the European Commission  in April 20201.  Second, the new SPD is in line with ENISA’s new strategy, which was adopted by  the management board in June 2020 and has been used as a baseline to set the  strategic objectives and priorities for programming the Agency’s work using a  multiannual framework.  Third, this programming document has been drawn up in parallel with the reorganisation  of the Agency, which was agreed by the management board in June 2020 and will become  effective on 1 January 2021, the same day that this SPD will become operational. As the  1 Communication from the Commission on the strengthening of the governance of Union bodies under  Article 70 of the Financial Regulation 2018/1046 and on the guidelines for the Single Programming Document  and the Consolidated Annual Activity Report, C(2020)2297 final, 20.04.2020, Brussels.  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2021–2023 7  new organisational structure aligns the tasks and functions of the Agency’s structural set- up with the CSA, it will not only allow more efficient delivery of the activities foreseen in  the SPD but also ensure that there are sufficient capabilities within the Agency to fulfil its  obligations and undertakings in an effective manner.  Finally, this SPD acknowledges and takes into account the ever-shifting cyber  landscape and evolving wider socioeconomic context. The COVID-19 crisis has  demonstrated the ability of the Agency to rapidly shift its priorities, as well as rise to  the challenge of catering for the cybersecurity needs of a society that has undergone  a massive digital transition of its functions, posing new risks as well as opportunities.  This SPD, while being clear on the scope of different activities and outputs, allows  for sufficient flexibility in designing individual deliverables to ensure that the  Agency’s activities and contributions will be able to take into account the most recent  developments, thus providing high added value to the EU at large and the best value  for money for the European taxpayer.  Juhan Lepassaar Executive Director  88  The mission of the European Union Agency for  Cybersecurity (ENISA) is to achieve a high common  level of cybersecurity across the Union in cooperation  with the wider community. It does this through acting  as a centre of expertise on cybersecurity, collecting  and providing independent, high quality technical  advice and assistance to Member States and EU  bodies on cybersecurity. It contributes to developing  and implementing the Union’s cyber policies.  Our aim is to strengthen trust in the connected  economy, boost resilience and trust of the Union’s  infrastructure and services and keep our society and  citizens digitally secure. We aspire to be an agile,  environmentally and socially responsible organisation  focused on people.  MISSION STATEMENT  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2021–2023 9  STRATEGY  EMPOWERING COMMUNITIES  Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. Europe  strives for a cross sectoral, all-inclusive cooperation  framework. ENISA plays a key role in stimulating  active cooperation between the cybersecurity  stakeholders in Member States and the EU  institutions and agencies. It strives to ensure  complementarity of common efforts, by adding  value to the stakeholders, exploring synergies and  effectively using limited cybersecurity expertise and  resources. Communities should be empowered to  scale up the cybersecurity model.  CYBERSECURITY POLICY  Cybersecurity is the cornerstone of digital  transformation and the need for it permeates  all sectors, therefore it needs to be considered  across a broad range of policy fields and initiatives.  Cybersecurity must not be restricted to a specialist  community of technical cyber experts. Cybersecurity  must therefore be embedded across all domains of  EU policy. Avoiding fragmentation and the need for  a coherent approach while taking into account the  specificities of each sector is essential.  OPERATIONAL COOPERATION  The benefits of the European digital economy and  society can only be fully attained under the premise  of cybersecurity. Cyber-attacks know no borders.  All layers of society can be impacted and the Union  needs to be ready to respond to massive (large scale  and cross-border) cyber-attacks and cyber crisis.  Cross-border interdependencies have highlighted  the need for effective cooperation between Member  States and the EU institutions for faster response and  proper coordination of efforts at all levels (strategic,  operational, technical and communications).  CAPACITY BUILDING  The frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks  is rising speedily, while at the same time the use of  ICT infrastructures and technologies by individuals,  organisations, and industries is increasing rapidly. The  needs for cybersecurity knowledge and competences  exceeds the supply. The EU has to invest in building  competences and talents in cybersecurity at all levels,  from the non-expert to the highly skilled professional.  The investments should focus not only on increasing  the cybersecurity skillset in the Member States but  also on making sure that the different operational  communities possess the appropriate capacity to deal  with the cyber threat landscape.  10  TRUSTED SOLUTION  Digital products and services bring benefits as well  as risks, and these risks must be identified and  mitigated. In the process of evaluating security of  digital solutions and ensuring their trustworthiness,  it is essential to adopt a common approach, with the  goal to strike a balance between societal, market,  economic and cybersecurity needs. A neutral  entity acting in a transparent manner will increase  customer trust on digital solutions and the wider  digital environment.  FORESIGHT  Numerous new technologies, still in their infancy or  close to mainstream adoption, would benefit from  the use of foresight methods. Through a structured  process enabling dialogue among stakeholders,  decision- and policy-makers would be able to define  early mitigation strategies that improve the EU  resilience to cybersecurity threats and find solutions  to address emerging challenges.  Empowering  Communities  Cybersecurity  Policy  Operational  Cooperation  Capacity  Building  Trusted  Solutions  Foresight  Knowledge  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2021–2023 11  KNOWLEDGE  The energy that fuels the mill of cybersecurity is  information and knowledge. For cybersecurity  professionals to be efficient at tackling our objectives,  to work in a constantly moving environment in  terms of digital developments as well as with  regard to actors, to face the challenges of our  time, we need a continuous process of collecting,  organising, summarising, analysing, communicating,  and maintaining cybersecurity information and  knowledge. All phases are essential to ensure that  information and knowledge is shared and expanded  within the EU cybersecurity ecosystem.  I  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2021–2023 13  On 27 November 2019, during the plenary session in  Strasbourg, President von der Leyen presented the  views and objectives of the European Commission for  the entirety of its mandate 2019–2024, noting that2:  … cyber security and digitalisation are two sides of the  same coin. This is why cyber security is a top priority.  For the competitiveness of European companies we have  to have stringent security requirements and a unified  European approach. We have to share our knowledge  of the dangers. We need a common platform, we need  an enhanced European Cybersecurity Agency. That is  the only way we can strengthen trust in the connected  economy and boost resilience to dangers of all kinds.  We can do all this if we act together, if we build on  our European values. And by doing so I am confident  that Europe will play a leading role in the digital age.  Europe can do it!  With the enactment of the Cybersecurity Act (CSA)  in June 2019, the European Union Agency for  Cybersecurity (ENISA) became a key instrument for  realising the EU’s ambition of significantly reinforcing  cybersecurity across Europe. The strengthened  and expanded tasks of the Agency in the field of  operational cooperation were tested in 2020 with the  need to ensure adequate cybersecurity throughout  the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis  2 Ursula von der Leyen, President-elect of the European  Commission, ‘Speech in the European Parliament Plenary  Session: As delivered’, pp. 9–10 (https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/ info/files/comm-2019-00612-00-00-en-tra-00_0.pdf).  presenting the Agency with a challenge. Acting in  the context of Article 7 of the CSA, ENISA undertook  a number of activities3 that played an important  role in helping EU bodies coordinate their activities  throughout the initial phases of the pandemic and  in raising the resilience of the EU. These practical  steps and actions are not expected to be one-off  endeavours, but will continue to be pursued through  the evolving Blueprint and could be merged, if  necessary, with the Joint Cyber Unit framework,  as this concept, announced by President von der  Leyen in 2019, is due to be developed further. The  year 2021 will also mark the point when structured  cooperation between ENISA and CERT-EU in the field  of operational cooperation (pending endorsement by  the management board) becomes fully operational,  influencing the activities anticipated in the 2021 work  programme of this SPD and beyond.  The CSA also set up a framework for European  cybersecurity certification schemes with a view to  creating a digital single market for ICT products,  services and processes. The Agency began to execute  this function fully in 2020, in particular for candidate  schemes for common criteria and cloud services. This  work will continue in 2021, taking into account not  3 Including initiating contacts with the European Commission,  the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation’s  (Europol) European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) and the Computer  Emergency Response Team for the EU (CERT-EU) to establish an  information exchange network, which subsequently attracted the  participation of the European External Action Service (EEAS) and the  Council of the European Union; contributing to the technical annex  of the Commission’s recommendation on contact tracing apps.  PART I GENERAL CONTEXT  https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/comm-2019-00612-00-00-en-tra-00_0.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/comm-2019-00612-00-00-en-tra-00_0.pdf  14  only the demands of the emerging EU rolling work  programme for European cybersecurity certification,  but also the increasing calls to take practical steps  in order to ensure the EU’s digital sovereignty and  autonomy. The need to contribute to raising the  competitiveness of the European cybersecurity  market and industry, including by advising and  assisting EU bodies (including the Cybersecurity  Competence Centre and Network4) in setting  cybersecurity research and innovation priorities, as  well as by providing regular insights into how both  the supply side and the demand side of the market  function, will begin in 2021 and continue to grow in  the years to come.  The Agency will continue to support EU decision- making institutions in relation to the announced  review of the security of networks and information  systems (NIS) directive. This renewal and  strengthening of a key pillar of the EU’s regulatory  framework, which underpins the cybersecurity of  critical sectors across our society, could further  make use of the expanded and permanent mandate  given to the Agency and thus also influence the  development of the ENISA work programme in the  years to come. The Agency will need to anticipate  and be ready to contribute to the development and  implementation of EU laws and policies in different  sectors, including in relation to the European  Electronic Communications Code (EECC), by providing  expertise in and technical input to cybersecurity  aspects across different policy fields and helping to  fulfil new tasks, should it be called to do so by EU  institutions and Member States.  Beyond the context of political and legislative  developments, the COVID-19 pandemic has  dramatically altered the EU’s economic outlook and  posed new challenges to the functioning of European  society. The almost overnight global transition  to digital solutions, in order to keep the essential  functions of societies working across different fields,  is unprecedented. Never before have people been  forced to embrace the digital world over the physical  world on such a scale, and this poses new risks, as  well as challenges, in terms of ensuring a high level  of cybersecurity across the EU. The Agency, rising to  meet this challenge, has dramatically increased its  capabilities, as well as channelled resources to this  work programme, to assist with capacity-building  4 In September 2018, the European Commission proposed a  regulation setting up a European Cybersecurity Competence  Centre and Network. The (draft) regulation ensures cooperation  and complementarity with ENISA. In particular, ENISA will have  an important role in contributing to the Centre’s strategic role  in coordinating cybersecurity technology-related investments  by the EU, Member States and industry. The Council agreed  its negotiating position in June 2020 and the trilogies with the  European Parliament began in summer 2020.  activities in critical areas touched by the crisis. It has  furthermore prioritised both targeted and general  actions to raise awareness of and foster education  in cybersecurity.  During these unprecedented times, it is more  important than ever that the Agency increases its  outreach activities and builds and utilises synergies  among all relevant actors at the EU level and beyond,  to ensure a coherent and joined-up approach to  enhancing cybersecurity across the EU, as well  as contributing to efforts to ensure that global  developments across the cybersecurity landscape  are aligned with and enlightened by the EU’s values,  to increase its competitiveness. The development of  stakeholder and international strategies of the Agency  will establish important baselines that will frame  actions to this end, and thus impact the evolvement  of the work programme in the future.  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2021–2023 15  PART I. General context  II  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2021–2023 17  Europe has for decades taken steps to improve  digital security and trust through policies and  initiatives. The management board of ENISA  adopted a new strategy for the Agency in June  2020, which builds on the CSA and outlines how  the Agency will strive to meet the expectations of  the cybersecurity ecosystem in the long term in a  manner that is open, innovative and agile, as well  as being socially and environmentally responsible.  The strategy sets out a vision of ‘a trusted and  cybersecure Europe’ in which all citizens and  organisations of Europe not only benefit from but  also are key components in the effort to secure  Europe. Importantly, the new ENISA strategy  outlines seven strategic objectives, which are  derived from the CSA and set the expected long- term goals for the Agency.  The most fundamental objective, which weaves across  all other objectives because of the nature of cyber- security being a shared responsibility, is the strategic  objective of empowered and engaged communities  across the cybersecurity ecosystem. The Agency  strives to ensure complementarity of common efforts,  exploring synergies and the effective use of limited  cybersecurity expertise and resources, which can be  achieved only through organised interactions between  all players in the cybersecurity ecosystem.  The following two strategic objectives both have  an integral role in relation to the other strategic  objectives because they are the lenses with which  the other objectives operate. The objective of  foresight on emerging and future cybersecurity  challenges provides an understanding of  emerging trends and patterns in order to define  early mitigation strategies that improve the EU’s  resilience to cybersecurity threats.  The energy that fuels the mill of cybersecurity  is information and knowledge, which relates to  the strategic objective of efficient and effective  cybersecurity information and knowledge  management for Europe. To address the challenges  of our time, we need to undergo a continuous  process of collecting, organising, summarising,  analysing, communicating and maintaining  cybersecurity information and knowledge. All of these  phases are essential for ensuring that information  and knowledge are shared and expanded within the  EU cybersecurity ecosystem.  The remaining strategic objectives tackle vertical  domains of cybersecurity. The strategic objective of  cybersecurity as an integral part of EU policies  seeks to embed cybersecurity across all domains  of EU policy. Avoiding fragmentation and ensuring  a coherent approach while taking into account the  specificities of each sector are essential.  The strategic objective of effective cooperation  among operational actors within the EU in case  of massive cyber incidents seeks to strengthen  effective cooperation between Member States and EU  PART II MULTIANNUAL  PROGRAMMING  2021–2023  17  1818  institutions in order to respond to large-scale cross- border cyberattacks and cyber crises.  The strategic objective of cutting-edge competences  and capabilities in cybersecurity across the EU  seeks to address the gap between the supply of and  need for cybersecurity knowledge and competences  and ensure that different operational communities  have the appropriate capacity to deal with the  cyberthreat landscape.  The strategic objective of a high level of trust  in secure digital solutions seeks to generate  trust in citizens with regard to ICT products,  services and processes through the deployment  of certification schemes.

ENISA’s foresight and advice on cybersecurity  challenges and opportunities (including in research)  ENISA’s strategy also establishes a set of values  that guide the execution of its mandate and its  functioning, as follows.  Community mindset. ENISA works with  communities, respecting their competences and  expertise, and fosters synergies and trust to best  achieve its mission.  Excellence. ENISA aims for state-of-the-art expertise  in its work, upholds the highest quality standards of  operation and evaluates its performance to strive for  continuous improvement through innovation and  foresight.  Integrity/ethics. ENISA upholds ethical principles  and EU-relevant rules and obligations with regard  to its services and working environment, ensuring  fairness and inclusiveness.  Respect. ENISA respects fundamental European  rights and values in all its services and its working  environment, as well as the expectations of its  stakeholders.  Responsibility. ENISA assumes responsibility,  ensuring the integration of social and environmental  dimensions into practices and procedures.  Transparency. ENISA adopts procedures,  structures and processes that are open, factual  and independent, thus limiting bias, ambiguity, fraud  and obscurity.  Those values are built on the ethos of the CSA, and  in particular the objectives set out in Articles 3(4) and  4(1), and have been encapsulated into two corporate  objectives, which form the baseline from which the  multiannual activities of the SPD will be delivered.  The corporate objective of sound resource and  risk management is derived from requirements in  Article 4(1) of the CSA, which obliges the Agency to  ‘be a centre of expertise on cybersecurity by virtue  of its independence, the scientific and technical  quality of the advice and assistance it delivers, the  information it provides, the transparency of its  operating procedures, the methods of operation, and  its diligence in carrying out its tasks’. In addition, the  inspiration for this corporate objective stems from the  values of excellence and transparency derived from  the ENISA strategy and the principle of efficiency set  out in the management board decision MB/2020/5  on the principles to be applied for organising ENISA.  The aim is for ENISA to uphold the highest quality of  standards, strive for continuous improvement and  enhance the organisation’s performance.  The corporate objective of building an agile  organisation focused on people is derived from  requirements in Article 3(4) of the CSA, which obliges  the Agency to ‘develop its own resources, including …  human capabilities and skills, necessary to perform  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2021–2023 2121  PART II. Multiannual programming  2021–2023  Strategic objective Actions to  achieve  objective  Article of  the CSA  Expected results Key performance indicator Metrics  SO5 – High level of trust  in secure digital solutions  Activities 6  and 7  Article 8 •  Support for schemes chosen to run under the  European cybersecurity certification framework  •  Certified ICT products, services and processes  are preferred by consumers and, where relevant,  Operators of Essential Services and Digital  Service Providers  Uptake of the European cybersecurity  certification framework and schemes as an  enabler of secure digital solutions  Effective preparation of candidate  certification schemes prepared by ENISA  1.  Number of stakeholders (governments or commercial solution  providers) on the EU market using the cybersecurity certification  framework for their digital solutions  2.  Citizens’ trust in digital solutions 3.  Satisfaction with ENISA’s support for the preparation of candidate  schemes (survey)  •  Where relevant, contribution towards a more  competitive European cybersecurity industry, small  and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups  Recognition of ENISA’s supporting  role for participants in the European  cybersecurity market  1.  Number of market analyses, guidelines and good practices issued  by ENISA  2.  Uptake of lessons learned / recommendations from ENISA reports 3.  Stakeholder satisfaction with the added value and quality of  ENISA’s work  SO6 – Foresight  on emerging and  future cybersecurity  challenges and  SO7 – Efficient and  effective cybersecurity  information and  knowledge management  for Europe  Activity 8 Articles 9  and 11  •  Decisions about cybersecurity are future-proof  and take account of trends, developments and  knowledge across the ecosystem  •  Stakeholders receive relevant and timely information  for policy- and decision-making  ENISA’s ability to contribute to Europe’s  cyber resilience through the provision  of timely and effective information and  knowledge  1.  Number of users and frequency of use of dedicated portal  (observatory)  2.  Number of recommendations, analyses and challenges identified  and analysed  3.  Stakeholder satisfaction with the usefulness, relevance and  timeliness of ENISA’s foresight and advice on cybersecurity  challenges and opportunities (including in research)  the tasks assigned to it under this Regulation’. In  addition, the inspiration for this corporate objective  stems from the values of responsibility and  respect derived from the ENISA strategy and the  principle of competences set out in management  board decision MB/2020/5 on the principles to be  applied for organising ENISA. The aim is for ENISA  to respect fundamental European rights and values  in its working environment, assume responsibility  for the social and environmental dimensions of  its procedures and develop its staff competences,  expertise and talent.  2222  Table 2.

With the enactment of the CSA both staff numbers  and the financial resources of the agency have grown,  reflecting the expanded tasks and mandate of the  Agency. The Agency has historically found it very  hard to recruit and retain the talent it needs to fulfil  its mandate as the job market for cybersecurity skills  is highly specialised and extremely competitive. This  ‘deficiency’ was reflected in the average occupancy  rate of the establishment plan, which was 88.3 % in  2017–2019. In turn, the unfulfilled posts have been  a source of ‘systemic surpluses’ within the Agency’s  budget, requiring some amendments over the  financial year to absorb the funds that were not used  for staff salaries.  The occupancy rate of the establishment plan has  also been a cause for concern in 2019 and 2020  for a number of reasons, including the mid-year  enactment of the CSA in 2019, which put a stress  on recruitment, and the outbreak of the COVID-19  pandemic, which delayed the launch and conduct of  recruitment operations in 2020, as well as the change  in senior manager, development of a new strategy  for the Agency and launch of reorganisation, all of  which have complicated the process of defining the  competences and talent that the Agency requires to  fulfil its new objectives and functions.  Table 3.  2019 2020  Establishment plan posts 59 69  Occupancy rate (%) 87 75*  *As of July 2020; this rate is expected to grow significantly by the  end of the year.  To overcome these challenges, at the beginning of  2020 the Agency embarked on a large-scale novel  recruitment exercise with the aim of creating a  sufficiently diverse and broad reserve shortlist of 75  candidates with more transversal competences and  skills that could be used to recruit staff into grades  AD6–AD8 and functions and thus fill the gaps in the  current establishment plan, as well as serve as a pool  of candidates for the establishment plan in 2021 and  2022 if necessary. The call, which was accompanied  by a widespread promotion campaign, attracted  1 235 candidates (who submitted more than 1 600  applications) across all Member States (please see  graph below), a result that is unprecedented in the  history of the Agency. This has already resulted in  a reserve shortlist of 69 candidates, from which  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2021–2023 2323  PART II. Multiannual programming  2021–2023  Table 2.

This outcome  needs to be added to the ongoing contracts agent  call, which has attracted over 600 applications and is  currently ongoing.  While the gender balance in the Agency follows trends  in technology-dominated areas of the job market,  the Agency proactively pursues gender balance with  varying degrees of success. Agency staff citizenship  is dominated by citizens of Member State of seat  agreement, and to a lesser extent by citizens of  neighbouring Member States; however, the diversity  of candidates responding to the ongoing call might  remedy this to some extent. Although geographical  balance is a chronic issue, in the job market of the  host Member State, ENISA represents a sound  Figure 1.

Overall,  the situation of the Agency is not that dissimilar to the  situation of other agencies.  Further information on appraisal of performance and  reclassification/promotions, mobility policy, gender  and geographical balance and schooling is provided  in the annexes to this report.  2.1.2. Outlook for 2021–2023  In terms of the evolution of tasks, the CSA set out new  levels of performance and cooperation that need  to be met by the Agency’s staff. In addition, and as  noted in Section I, the expected political and legislative  developments place a demand on the Agency to develop  the necessary skills and expertise to cater for increasing  needs in fulfilling its mandate in the field of operational  cooperation, as well as international cooperation, both  of which are relatively new tasks for the Agency.  The overarching need to grow the Agency’s  capabilities can be met by either (a) developing talent  and measuring staff performance or (b) recruiting  new staff who possess the competences required to  meet the requirements of the CSA.  With regard to competence development, the Agency  already has experience in learning and development  that continuously produces outcomes in the areas  of cybersecurity, project management, finance, etc.  The area of performance management currently  covers annual appraisals, reclassification and the  linking of appraisals with training needs. There is  a need, however, to develop more precise metrics  for performance management and use information  systems to this end, a process that has been kick- started with this SPD.  The shift in the profiles of newly recruited staff is  also likely to lead to benefits for the Agency as it is  expected that greater collaboration across agency  verticals will be instigated. The push towards  interdisciplinary and social science-based profiles is  likely to support the areas that the Agency expects to  develop in the years to come.  Better retention rates have lowered the impact of  staff turnover on the Agency and, combined with the  outcome of the 2020 temporary agents call, which  has provided the agency with a sufficient number of  shortlisted candidates to enable rapid recruitment,  it is anticipated that in the next few years payroll  expenditure will become more predictable, as the  Agency has historically implemented the establishment  plan as approved by the budgetary authority. The  Agency has provided significant, albeit not always  balanced, opportunities for reclassification to its staff.  While mobility in the Agency has been a continuing  concern of management, several readjustments of its  resources have taken effect over the past few years in  an effort to seek the right balance between tasks and  performance. The Agency will have have adapted its  resources to the new environment set up by the CSA  by the end of 2020.  In contrast to the three initial management posts,  in the past 8 years the Agency has relied on a high  number of management posts, which has allowed  for a broader distribution of tasks and possibly more  targeted control at the various stages of processing of  tasks. However, with the implementation of the new  structure in 2021, the number of middle management  posts is expected to decrease and stabilise, from eight  to six. It is hereby affirmed that the executive director  is the senior manager of the Agency.  2.1.3. Resource programming  for 2021–2023  2.1.3.1. Financial resources  The evolution of the planned total EU contribution  for 2021–2023, as well as for the full period of the  new multiannual financial framework 2021–2027, is  not yet available. As part of the CSA, the estimated  impact on expenditure was indicated for the period  2019–2022, which is presented in the table 4 below.  Average growth during 2019–2022 is expected to be  12 %. A similar growth trend is expected for 2023.  Table 4.  2019 2020 2021 2022  Total  appropriations  for ENISA  (thousand EUR)  16 550 21 683 23 433 24 227  95 % of ENISA’s revenue in 2019 came from the  EU contribution, 2 % was from the European Free  Trade Association (EFTA) country contribution  and 3 % was from other contributions (Table 6 in  Annex III). A similar trend is expected for 2021–2023.  The EU contribution for 2021 is estimated to be  EUR 22.3 million, the EFTA contribution is estimated  to be EUR 0.5 million and other contributions, mainly  from the Hellenic Authorities, are expected to be  EUR 0.6 million.  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2021–2023 2525  PART II. Multiannual programming  2021–2023  The general allocation of funds between titles is  expected to remain at a similar level in 2021–2023  to that in 2019 (Table 8 in Annex III). Expenditure in  2020 is expected to be EUR 21.7 million, of which  EUR 11.2 million in Title 1 covers all staff-related costs,  EUR 3.2 million in Title 2 covers main items such as  building rental and ICT expenses, and EUR 7.3 million  in Title 3 covers all core operating expenditure.  2.1.4. Strategy for achieving  efficiency gains  ENISA is committed to continue to implement  measures to obtain efficiency gains in all activities.  The new structure of the organisation, adopted and  endorsed by its management board in June 2020, has  been developed to specifically achieve and follow the  principles of sound budgetary management and build  efficiencies in both executing its core mandate and  fulfilling its corporate functions.  Within the domain of its operational activities,  the Agency is revolutionising its approach by  implementing its work programme in such a way  as to ensure efficiencies and maximise its added  value. In particular, it will seek to systematically use  its statutory bodies (National Liaison Officers (NLO)  Network, ENISA Advisory Group), as well as other  statutory groups that it is involved in (Stakeholder  Cybersecurity Certification Group (SCCG), as set out  in CSA Article 22, NIS Cooperation Group (NIS CG)  and its workstreams, expert groups created under  EU law) and its own ad hoc expert groups, where  appropriate, to peer review the scope and direction  of actions undertaken to achieve outputs, as well as  validate the results. In this way the Agency will fulfil  its obligation as outlined in Article 3(3) of the CSA  to avoid the duplication of Member State activities  and take into consideration existing Member State  expertise. Hence, all activities listed in Sections 3.1  and 3.2 of this SPD include an indication of how  specific deliverables and other actions undertaken  to achieve the outputs will be validated and peer  reviewed or consulted as per the legal framework in  the area of certification.  The Agency is also setting up a framework for  structured cooperation with CERT-EU to utilise  synergies and avoid the duplication of activities  in executing its tasks in the field of operational  cooperation (Article 7 of the CSA). In addition, the  establishment of a local office in Brussels should  enable the Agency to create further collaborations  with other EU institutions, agencies and bodies with  regard to these and other activities. The Agency is  also pursuing cooperation with relevant EU bodies  (Joint Research Centre) and will embark on creating  synergies with the Cybersecurity Competence  Centre and Network once it is established to enable  collaboration in fulfilling its tasks in the field of  research and innovation (Article 11 of the CSA).  In its corporate functions, ENISA further seeks  to rationalise its internal processes to improve  its overall efficiency and benchmark its activities  against best practices implemented by other EU  institutions and agencies. The Agency is continuing  and further expanding the sharing of services among  other EU agencies. A number of collaborations and  agreements are currently in place (with the European  Union Agency for the Operational Management  of Large-scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom,  Security and Justice (EU-LISA), European Union  Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO)) and in 2020 the  Agency signed a service-level agreement with the  European Centre for the Development of Vocational  Training (Cedefop), which is also located in Greece,  to enable further collaboration. This will include the  setting up of a joint compliance function and the  sharing of procurement procedures.  Prompted by the COVID-19 crisis, the Agency is  reviewing its digital and tele-working framework  and will embark on actively seeking efficiency  gains through the digitalisation of its functions in  all endeavours. It is already using EU tools such  as accrual-based accounting (ABAC), ABAC assets,  procurement and e-invoicing. Furthermore, in 2020,  the Agency deployed Sysper and it is examining  the migration of its services to other tools, such as  Mission Processing System (MIPS) and eRecruitment.  The Agency is using a basic workflow application  called Paperless that makes handwritten signatures  for internal approval redundant. Most administrative  tasks are already supported by Paperless and  other applications, which has enabled significant  steps to be taken towards the aim of implementing  100% e-administration.  E-training is also encouraged internally with the aim,  among other things, of reducing the associated costs  of ‘classroom’ training (e.g. travelling costs). However,  in view of the COVID-19 pandemic the Agency will  also review the training, conferences and seminars  provided for external parties and upgrade its  capabilities to use secure digital conferencing across  the field, providing further opportunities for efficiency  gains, as well as expanding the scale and scope of  its activities.  26  III  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2021–2023 27  This section describes the main body of the work  programme, what the Agency aims to deliver in 2021  towards achieving its strategy and the expected  results. In total, nine operational activities and two  corporate activities have been identified to support  the implementation of ENISA’s mandate in 2021.  PART III WORK PROGRAMME  FOR 2021  28  3.1. OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES  Activity 1: Providing assistance on policy development  Overview of activity  This activity delivers assistance and advice to the EU and Member States in developing cybersecurity policy and  sector-specific policy and law initiatives where matters related to cybersecurity are involved.  The activity seeks to bolster policy initiatives on novel/emerging technology areas by providing technical, fact-driven  and tailor-made cybersecurity advice and recommendations. In addition to providing support in emerging policy  areas (such as artificial intelligence, 5G and response to current and future crises), ENISA – in coordination with the  European Commission and Member States – will also conduct policy scouting to support them to identify potential  areas for policy development, as well as develop monitoring capabilities and tools to regularly and consistently be  able to give advice on the effectiveness of existing EU policy and law.  The added value of this activity is to support decision-makers in a timely manner with regard to developments at the  technological, societal or economic market level that affect the cybersecurity policy framework (see also Activity 8).  Given the cross-cutting nature of cybersecurity across the policy landscape, the activity will provide not only an up-to- date risk-based analysis of cybersecurity in the areas of critical infrastructure and sectors, but also advice across the  field in an integrated and holistic manner.  The legal basis for this activity is Article 5 of the CSA.

ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2021–2023 29  PART III. Work Programme for the year 2021  Activity 2: Supporting implementation of Union policy and law  Overview of activity  This activity provides support to Member States and EU Institutions in the implementation of European cybersecurity  policy and legal frameworks and advice on specific cybersecurity aspects related to the NIS directive, telecom security  and the security of electronic communications, data protection, privacy, electronic identification (eID) and trust  services, incident notification and the general availability or integrity of the public core of the open internet. It further  supports initiatives related to implementation of policy frameworks on novel digital technologies such as artificial  intelligence, machine learning and the internet of things and networking technologies such as 5G (e.g. 5G security  toolbox) and assists with the work of the NIS Cooperation Group and its sectorial workstreams. Contribution by  ENISA in the European Commission’s regular monitoring of the implementation of specific EU policies is envisaged  that considers relevant indicators and could result in a contribution being made to a potential index for capturing the  maturity of relevant cybersecurity policies.  The activity helps to avoid fragmentation and supports the coherent implementation of the digital single market  across Member States.  The legal basis for this activity is Articles 5 and 6(1)b of the CSA.

Activity 10: Performance and risk management  Overview of activity  This activity seeks to achieve requirements set out in Article 4(1) of the CSA that set an objective for the Agency to  ‘be a centre of expertise on cybersecurity by virtue of its independence, the scientific and technical quality of the  advice and assistance it delivers, the information it provides, the transparency of its operating procedures, the  methods of operation, and its diligence in carrying out its tasks’. This objective requires an efficient performance  and risk management framework, which should be developed and implemented hand in hand with the imposition of  the new organisational set-up.  Under this activity ENISA will confinue to enhance key objectives of the reorganisation, as described in management  board decision MB/2020/5, including the need to adress the gaps in the Agency’s quality assessment framework,  install proper and functioning internal controls and compliance checks, make best use of the internal resources of  the Agency, impose sound financial and budgetary management, and utilise internal and external synergies within  ENISA. These aspects are addressed in the new organisational architecture, but should also be built into the daily  operations of the Agency, as guided by the work programme. The actions undertaken will ensure that the Agency’s  outputs add real value, by making performance and ex post and ex ante evaluation integral to the work programme  througout its lifecycle, including through rigorous quality assurance by carrying out proper project management,  internal peer review and independent audits and validations.  The legal basis for this activity is Articles 4(1) and 32 of the CSA, the latter of which strongly focuses on the sound  financial management principle with a view to maximise value for money.  Objectives  •  For the performance of ENISA to be fully compliant with legal and financial frameworks  (build a culture of compliance)  •  Increased effectiveness and efficiency in achieving the Agency’s objectives •  Protect the Agency’s assets and reputation, while reducing risks  Results Link to strategic objective (ENISA strategy)  •  Maximise value for money provided to stakeholders  and citizens  •  Build lasting credibility and trust  Sound resource and risk management  Outputs Key performance indicator  10.1.  Roll-out of an Agency-wide performance  management framework and systems across  its functions  10.2.  Develop, establish and implement a risk  management plan and systems, including an  anti-fraud strategy, a conflict of interest policy,  a whistleblowing policy, an information security  policy, an anti-harassment policy and an  intellectual property rights (IPR) policy  10.3.  Develop and implement an Agency-wide  IT strategy  10.4.  Carry out relevant training and develop  guidelines for staff  Indicator:  Organisational performance culture Metrics: 10.1.  Proportion of key performance indicators  reaching targets 10.2.  Individual contributions to achieving the  objectives of the Agency through clear links to key  performance indicators (CDR report)  10.3.  Exceptions in the risk register 10.4.  Number of complaints filed against ENISA,  including number of inquiries/complaints  submitted to the European Ombudsman  10.5.  Results of the annual risk assessment exercise 10.6.  Observations from external audit bodies (e.g.  ECoA) requiring follow-up actions by ENISA  (i.e. number of ‘critical’, ‘significant’ or ‘very  important’ findings)  Frequency: Annual  Validation Target groups and beneficiaries  •  Budget management committee •  ENISA ethics committee •  IPR management committee •  IT management committee •  Management team •  Staff committee  •  All stakeholders of the Agency •  Citizens  38  Activity 11: Staff development and working environment  Overview of activity  This activity seeks to support ENISA aspirations as stipulated in Article 3(4) of the CSA, which obliges the Agency to  ‘develop its own resources, including … human capabilities and skills, necessary to perform the tasks assigned to it  under this Regulation’.  Moreover, since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of organisations that have announced permanent  teleworking options has grown globally. This must accelerate a review of employer–employee relationships in the  Agency, with a view to introducing a more flexible (50/50) framework while maintaining and enhancing employee  motivation, efficiency and development, an option that was supported by 87 % of respondents to the staff survey  conducted in June 2020.  The actions that will be pursued under this activity will focus on attracting, retaining and developing talent and  building ENISA’s reputation as an employer of choice and an agile and knowledge-based organisation where staff can  evolve personally and professionaly, while keeping staff engaged and motivated and providing a sense of belonging.  The activity will seek to build an attractive workspace by establishing and maintaining excellent working conditions  (premises, layout of office space) and developing user-centric (tele)working and conferencing tools (including IT  systems and platforms) delivering state-of-the-art services and supporting ENISA’s business owners and stakeholders  in line with the Agency’s objectives.

The allocation was determined according to the direct  budget and number of full-time equivalents (FTEs)  indicated for each activity, with the indirect budget  being assigned based on causal relationships.  The following assumptions are used in the simplified  activity-based budgeting methodology.  The direct budget is the cost estimate for each of  the nine operational activities described in Section  III (and carried out under Articles 5–12) in terms of  goods and services to be procured.  The indirect budget is the cost estimate for  salaries and allowances, mission costs, buildings,  IT, equipment and miscellaneous operating  costs attributable to each activity. The indirect  budget is allocated to activities based on different  drivers. The main driver for cost allocation was  the estimated number of FTEs required for each  operational activity in 2021.

Furthermore, with its renewed mandate, ENISA was given greater competences but also greater financial resources, increasing its  budget by almost a factor of two in less than 3 years.  48  Table 8. For ENISA to review again  Expenditure (EUR) 2020* 2021  Commitment  appropriations  Payment  appropriations  Commitment  appropriations  Payment  appropriations  Title 1 11 203 334 11 203 334 10 775 409 10 775 409  Title 2 3 150 568 3 150 568 3 507 667 3 507 667  Title 3 7 328 981 7 328 981 9 150 000 9 150 000  Total expenditure 21 682 884 21 682 884 23 433 076 23 433 076  * As adopted in the amending budget 1/2020 (management board decision MB/2020/18).

Cancellation of commitment appropriations. In  2019 commitment appropriations were cancelled  for an amount of EUR 521 426, representing  3 % of the total budget. ENISA demonstrated a  commitment rate of 97 % of C1 appropriations  (appropriations for the respective year) at the  year-end (31 December 2019). The consumption  of the 2019 budget at year-end shows the capacity  of the Agency to fully implement its annual  appropriations. The payment rate reached 70 %  and the amount carried forward to 2020 was  EUR 4 347 332, representing 27 % of the total C1  appropriations in 2019.  Cancellation of payment appropriations for  the year. No payment appropriations were  cancelled during 2019.  Cancellation of payment appropriations carried  over (fund source C8 – appropriations carried  over automatically from 2018 to 2019). The  appropriations for 2018 carried over to 2019  were utilised at a rate of 95 % (automatic carry- overs), which indicates a satisfactory estimation  of needs. Of the EUR 1 232 263 carried forward,  an amount of EUR 62 522 was cancelled because  the estimated expenditure deviated from the  actual paid amount. This cancellation represents  0.4 % of the total budget for 2019.

Other reasons that may be cited are the need for stability during the start-up phase of the Agency, with staff  members from the hosting Member State (Greece) being less likely to resign (resulting in lower turnover), which,  because of the relatively young age of the Agency, is still having an impact; the relatively better academic profile  of Greek candidates applying for lower level posts; the relatively smaller payroll cost for Greek staff who are  better qualified than average and who do not require an expatriation allowance; and the general tendency for  people to remain in lower level positions in the home country.

All of these measures were taken within the scope of the agency’s activities and to the  extent possible given its infrastructure and location.  ENISA presently occupies part of a leased building in Athens. This unfortunately does  not allow the Agency to control the heating/cooling system or to access autonomous  electricity meters. The Agency is therefore unable to directly monitor these systems and  assess the impact of the greening measures implemented.  Therefore, ENISA has not been able to obtain Eco-Management and Audit Scheme  (EMAS) certification for its main office building considering the leasing restrictions.  However, it is envisaged that this certification will be obtained for the new premises to be  provided by the Hellenic Authorities. In anticipation of this, the Agency plans to conduct  an environmental audit of its activities, as well as pursue options to offset its carbon  emissions (including those produced through its missions).  60  ANNEX 7 BUILDING POLICY  As in the existing Seat Agreement between ENISA and the Greek government, which  entered into force on 4 October 2019, the Agency will continue to have premises in  Athens and Heraklion. The permanent seat of the Agency is in Athens, where the majority  of its staff are based, with a support office located in Heraklion.  At the time of this document the ENISA premises in Athens are privately owned and  rented by the Agency; in Heraklion the ENISA premises are located in a public building  made available by the Hellenic Authorities. The rent for the premises in Athens and  Heraklion is covered by the Hellenic Authorities, who provide up to EUR 640 000 per year.  The current building in Athens will not be able to accommodate all of the new staff  who will be joining the Agency in light of the new mandate, with an additional challenge  being that the current rental contract expires on 31 December 2021 with no possibility  of extension. ENISA has asked the Hellenic Authorities to find suitable premises to  accommodate the Agency in Athens. The Ministry of Digital Governance, representing  the Hellenic Authorities, is in charge of this dossier and has expressed a commitment to  find adequate long-term premises for the Agency. The selection of the new premises in  Athens will need to be completed by Q3 2020 to allow a smooth transition.  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2021–2023 61  ANNEX Privileges and immunities  ANNEX 8 PRIVILEGES  AND IMMUNITIES  Agency privileges  Privileges granted to staff  Protocol of privileges and immunities/ diplomatic status  Education/day  care  In accordance with Article 23 of Regulation  (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament  and of the Council of 17 April 2019, protocol  no 7 on the privileges and immunities of the  European Union, annexed to the Treaty on  European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the  Functioning of the European Union (TFEU),  applies to the Agency and its staff.  The Greek government and ENISA signed  a Seat Agreement on 13 November 2018,  which was ratified by Greek Law 4627/2019  on 25 September 2019 and entered into  force on 4 October 2019 and is applicable to  ENISA and its staff.  In accordance with Article 35 of Regulation  (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament  and of the Council of 17 April 2019,  the protocol no 7 on the privileges and  immunities of the European Union, annexed  to the TEU and the TFEU, applies to the  Agency and its staff.  The Greek government and ENISA signed  a Seat Agreement on 13 November 2018,  which was ratified by Greek Law 4627/2019  on 25 September 2019 and entered into force  on 4 October 2019 and is applicable to ENISA  and its staff.  A public school  of European  education of type  2 was founded in  2005 by the Greek  government in  Heraklion, Crete, for  the children of the  staff of ENISA.  There is no  European school  operating in Athens.  62  ANNEX 9 EVALUATIONS  External consultants are contracted to carry out annual ex post evaluations of operational  activities. The overall aim of the annual evaluations is to evaluate effectiveness, efficiency,  added value, utility, coordination and coherence.  ENISA uses an internal monitoring system that is intended to support the project  management function, which includes project delivery and allocation of resources. This  is used for regular reporting and managerial purposes by the ENISA management team.  Moreover, ENISA has implemented a mid-term review procedure and regular monthly  management team meetings. ENISA expects to undertake a study to upgrade the use of  an electronic tool for internal project management and overall delivery of the Agency’s  work programme.  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2021–2023 63  ANNEX Strategy for organisational management and internal control systems  ANNEX 10 STRATEGY FOR  ORGANISATIONAL  MANAGEMENT  AND INTERNAL  CONTROL SYSTEMS  The Agency’s strategy for effective internal control is based on best international practices  and on the internal control framework (COSO framework’s international standards).  The control environment is a set of standards for conduct, processes and structures that  provides the basis for effective internal control across ENISA. The management team sets  the tone at the top with respect to the importance of internal control, including expected  standards of conduct.  Risk assessment is the Agency’s dynamic and iterative process for identifying and  assessing risks that could affect the achievement of objectives and for determining how  such risks should be managed.  The control activities ensure the mitigation of risks related to the achievement of  policy, operational and internal control objectives. They are performed at all levels of  the organisation, at various stages of business processes and across the technology  environment. They may be preventative or detective and encompass a range of manual  and automated activities, as well as segregation of duties.  Information is necessary for the organisation to carry out internal control and to support  the achievement of objectives. In this respect external and internal communication need  to be considered. External communication provides the specific Agency stakeholders  and, globally, EU citizens with information on ENISA’s policies, objectives, actions and  achievements. Internal communication provides ENISA staff with the information required  to support the achievement of objectives and to enable awareness for day-to-day controls.  Continuous and specific assessments are used to ascertain whether or not each of the five  components of internal control is present and functioning. Continuous assessments, built  into business processes at different levels of the organisation, provide timely information  on any deficiencies. Findings are assessed and deficiencies are communicated and  corrected in a timely manner, with serious matters reported as appropriate.  The common approach on EU decentralised agencies foresees that EU agencies should  be more active concerning fraud prevention issues and that the related communication  forms an essential part of their success. In order to implement this approach, the  European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) has recommended that each agency should adopt an  anti-fraud strategy that is proportionate to its fraud risks. Rules for the prevention and  management of conflicts of interests are part of the anti-fraud strategy of the Agency.  64  ANNEX 11 GRANTS, CONTRIBUTIONS  AND SERVICE-LEVEL  AGREEMENTS  ENISA does not receive any form of grants.  As part of the host country agreement an annual contribution is received from the  Hellenic Authorities to cover leasing expenditures for the Agency’s offices (as per the Seat  Agreement – Greek Law 4627/2019). The 2019 contribution was EUR 435 844.  ENISA has signed a service-level agreement (SLA) with EU-LISA, an EU agency, for the  purposes of sharing its knowledge and resources related to the organisation of EU- LISA’s security exercises in 2019 and 2020, as well as making available its online exercise  platform. The income generated amounts to EUR 97 920 per year to cover staff costs and  overheads (two FTEs, equivalent to contract agent posts, are allocated to these tasks). The  amounts established in the agreement are based on a cost recovery policy, rather than  on generating any additional financial value for the parties involved.  The table below provides a summary of the SLAs and agreements of the Agency,  including the contracted amounts where necessary.

First, it has been developed to enable the Agency to fully exploit its permanent mandate  and fulfil all the tasks given to it by the EU Cybersecurity Act (CSA), while taking into  account all other changes in the EU’s regulatory framework. All the activities and  outputs in this work programme stem from, and are clearly derived from, the statutory  obligations of the Agency; none of the statutory tasks is neglected.  Moreover, the planning document also makes full use of the different statutory bodies  set up by the CSA (such as the National Liaison Officers (NLO) Network) and EU law to  guide and help the Agency to design and validate the specific deliverables that the Agency  will produce across the activities anticipated in this SPD. This will ensure that the activities  undertaken in accordance with this SPD will be carried out in cooperation and in synergy  with all relevant actors at EU and national levels.  The new SPD is fully aligned with and incorporates the changes introduced to the  design and set-up of the SPDs of EU bodies, as adopted by the European Commission  in April 20201.  Second, the new SPD is in line with ENISA’s new strategy, which was adopted by  the management board in June 2020 and has been used as a baseline to set the  strategic objectives and priorities for programming the Agency’s work using a  multiannual framework.  Third, this programming document has been drawn up in parallel with the reorganisation  of the Agency, which was agreed by the management board in June 2020 and will become  effective on 1 January 2021, the same day that this SPD will become operational. As the  1 Communication from the Commission on the strengthening of the governance of Union bodies under  Article 70 of the Financial Regulation 2018/1046 and on the guidelines for the Single Programming Document  and the Consolidated Annual Activity Report, C(2020)2297 final, 20.04.2020, Brussels.  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2021–2023 7  new organisational structure aligns the tasks and functions of the Agency’s structural set- up with the CSA, it will not only allow more efficient delivery of the activities foreseen in  the SPD but also ensure that there are sufficient capabilities within the Agency to fulfil its  obligations and undertakings in an effective manner.  Finally, this SPD acknowledges and takes into account the ever-shifting cyber  landscape and evolving wider socioeconomic context. The COVID-19 crisis has  demonstrated the ability of the Agency to rapidly shift its priorities, as well as rise to  the challenge of catering for the cybersecurity needs of a society that has undergone  a massive digital transition of its functions, posing new risks as well as opportunities.  This SPD, while being clear on the scope of different activities and outputs, allows  for sufficient flexibility in designing individual deliverables to ensure that the  Agency’s activities and contributions will be able to take into account the most recent  developments, thus providing high added value to the EU at large and the best value  for money for the European taxpayer.  Juhan Lepassaar Executive Director  88  The mission of the European Union Agency for  Cybersecurity (ENISA) is to achieve a high common  level of cybersecurity across the Union in cooperation  with the wider community. It does this through acting  as a centre of expertise on cybersecurity, collecting  and providing independent, high quality technical  advice and assistance to Member States and EU  bodies on cybersecurity. It contributes to developing  and implementing the Union’s cyber policies.  Our aim is to strengthen trust in the connected  economy, boost resilience and trust of the Union’s  infrastructure and services and keep our society and  citizens digitally secure. We aspire to be an agile,  environmentally and socially responsible organisation  focused on people.  MISSION STATEMENT  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2021–2023 9  STRATEGY  EMPOWERING COMMUNITIES  Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. Europe  strives for a cross sectoral, all-inclusive cooperation  framework. ENISA plays a key role in stimulating  active cooperation between the cybersecurity  stakeholders in Member States and the EU  institutions and agencies. It strives to ensure  complementarity of common efforts, by adding  value to the stakeholders, exploring synergies and  effectively using limited cybersecurity expertise and  resources. Communities should be empowered to  scale up the cybersecurity model.  CYBERSECURITY POLICY  Cybersecurity is the cornerstone of digital  transformation and the need for it permeates  all sectors, therefore it needs to be considered  across a broad range of policy fields and initiatives.  Cybersecurity must not be restricted to a specialist  community of technical cyber experts. Cybersecurity  must therefore be embedded across all domains of  EU policy. Avoiding fragmentation and the need for  a coherent approach while taking into account the  specificities of each sector is essential.  OPERATIONAL COOPERATION  The benefits of the European digital economy and  society can only be fully attained under the premise  of cybersecurity. Cyber-attacks know no borders.  All layers of society can be impacted and the Union  needs to be ready to respond to massive (large scale  and cross-border) cyber-attacks and cyber crisis.  Cross-border interdependencies have highlighted  the need for effective cooperation between Member  States and the EU institutions for faster response and  proper coordination of efforts at all levels (strategic,  operational, technical and communications).  CAPACITY BUILDING  The frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks  is rising speedily, while at the same time the use of  ICT infrastructures and technologies by individuals,  organisations, and industries is increasing rapidly. The  needs for cybersecurity knowledge and competences  exceeds the supply. The EU has to invest in building  competences and talents in cybersecurity at all levels,  from the non-expert to the highly skilled professional.  The investments should focus not only on increasing  the cybersecurity skillset in the Member States but  also on making sure that the different operational  communities possess the appropriate capacity to deal  with the cyber threat landscape.  10  TRUSTED SOLUTION  Digital products and services bring benefits as well  as risks, and these risks must be identified and  mitigated. In the process of evaluating security of  digital solutions and ensuring their trustworthiness,  it is essential to adopt a common approach, with the  goal to strike a balance between societal, market,  economic and cybersecurity needs. A neutral  entity acting in a transparent manner will increase  customer trust on digital solutions and the wider  digital environment.  FORESIGHT  Numerous new technologies, still in their infancy or  close to mainstream adoption, would benefit from  the use of foresight methods. Through a structured  process enabling dialogue among stakeholders,  decision- and policy-makers would be able to define  early mitigation strategies that improve the EU  resilience to cybersecurity threats and find solutions  to address emerging challenges.  Empowering  Communities  Cybersecurity  Policy  Operational  Cooperation  Capacity  Building  Trusted  Solutions  Foresight  Knowledge  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2021–2023 11  KNOWLEDGE  The energy that fuels the mill of cybersecurity is  information and knowledge. For cybersecurity  professionals to be efficient at tackling our objectives,  to work in a constantly moving environment in  terms of digital developments as well as with  regard to actors, to face the challenges of our  time, we need a continuous process of collecting,  organising, summarising, analysing, communicating,  and maintaining cybersecurity information and  knowledge. All phases are essential to ensure that  information and knowledge is shared and expanded  within the EU cybersecurity ecosystem.  I  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2021–2023 13  On 27 November 2019, during the plenary session in  Strasbourg, President von der Leyen presented the  views and objectives of the European Commission for  the entirety of its mandate 2019–2024, noting that2:  … cyber security and digitalisation are two sides of the  same coin. This is why cyber security is a top priority.  For the competitiveness of European companies we have  to have stringent security requirements and a unified  European approach. We have to share our knowledge  of the dangers. We need a common platform, we need  an enhanced European Cybersecurity Agency. That is  the only way we can strengthen trust in the connected  economy and boost resilience to dangers of all kinds.  We can do all this if we act together, if we build on  our European values. And by doing so I am confident  that Europe will play a leading role in the digital age.  Europe can do it!  With the enactment of the Cybersecurity Act (CSA)  in June 2019, the European Union Agency for  Cybersecurity (ENISA) became a key instrument for  realising the EU’s ambition of significantly reinforcing  cybersecurity across Europe. The strengthened  and expanded tasks of the Agency in the field of  operational cooperation were tested in 2020 with the  need to ensure adequate cybersecurity throughout  the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis  2 Ursula von der Leyen, President-elect of the European  Commission, ‘Speech in the European Parliament Plenary  Session: As delivered’, pp. 9–10 (https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/ info/files/comm-2019-00612-00-00-en-tra-00_0.pdf).  presenting the Agency with a challenge. Acting in  the context of Article 7 of the CSA, ENISA undertook  a number of activities3 that played an important  role in helping EU bodies coordinate their activities  throughout the initial phases of the pandemic and  in raising the resilience of the EU. These practical  steps and actions are not expected to be one-off  endeavours, but will continue to be pursued through  the evolving Blueprint and could be merged, if  necessary, with the Joint Cyber Unit framework,  as this concept, announced by President von der  Leyen in 2019, is due to be developed further. The  year 2021 will also mark the point when structured  cooperation between ENISA and CERT-EU in the field  of operational cooperation (pending endorsement by  the management board) becomes fully operational,  influencing the activities anticipated in the 2021 work  programme of this SPD and beyond.  The CSA also set up a framework for European  cybersecurity certification schemes with a view to  creating a digital single market for ICT products,  services and processes. The Agency began to execute  this function fully in 2020, in particular for candidate  schemes for common criteria and cloud services. This  work will continue in 2021, taking into account not  3 Including initiating contacts with the European Commission,  the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation’s  (Europol) European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) and the Computer  Emergency Response Team for the EU (CERT-EU) to establish an  information exchange network, which subsequently attracted the  participation of the European External Action Service (EEAS) and the  Council of the European Union; contributing to the technical annex  of the Commission’s recommendation on contact tracing apps.

The need to contribute to raising the  competitiveness of the European cybersecurity  market and industry, including by advising and  assisting EU bodies (including the Cybersecurity  Competence Centre and Network4) in setting  cybersecurity research and innovation priorities, as  well as by providing regular insights into how both  the supply side and the demand side of the market  function, will begin in 2021 and continue to grow in  the years to come.  The Agency will continue to support EU decision- making institutions in relation to the announced  review of the security of networks and information  systems (NIS) directive. This renewal and  strengthening of a key pillar of the EU’s regulatory  framework, which underpins the cybersecurity of  critical sectors across our society, could further  make use of the expanded and permanent mandate  given to the Agency and thus also influence the  development of the ENISA work programme in the  years to come. The Agency will need to anticipate  and be ready to contribute to the development and  implementation of EU laws and policies in different  sectors, including in relation to the European  Electronic Communications Code (EECC), by providing  expertise in and technical input to cybersecurity  aspects across different policy fields and helping to  fulfil new tasks, should it be called to do so by EU  institutions and Member States.  Beyond the context of political and legislative  developments, the COVID-19 pandemic has  dramatically altered the EU’s economic outlook and  posed new challenges to the functioning of European  society. The almost overnight global transition  to digital solutions, in order to keep the essential  functions of societies working across different fields,  is unprecedented. Never before have people been  forced to embrace the digital world over the physical  world on such a scale, and this poses new risks, as  well as challenges, in terms of ensuring a high level  of cybersecurity across the EU. The Agency, rising to  meet this challenge, has dramatically increased its  capabilities, as well as channelled resources to this  work programme, to assist with capacity-building  4 In September 2018, the European Commission proposed a  regulation setting up a European Cybersecurity Competence  Centre and Network.

It has  furthermore prioritised both targeted and general  actions to raise awareness of and foster education  in cybersecurity.  During these unprecedented times, it is more  important than ever that the Agency increases its  outreach activities and builds and utilises synergies  among all relevant actors at the EU level and beyond,  to ensure a coherent and joined-up approach to  enhancing cybersecurity across the EU, as well  as contributing to efforts to ensure that global  developments across the cybersecurity landscape  are aligned with and enlightened by the EU’s values,  to increase its competitiveness. The development of  stakeholder and international strategies of the Agency  will establish important baselines that will frame  actions to this end, and thus impact the evolvement  of the work programme in the future.  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2021–2023 15  PART I. General context  II  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2021–2023 17  Europe has for decades taken steps to improve  digital security and trust through policies and  initiatives. The management board of ENISA  adopted a new strategy for the Agency in June  2020, which builds on the CSA and outlines how  the Agency will strive to meet the expectations of  the cybersecurity ecosystem in the long term in a  manner that is open, innovative and agile, as well  as being socially and environmentally responsible.  The strategy sets out a vision of ‘a trusted and  cybersecure Europe’ in which all citizens and  organisations of Europe not only benefit from but  also are key components in the effort to secure  Europe. Importantly, the new ENISA strategy  outlines seven strategic objectives, which are  derived from the CSA and set the expected long- term goals for the Agency.  The most fundamental objective, which weaves across  all other objectives because of the nature of cyber- security being a shared responsibility, is the strategic  objective of empowered and engaged communities  across the cybersecurity ecosystem. The Agency  strives to ensure complementarity of common efforts,  exploring synergies and the effective use of limited  cybersecurity expertise and resources, which can be  achieved only through organised interactions between  all players in the cybersecurity ecosystem.  The following two strategic objectives both have  an integral role in relation to the other strategic  objectives because they are the lenses with which  the other objectives operate. The objective of  foresight on emerging and future cybersecurity  challenges provides an understanding of  emerging trends and patterns in order to define  early mitigation strategies that improve the EU’s  resilience to cybersecurity threats.  The energy that fuels the mill of cybersecurity  is information and knowledge, which relates to  the strategic objective of efficient and effective  cybersecurity information and knowledge  management for Europe. To address the challenges  of our time, we need to undergo a continuous  process of collecting, organising, summarising,  analysing, communicating and maintaining  cybersecurity information and knowledge. All of these  phases are essential for ensuring that information  and knowledge are shared and expanded within the  EU cybersecurity ecosystem.  The remaining strategic objectives tackle vertical  domains of cybersecurity. The strategic objective of  cybersecurity as an integral part of EU policies  seeks to embed cybersecurity across all domains  of EU policy. Avoiding fragmentation and ensuring  a coherent approach while taking into account the  specificities of each sector are essential.  The strategic objective of effective cooperation  among operational actors within the EU in case  of massive cyber incidents seeks to strengthen  effective cooperation between Member States and EU  PART II MULTIANNUAL  PROGRAMMING  2021–2023  17  1818  institutions in order to respond to large-scale cross- border cyberattacks and cyber crises.  The strategic objective of cutting-edge competences  and capabilities in cybersecurity across the EU  seeks to address the gap between the supply of and  need for cybersecurity knowledge and competences  and ensure that different operational communities  have the appropriate capacity to deal with the  cyberthreat landscape.  The strategic objective of a high level of trust  in secure digital solutions seeks to generate  trust in citizens with regard to ICT products,  services and processes through the deployment  of certification schemes.

ENISA’s foresight and advice on cybersecurity  challenges and opportunities (including in research)  ENISA’s strategy also establishes a set of values  that guide the execution of its mandate and its  functioning, as follows.  Community mindset. ENISA works with  communities, respecting their competences and  expertise, and fosters synergies and trust to best  achieve its mission.  Excellence. ENISA aims for state-of-the-art expertise  in its work, upholds the highest quality standards of  operation and evaluates its performance to strive for  continuous improvement through innovation and  foresight.  Integrity/ethics. ENISA upholds ethical principles  and EU-relevant rules and obligations with regard  to its services and working environment, ensuring  fairness and inclusiveness.  Respect. ENISA respects fundamental European  rights and values in all its services and its working  environment, as well as the expectations of its  stakeholders.  Responsibility. ENISA assumes responsibility,  ensuring the integration of social and environmental  dimensions into practices and procedures.  Transparency. ENISA adopts procedures,  structures and processes that are open, factual  and independent, thus limiting bias, ambiguity, fraud  and obscurity.  Those values are built on the ethos of the CSA, and  in particular the objectives set out in Articles 3(4) and  4(1), and have been encapsulated into two corporate  objectives, which form the baseline from which the  multiannual activities of the SPD will be delivered.  The corporate objective of sound resource and  risk management is derived from requirements in  Article 4(1) of the CSA, which obliges the Agency to  ‘be a centre of expertise on cybersecurity by virtue  of its independence, the scientific and technical  quality of the advice and assistance it delivers, the  information it provides, the transparency of its  operating procedures, the methods of operation, and  its diligence in carrying out its tasks’. In addition, the  inspiration for this corporate objective stems from the  values of excellence and transparency derived from  the ENISA strategy and the principle of efficiency set  out in the management board decision MB/2020/5  on the principles to be applied for organising ENISA.  The aim is for ENISA to uphold the highest quality of  standards, strive for continuous improvement and  enhance the organisation’s performance.  The corporate objective of building an agile  organisation focused on people is derived from  requirements in Article 3(4) of the CSA, which obliges  the Agency to ‘develop its own resources, including …  human capabilities and skills, necessary to perform  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2021–2023 2121  PART II. Multiannual programming  2021–2023  Strategic objective Actions to  achieve  objective  Article of  the CSA  Expected results Key performance indicator Metrics  SO5 – High level of trust  in secure digital solutions  Activities 6  and 7  Article 8 •  Support for schemes chosen to run under the  European cybersecurity certification framework  •  Certified ICT products, services and processes  are preferred by consumers and, where relevant,  Operators of Essential Services and Digital  Service Providers  Uptake of the European cybersecurity  certification framework and schemes as an  enabler of secure digital solutions  Effective preparation of candidate  certification schemes prepared by ENISA  1.  Number of stakeholders (governments or commercial solution  providers) on the EU market using the cybersecurity certification  framework for their digital solutions  2.  Citizens’ trust in digital solutions 3.  Satisfaction with ENISA’s support for the preparation of candidate  schemes (survey)  •  Where relevant, contribution towards a more  competitive European cybersecurity industry, small  and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups  Recognition of ENISA’s supporting  role for participants in the European  cybersecurity market  1.  Number of market analyses, guidelines and good practices issued  by ENISA  2.  Uptake of lessons learned / recommendations from ENISA reports 3.  Stakeholder satisfaction with the added value and quality of  ENISA’s work  SO6 – Foresight  on emerging and  future cybersecurity  challenges and  SO7 – Efficient and  effective cybersecurity  information and  knowledge management  for Europe  Activity 8 Articles 9  and 11  •  Decisions about cybersecurity are future-proof  and take account of trends, developments and  knowledge across the ecosystem  •  Stakeholders receive relevant and timely information  for policy- and decision-making  ENISA’s ability to contribute to Europe’s  cyber resilience through the provision  of timely and effective information and  knowledge  1.  Number of users and frequency of use of dedicated portal  (observatory)  2.  Number of recommendations, analyses and challenges identified  and analysed  3.  Stakeholder satisfaction with the usefulness, relevance and  timeliness of ENISA’s foresight and advice on cybersecurity  challenges and opportunities (including in research)  the tasks assigned to it under this Regulation’. In  addition, the inspiration for this corporate objective  stems from the values of responsibility and  respect derived from the ENISA strategy and the  principle of competences set out in management  board decision MB/2020/5 on the principles to be  applied for organising ENISA. The aim is for ENISA  to respect fundamental European rights and values  in its working environment, assume responsibility  for the social and environmental dimensions of  its procedures and develop its staff competences,  expertise and talent.  2222  Table 2.

With the enactment of the CSA both staff numbers  and the financial resources of the agency have grown,  reflecting the expanded tasks and mandate of the  Agency. The Agency has historically found it very  hard to recruit and retain the talent it needs to fulfil  its mandate as the job market for cybersecurity skills  is highly specialised and extremely competitive. This  ‘deficiency’ was reflected in the average occupancy  rate of the establishment plan, which was 88.3 % in  2017–2019. In turn, the unfulfilled posts have been  a source of ‘systemic surpluses’ within the Agency’s  budget, requiring some amendments over the  financial year to absorb the funds that were not used  for staff salaries.  The occupancy rate of the establishment plan has  also been a cause for concern in 2019 and 2020  for a number of reasons, including the mid-year  enactment of the CSA in 2019, which put a stress  on recruitment, and the outbreak of the COVID-19  pandemic, which delayed the launch and conduct of  recruitment operations in 2020, as well as the change  in senior manager, development of a new strategy  for the Agency and launch of reorganisation, all of  which have complicated the process of defining the  competences and talent that the Agency requires to  fulfil its new objectives and functions.  Table 3.  2019 2020  Establishment plan posts 59 69  Occupancy rate (%) 87 75*  *As of July 2020; this rate is expected to grow significantly by the  end of the year.  To overcome these challenges, at the beginning of  2020 the Agency embarked on a large-scale novel  recruitment exercise with the aim of creating a  sufficiently diverse and broad reserve shortlist of 75  candidates with more transversal competences and  skills that could be used to recruit staff into grades  AD6–AD8 and functions and thus fill the gaps in the  current establishment plan, as well as serve as a pool  of candidates for the establishment plan in 2021 and  2022 if necessary. The call, which was accompanied  by a widespread promotion campaign, attracted  1 235 candidates (who submitted more than 1 600  applications) across all Member States (please see  graph below), a result that is unprecedented in the  history of the Agency. This has already resulted in  a reserve shortlist of 69 candidates, from which  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2021–2023 2323  PART II. Multiannual programming  2021–2023  Table 2.

This outcome  needs to be added to the ongoing contracts agent  call, which has attracted over 600 applications and is  currently ongoing.  While the gender balance in the Agency follows trends  in technology-dominated areas of the job market,  the Agency proactively pursues gender balance with  varying degrees of success. Agency staff citizenship  is dominated by citizens of Member State of seat  agreement, and to a lesser extent by citizens of  neighbouring Member States; however, the diversity  of candidates responding to the ongoing call might  remedy this to some extent. Although geographical  balance is a chronic issue, in the job market of the  host Member State, ENISA represents a sound  Figure 1.

Overall,  the situation of the Agency is not that dissimilar to the  situation of other agencies.  Further information on appraisal of performance and  reclassification/promotions, mobility policy, gender  and geographical balance and schooling is provided  in the annexes to this report.  2.1.2. Outlook for 2021–2023  In terms of the evolution of tasks, the CSA set out new  levels of performance and cooperation that need  to be met by the Agency’s staff. In addition, and as  noted in Section I, the expected political and legislative  developments place a demand on the Agency to develop  the necessary skills and expertise to cater for increasing  needs in fulfilling its mandate in the field of operational  cooperation, as well as international cooperation, both  of which are relatively new tasks for the Agency.  The overarching need to grow the Agency’s  capabilities can be met by either (a) developing talent  and measuring staff performance or (b) recruiting  new staff who possess the competences required to  meet the requirements of the CSA.  With regard to competence development, the Agency  already has experience in learning and development  that continuously produces outcomes in the areas  of cybersecurity, project management, finance, etc.  The area of performance management currently  covers annual appraisals, reclassification and the  linking of appraisals with training needs. There is  a need, however, to develop more precise metrics  for performance management and use information  systems to this end, a process that has been kick- started with this SPD.  The shift in the profiles of newly recruited staff is  also likely to lead to benefits for the Agency as it is  expected that greater collaboration across agency  verticals will be instigated. The push towards  interdisciplinary and social science-based profiles is  likely to support the areas that the Agency expects to  develop in the years to come.  Better retention rates have lowered the impact of  staff turnover on the Agency and, combined with the  outcome of the 2020 temporary agents call, which  has provided the agency with a sufficient number of  shortlisted candidates to enable rapid recruitment,  it is anticipated that in the next few years payroll  expenditure will become more predictable, as the  Agency has historically implemented the establishment  plan as approved by the budgetary authority. The  Agency has provided significant, albeit not always  balanced, opportunities for reclassification to its staff.  While mobility in the Agency has been a continuing  concern of management, several readjustments of its  resources have taken effect over the past few years in  an effort to seek the right balance between tasks and  performance. The Agency will have have adapted its  resources to the new environment set up by the CSA  by the end of 2020.  In contrast to the three initial management posts,  in the past 8 years the Agency has relied on a high  number of management posts, which has allowed  for a broader distribution of tasks and possibly more  targeted control at the various stages of processing of  tasks. However, with the implementation of the new  structure in 2021, the number of middle management  posts is expected to decrease and stabilise, from eight  to six. It is hereby affirmed that the executive director  is the senior manager of the Agency.  2.1.3. Resource programming  for 2021–2023  2.1.3.1. Financial resources  The evolution of the planned total EU contribution  for 2021–2023, as well as for the full period of the  new multiannual financial framework 2021–2027, is  not yet available. As part of the CSA, the estimated  impact on expenditure was indicated for the period  2019–2022, which is presented in the table 4 below.  Average growth during 2019–2022 is expected to be  12 %. A similar growth trend is expected for 2023.

A similar trend is expected for 2021–2023.  The EU contribution for 2021 is estimated to be  EUR 22.3 million, the EFTA contribution is estimated  to be EUR 0.5 million and other contributions, mainly  from the Hellenic Authorities, are expected to be  EUR 0.6 million.  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2021–2023 2525  PART II. Multiannual programming  2021–2023  The general allocation of funds between titles is  expected to remain at a similar level in 2021–2023  to that in 2019 (Table 8 in Annex III). Expenditure in  2020 is expected to be EUR 21.7 million, of which  EUR 11.2 million in Title 1 covers all staff-related costs,  EUR 3.2 million in Title 2 covers main items such as  building rental and ICT expenses, and EUR 7.3 million  in Title 3 covers all core operating expenditure.  2.1.4. Strategy for achieving  efficiency gains  ENISA is committed to continue to implement  measures to obtain efficiency gains in all activities.  The new structure of the organisation, adopted and  endorsed by its management board in June 2020, has  been developed to specifically achieve and follow the  principles of sound budgetary management and build  efficiencies in both executing its core mandate and  fulfilling its corporate functions.  Within the domain of its operational activities,  the Agency is revolutionising its approach by  implementing its work programme in such a way  as to ensure efficiencies and maximise its added  value. In particular, it will seek to systematically use  its statutory bodies (National Liaison Officers (NLO)  Network, ENISA Advisory Group), as well as other  statutory groups that it is involved in (Stakeholder  Cybersecurity Certification Group (SCCG), as set out  in CSA Article 22, NIS Cooperation Group (NIS CG)  and its workstreams, expert groups created under  EU law) and its own ad hoc expert groups, where  appropriate, to peer review the scope and direction  of actions undertaken to achieve outputs, as well as  validate the results. In this way the Agency will fulfil  its obligation as outlined in Article 3(3) of the CSA  to avoid the duplication of Member State activities  and take into consideration existing Member State  expertise. Hence, all activities listed in Sections 3.1  and 3.2 of this SPD include an indication of how  specific deliverables and other actions undertaken  to achieve the outputs will be validated and peer  reviewed or consulted as per the legal framework in  the area of certification.  The Agency is also setting up a framework for  structured cooperation with CERT-EU to utilise  synergies and avoid the duplication of activities  in executing its tasks in the field of operational  cooperation (Article 7 of the CSA). In addition, the  establishment of a local office in Brussels should  enable the Agency to create further collaborations  with other EU institutions, agencies and bodies with  regard to these and other activities. The Agency is  also pursuing cooperation with relevant EU bodies  (Joint Research Centre) and will embark on creating  synergies with the Cybersecurity Competence  Centre and Network once it is established to enable  collaboration in fulfilling its tasks in the field of  research and innovation (Article 11 of the CSA).  In its corporate functions, ENISA further seeks  to rationalise its internal processes to improve  its overall efficiency and benchmark its activities  against best practices implemented by other EU  institutions and agencies. The Agency is continuing  and further expanding the sharing of services among  other EU agencies. A number of collaborations and  agreements are currently in place (with the European  Union Agency for the Operational Management  of Large-scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom,  Security and Justice (EU-LISA), European Union  Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO)) and in 2020 the  Agency signed a service-level agreement with the  European Centre for the Development of Vocational  Training (Cedefop), which is also located in Greece,  to enable further collaboration. This will include the  setting up of a joint compliance function and the  sharing of procurement procedures.  Prompted by the COVID-19 crisis, the Agency is  reviewing its digital and tele-working framework  and will embark on actively seeking efficiency  gains through the digitalisation of its functions in  all endeavours. It is already using EU tools such  as accrual-based accounting (ABAC), ABAC assets,  procurement and e-invoicing. Furthermore, in 2020,  the Agency deployed Sysper and it is examining  the migration of its services to other tools, such as  Mission Processing System (MIPS) and eRecruitment.  The Agency is using a basic workflow application  called Paperless that makes handwritten signatures  for internal approval redundant. Most administrative  tasks are already supported by Paperless and  other applications, which has enabled significant  steps to be taken towards the aim of implementing  100% e-administration.  E-training is also encouraged internally with the aim,  among other things, of reducing the associated costs  of ‘classroom’ training (e.g. travelling costs). However,  in view of the COVID-19 pandemic the Agency will  also review the training, conferences and seminars  provided for external parties and upgrade its  capabilities to use secure digital conferencing across  the field, providing further opportunities for efficiency  gains, as well as expanding the scale and scope of  its activities.  26  III  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2021–2023 27  This section describes the main body of the work  programme, what the Agency aims to deliver in 2021  towards achieving its strategy and the expected  results. In total, nine operational activities and two  corporate activities have been identified to support  the implementation of ENISA’s mandate in 2021.  PART III WORK PROGRAMME  FOR 2021  28  3.1. OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES  Activity 1: Providing assistance on policy development  Overview of activity  This activity delivers assistance and advice to the EU and Member States in developing cybersecurity policy and  sector-specific policy and law initiatives where matters related to cybersecurity are involved.  The activity seeks to bolster policy initiatives on novel/emerging technology areas by providing technical, fact-driven  and tailor-made cybersecurity advice and recommendations. In addition to providing support in emerging policy  areas (such as artificial intelligence, 5G and response to current and future crises), ENISA – in coordination with the  European Commission and Member States – will also conduct policy scouting to support them to identify potential  areas for policy development, as well as develop monitoring capabilities and tools to regularly and consistently be  able to give advice on the effectiveness of existing EU policy and law.

Activity 10: Performance and risk management  Overview of activity  This activity seeks to achieve requirements set out in Article 4(1) of the CSA that set an objective for the Agency to  ‘be a centre of expertise on cybersecurity by virtue of its independence, the scientific and technical quality of the  advice and assistance it delivers, the information it provides, the transparency of its operating procedures, the  methods of operation, and its diligence in carrying out its tasks’. This objective requires an efficient performance  and risk management framework, which should be developed and implemented hand in hand with the imposition of  the new organisational set-up.  Under this activity ENISA will confinue to enhance key objectives of the reorganisation, as described in management  board decision MB/2020/5, including the need to adress the gaps in the Agency’s quality assessment framework,  install proper and functioning internal controls and compliance checks, make best use of the internal resources of  the Agency, impose sound financial and budgetary management, and utilise internal and external synergies within  ENISA. These aspects are addressed in the new organisational architecture, but should also be built into the daily  operations of the Agency, as guided by the work programme. The actions undertaken will ensure that the Agency’s  outputs add real value, by making performance and ex post and ex ante evaluation integral to the work programme  througout its lifecycle, including through rigorous quality assurance by carrying out proper project management,  internal peer review and independent audits and validations.  The legal basis for this activity is Articles 4(1) and 32 of the CSA, the latter of which strongly focuses on the sound  financial management principle with a view to maximise value for money.  Objectives  •  For the performance of ENISA to be fully compliant with legal and financial frameworks  (build a culture of compliance)  •  Increased effectiveness and efficiency in achieving the Agency’s objectives •  Protect the Agency’s assets and reputation, while reducing risks  Results Link to strategic objective (ENISA strategy)  •  Maximise value for money provided to stakeholders  and citizens  •  Build lasting credibility and trust  Sound resource and risk management  Outputs Key performance indicator  10.1.  Roll-out of an Agency-wide performance  management framework and systems across  its functions  10.2.  Develop, establish and implement a risk  management plan and systems, including an  anti-fraud strategy, a conflict of interest policy,  a whistleblowing policy, an information security  policy, an anti-harassment policy and an  intellectual property rights (IPR) policy  10.3.  Develop and implement an Agency-wide  IT strategy  10.4.  Carry out relevant training and develop  guidelines for staff  Indicator:  Organisational performance culture Metrics: 10.1.  Proportion of key performance indicators  reaching targets 10.2.  Individual contributions to achieving the  objectives of the Agency through clear links to key  performance indicators (CDR report)  10.3.  Exceptions in the risk register 10.4.  Number of complaints filed against ENISA,  including number of inquiries/complaints  submitted to the European Ombudsman  10.5.  Results of the annual risk assessment exercise 10.6.  Observations from external audit bodies (e.g.  ECoA) requiring follow-up actions by ENISA  (i.e. number of ‘critical’, ‘significant’ or ‘very  important’ findings)  Frequency: Annual  Validation Target groups and beneficiaries  •  Budget management committee •  ENISA ethics committee •  IPR management committee •  IT management committee •  Management team •  Staff committee  •  All stakeholders of the Agency •  Citizens  38  Activity 11: Staff development and working environment  Overview of activity  This activity seeks to support ENISA aspirations as stipulated in Article 3(4) of the CSA, which obliges the Agency to  ‘develop its own resources, including … human capabilities and skills, necessary to perform the tasks assigned to it  under this Regulation’.  Moreover, since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of organisations that have announced permanent  teleworking options has grown globally. This must accelerate a review of employer–employee relationships in the  Agency, with a view to introducing a more flexible (50/50) framework while maintaining and enhancing employee  motivation, efficiency and development, an option that was supported by 87 % of respondents to the staff survey  conducted in June 2020.  The actions that will be pursued under this activity will focus on attracting, retaining and developing talent and  building ENISA’s reputation as an employer of choice and an agile and knowledge-based organisation where staff can  evolve personally and professionaly, while keeping staff engaged and motivated and providing a sense of belonging.  The activity will seek to build an attractive workspace by establishing and maintaining excellent working conditions  (premises, layout of office space) and developing user-centric (tele)working and conferencing tools (including IT  systems and platforms) delivering state-of-the-art services and supporting ENISA’s business owners and stakeholders  in line with the Agency’s objectives.

The allocation was determined according to the direct  budget and number of full-time equivalents (FTEs)  indicated for each activity, with the indirect budget  being assigned based on causal relationships.  The following assumptions are used in the simplified  activity-based budgeting methodology.  The direct budget is the cost estimate for each of  the nine operational activities described in Section  III (and carried out under Articles 5–12) in terms of  goods and services to be procured.  The indirect budget is the cost estimate for  salaries and allowances, mission costs, buildings,  IT, equipment and miscellaneous operating  costs attributable to each activity. The indirect  budget is allocated to activities based on different  drivers. The main driver for cost allocation was  the estimated number of FTEs required for each  operational activity in 2021.  For the purpose of the allocation of human  and financial resources, an Executive Director’s  Office activity (budget and FTEs), which includes  coordination, compliance, communication and  administration executed by 15 FTEs, was allocated  for all of the Agency’s activities.  For the purpose of the allocation of human and  financial resources, Corporate Support Service  activity, including human resources, IT services,  procurement and finance, facilities and logistics  activity, was created.

Furthermore, with its renewed mandate, ENISA was given greater competences but also greater financial resources, increasing its  budget by almost a factor of two in less than 3 years.  48  Table 8. For ENISA to review again  Expenditure (EUR) 2020* 2021  Commitment  appropriations  Payment  appropriations  Commitment  appropriations  Payment  appropriations  Title 1 11 203 334 11 203 334 10 775 409 10 775 409  Title 2 3 150 568 3 150 568 3 507 667 3 507 667  Title 3 7 328 981 7 328 981 9 150 000 9 150 000  Total expenditure 21 682 884 21 682 884 23 433 076 23 433 076  * As adopted in the amending budget 1/2020 (management board decision MB/2020/18).

Cancellation of commitment appropriations. In  2019 commitment appropriations were cancelled  for an amount of EUR 521 426, representing  3 % of the total budget. ENISA demonstrated a  commitment rate of 97 % of C1 appropriations  (appropriations for the respective year) at the  year-end (31 December 2019). The consumption  of the 2019 budget at year-end shows the capacity  of the Agency to fully implement its annual  appropriations. The payment rate reached 70 %  and the amount carried forward to 2020 was  EUR 4 347 332, representing 27 % of the total C1  appropriations in 2019.  Cancellation of payment appropriations for  the year. No payment appropriations were  cancelled during 2019.  Cancellation of payment appropriations carried  over (fund source C8 – appropriations carried  over automatically from 2018 to 2019). The  appropriations for 2018 carried over to 2019  were utilised at a rate of 95 % (automatic carry- overs), which indicates a satisfactory estimation  of needs. Of the EUR 1 232 263 carried forward,  an amount of EUR 62 522 was cancelled because  the estimated expenditure deviated from the  actual paid amount. This cancellation represents  0.4 % of the total budget for 2019.

Nevertheless, an improvement has been noted over the past 5 years. Continuous efforts to encourage  female involvement in this area have been successful; however, further efforts should be made in order to  achieve a higher percentage of female middle and senior managers at ENISA in the coming years.

Other reasons that may be cited are the need for stability during the start-up phase of the Agency, with staff  members from the hosting Member State (Greece) being less likely to resign (resulting in lower turnover), which,  because of the relatively young age of the Agency, is still having an impact; the relatively better academic profile  of Greek candidates applying for lower level posts; the relatively smaller payroll cost for Greek staff who are  better qualified than average and who do not require an expatriation allowance; and the general tendency for  people to remain in lower level positions in the home country.

All of these measures were taken within the scope of the agency’s activities and to the  extent possible given its infrastructure and location.  ENISA presently occupies part of a leased building in Athens. This unfortunately does  not allow the Agency to control the heating/cooling system or to access autonomous  electricity meters. The Agency is therefore unable to directly monitor these systems and  assess the impact of the greening measures implemented.  Therefore, ENISA has not been able to obtain Eco-Management and Audit Scheme  (EMAS) certification for its main office building considering the leasing restrictions.  However, it is envisaged that this certification will be obtained for the new premises to be  provided by the Hellenic Authorities. In anticipation of this, the Agency plans to conduct  an environmental audit of its activities, as well as pursue options to offset its carbon  emissions (including those produced through its missions).  60  ANNEX 7 BUILDING POLICY  As in the existing Seat Agreement between ENISA and the Greek government, which  entered into force on 4 October 2019, the Agency will continue to have premises in  Athens and Heraklion. The permanent seat of the Agency is in Athens, where the majority  of its staff are based, with a support office located in Heraklion.  At the time of this document the ENISA premises in Athens are privately owned and  rented by the Agency; in Heraklion the ENISA premises are located in a public building  made available by the Hellenic Authorities. The rent for the premises in Athens and  Heraklion is covered by the Hellenic Authorities, who provide up to EUR 640 000 per year.  The current building in Athens will not be able to accommodate all of the new staff  who will be joining the Agency in light of the new mandate, with an additional challenge  being that the current rental contract expires on 31 December 2021 with no possibility  of extension. ENISA has asked the Hellenic Authorities to find suitable premises to  accommodate the Agency in Athens. The Ministry of Digital Governance, representing  the Hellenic Authorities, is in charge of this dossier and has expressed a commitment to  find adequate long-term premises for the Agency. The selection of the new premises in  Athens will need to be completed by Q3 2020 to allow a smooth transition.

The Greek government and ENISA signed  a Seat Agreement on 13 November 2018,  which was ratified by Greek Law 4627/2019  on 25 September 2019 and entered into  force on 4 October 2019 and is applicable to  ENISA and its staff.  In accordance with Article 35 of Regulation  (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament  and of the Council of 17 April 2019,  the protocol no 7 on the privileges and  immunities of the European Union, annexed  to the TEU and the TFEU, applies to the  Agency and its staff.  The Greek government and ENISA signed  a Seat Agreement on 13 November 2018,  which was ratified by Greek Law 4627/2019  on 25 September 2019 and entered into force  on 4 October 2019 and is applicable to ENISA  and its staff.  A public school  of European  education of type  2 was founded in  2005 by the Greek  government in  Heraklion, Crete, for  the children of the  staff of ENISA.  There is no  European school  operating in Athens.  62  ANNEX 9 EVALUATIONS  External consultants are contracted to carry out annual ex post evaluations of operational  activities. The overall aim of the annual evaluations is to evaluate effectiveness, efficiency,  added value, utility, coordination and coherence.  ENISA uses an internal monitoring system that is intended to support the project  management function, which includes project delivery and allocation of resources. This  is used for regular reporting and managerial purposes by the ENISA management team.  Moreover, ENISA has implemented a mid-term review procedure and regular monthly  management team meetings. ENISA expects to undertake a study to upgrade the use of  an electronic tool for internal project management and overall delivery of the Agency’s  work programme.  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2021–2023 63  ANNEX Strategy for organisational management and internal control systems  ANNEX 10 STRATEGY FOR  ORGANISATIONAL  MANAGEMENT  AND INTERNAL  CONTROL SYSTEMS  The Agency’s strategy for effective internal control is based on best international practices  and on the internal control framework (COSO framework’s international standards).  The control environment is a set of standards for conduct, processes and structures that  provides the basis for effective internal control across ENISA. The management team sets  the tone at the top with respect to the importance of internal control, including expected  standards of conduct.  Risk assessment is the Agency’s dynamic and iterative process for identifying and  assessing risks that could affect the achievement of objectives and for determining how  such risks should be managed.  The control activities ensure the mitigation of risks related to the achievement of  policy, operational and internal control objectives. They are performed at all levels of  the organisation, at various stages of business processes and across the technology  environment. They may be preventative or detective and encompass a range of manual  and automated activities, as well as segregation of duties.  Information is necessary for the organisation to carry out internal control and to support  the achievement of objectives. In this respect external and internal communication need  to be considered. External communication provides the specific Agency stakeholders  and, globally, EU citizens with information on ENISA’s policies, objectives, actions and  achievements. Internal communication provides ENISA staff with the information required  to support the achievement of objectives and to enable awareness for day-to-day controls.  Continuous and specific assessments are used to ascertain whether or not each of the five  components of internal control is present and functioning. Continuous assessments, built  into business processes at different levels of the organisation, provide timely information  on any deficiencies. Findings are assessed and deficiencies are communicated and  corrected in a timely manner, with serious matters reported as appropriate.  The common approach on EU decentralised agencies foresees that EU agencies should  be more active concerning fraud prevention issues and that the related communication  forms an essential part of their success. In order to implement this approach, the  European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) has recommended that each agency should adopt an  anti-fraud strategy that is proportionate to its fraud risks. Rules for the prevention and  management of conflicts of interests are part of the anti-fraud strategy of the Agency.  64  ANNEX 11 GRANTS, CONTRIBUTIONS  AND SERVICE-LEVEL  AGREEMENTS  ENISA does not receive any form of grants.  As part of the host country agreement an annual contribution is received from the  Hellenic Authorities to cover leasing expenditures for the Agency’s offices (as per the Seat  Agreement – Greek Law 4627/2019). The 2019 contribution was EUR 435 844.  ENISA has signed a service-level agreement (SLA) with EU-LISA, an EU agency, for the  purposes of sharing its knowledge and resources related to the organisation of EU- LISA’s security exercises in 2019 and 2020, as well as making available its online exercise  platform. The income generated amounts to EUR 97 920 per year to cover staff costs and  overheads (two FTEs, equivalent to contract agent posts, are allocated to these tasks). The  amounts established in the agreement are based on a cost recovery policy, rather than  on generating any additional financial value for the parties involved.  The table below provides a summary of the SLAs and agreements of the Agency,  including the contracted amounts where necessary.

The integrity of devices is vital for technology to become  mobile and for most implementations of the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT  can enhance physical security with more advanced and complex  solutions. 1  This way, IP security-based systems with smart sensors, Wi-Fi  cameras, smart security lighting, drones and electronic locks can provide  surveillance data that are evaluated by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and  Machine Learning (ML) mechanisms to identify threats and respond with  minimum delay and maximum accuracy. 2 However, intelligent buildings,  mobile devices and smart wearables can be exploited to bypass physical  security measures. 3  In 2019, ATM and POS related physical attacks continued in Europe and  worldwide, but the resulting losses were lower than the average over the  past decade. The good news is that the companies, IT managers and  decision makers are leaning towards hybrid cyber and physical security  plans, although in the past physical security was not a priority.  2  3  _New and outdated security practices  Converged Security Practices Proactive Prevention Strategies  Cloud Solutions AI and Deep Learning IP camera systems  Liability Multi-factor authentication with biometrics  IoT Intelligent Sensors  Siloed Security Practices Detection Strategies  On-premise Solutions Video Management Systems (VMS) and (DVR)  Risk 2-factor authentication  Non-Intelligent Sensors  Source: Boonedam blog 4  4  Kill chain  Reconnaissance Weaponisation Delivery Exploitation  Step of Attack Workflow  Width of Purpose  5  Installation Command &  Control  Actions on  Objectives  Physical  damage/loss/  theft  MORE INFORMATION  The Cyber Kill Chain® framework was developed by  Lockheed Martin, adapted from a military concept related  with the structure of an attack. To study a particular attack  vector, use this kill-chain diagram to map each step of the  process and reference the tools, techniques and  procedures used by the attacker.  https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html  6  In April 2019, Vishwanath Akuthota, pleaded guilty to vandalism, having  destroyed equipment with an electric charge using a malicious USB device.  The devices destroyed were owned by the College of Saint Rose in Albany,  New York, the college Akuthota had graduated from. For the purpose of  this attack, he accessed 66 workstations and numerous monitors and  digital podiums. The ‘USB killer’ key he used was purchased online. The  college spent more than US $50.000 (ca. €42.452) replacing the equipment  and more than US $7.000 (ca. €5.943) in paying the employee who dealt  with this incident. Akuthota faced 10 years imprisonment and a maximum  fine of US $250.000 (ca. €212.257). 5  _Physical access is the biggest backdoor  Trends  During 2019, various surveys of physical security took place. Some of these  surveys focused on CEOs, IT managers and decision-makers across several  industries, and the results give a good idea on how physical security is  handled within companies. CEOs across industry sectors appeared to lean  towards a combined cyber and physical security plan to protect their  assets against threats, considering factors such as insider threats, the  importance of infrastructure and the integrity of the company’s networks.  In these combined security plans, the most emphasis, budget and  personnel were given to investments in cybersecurity (i.e. 83-86% of the  respective resources), while 14-17% of the company’s resources were  spent on physical security. In Europe, the majority of IT managers (77%)  stated that the physical security of their company’s assets was outdated. 7  _Physical security lacks corporate attention  7  A trend in 2019 was enhancing physical security by enabling hosted  security solutions. The majority of IT managers’ security plans had already  shifted towards cloud-and IoT-enabled scheme or they were planning to  make this shift in a 12-month period. The decision-makers reported that  they were already evaluating video surveillance-as-a-service (VSaaS) and  access control as-a-service (ACaaS) solutions to improve incident detection  and minimum response times and reduce false positive rates. VSaaS and  ACaaS improved both physical security and cybersecurity, although just a  few of the IT managers identified physical security as their priority. 8  _Physical security as-a-service  Just as was observed in 2018, in this reporting period, ATMs were  vulnerable to tampering and physical damage with the ultimate goal of  stealing the cash within. In Ireland nine incidents were reported in Q1  2019 alone. 9 Some of the attackers were very dramatic using stolen  diggers, breaking down walls, and scooping the ATMs into vans or cars. In  other cases, the attacks were completed within minutes using explosives,  chain lassoing, and ram-raiding. 10  In the Netherlands, 71 ATM bombing  attacks (Plofkraken in Dutch) took place in one November’s weekend  alone, compared with 43 similar attacks during the whole of 2018. ABN  AMRO bank was forced to remove 470 vulnerable ATMs, and the Dutch  Banking Association (NVB) decided to shut down all cash machines nation-  wide every night between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. during December. 11  2019 is  the fourth consecutive year that physical attacks on ATMs haves increased.  _ATMs’ physical security failed the test of  time  During 2019, the main expressions of ATM tampering were card trapping,  cash trapping and transaction reversal fraud. The big picture for the year is  that ATM and petrol pump tampering decreased, thanks to the increase in  EMV payments. The EMV standard, named after the three companies that  introduced it (i.e. Europay, Mastercard, and Visa), describes the  specifications for smart cards, payment terminals and ATMs. EMV cards  (aka Chip and PIN or chip cards) integrated circuit chips. The adoption of  EMV cards disrupted card-present fraud, at least partially. 12  Unfortunately,  EMV cards have not yet been widely implemented outside Europe and  even within Europe, only a few countries have adopted geo control, an EMV  card’s anti-fraud utility. 13  _ ATM tampering  8  Trends   Killer USB breach highlights need for physical security.  Vishwanath Akuthota, an alumnus of the College of Saint Rose in  Albany, New York, pleaded guilty for vandalising equipment using  a malicious USB device. 5   Crooks use digger to steal ATMs in Northern Ireland. The number  of physical attacks on ATMs is rising across the EU. 9   Dutch Plofkraken. Explosive attacks (known as ‘Plofkraken’) Dutch  ATMs. Mostly focused on ABN AMRO bank’s machines because of  a vulnerability. It led the bank to remove about 470 of its cash  machines across the Netherlands. 11  _ Incidents  9  __Findings  4%_of breaches were caused by physical actions12  20%_of cybersecurity incidents started or  ended with a physical action12  5th_most implemented malicious action on assets  was physical attacks on ATMs12  54%_of data breaches across all sectors  included a physical attack as the main method  48%_of IT managers use cloud-based video  surveillance or access control8  72%_of employees consider leaving sensitive  information in publicly accessible areas the most  serious threat to data security14  65%_of over 1.000 employees surveyed reported  behaving in ways and adopting practices identified  as risky for physical security15  _Proposed actions  10  Mitigation   Use encryption in all information storage and flow that is outside the  security perimeter (devices, networks, cloud services, etc.).   Use asset inventories to keep track of users’ devices and remind  owners to check availability.   Ensure limited access to areas containing sensitive information or  equipment.   Implement well-documented physical security policies and integrate  physical security measures with digital ones to achieve a holistic  approach.   Use insurance policies to cover losses to both physical and cyber-  related risks.   Develop user guides for mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops,  etc.) and follow best practices.   Establish well-communicated procedures for the physical protection of  assets, including loss, damage and theft.   Ensure that devices are disposed after personal or sensitive  information had been securely deleted. 6   Reduce the response time for theft, damage and loss incidents.   Implement multi-factor authentication combining user credentials with  biometrics, smart cards or other physical tokens. 16   Inspect devices periodically for alterations or replacements. 6   Implement processes to detect authorized visitors or employees and  assign proper access rights. 6   Implement access monitoring systems, access control systems, strong  access credentials, and smart access devices (e.g. smart locks, smart  keys) for areas housing sensitive equipment. 6  11  20%  21%  17%  14%  8%  8%  5% 5%2%  Finger print  Secure ID  SMS/Smartphone  Facial recognition  PIV/CAC cards  Iris/retina scanning  Yubikey smart card  Tokens  Don’t know  _Most preferable alternatives for user’s  credentials in MFA  Source: ORACLE & KPMG 16  12  References  1. “Physical Security Guide”.

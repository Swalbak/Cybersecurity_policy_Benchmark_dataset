This guidance has used the principles of the Essential Eight and adapted them to  environments using Microsoft 365. The guides use the principles of the Essential Eight to help  organisations increase their cyber security, they are not designed to help an organisation reach a  particular maturity level. Therefore organisations should consider these guides an adaptation of  the Essential Eight, rather than a strict Essential Eight implementation.  Required subscriptions The Small Business Cloud Security Guides are designed for organisations using a Microsoft 365  software as a service environment with devices configured with Microsoft Intune. The technical  examples use low cost or free solutions where possible, however, many security configuration  options are unavailable in entry level Microsoft 365 subscriptions. To follow these technical  examples, an organisation will require subscriptions to Microsoft 365 Business Premium (or  equivalent), this is the subscription tier where many of Microsoft’s security configuration options  are introduced. A limited number of administrators will also require an Azure Active Directory  Premium P2 subscription.  Required expertise These guides are designed to be accessible to organisations with limited resources and cyber  security expertise. Organisations should be capable of following the technical examples if they  have an employee who is comfortable using Microsoft 365 admin portals. The technical examples  should also be accessible to any organisation with the support of an IT Managed Service Provider.  It may be appropriate to train staff on how to administer Microsoft 365 through their training  website.  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/azure/  Required privileges Administrator privileges are required to implement these guides. Each technical example lists the  administrator privileges required to follow it.  Enable security defaults These technical examples build upon Microsoft’s security defaults. Before you begin, enable  security defaults in the Azure portal. Refer to Microsoft’s guidance for detailed instructions.  Enrol your devices in Intune The technical examples in these guides use Mobile Device Management (MDM) to manage  Windows endpoints. To follow these technical examples, all compatible devices must first be  enrolled in an MDM. Microsoft has published guidance on enrolling Windows devices in Intune.  Adapt this guide to your organisation’s environment There are several ways to secure Microsoft 365, the Technical Examples in these guides  demonstrate just one approach. Every organisation will have unique factors to consider when  determining their cyber security strategy. For example, their unique risk profile, operational needs  and risk appetite. These guides are not intended to be prescriptive; organisations are encouraged  https://portal.azure.com/ https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-security-defaults#enabling-security-defaults https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/enrollment/windows-enrollment-methods  to adapt them to meet their unique requirements. When considering your organisation’s unique  requirements, be mindful of legislation that may apply to your industry. For example, there are  obligations that have been legislated for organisations that deal with personally identifiable  information and organisations in the critical infrastructure sector.  Adopt a risk-based approach Your organisation’s cyber security strategy should be informed by its risk profile and appetite.  Before you implement these guides, consider if they sufficiently mitigate the risks to your  organisation and are compatible with your organisation’s operational requirements. Some parts  of the guides may not be relevant to your organisation or may not be possible to implement in  full. Some parts of the guides may also have an unacceptable impact on your organisation’s  operations. If you are not able to implement the guides in full, consider what risks your  organisation is willing to accept and what risks require mitigation through other compensating  controls.  The Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources has developed a Cyber Security  Assessment Tool that can assist organisations to consider their cyber security risks.  If your organisation requires other compensating controls, you can find further guidance on our  website. Other compensating controls are listed in the ACSC’s:  Small Business Cyber Security Guide  Exercise in a Box  The Essential Eight  Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents  Information Security Manual.  Technical example scope  https://digitaltools.business.gov.au/jfe/form/SV_0dnd9cF15I8LnH8?ref=bga https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/small-business-cyber-security/small-business-cyber-security-guide https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/exercise-in-a-box https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/ism  The technical examples in these guides are focused on securing Microsoft 365 and Intune  managed endpoints. Many organisations will use programs or platforms that are outside of the  Microsoft ecosystem and the scope of these guides. In addition to implementing this guidance,  consider what cyber security mitigation strategies are best suited to protect any other programs  or platforms that your organisation uses. Many of the principles in these guides can be applied to  other parts of an organisation’s IT environment. For example, multi-factor authentication,  patching applications, patching operating systems and regular backups are widely applicable  mitigation strategies.  While the Essential Eight provide significant protection against cyber incidents, they are not an  exhaustive list of cyber security controls. For many organisations, these guides should be  considered a starting point to securing Microsoft 365 capabilities that is built upon in line with  organisational needs.  Note: The settings outlined in these guides may change from time to time, please consult  Microsoft documentation for equivalent controls.  ACSC Business guidance breakdown Businesses should implement cyber security mitigation strategies that are proportionate to their  risk profile and risk appetite. The ACSC has published guidance for businesses of varying sizes  and with varying risk profiles. The table below summarises the target audience for the ACSC’s  flagship business guidance.

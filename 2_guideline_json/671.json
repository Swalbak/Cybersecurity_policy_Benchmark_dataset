Sandwiched  between the giants of the ICT industry in the US and  Asia, Europe is struggling to keep up and risks losing  hold of its own digital sovereignty.  Surprisingly, this is happening while the EU and EU  Member States are among the most digitally developed  world economies1.  Europe has created a number of  successes such as Skype, Sailfish, F-Secure, AVG, Signal,  and the re-emergence of Nokia mobile handsets. We  also see in Switzerland a culture of promoting start-ups  and supporting the financial sector and in particular the  encouragement of blockchain with supporting regulatory  1 European Commission, “I-DESI 2018”, 26 October 2018.

Figure 1 portrays a traditional depiction of the current  state of the global ICT market, where the EU is stuck in  the middle between the US and Asia.  However, it is suggested that the marketplace is  more complicated than the above diagram seems to  indicate. In order to gain a better understanding of the  marketplace, the first question that needs to be analysed  is in what part/segment of the market do we intend to  compete. Any market analysis will always clearly indicate  that you cannot compete in every aspect of the market,  that market segmentations are different and that any  competitive advantage is only temporary. For example,  if we take the 5G market, the hamburger could be seen  from a different perspective, as illustrated in figure 2:  2 Global Legal Insights, “Blockchain and Cryptocurrency  Regulation 2019 | Switzerland”, 2019. Available at: https://www. globallegalinsights.com/practice-areas/blockchain-laws-and- regulations/switzerland  Given the proposal for the development of cybersecurity  competence centres, one of the initial tasks could be the  gathering of evidence to support the decision-making  process, as no report has been identified that addresses  this aspect of the market research.  The US reportedly filed 56,142 international patents  in 2018, closely followed by China with 53,345 patent  filings3.  Approximately one in ten of the Chinese  applications came from Huawei Technologies, making it  the leading filer of international patent applications for  20184.  At a European level, according to the European  Patent Office (EPO) figures for 2018, Siemens had the  highest number of patent applications and was ahead  of Huawei by a narrow margin, with 2,493 applications  compared with Huawei’s 2,4855.  ICT and cybersecurity are closely interlinked. While  ENISA’s mandate is to focus on cybersecurity, the  importance and strategic aspect of cybersecurity  underpins the ICT sector in relation to both hardware  and software. Strengthening EU cybersecurity is key to  securing European digital sovereignty and the EU ICT  industry. Given the size of the European market in a  global marketplace, Europe finds itself as an ICT taker  rather than an ICT maker. Any solution to the European  ICT problem will require an equivalent European  cybersecurity solution, which should be seen as an  opportunity rather than an insolvable problem.  This short consultation paper looks at the strengths  and shortcomings of the ICT industrial policy in the EU  with a view to how Europe can do better, and how the  development of the EU ICT industry in the years to come  can be rendered a success and not a failure.  If we sit in an average European office, the computers  and printers are generally produced in Asia and the  software is primarily developed in the US. When we turn  on our computers, the operating system is generally of  US origin. When we turn on our browsers, we generally  select from Microsoft, Google, Apple or Firefox products.  Other browsers, which had their origin in Europe such as  Opera6, are now owned by non-European entities.

It is suggested that European policy  has followed the approach of trying to be a master of  everything. Clearly, this is not an ideal situation. Europe  needs to identify its market, gather the necessary  evidence to identify the correct market segment, and  pursue a specific strategic approach. In this regard, do  we need another European Facebook? Or a European TV  screen manufacturer?  Europe has a strong track record  in developing key software, car manufacturing, and  intellectual property in certain areas.  Further research should be carried out to clearly identify  and focus on those market segments where Europe has  the possibility to demonstrate competitive advantage.  https://www.globallegalinsights.com/practice-areas/blockchain-laws-and-regulations/switzerland https://www.globallegalinsights.com/practice-areas/blockchain-laws-and-regulations/switzerland https://www.globallegalinsights.com/practice-areas/blockchain-laws-and-regulations/switzerland https://www.wipo.int/pressroom/en/articles/2019/article_0004.html https://www.wipo.int/pressroom/en/articles/2019/article_0004.html https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/diginomics/siemens-stellt-in-europa-die-meisten-patentantraege-16084333.html https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/diginomics/siemens-stellt-in-europa-die-meisten-patentantraege-16084333.html https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/diginomics/siemens-stellt-in-europa-die-meisten-patentantraege-16084333.html https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSObiJnNKLa https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSObiJnNKLa  OPINION PAPERS 3  EUROPEAN UNION AGENCY FOR CYBERSECURITY  markets, Europe is now debating the appropriateness  of the supply of 5G technology from non-European  suppliers.7 Traditional EU mobile handset manufacturers  are struggling to compete with major Asian and US  suppliers. Europe is dragging its feet with regard to  investment in emerging technologies, attracting a mere  11 percent of the global corporate investment and  venture capital in AI in 2016. This compares with 50  percent in the US and 39 percent in Asia.8  Back in the 1980s, the technology challenge between  the EU standard Video 2000 developed by Grundig  and Philips, the Japanese Betamax, and the US VHS for  domestic video recording and watching was taking place.

However,  the EU’s normative power alone cannot guarantee  the digital sovereignty of its citizens or its businesses.  To regain its influence and shed its status as an ICT  industry lightweight, Europe needs to deliver European  champions in the ICT sector that succeed in the  marketplace.  While the EU continues to engage in bilateral Free  Trade Agreements as opposed to multilateral trade  agreements, and the EU applies a strict interpretation of  competition law, it can be argued that its competitors do  not share the same values. Consequently, the EU may be  suffering a serious competitive disadvantage.  While it is not proposed that Europe try and build a  global PC company, but rather that it should focus on  its existing strengths, consideration could be given  to adopting a more flexible approach to mergers and  acquisitions policy to allow European companies to  expand further and compete effectively in the global  marketplace. A revised strategic approach to the  European ICT sector that targets the areas in which  EU industry has the potential to excel, would enable  European businesses to capitalise on comparative  advantages that have remained untapped to date.  Interestingly, in 2016, key players in the European  cybersecurity industry made a number of  recommendations on cybersecurity for Europe. The  recommendations of this group, which is known as  the European Cybersecurity Industry Leaders (ECIL),  include:10  1.  Creating a level playing field for enterprises within  the EU;  2.  Establishing voluntary cybersecurity certification  processes at the European level;  3.  Promoting and enhancing cooperation between EU  Member States;  4.  Positively considering market consolidation  and adapting merger rules accordingly (“Airbus  approach”11).

Securing, developing and keeping European intellectual  property in the EU should be a priority, as should the  creation of a flexible legal framework that can contribute  to the scalability of European ICT businesses.

THE CYCLE OF FAILURE IN EU ICT  INDUSTRIAL POLICY 2.1 CHALLENGES OF THE EU ICT INDUSTRY  In 1991, the Global System for Mobile Communications  (GSM) was first launched in the European markets. GSM  technologies subsequently came to dominate the global  marketplace. GSM is a classic example of a European  success story. It illustrates the strength of European  innovation, but also the strengths of European  governance, which succeeded in handling the complexity  and coordination of public and private stakeholders to  support the rollout of GSM in Europe. In the years  following the successes of GSM, examples of European  leadership in the ICT industry begin to fade. This is  illustrated by the absence of any European  players in  the top 15 digital companies worldwide. The question is  why, and how can Europe get back on track?  Figure 5: Top 15 global digital companies17  In the ICT sector in particular, time to market can be equally  important as delivering quality products. From the 1980s to  the 2000s, Siemens sold mobile phones. A jovial expression  that makes fun about the durability of Siemens phones  17 European Commission, “Europe in May 2019: Preparing for a  more united, stronger and more democratic Union in an increasingly  uncertain world”, 30th April 2019.

Despite the high quality and  durability of these products, Siemens eventually sold  its mobile branch to BenQ, a Taiwanese company. 19  An  important aspect to the decline of Siemens mobile phone  manufacturing was possible over-engineering and delays in  bringing the products to market. Other missed marketing  opportunities included the launching of new products after  the Christmas market was finished.  European businesses with a high market potential are  often acquired by companies from outside of the EU  that see the strategic value of investing in Europe. For  example, the German company Secusmart was founded  in 2007 and quickly became an important player in  anti-eavesdropping solutions for mobile  communications.20 Recognising the vast potential of this  rising star of ICT industry, Blackberry acquired ecusmart  18 See Siemens Belgium website: https://www.siemens.be/cmc/ newsletters/index.aspx?id=13-613-17686  19 Deutsche Welle, “Siemens sells cell phone unit”, 7th June 2006.

These examples also illustrate the assertiveness of  non-EU players and the lack of enthusiasm of European  players when it comes to investing in new companies  with growth potential. Perhaps the scale and differences  across the EU Member States also form part of the  challenge. The current population of over 500 million  spread across 28 Member States (19 of which are in the  Eurozone), as well as 24 official languages,can be seen as  adding to the complexity of building strong ICT industry  players in the EU.  Figure 6: Acquisitions of EU tech companies made by  large US tech companies (Slush & Atomico)22  By comparison, a country like the US, with a population  of roughly 300 million, a single currency, and one  national language, appears to benefit from significant  advantages. Diversity can also be the EU’s strength, but  only when cross-fertilisation of ideas and coordination  of industrial efforts are successfully achieved and first  21 Broedersen, Bjoern, “Blackberry kauft Sicherheits-Spezialisten  Secusmart”, areamobile, 29th July 2014.

The greater use of pan- European standards, as is proposed for cybersecurity  in the current EU Cybersecurity Act, can contribute to  achieving this objective.  Europe is known for its numerous and innovative SMEs,  but European ICT businesses typically neither grow  by means of mergers nor acquisitions, nor do they  succeed in achieving scale. These shortcomings can in  part be traced back to a perceived overly burdensome  regulatory environment that does not encourage growth  and risk taking.  The EU also appears to lack a strong entrepreneurial  culture, and conservative attitudes in European  companies may lead to lower numbers of acquisitions.  European businesses typically refrain from taking  the risks that their overseas competitors take and  accordingly do not reap the benefits that can be the  outcome of calculated risk-taking behaviour. Even in  the EU, there appears to be a high level of lobbying  and representations by US companies.23 Furthermore,  successful European businesses are often acquired by  larger companies from outside the EU.  23 Of the top six lobbying companies and groups by meetings in  the EU Transparency Register, four represent US tech companies:  Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and IBM, See: Transparency  International EU, “EU Integrity Watch”.

However, if and when  the same or similar standards are not being upheld  abroad, it makes for an uneven playing field for  European business. For example, as reported by the  Commission, EU stakeholders claim that certain non-EU  ICT companies widely use patented technologies without  paying adequate royalties.25  It is also observed that non-EU market actors make  attempts to dump their products on the European  market at artificially low prices that do not accurately  reflect the production costs.26 Furthermore, another  practice that can distort competition is unfair state  subsidies in countries outside of the EU, to the  competitive disadvantage of European ICT businesses.27  To address the new globalised landscape of competition  24 Dell’Oro Group, “Key Takeaways – Worldwide Telecom Equipment  Market 2018”, 4 March 2019.

This new approach would entail a revision of existing  European competition rules.28  The challenges faced by European industry are for  example reflected in the telecommunications equipment  market, where the revenue share of major European  players has declined in recent years.  2.2 CHALLENGES TO EU DIGITAL  SOVEREIGNTY  EU digital sovereignty has become a major policy issue  and challenge for the operators of digital services, the  end users, policymakers, and academia/think tanks.  Europe is increasingly importing ICT products and  services in a globalised marketplace to a point where  the value of cybersecurity has been diminished to a level  that European digital service operators are no longer  in a position to guarantee the cybersecurity aspects of  their products and services. This approach runs contrary  to the high standards of privacy and data protection set  down in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  where Europe is seen to be a leader in this area.  28 Alipranti, Z, “France and Germany set to tilt EU competition policy”,  Open Europe, 6 March 2019.

It is difficult to explain this contradiction from a  European perspective. Perhaps one of the reasons for  this difficulty is insufficient coordination in relation  to cybersecurity in the EU. Many Member States are  actively working in the area of cybersecurity. However,  this effort is being duplicated at high expense and  reducing the efficient use of funds and resources.29  Strengthening cooperation between Member States  and avoiding duplication of both human and financial  resources can contribute to addressing this issue.  Figure 8: If Europe fails, its ICT industry will be only  history30  European digital sovereignty can be perceived as  encompassing three categories:31  29 European Commission, “Proposal for a Regulation of the European  Parliament and of the Council establishing the European Cybersecurity  Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre and the Network  of National Coordination Centres”, 12 September 2018, COM(2018)  630.

Available at: http:// www.fondapol.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/F.GUEHAM-Digital-  1.  The data sovereignty over the personal data of EU  citizens – the personal aspect;  2.  The digital sovereignty of data-driven European  industry – the industry aspect; and  3.  The digital sovereignty of the EU and the EU Member  States – the political aspect.  These three categories are interrelated as they all  hinge on the ability of the EU to foster and maintain  its strategic ICT sector. With the manufacturing  and development of ICT products and services  predominately in control of non-EU industry, the  difficulty of working towards a digitally sovereign Europe  is significantly increased.  Cumulatively, the above factors could be interpreted as  a failure of European ICT industrial policy. Beyond taking  baby steps, tackling this perceived cycle of failure  requires a paradigm shift in the way we think about the  ICT industry in Europe and a radical break with current  practice. The section below outlines possible approaches  to support the future development of a more globally  competitive EU ICT sector and thus reduce the  dependency of EU Member States on ICT vendors  outside the EU  Sovereignty.pdf  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/proposal-regulation-establishing-european-cybersecurity-industrial-technology-and-research https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/proposal-regulation-establishing-european-cybersecurity-industrial-technology-and-research https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/proposal-regulation-establishing-european-cybersecurity-industrial-technology-and-research https://www.pinterest.com/pin/478507529128344375/ https://www.pinterest.com/pin/478507529128344375/ http://www.fondapol.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/F.GUEHAM-Digital-Sovereignty.pdf http://www.fondapol.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/F.GUEHAM-Digital-Sovereignty.pdf http://www.fondapol.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/F.GUEHAM-Digital-Sovereignty.pdf  OPINION PAPERS 11  EUROPEAN UNION AGENCY FOR CYBERSECURITY  3. HUAWEI AS A CHINESE ICT  INDUSTRY SUCCESS STORY  According to figures from 2018, the biggest mobile  phone exporters are in Asia (China and Vietnam).32 One  of the fastest growing businesses in this area is Huawei,  which in 2018 surpassed Apple as the second largest  smartphone company by market share.33 Strategic  investment decisions can be perceived as an important  dimension of Huawei’s ascent.  Microsoft completed its acquisition of the mobile  phone manufacturing branch of Nokia in 2014, creating  Microsoft Mobile. This acquisition was followed by  the gradual divestment and eventual closure of the  operation. Subsequently, HMD Global, a Finnish start-up,  acquired the mobile phone branch of Nokia.34  With the decline of Nokia’s mobile phone presence,  Huawei made a strategic decision to invest in Finland  and the engineers who used to work in Nokia35 by  establishing an R&D centre in Helsinki in 201236 and  another R&D facility in Tampere in 201737. These facilities  leveraged the expertise in the camera technology and  the antennas associated with mobile phones.  What this in effect means is that the supply chain is  very complex and we see that European expertise is  recognised by Asian manufacturers and that they are  prepared to invest in this expertise to accelerate the  bringing to market of European world class products and  technology.  The disappointing part is that European mobile phone  manufacturers were not prepared to make this strategic  investment in European technology and people.

Other differences that potentially  make non-European and non-OECD companies  more competitive are the diverging corporate social  responsibility (CSR) norms, as well as looser regulatory  compliance requirements.

BREAKING THE CYCLE  4.1 THE EU ICT INDUSTRY AS  A STRATEGIC SECTOR  While the EU has very strong competition rules in relation  to commercial activity, the success of the Airbus project  in the 1990s was based on the strategic realisation of the  importance of the aircraft industry, a very close liaison  between government and industry39, and the recognition  of the difficulty of competing in this area on a global  scale. An alternative business model with regard to the  EU ICT industry, taking into account the Airbus example,  could replicate this success and contribute to the global  competitiveness of European ICT products and services.  Consideration could be given to adopting a flexible  interpretation of competition rules with an aim to  creating a protected environment for local players  identified as strategic on the European market and  stimulating the growth potential of EU ICT businesses.  It is noteworthy in this regard that a similar approach  has already been adopted by non-European countries.  At an EU level, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP),  which has been applied for the last few decades,  forms an example of how strategic markets can be  afforded special attention. Perhaps the time is now  ripe to consider the European ICT industry for similar  treatment.  Recognising that Europe is currently falling behind the  US and Asia, a flexible approach to legislative and/or  financial policies should be considered to facilitate and  stimulate the EU ICT manufacturing and service sector.  The support of this sector should not only stimulate  financial investment but also generate human capital  investment, where products and services could be  delivered that represent European values and standards  while positioning Europe well in the export market.  Additionally, the European public sector has the ability  to encourage a more demand-driven market instead of  the existing market, which is driven by the supply push  principle alone. One option is to contribute to innovation  in the ICT industry and to maximise public procurement in  this area with an aim of stimulating the European market.  A prospective reinvigoration of the ICT industrial  strategy in Europe would require an evidence-based  strategic approach. This process starts with identifying  and studying the market to clarify the strengths  39 Von Dohnanyi, Klaus, “Dohnanyi: Die Lehren aus dem Airbus-Erfolg”,  Hamburger Abendblatt, 3 February 2001. Available at: https://www. abendblatt.de/archiv/2001/article204759423/Dohnanyi-Die-Lehren- aus-dem-Airbus-Erfolg.html  and weaknesses of the EU ICT sector, and weigh the  opportunities for success, as well as the threats that may  impede further development. In this manner, the EU  can build a comparative advantage by targeting areas  of relative strength that demonstrate a potential to  compete in the global marketplace.  A degree of self-reflection on the European ICT industry  may be needed to identify on what advantages Europe  should compete in order to avoid getting lost in the  middle (costs, quality, or customer relationship), as  illustrated in the figure below.  Clearly, Europe cannot win in terms of costs in a global  competitive environment given the standard of living  and culture of government support for citizens. This  model suggests that Europe’s competitive advantage can  or should be delivered by way of product leadership and  quality and/or having in place a special relationship with  customers.  Figure 10: Possible sources of competitive advantage  The power of the European market, given its size, should  not be underestimated. The GDPR has extraterritorial  effect in that third country companies who supply  services on the European market are obliged to comply  with this Regulation. A similar argument can be applied  to the certification proposals contained in respect of  cybersecurity in the EU Cybersecurity Act. In this regard,  market decisions enforceable by European law can have  an effect on third country markets and impose on them  European values and cultures.

In particular,  the European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI), a joint  effort of the European Investment Bank, the European  Investment Fund, and the Commission, can be used  to finance digital projects and businesses including  broadband investments, start-ups and scale-ups, IoT,  cybersecurity, and emerging priorities (including 5G  and automated driving). Current efforts within this  framework are aimed primarily at contributing to digital  infrastructure projects.40 TThis positive initiative needs  to focus more on the software that runs on digital  platforms rather than the digital platforms themselves.  A similar initiative can be seen in the proposal of the  Commission aimed at encouraging a more focussed  investment in cybersecurity by the creation of centres  across the EU to focus on research and development in  the area of cyber security, as well as an EU-level centre41  4.2 PROMOTING THE TRUST AND QUALITY  OF EUROPEAN ICT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES  The comparative advantage of European products and  services is the high level of trust and quality that is  associated with the “made in the EU” label worldwide.  Following the high standards that Europe has adopted  in the GDPR, the EU should also capitalise on its ability  to develop products and services that deliver trusted  cybersecurity on a global scale.  The Cybersecurity Act42, and the proposal for a  European Cybersecurity Certification Framework  contained therein, lay the groundwork for developing  European cybersecurity trust labels that could boost the  competitiveness of ICT products and services globally.  European businesses also have one of the largest  consumer markets in the world, the EU, at their disposal,  and the delivery of certified products and services  can inspire the trust of consumers within the EU. The  ICT technology in a typical European office space may  change if the consumer perceives the choice as being  between a better quality and more secure product  manufactured in the EU versus a product manufactured  outside the EU with lower standards.  40 European Commission, “EFSI in the digital sector”.

Available at: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2017:477:FIN  4.3 MARKET FRAGMENTATION  In the European ICT context, the efforts both of industrial  players and of research organisations frequently are  fragmented, thereby hindering the attainment of  optimal results for the EU Digital Single Market. This  fragmentation of capabilities means that work may be  duplicated and that otherwise valuable contributions  to the European market are going to waste. In order to  overcome the challenges of market fragmentation, it is  necessary to coordinate and cooperate with regard to  the research and industrial capacities in the area of ICT.  Due regard should also be given to the effectiveness of  funding opportunities, which at present do not always  result in the most desirable outcomes.  The EU is taking steps aimed at facilitating the  coordination of efforts between Member States, as well  as cooperation at a European level. For example, in  September 2018 the Commission proposed a Regulation  establishing a European Cybersecurity Competence  Centre, as well as a network of Coordination Centres in  the Member States with a proposed Union contribution  to its budget of approximately two billion euros.43 This  draft Regulation aims to contribute to the European  Digital Single Market by creating a Europe-wide  ecosystem with a view to investing in stronger and  pioneering cybersecurity capacities in the EU. As follows,  the proposed Cybersecurity Competence Centre and  Network offers an opportunity to strengthen the  coordination of the efforts of cybersecurity research  and industry, and to make funding more accessible to  regions and untapped areas in the EU.  In the prospective implementation of this draft Regulation,  account should be taken of the effective and economical  distribution of EU funding to prevent a repetition of past  shortcomings, and to develop funding programmes that  work for European research and industry. ENISA is already  playing a role here by advising on research needs and  priorities with regard to cybersecurity.  4.4 SUPPORTING SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED  ENTERPRISES (SMES) IN THE EU ICT SECTOR  It is estimated that 99 percent of all businesses in the  EU are SMEs.44 With SMEs taking up such a significant  portion of European business, it is no overstatement to  say that SMEs form the backbone of the EU economy. It  is therefore essential that the EU provide the necessary  access to investment and support services to promote  innovation and productivity among European  43 See note 28  44 European Commission, “What is an SME?” Available at: https:// ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/business-friendly-environment/sme- definition_en  https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/jobs-growth-and-investment/investment-plan-europe-juncker-plan/investment-plan-results/efsi-digital-sector_en https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/jobs-growth-and-investment/investment-plan-europe-juncker-plan/investment-plan-results/efsi-digital-sector_en https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/jobs-growth-and-investment/investment-plan-europe-juncker-plan/investment-plan-results/efsi-digital-sector_en https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2017:477:FIN https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2017:477:FIN https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/business-friendly-environment/sme-definition_en https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/business-friendly-environment/sme-definition_en https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/business-friendly-environment/sme-definition_en  OPINION PAPERS 14  EUROPEAN UNION AGENCY FOR CYBERSECURITY  Figure 10: Venture capital funds raised (billion euro)  in the EU (excl.

Over the past years, European ICT SMEs  have been overburdened and underexploited and it is  observed that initial success on the EU market does not  easily translate into global competitiveness. Moreover, the  companies that achieve a certain level of success often  move their headquarters outside the EU to jurisdictions  that are perceived as having a more favourable business  climate.46 Notwithstanding this, the potential of European  ICT SMEs is boundless – SMEs are drivers of innovation  and frequently offer high quality products and services.  When we look at the market value of the top 100  companies globally, the influence of digital companies  can be clearly seen as they increase in value and displace  the traditional brick and mortar companies. Many of  these digital companies started off some twenty years  ago as small SMEs with a vision.  In other sectors such as manufacturing, which is  typically characterised by relatively low technology  intensity, European players have been able to produce  competitive SMEs that have developed into successful  global players. It is unclear why such SME champions  have succeeded in manufacturing, but not in ICT  45 European Commission, “Science, Research and Innovation  Performance of the EU 2018”.

Available  at: https://www.ft.com/content/33a85426-6277-11e7-8814- 0ac7eb84e5f1  Supporting European SMEs means facilitating access  to capital thereby reducing barriers to much-needed  funding for small businesses. It also means contributing  to a strong culture of entrepreneurship with a  supportive and constructive industrial policy. This policy  should reflect European ambition, build on the strengths  of European industry, including European SMEs, and  stress the reputation of trustworthiness and security for  which EU products have become known globally. ENISA  contributes by providing a forum for discussion on how  to better understand and improve the market for SMEs,  e.g. through its Industry Events. In relation to supporting  SMEs, consideration should be given to their future  growth potential and the application of global best  practices that exist for SME support.  4.5 BUILDING A EUROPEAN START-UP  CULTURE WHERE FAILURE IS NOT A STIGMA  A closely related issue is the need to nurture and  encourage an entrepreneurial start-up culture across  the EU. Nurturing the European start-up culture can help  stimulate the building and the accelerating of start- ups, as well as their further development into scaled- up companies. European start-up unicorns47 remain  underrepresented in relative terms in comparison with  their US and Asian counterparts.  47 Recognising the definition of a unicorn as a start-up company  that reaches a value of $1 billion or more, see: CB Insights, “The  Global Unicorn Club”, 2019.

The risk appetite of US companies means that  they appear to be more likely to look beyond the present  revenue of a business, but to focus on the potential  future value of investment opportunities.  The support of a risk-based entrepreneurial culture and  the effective use of venture capital are key to addressing  start-up culture in the EU. The market attractiveness for  start-ups can also be boosted by reducing administrative  burdens while providing the appropriate state  assistance. From a business culture perspective, EU  companies should not shy away from risk and factor in  more the future potential of investment opportunities  when making a valuation.  47 European Commission, “Science, Research and Innovation  Performance of the EU 2018”.

Furthermore, Europe’s leading universities and technical  colleges can drive innovation and contribute to the  development of industry. Survey results indicate that the  proportion of start-ups founded from a university or a  university project (spin-offs) is lower in the selected EU  Member States than in neighbouring Switzerland. In fact,  in Switzerland the number was 18.1 percent, whereas  the next highest-ranking EU Member State had only 13.5  percentt.52 Encouraging and investing more in the  academic spin-off model can play an important role in  harnessing Europe’s innovative capacities and  supporting young entrepreneurial talent in the EU.  4.6 CYBERSECURITY SKILLS AND TRAINING  A prerequisite for a booming European ICT sector is to  support a strong cybersecurity skills base across the  EU. In this regard, the challenge faced by the European  market is two-fold. Firstly, there is a cybersecurity skills  shortage in the EU and, secondly, the skills available  are not being used in the most effective and efficient  manner possible.

CONCLUSIONS AND  RECOMMENDATIONS 5.1 CONCLUSIONS  Digital development policy should work for and not  against the European market. While a progressive  scenario would see the adoption of a positive and  collaborative policy that builds on the complementary  strengths of various global players, the present reality  requires a more pragmatic approach.  Success requires risk. New business and regulatory  models need to be produced that anticipate the  evolution of the market over the next 5 to 10 years and  lay the groundwork for the success of the European ICT  industry. Government needs to act as a stimulus and not  an inhibitor to this progress.  In an increasingly inter-connected world, the European  ICT sector should be strengthened and stimulated to  improve its competitiveness in the global marketplace,  as well as in the domestic marketplace. A number of  recommendations can contribute to this goal:  1.  The EU should revisit its ICT industrial policy by  recognising it as strategic, while also supporting its ICT  sector.  2.  Building on the Airbus success story, competition law  should be interpreted flexibly and in a manner that  supports and incentivises the European ICT industry;  3.  The EU and Member States should reduce regulatory  barriers and administrative burdens for EU ICT  businesses;  4.  European IP needs to be protected. The EU and  Member States should consider identifying European  IP developed with public funds as strategic and  subjecting it to pre-export regulatory approval;  5.  Public procurement in the Member States should be  used to stimulate the EU ICT industry;  6.  The EU needs a long-term strategy for building and  maintaining a cyber-skilled Europe;  7.  The EU should embrace and encourage a more risk- based entrepreneurial culture. Venture capital should  be more readily accessible to European ICT businesses  with strong growth potential.  5.2 QUESTIONS FOR CONSULTATION  1.

Sandwiched  between the giants of the ICT industry in the US and  Asia, Europe is struggling to keep up and risks losing  hold of its own digital sovereignty.  Surprisingly, this is happening while the EU and EU  Member States are among the most digitally developed  world economies1.  Europe has created a number of  successes such as Skype, Sailfish, F-Secure, AVG, Signal,  and the re-emergence of Nokia mobile handsets. We  also see in Switzerland a culture of promoting start-ups  and supporting the financial sector and in particular the  encouragement of blockchain with supporting regulatory  1 European Commission, “I-DESI 2018”, 26 October 2018.

Figure 1 portrays a traditional depiction of the current  state of the global ICT market, where the EU is stuck in  the middle between the US and Asia.  However, it is suggested that the marketplace is  more complicated than the above diagram seems to  indicate. In order to gain a better understanding of the  marketplace, the first question that needs to be analysed  is in what part/segment of the market do we intend to  compete. Any market analysis will always clearly indicate  that you cannot compete in every aspect of the market,  that market segmentations are different and that any  competitive advantage is only temporary. For example,  if we take the 5G market, the hamburger could be seen  from a different perspective, as illustrated in figure 2:  2 Global Legal Insights, “Blockchain and Cryptocurrency  Regulation 2019 | Switzerland”, 2019. Available at: https://www. globallegalinsights.com/practice-areas/blockchain-laws-and- regulations/switzerland  Given the proposal for the development of cybersecurity  competence centres, one of the initial tasks could be the  gathering of evidence to support the decision-making  process, as no report has been identified that addresses  this aspect of the market research.  The US reportedly filed 56,142 international patents  in 2018, closely followed by China with 53,345 patent  filings3.  Approximately one in ten of the Chinese  applications came from Huawei Technologies, making it  the leading filer of international patent applications for  20184.  At a European level, according to the European  Patent Office (EPO) figures for 2018, Siemens had the  highest number of patent applications and was ahead  of Huawei by a narrow margin, with 2,493 applications  compared with Huawei’s 2,4855.  ICT and cybersecurity are closely interlinked. While  ENISA’s mandate is to focus on cybersecurity, the  importance and strategic aspect of cybersecurity  underpins the ICT sector in relation to both hardware  and software. Strengthening EU cybersecurity is key to  securing European digital sovereignty and the EU ICT  industry. Given the size of the European market in a  global marketplace, Europe finds itself as an ICT taker  rather than an ICT maker. Any solution to the European  ICT problem will require an equivalent European  cybersecurity solution, which should be seen as an  opportunity rather than an insolvable problem.  This short consultation paper looks at the strengths  and shortcomings of the ICT industrial policy in the EU  with a view to how Europe can do better, and how the  development of the EU ICT industry in the years to come  can be rendered a success and not a failure.  If we sit in an average European office, the computers  and printers are generally produced in Asia and the  software is primarily developed in the US.

It is suggested that European policy  has followed the approach of trying to be a master of  everything. Clearly, this is not an ideal situation. Europe  needs to identify its market, gather the necessary  evidence to identify the correct market segment, and  pursue a specific strategic approach. In this regard, do  we need another European Facebook? Or a European TV  screen manufacturer?  Europe has a strong track record  in developing key software, car manufacturing, and  intellectual property in certain areas.  Further research should be carried out to clearly identify  and focus on those market segments where Europe has  the possibility to demonstrate competitive advantage.  https://www.globallegalinsights.com/practice-areas/blockchain-laws-and-regulations/switzerland https://www.globallegalinsights.com/practice-areas/blockchain-laws-and-regulations/switzerland https://www.globallegalinsights.com/practice-areas/blockchain-laws-and-regulations/switzerland https://www.wipo.int/pressroom/en/articles/2019/article_0004.html https://www.wipo.int/pressroom/en/articles/2019/article_0004.html https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/diginomics/siemens-stellt-in-europa-die-meisten-patentantraege-16084333.html https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/diginomics/siemens-stellt-in-europa-die-meisten-patentantraege-16084333.html https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/diginomics/siemens-stellt-in-europa-die-meisten-patentantraege-16084333.html https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSObiJnNKLa https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSObiJnNKLa  OPINION PAPERS 3  EUROPEAN UNION AGENCY FOR CYBERSECURITY  markets, Europe is now debating the appropriateness  of the supply of 5G technology from non-European  suppliers.7 Traditional EU mobile handset manufacturers  are struggling to compete with major Asian and US  suppliers. Europe is dragging its feet with regard to  investment in emerging technologies, attracting a mere  11 percent of the global corporate investment and  venture capital in AI in 2016. This compares with 50  percent in the US and 39 percent in Asia.8  Back in the 1980s, the technology challenge between  the EU standard Video 2000 developed by Grundig  and Philips, the Japanese Betamax, and the US VHS for  domestic video recording and watching was taking place.

However,  the EU’s normative power alone cannot guarantee  the digital sovereignty of its citizens or its businesses.  To regain its influence and shed its status as an ICT  industry lightweight, Europe needs to deliver European  champions in the ICT sector that succeed in the  marketplace.  While the EU continues to engage in bilateral Free  Trade Agreements as opposed to multilateral trade  agreements, and the EU applies a strict interpretation of  competition law, it can be argued that its competitors do  not share the same values. Consequently, the EU may be  suffering a serious competitive disadvantage.  While it is not proposed that Europe try and build a  global PC company, but rather that it should focus on  its existing strengths, consideration could be given  to adopting a more flexible approach to mergers and  acquisitions policy to allow European companies to  expand further and compete effectively in the global  marketplace. A revised strategic approach to the  European ICT sector that targets the areas in which  EU industry has the potential to excel, would enable  European businesses to capitalise on comparative  advantages that have remained untapped to date.  Interestingly, in 2016, key players in the European  cybersecurity industry made a number of  recommendations on cybersecurity for Europe. The  recommendations of this group, which is known as  the European Cybersecurity Industry Leaders (ECIL),  include:10  1.  Creating a level playing field for enterprises within  the EU;  2.  Establishing voluntary cybersecurity certification  processes at the European level;  3.  Promoting and enhancing cooperation between EU  Member States;  4.  Positively considering market consolidation  and adapting merger rules accordingly (“Airbus  approach”11).

Securing, developing and keeping European intellectual  property in the EU should be a priority, as should the  creation of a flexible legal framework that can contribute  to the scalability of European ICT businesses.

THE CYCLE OF FAILURE IN EU ICT  INDUSTRIAL POLICY 2.1 CHALLENGES OF THE EU ICT INDUSTRY  In 1991, the Global System for Mobile Communications  (GSM) was first launched in the European markets. GSM  technologies subsequently came to dominate the global  marketplace. GSM is a classic example of a European  success story. It illustrates the strength of European  innovation, but also the strengths of European  governance, which succeeded in handling the complexity  and coordination of public and private stakeholders to  support the rollout of GSM in Europe. In the years  following the successes of GSM, examples of European  leadership in the ICT industry begin to fade. This is  illustrated by the absence of any European  players in  the top 15 digital companies worldwide. The question is  why, and how can Europe get back on track?  Figure 5: Top 15 global digital companies17  In the ICT sector in particular, time to market can be equally  important as delivering quality products.

Despite the high quality and  durability of these products, Siemens eventually sold  its mobile branch to BenQ, a Taiwanese company. 19  An  important aspect to the decline of Siemens mobile phone  manufacturing was possible over-engineering and delays in  bringing the products to market.

These examples also illustrate the assertiveness of  non-EU players and the lack of enthusiasm of European  players when it comes to investing in new companies  with growth potential. Perhaps the scale and differences  across the EU Member States also form part of the  challenge. The current population of over 500 million  spread across 28 Member States (19 of which are in the  Eurozone), as well as 24 official languages,can be seen as  adding to the complexity of building strong ICT industry  players in the EU.  Figure 6: Acquisitions of EU tech companies made by  large US tech companies (Slush & Atomico)22  By comparison, a country like the US, with a population  of roughly 300 million, a single currency, and one  national language, appears to benefit from significant  advantages.

The greater use of pan- European standards, as is proposed for cybersecurity  in the current EU Cybersecurity Act, can contribute to  achieving this objective.  Europe is known for its numerous and innovative SMEs,  but European ICT businesses typically neither grow  by means of mergers nor acquisitions, nor do they  succeed in achieving scale. These shortcomings can in  part be traced back to a perceived overly burdensome  regulatory environment that does not encourage growth  and risk taking.  The EU also appears to lack a strong entrepreneurial  culture, and conservative attitudes in European  companies may lead to lower numbers of acquisitions.  European businesses typically refrain from taking  the risks that their overseas competitors take and  accordingly do not reap the benefits that can be the  outcome of calculated risk-taking behaviour. Even in  the EU, there appears to be a high level of lobbying  and representations by US companies.23 Furthermore,  successful European businesses are often acquired by  larger companies from outside the EU.  23 Of the top six lobbying companies and groups by meetings in  the EU Transparency Register, four represent US tech companies:  Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and IBM, See: Transparency  International EU, “EU Integrity Watch”.

However, if and when  the same or similar standards are not being upheld  abroad, it makes for an uneven playing field for  European business. For example, as reported by the  Commission, EU stakeholders claim that certain non-EU  ICT companies widely use patented technologies without  paying adequate royalties.25  It is also observed that non-EU market actors make  attempts to dump their products on the European  market at artificially low prices that do not accurately  reflect the production costs.26 Furthermore, another  practice that can distort competition is unfair state  subsidies in countries outside of the EU, to the  competitive disadvantage of European ICT businesses.27  To address the new globalised landscape of competition  24 Dell’Oro Group, “Key Takeaways – Worldwide Telecom Equipment  Market 2018”, 4 March 2019.

This new approach would entail a revision of existing  European competition rules.28  The challenges faced by European industry are for  example reflected in the telecommunications equipment  market, where the revenue share of major European  players has declined in recent years.  2.2 CHALLENGES TO EU DIGITAL  SOVEREIGNTY  EU digital sovereignty has become a major policy issue  and challenge for the operators of digital services, the  end users, policymakers, and academia/think tanks.  Europe is increasingly importing ICT products and  services in a globalised marketplace to a point where  the value of cybersecurity has been diminished to a level  that European digital service operators are no longer  in a position to guarantee the cybersecurity aspects of  their products and services. This approach runs contrary  to the high standards of privacy and data protection set  down in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  where Europe is seen to be a leader in this area.  28 Alipranti, Z, “France and Germany set to tilt EU competition policy”,  Open Europe, 6 March 2019.

It is difficult to explain this contradiction from a  European perspective. Perhaps one of the reasons for  this difficulty is insufficient coordination in relation  to cybersecurity in the EU. Many Member States are  actively working in the area of cybersecurity. However,  this effort is being duplicated at high expense and  reducing the efficient use of funds and resources.29  Strengthening cooperation between Member States  and avoiding duplication of both human and financial  resources can contribute to addressing this issue.  Figure 8: If Europe fails, its ICT industry will be only  history30  European digital sovereignty can be perceived as  encompassing three categories:31  29 European Commission, “Proposal for a Regulation of the European  Parliament and of the Council establishing the European Cybersecurity  Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre and the Network  of National Coordination Centres”, 12 September 2018, COM(2018)  630.

The digital sovereignty of data-driven European  industry – the industry aspect; and  3.  The digital sovereignty of the EU and the EU Member  States – the political aspect.  These three categories are interrelated as they all  hinge on the ability of the EU to foster and maintain  its strategic ICT sector. With the manufacturing  and development of ICT products and services  predominately in control of non-EU industry, the  difficulty of working towards a digitally sovereign Europe  is significantly increased.  Cumulatively, the above factors could be interpreted as  a failure of European ICT industrial policy. Beyond taking  baby steps, tackling this perceived cycle of failure  requires a paradigm shift in the way we think about the  ICT industry in Europe and a radical break with current  practice.

HUAWEI AS A CHINESE ICT  INDUSTRY SUCCESS STORY  According to figures from 2018, the biggest mobile  phone exporters are in Asia (China and Vietnam).32 One  of the fastest growing businesses in this area is Huawei,  which in 2018 surpassed Apple as the second largest  smartphone company by market share.33 Strategic  investment decisions can be perceived as an important  dimension of Huawei’s ascent.  Microsoft completed its acquisition of the mobile  phone manufacturing branch of Nokia in 2014, creating  Microsoft Mobile. This acquisition was followed by  the gradual divestment and eventual closure of the  operation. Subsequently, HMD Global, a Finnish start-up,  acquired the mobile phone branch of Nokia.34  With the decline of Nokia’s mobile phone presence,  Huawei made a strategic decision to invest in Finland  and the engineers who used to work in Nokia35 by  establishing an R&D centre in Helsinki in 201236 and  another R&D facility in Tampere in 201737. These facilities  leveraged the expertise in the camera technology and  the antennas associated with mobile phones.  What this in effect means is that the supply chain is  very complex and we see that European expertise is  recognised by Asian manufacturers and that they are  prepared to invest in this expertise to accelerate the  bringing to market of European world class products and  technology.  The disappointing part is that European mobile phone  manufacturers were not prepared to make this strategic  investment in European technology and people.

Other differences that potentially  make non-European and non-OECD companies  more competitive are the diverging corporate social  responsibility (CSR) norms, as well as looser regulatory  compliance requirements.

BREAKING THE CYCLE  4.1 THE EU ICT INDUSTRY AS  A STRATEGIC SECTOR  While the EU has very strong competition rules in relation  to commercial activity, the success of the Airbus project  in the 1990s was based on the strategic realisation of the  importance of the aircraft industry, a very close liaison  between government and industry39, and the recognition  of the difficulty of competing in this area on a global  scale. An alternative business model with regard to the  EU ICT industry, taking into account the Airbus example,  could replicate this success and contribute to the global  competitiveness of European ICT products and services.  Consideration could be given to adopting a flexible  interpretation of competition rules with an aim to  creating a protected environment for local players  identified as strategic on the European market and  stimulating the growth potential of EU ICT businesses.  It is noteworthy in this regard that a similar approach  has already been adopted by non-European countries.  At an EU level, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP),  which has been applied for the last few decades,  forms an example of how strategic markets can be  afforded special attention. Perhaps the time is now  ripe to consider the European ICT industry for similar  treatment.  Recognising that Europe is currently falling behind the  US and Asia, a flexible approach to legislative and/or  financial policies should be considered to facilitate and  stimulate the EU ICT manufacturing and service sector.  The support of this sector should not only stimulate  financial investment but also generate human capital  investment, where products and services could be  delivered that represent European values and standards  while positioning Europe well in the export market.  Additionally, the European public sector has the ability  to encourage a more demand-driven market instead of  the existing market, which is driven by the supply push  principle alone. One option is to contribute to innovation  in the ICT industry and to maximise public procurement in  this area with an aim of stimulating the European market.  A prospective reinvigoration of the ICT industrial  strategy in Europe would require an evidence-based  strategic approach. This process starts with identifying  and studying the market to clarify the strengths  39 Von Dohnanyi, Klaus, “Dohnanyi: Die Lehren aus dem Airbus-Erfolg”,  Hamburger Abendblatt, 3 February 2001. Available at: https://www. abendblatt.de/archiv/2001/article204759423/Dohnanyi-Die-Lehren- aus-dem-Airbus-Erfolg.html  and weaknesses of the EU ICT sector, and weigh the  opportunities for success, as well as the threats that may  impede further development. In this manner, the EU  can build a comparative advantage by targeting areas  of relative strength that demonstrate a potential to  compete in the global marketplace.  A degree of self-reflection on the European ICT industry  may be needed to identify on what advantages Europe  should compete in order to avoid getting lost in the  middle (costs, quality, or customer relationship), as  illustrated in the figure below.  Clearly, Europe cannot win in terms of costs in a global  competitive environment given the standard of living  and culture of government support for citizens. This  model suggests that Europe’s competitive advantage can  or should be delivered by way of product leadership and  quality and/or having in place a special relationship with  customers.  Figure 10: Possible sources of competitive advantage  The power of the European market, given its size, should  not be underestimated. The GDPR has extraterritorial  effect in that third country companies who supply  services on the European market are obliged to comply  with this Regulation. A similar argument can be applied  to the certification proposals contained in respect of  cybersecurity in the EU Cybersecurity Act. In this regard,  market decisions enforceable by European law can have  an effect on third country markets and impose on them  European values and cultures.

In particular,  the European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI), a joint  effort of the European Investment Bank, the European  Investment Fund, and the Commission, can be used  to finance digital projects and businesses including  broadband investments, start-ups and scale-ups, IoT,  cybersecurity, and emerging priorities (including 5G  and automated driving). Current efforts within this  framework are aimed primarily at contributing to digital  infrastructure projects.40 TThis positive initiative needs  to focus more on the software that runs on digital  platforms rather than the digital platforms themselves.  A similar initiative can be seen in the proposal of the  Commission aimed at encouraging a more focussed  investment in cybersecurity by the creation of centres  across the EU to focus on research and development in  the area of cyber security, as well as an EU-level centre41  4.2 PROMOTING THE TRUST AND QUALITY  OF EUROPEAN ICT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES  The comparative advantage of European products and  services is the high level of trust and quality that is  associated with the “made in the EU” label worldwide.  Following the high standards that Europe has adopted  in the GDPR, the EU should also capitalise on its ability  to develop products and services that deliver trusted  cybersecurity on a global scale.  The Cybersecurity Act42, and the proposal for a  European Cybersecurity Certification Framework  contained therein, lay the groundwork for developing  European cybersecurity trust labels that could boost the  competitiveness of ICT products and services globally.  European businesses also have one of the largest  consumer markets in the world, the EU, at their disposal,  and the delivery of certified products and services  can inspire the trust of consumers within the EU. The  ICT technology in a typical European office space may  change if the consumer perceives the choice as being  between a better quality and more secure product  manufactured in the EU versus a product manufactured  outside the EU with lower standards.  40 European Commission, “EFSI in the digital sector”.

This  fragmentation of capabilities means that work may be  duplicated and that otherwise valuable contributions  to the European market are going to waste. In order to  overcome the challenges of market fragmentation, it is  necessary to coordinate and cooperate with regard to  the research and industrial capacities in the area of ICT.  Due regard should also be given to the effectiveness of  funding opportunities, which at present do not always  result in the most desirable outcomes.  The EU is taking steps aimed at facilitating the  coordination of efforts between Member States, as well  as cooperation at a European level. For example, in  September 2018 the Commission proposed a Regulation  establishing a European Cybersecurity Competence  Centre, as well as a network of Coordination Centres in  the Member States with a proposed Union contribution  to its budget of approximately two billion euros.43 This  draft Regulation aims to contribute to the European  Digital Single Market by creating a Europe-wide  ecosystem with a view to investing in stronger and  pioneering cybersecurity capacities in the EU. As follows,  the proposed Cybersecurity Competence Centre and  Network offers an opportunity to strengthen the  coordination of the efforts of cybersecurity research  and industry, and to make funding more accessible to  regions and untapped areas in the EU.  In the prospective implementation of this draft Regulation,  account should be taken of the effective and economical  distribution of EU funding to prevent a repetition of past  shortcomings, and to develop funding programmes that  work for European research and industry. ENISA is already  playing a role here by advising on research needs and  priorities with regard to cybersecurity.  4.4 SUPPORTING SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED  ENTERPRISES (SMES) IN THE EU ICT SECTOR  It is estimated that 99 percent of all businesses in the  EU are SMEs.44 With SMEs taking up such a significant  portion of European business, it is no overstatement to  say that SMEs form the backbone of the EU economy. It  is therefore essential that the EU provide the necessary  access to investment and support services to promote  innovation and productivity among European  43 See note 28  44 European Commission, “What is an SME?” Available at: https:// ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/business-friendly-environment/sme- definition_en  https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/jobs-growth-and-investment/investment-plan-europe-juncker-plan/investment-plan-results/efsi-digital-sector_en https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/jobs-growth-and-investment/investment-plan-europe-juncker-plan/investment-plan-results/efsi-digital-sector_en https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/jobs-growth-and-investment/investment-plan-europe-juncker-plan/investment-plan-results/efsi-digital-sector_en https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2017:477:FIN https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2017:477:FIN https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/business-friendly-environment/sme-definition_en https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/business-friendly-environment/sme-definition_en https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/business-friendly-environment/sme-definition_en  OPINION PAPERS 14  EUROPEAN UNION AGENCY FOR CYBERSECURITY  Figure 10: Venture capital funds raised (billion euro)  in the EU (excl.

Over the past years, European ICT SMEs  have been overburdened and underexploited and it is  observed that initial success on the EU market does not  easily translate into global competitiveness. Moreover, the  companies that achieve a certain level of success often  move their headquarters outside the EU to jurisdictions  that are perceived as having a more favourable business  climate.46 Notwithstanding this, the potential of European  ICT SMEs is boundless – SMEs are drivers of innovation  and frequently offer high quality products and services.  When we look at the market value of the top 100  companies globally, the influence of digital companies  can be clearly seen as they increase in value and displace  the traditional brick and mortar companies. Many of  these digital companies started off some twenty years  ago as small SMEs with a vision.  In other sectors such as manufacturing, which is  typically characterised by relatively low technology  intensity, European players have been able to produce  competitive SMEs that have developed into successful  global players. It is unclear why such SME champions  have succeeded in manufacturing, but not in ICT  45 European Commission, “Science, Research and Innovation  Performance of the EU 2018”.

Available  at: https://www.ft.com/content/33a85426-6277-11e7-8814- 0ac7eb84e5f1  Supporting European SMEs means facilitating access  to capital thereby reducing barriers to much-needed  funding for small businesses. It also means contributing  to a strong culture of entrepreneurship with a  supportive and constructive industrial policy. This policy  should reflect European ambition, build on the strengths  of European industry, including European SMEs, and  stress the reputation of trustworthiness and security for  which EU products have become known globally. ENISA  contributes by providing a forum for discussion on how  to better understand and improve the market for SMEs,  e.g. through its Industry Events. In relation to supporting  SMEs, consideration should be given to their future  growth potential and the application of global best  practices that exist for SME support.  4.5 BUILDING A EUROPEAN START-UP  CULTURE WHERE FAILURE IS NOT A STIGMA  A closely related issue is the need to nurture and  encourage an entrepreneurial start-up culture across  the EU. Nurturing the European start-up culture can help  stimulate the building and the accelerating of start- ups, as well as their further development into scaled- up companies. European start-up unicorns47 remain  underrepresented in relative terms in comparison with  their US and Asian counterparts.  47 Recognising the definition of a unicorn as a start-up company  that reaches a value of $1 billion or more, see: CB Insights, “The  Global Unicorn Club”, 2019.

The risk appetite of US companies means that  they appear to be more likely to look beyond the present  revenue of a business, but to focus on the potential  future value of investment opportunities.  The support of a risk-based entrepreneurial culture and  the effective use of venture capital are key to addressing  start-up culture in the EU. The market attractiveness for  start-ups can also be boosted by reducing administrative  burdens while providing the appropriate state  assistance. From a business culture perspective, EU  companies should not shy away from risk and factor in  more the future potential of investment opportunities  when making a valuation.  47 European Commission, “Science, Research and Innovation  Performance of the EU 2018”.

Furthermore, Europe’s leading universities and technical  colleges can drive innovation and contribute to the  development of industry. Survey results indicate that the  proportion of start-ups founded from a university or a  university project (spin-offs) is lower in the selected EU  Member States than in neighbouring Switzerland. In fact,  in Switzerland the number was 18.1 percent, whereas  the next highest-ranking EU Member State had only 13.5  percentt.52 Encouraging and investing more in the  academic spin-off model can play an important role in  harnessing Europe’s innovative capacities and  supporting young entrepreneurial talent in the EU.  4.6 CYBERSECURITY SKILLS AND TRAINING  A prerequisite for a booming European ICT sector is to  support a strong cybersecurity skills base across the  EU. In this regard, the challenge faced by the European  market is two-fold. Firstly, there is a cybersecurity skills  shortage in the EU and, secondly, the skills available  are not being used in the most effective and efficient  manner possible. A 2017 estimate suggested that  Europe will have 350,000 more cybersecurity jobs than it  has skilled workers in this area by 2022.53  A number of options exist to contribute to the  development of cybersecurity skills, including the  development of awareness raising campaigns, support  to lifelong learning and training initiatives, as well as  51 Statista, “Percentage of startups founded from a university, or  university project spin-off in selected European countries as of 2016”,  2016.

Additionally, the development of a core cybersecurity  curriculum for professionals in both the public and  private sector should be considered.  ENISA could cooperate with the  proposed European  Cybersecurity Competence Centre and Network on  this topic. The efforts in the area of cyber skills should  be based on a long-term strategy that tackles the  cybersecurity skills needs across the EU.  53 Atlas, “Alma mater of unicorn founders”, 2017.

CONCLUSIONS AND  RECOMMENDATIONS 5.1 CONCLUSIONS  Digital development policy should work for and not  against the European market. While a progressive  scenario would see the adoption of a positive and  collaborative policy that builds on the complementary  strengths of various global players, the present reality  requires a more pragmatic approach.  Success requires risk. New business and regulatory  models need to be produced that anticipate the  evolution of the market over the next 5 to 10 years and  lay the groundwork for the success of the European ICT  industry. Government needs to act as a stimulus and not  an inhibitor to this progress.  In an increasingly inter-connected world, the European  ICT sector should be strengthened and stimulated to  improve its competitiveness in the global marketplace,  as well as in the domestic marketplace. A number of  recommendations can contribute to this goal:  1.  The EU should revisit its ICT industrial policy by  recognising it as strategic, while also supporting its ICT  sector.  2.  Building on the Airbus success story, competition law  should be interpreted flexibly and in a manner that  supports and incentivises the European ICT industry;  3.  The EU and Member States should reduce regulatory  barriers and administrative burdens for EU ICT  businesses;  4.  European IP needs to be protected. The EU and  Member States should consider identifying European  IP developed with public funds as strategic and  subjecting it to pre-export regulatory approval;  5.  Public procurement in the Member States should be  used to stimulate the EU ICT industry;  6.  The EU needs a long-term strategy for building and  maintaining a cyber-skilled Europe;  7.  The EU should embrace and encourage a more risk- based entrepreneurial culture. Venture capital should  be more readily accessible to European ICT businesses  with strong growth potential.  5.2 QUESTIONS FOR CONSULTATION  1.

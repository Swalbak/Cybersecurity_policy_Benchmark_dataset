INTRODUCTION  The ENISA study on \"Good Practices for Security of IoT in the context of Smart  Manufacturing\"1 focuses on addressing the security and privacy challenges related to the  evolution of industrial systems and services precipitated by the introduction of IoT innovations.  The main objectives are to collect good practices to ensure security of IoT in the context  of Industry 4.0/Smart Manufacturing, while mapping the relevant security and privacy  challenges, threats, risks and attack scenarios.  Building on this work, this document provides the results of a gap analysis conducted in  order to identify main challenges to the adoption of the security measures and security of  Industry 4.0 and Industrial IoT. Moreover, ENISA lists high-level recommendations to different  stakeholder groups in order to promote Industry 4.0 cybersecurity and facilitate wider take-up  of relevant innovations in a secure manner.  The adoption of the high-level recommendations proposed by ENISA aims at contributing  to the enhancement of Industry 4.0 cybersecurity across the European Union and at laying  the foundations of the relevant forthcoming work, as well as at serving as a basis for future  developments.  In this short paper, ENISA follows a holistic and comprehensive approach to the issues  related to cybersecurity in Industry 4.0, whereby challenges and recommendations are  associated with one of the following categories: People, Processes, and Technologies. This  ensures consistency with the relevant ENISA study1. Additionally, recommendations are also  categorised in terms the target audience groups to which they are addressed (the icons for  the 5 stakeholder groups identified below may be used as a guidance, i.e. the presence of an  icon next to a recommendation indicates that a particular set of recommendations is aimed at  the corresponding stakeholder group).  1 See ENISA study on \"Good Practices for Security of IoT in the context of Smart Manufacturing\": https://www.enisa. europa.eu/publications/good-practices-for-security-of-iot, November 2018  This document  provides the  results of  a gap analysis  conducted in  order to identify  main challenges  to the adoption  of the security  measures and  security of  Industry 4.0 and  Industrial IoT.

PEOPLE  CHALLENGE: NEED TO FOSTER AND ALIGN IT/OT SECURITY  EXPERTISE AND AWARENESS  Lack of sufficient information security expertise and awareness is a major barrier that hinders  the adoption of Industry 4.0 security measures. People involved in deployments of new  solutions usually have only knowledge of either IT or OT security, while Industry 4.0 and  Smart Manufacturing require expertise over several areas, e.g. network security, embedded  systems, OT and IT security to name a few. It is becoming increasingly difficult to find qualified  specialists who are well aware of security issues.  The emergence of Industry 4.0 introduces new technologies into traditional OT environments  and thus people familiar with OT that work in such environments need to adapt. These people  have knowledge on how to operate such environments for years and are nowadays faced with  adapting the way they work and embrace new Industry 4.0 capabilities. Being unfamiliar with  such technologies, employees lack new competences that are essential for secure utilization  of Industry 4.0 solutions within the Smart Manufacturing systems. Such new competences  would include, among others:  operational security knowledge and skills required to monitor, prevent, and detect  anomalies due to security violations;  security aspects of new protocols used by Industry 4.0 solutions;  skills to utilize security functionalities of the components and services (which may seem  overly complicated to users if not adequately explained);  methods of secure integration with legacy systems;  information systems security over complex supply chains.  Moreover, large manufacturing companies often are lagging in training employees who work  with OT equipment and instead employ security solutions for Industry 4.0 systems without first  ensuring take-up by employees. In addition, nowadays there are a limited number of state-of- the-art cybersecurity trainings dedicated to IT/OT convergence and Industry 4.0 systems and  in any case, such trainings in most cases do not cover all essential aspects of these areas,  are often very expensive and not always tailored to specific industry needs.  RECOMMENDATION: PROMOTE CROSS-FUNCTIONAL  KNOWLEDGE ON IT AND OT SECURITY  Raising awareness on basic industrial control security as well as on the secure way for  transitioning to Industry 4.0 and Smart manufacturing is of paramount importance. To address  the lack of IoT and Industry 4.0 security talent, it is essential is to cultivate such knowledge  both within and across organisational boundaries. Persons in charge of security within  Industry 4.0 organizations should invest in state-of-the-art dedicated cybersecurity trainings  that cover all necessary aspects specific to IT/OT convergence and Smart manufacturing.  Lastly, trainings and courses at schools and universities (considering localisation to reach a  wider audience) will further promote a better understanding of Industry 4.0 security among  younger generations and thus in the long-term will contribute to raising awareness.  The emergence  of Industry 4.0  introduces new  technologies  into traditional  OT environments  and thus people  familiar with OT  that work in such  environments  need to adapt.  4  INDUSTRY 4.0 CYBERSECURITY: CHALLENGES & RECOMMENDATIONS May 2019  To promote cross-functional knowledge on IT and OT security, ENISA recommends:  Encourage cross-functional security and safety knowledge exchange between IT and OT  experts respectively.  Launch security education and training in industries transitioning to Industry 4.0, including  knowledge of state-of-the-art, best practices, methodologies and tools for secure  convergence of IT and OT systems.  Establish tailor made training courses focused on Industry 4.0 security to increase  effectiveness of the training and assist OT and IT security experts to address relevant  cybersecurity issues more efficiently.  Develop competency profiles to provide IoT and Industry 4.0 specific awareness and  education training for all staff.  Introduce programs at schools and universities to address the lack of security and safety  knowledge across the industry and to empower the next generation of IT and OT security  experts.  Organise cyber-culture and cyber-hygiene induction courses for OT personnel and  conversely safety-culture and safety-hygiene courses for IT personnel, also involving all  staff. Introduce to OT people the notion of security and to IT people the notion of safety,  with special mentions to cases where the two notions may align or not.  CHALLENGE: INCOMPLETE ORGANISATIONAL POLICIES AND  RELUCTANCE TO FUND SECURITY  Industry 4.0 operators, which are at various stages of Industry 4.0 adoption, often do not have  appropriate governance structures in place for secure implementation of new technologies  and secure maintenance of the existing ones. Defined security programs are rarely in place  and in general comprehensive programs that consider security and safety in tandem are  lacking. It is also often noted that security related roles and responsibilities of employees  are not clearly defined and there is minimal planning to consider safety engineers within the  cybersecurity ecosystem. This results in companies’ lack of resilience and vulnerability to  potential security breaches.  This is because to date cybersecurity was traditionally not perceived as a Board-level topic,  since its impact on increasing revenue or optimizing cost remains generally unclear. This  results in the fact that the majority of technological transformations mostly focus on increased  functionality and business value rather than cybersecurity, i.e. hindering the potential negative  impact of associated risks. A typical example of this is the ongoing migration of manufacturing  companies towards Cloud. In general, companies decide to opt for Cloud solutions to  benefit from cost efficiency and ubiquitous access to information. During this migration,  security should be considered as a high priority issue –and accordingly it should play an  equally important role in decision-making as cost efficiency– especially when manufacturing  companies choose public clouds and thus increase the risk of exposing their data and  operations, while at the same time improving their resilience.  Furthermore, it is worth highlighting that ensuring security of a system or solution, both in the  context of Industry 4.0 vendors and operators, requires funding and commitment from top- level management. However, as there is no clearly discernible link to generate profits from  investing in cybersecurity, it is often the case that due consideration to cybersecurity is given  when a security breach directly leads to financial losses.  Striking the proper balance between  the costs and the need for security remains an open challenge.  Industry 4.0  operators,  which are at  various stages  of Industry 4.0  adoption, often  do not have  appropriate  governance  structures in  place for secure  implementation  of new  technologies  and secure  maintenance  of the existing  ones.  5  INDUSTRY 4.0 CYBERSECURITY: CHALLENGES & RECOMMENDATIONS May 2019  RECOMMENDATION: FOSTER ECONOMIC AND  ADMINISTRATIVE INCENTIVES FOR INDUSTRY 4.0 SECURITY  It is clear that lack of security has the potential to significantly affect business continuity.  Industry 4.0 is no exception given the criticality of related operations and the associated  impact on safety as well. In this respect, best practices for business continuity can serve as a  driver for investing in cybersecurity solutions and accordingly for supporting the unobstructed  operation of Industry 4.0 processes.  Investments in cybersecurity should not be driven only by fear of losing money. It is equally  if not more important, for industries and organisations to not look at cybersecurity only as a  cost, but to also start seeing it as an important business opportunity. Cybersecurity can be  an important competitive advantage for businesses, since it leads to having secure, reliable  and trustworthy products and services. Accordingly, cybersecurity is an enabler of business  opportunities, not a hindering factor and certainly not another item on a checklist.  Nonetheless, economic and administrative stimuli are also required to incentivize investments  in Industry 4.0 security, given that maturity and mentality of organisations and businesses  needs to grow further when it comes to identifying the role and importance of security.  To foster economic and administrative incentives for Industry 4.0 security, ENISA  recommends:  Establish administrative structures for top-level management to discuss and exchange  views with cybersecurity experts and CISOs.  Launch funding schemes for SMEs and other bodies to support their transition to a secure  Industry 4.0 ecosystem, including financial support for cooperative actions.  Incentivize innovation and R&D activities for securing IT and OT environments,  components and systems.  Ensure a homogeneous and stable legal environment for Industry 4.0 cybersecurity to  allow companies to plan long-term, sustainable business strategies including the aspect of  security.  Consider the development of certification schemes for Industry 4.0 security (taking into  account the inherent particularities when defining the target of evaluation), since they  promote harmonisation of the market, increase consumer trust and open up new business  opportunities.  Promote Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) focused on Industry 4.0 cybersecurity to  benefit from multi-stakeholder dialogues and much needed synergies.  Investments in  cybersecurity  should not be  driven only  by fear of  losing money.  It is equally  if not more  important, for  industries and  organisations  to not look at  cybersecurity  only as a cost,  but to also start  seeing it as  an important  business  opportunity.  6  INDUSTRY 4.0 CYBERSECURITY: CHALLENGES & RECOMMENDATIONS May 2019  3. PROCESSES  CHALLENGE: LIABILITY OVER INDUSTRY 4.0 PRODUCTS’  LIFECYCLE  IS POORLY DEFINED  Liability for Industry 4.0 cybersecurity is an open issue (a gap also identified for most of  emerging technologies) as accountability for Industry 4.0 cybersecurity incidents remains  unclear. There is a large number of stakeholders involved in the supply chain and in the use  lifecycle of Industry 4.0, therefore apportioning liability in the aftermath of a security incident  becomes challenging as currently, only general provisions of liability are applicable.  The major difficulty in finding a clear solution for liability stems for the inherent complexity of  the ecosystem. The majority of Industrial IoT devices are usually built from a large number  of components manufactured by multiple vendors, in disperse locations (possibly subject  to different administrative and legal constraints) and including vendors of the software  embedded in the devices. The complexity of the supply chain further exacerbates relevant  concerns. Apportioning liability thus remains an open challenge.  In the context of cybersecurity, an Industry 4.0 device manufacturer is broadly expected  to implement functionalities in its product that would enable a proper level of security. In  a similar fashion, the role of Industry 4.0 operators would see them using these available  security features and perform all security upgrades provided by the manufacturer. In reality,  the situation is more complicated. The long lifespan of Industry 4.0 solutions (especially  in comparison to IT systems) and the financial commitments related to their long-term  maintenance (e.g. software patching), both aggravate the requirements on manufactures,  users and operators of such solutions. Shared ownership of connected, Industry 4.0 solutions,  unclear or unspecified role assignments and lack of provisions in procurement contracts and  service level agreements further complicate the issue of liability.  RECOMMENDATION: CLARIFY LIABILITY AMONG  INDUSTRY 4.0 ACTORS  The Industry 4.0 paradigm introduces emerging technologies and services in manufacturing  and the industrial ecosystem in general. Given the cyber-physical nature of this paradigm,  security and safety are tightly intertwined. Therefore, it is of particular importance to address  liability concerns not only to protect end-users and consumers of such products and services,  but also to stimulate corresponding investments through a comprehensive and stable legal  framework. The European Commission has recently published a Staff Working Document  that sets the scene for liability issues in emerging technologies such as IoT and Artificial  Intelligence2. This will serve as a reference point for forthcoming work.  The question of where liability may fall lies between the different and diverse stakeholders  of the Industry 4.0 supply chain, such as developers, manufacturers, providers, vendors,  aftermarket support operators, third party providers and the end users, to name a few.  2 See EC Staff Working Document on “Liability for emerging digital technologies”: http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/ document.cfm?doc_id=51633, April 2018  The major  difficulty in  finding a clear  solution for  liability stems  for the inherent  complexity of the  ecosystem.  7  INDUSTRY 4.0 CYBERSECURITY: CHALLENGES & RECOMMENDATIONS May 2019  To clarify liability among Industry 4.0 actors, ENISA recommends:  Address liability issues in the context of European and national legislation and case law,  especially where gaps in existing legislation are identified.  Adjust procurement language to clarify liability among stakeholders in supply chains,  e.g. specify Industry 4.0 cybersecurity requirements as part of SLAs (Service Level  Agreements) and contracts during procurement.  Assess the potential of cyber-insurance policies to transfer residual cyber risk and reduce  the impact of cybersecurity incidents, for which an entity might be held liable.  Raise awareness of end users and consumers on their rights concerning liability  legislation.  Specify in a clear manner the legal obligations of Industry 4.0 operators when it comes to  liability.  CHALLENGE: FRAGMENTATION OF INDUSTRY 4.0 SECURITY  TECHNICAL STANDARDS  The current landscape of standards and policy initiatives related to IoT and Industry 4.0  cybersecurity is quite large, covering security aspects at both a horizontal and vertical  (application specific deployments, e.g. automotive, health, and consumer) manner. In the  context of IoT, many high-level reference documents have been published, as well as  baselines, good practices, checklists and general guidance3. Concerning connected industrial  systems and manufacturing systems in particular, there are also useful sources that may  serve as guidelines for relevant stakeholders4.  However, when it comes to Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing the situation is slightly  different. Given the nascent nature of these areas, comprehensive initiatives to address  security in a holistic manner are lagging behind. Nonetheless, it is important to refer to some  notable examples that already exist (such as IEC 624435 or the efforts under IUNO/Industrie  4.06 to name a few). Accordingly, interested parties currently utilize documentation that is only  partially applicable to the broad spectrum of Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing.  The fragmentation of Industry 4.0 security standards and initiatives is of particular importance  for the manufacturing sector. Large manufacturing companies commonly have sites spread  across the world. Accordingly, the lack of uniform standardization efforts at a global level  results in a situation when sites that belong to one organization cannot collaborate and share  security expertise and solutions with each other, as they are subject to different schemes.  Moreover, secure collaboration across companies is also hindered. At the same time, it is  promising that cross-mapping initiatives have started to evolve, e.g. ENISA Baseline Security  Recommendations for IoT7, UK Government Code of Practice for Consumer IoT Security8, NIST  Internal Report 82289. Whereas, such initiatives contribute to increasing homogeneity in the  area of IoT security, further work to expand them in the Industry 4.0 ecosystem is desirable10.  3 ENISA online tool for IoT and Smart Infrastructures Security maintains a continuously updated list of relevant efforts  mapped against the ENISA IoT Security Baseline: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/iot-tool 4 See Annex C of ENISA study on \"Good Practices for Security of IoT in the context of Smart Manufacturing\": https:// www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practices-for-security-of-iot 5 See IEC 62443 family of standards at:  https://www.iec.ch/index.htm 6 See IUNO project homepage at: https://iuno-projekt.de/ 7 See ENISA “Baseline IoT Security Recommendations” study at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/baseline- security-recommendations-for-iot, October 2017 8 See Code of Practice for Consumer IoT Security at: https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/secure-by-design 9 See NIST Internal Report 8228 (Draft) Considerations for Managing Internet of Things (IoT) Cybersecurity and  Privacy Risks at: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2018/NIST.IR.8228-draft.pdf 10 See Annex B of ENISA study on \"Good Practices for Security of IoT in the context of Smart Manufacturing\" for a  relevant effort: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practices-for-security-of-iot  The  fragmentation  of Industry  4.0 security  standards and  initiatives is  of particular  importance  for the  manufacturing  sector. Large  manufacturing  companies  commonly have  sites spread  across the world.  8  INDUSTRY 4.0 CYBERSECURITY: CHALLENGES & RECOMMENDATIONS May 2019  Moreover, there is a need for systematic recipes for implementing the recommendations  proposed in Industry 4.0 security standards and guidelines. Current lack of pragmatic ways to  achieve this objective is leading to significant diversities of systems and services security in  the manufacturing sector.  RECOMMENDATION: HARMONIZE EFFORTS ON INDUSTRY 4.0  SECURITY STANDARDS  To address the fragmentation of current technical standards for Industry 4.0 cybersecurity, it  is necessary to harmonize relevant efforts wherever there are significant gaps and overlaps.  One option towards this direction involves the introduction of baseline standards dedicated  to Industry 4.0 security. Along these lines, it is encouraging that such efforts have recently  emerged in the context of IoT11.  Alternatively, it is beneficial to explore initiatives and guidelines that map security standards  from many different sources to provide a complete point of reference and thus ensure all  necessary security controls are considered. At any rate, standardization activities should be  based on the input of the different actors of the Industry 4.0 ecosystem to ensure fair and  comprehensive representation of relevant requirements and eventually wider adoption.  To harmonize efforts on Industry 4.0 security standards, ENISA recommends:  Launch standardization activities addressing the entire spectrum of Industry 4.0 security.  Conduct analyses on current standards for Industry 4.0 security to examine potential gaps,  i.e. whether existing standards adequately address Industry 4.0 security requirements12.  Promote multi-stakeholder dialogues between Industry 4.0 actors to ensure consensus in  the development of relevant technical standards.  Develop and maintain mapping schemes between standardization activities (such as  the ones by ENISA2, NIST8, UK DCMS7) to explore cross-standard commonalities and  synergies.  CHALLENGE: SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT COMPLEXITY  Supply chain management in the manufacturing sector is a well-known challenge  acknowledged by the majority of involved actors and stakeholders. Although the supply  chain characteristics depend on the company (for example, a large corporation may be able  to control a significant part of the supply chain as it manufacturers its own components),  typically companies rely on others to take over part of this work. Recently, the situation  has become even more complicated as Smart Manufacturing introduced new capabilities  (End-to-End visibility, predictive analysis, automation and data-driven decision-making) that  have an additional impact on the supply chain. Accordingly, supply chains have become  more dynamic, flexible, interdependent and demanding in terms of performance. However,  increased inter-dependence of supply chains results in broader impact caused by existing  security risks and introduction of new ones.  Scalability is one of the most significant concerns, as a large number of people, organizations  and processes are involved. In such cases, companies need to make numerous decisions  (e.g. select vendors, agree on methods of collaboration, establish organizational processes),  11 See ETSI TS 103 645 “Cyber Security for Consumer Internet of Things”: https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103600_1 03699/103645/01.01.01_60/ts_103645v010101p.pdf, February 2019 12 See relevant ENISA study on “IoT Security Standards Gap Analysis”: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/iot- security-standards-gap-analysis, January 2019  Supply chain  management  in the  manufacturing  sector is a well- known challenge  acknowledged  by the majority  of involved  actors and  stakeholders.  9  INDUSTRY 4.0 CYBERSECURITY: CHALLENGES & RECOMMENDATIONS May 2019  on which the security of the final product will depend. Having an effective control over the  supply chain is essential, as not being able to track every component to its source further  erodes confidence in a product’s security. The notion of trustworthiness is also noteworthy,  since companies need to delineate the amount of trust they place on their partners as well as  to manage any residual risks.  The plethora of supply chain actors, who may be subject to different national legislative  frameworks, also means that security incidents may occur at various tiers and stages. Such  incidents may be related to the exchange of goods, services or information and consequently  may result in a propagation of errors and risks across the whole supply chain13. Detecting the  source of a problem becomes extremely challenging and possible cascade effects could be  very hard to predict. At any rate, it is evident that a security breach at any point of the supply  chain would have a negative impact on the final product’s security.  The complexity of the supply chain exacerbates the utilization of security standards and  solutions that are applicable across the different actors involved. Therefore, it is often that  diverse requirements apply to different actors and processes making this an even more  cumbersome issue.  RECOMMENDATION: SECURE SUPPLY CHAIN  MANAGEMENT PROCESSES  Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. When we talk about IoT and Industry 4.0, with  complex supply chains and several actors involved, this becomes an even more pressing  reality. In securing Industry 4.0, collaboration is everything. There are many players, many  interdependencies, and many facets. Trust is the root of a secure supply chain, since the  amount of trust that an organisation places on another that will eventually feed into the risk  assessment process and the introduction of appropriate security controls.  Addressing the complexity and the risks involved in large supply chains is  a matter of  identifying how much trust one can afford to place, and what residual risks it can accept in  order to define appropriate levels of security.  Another important consideration involves holistic management of security across the supply chain.  Securing the interaction between two entities is not adequate, when such an interaction is only  part of a longer supply chain. End-to-end security is a prerequisite for Industry 4.0 to succeed.  To fully understand and secure supply chain management processes, ENISA recommends:  Conduct risk assessment at periodic intervals to identify potential Industry 4.0 supply chain  risks.  Define amount of trust placed on each supplier and review this definition at periodic  intervals, also considering cyber threat intelligence to monitor ongoing and emerging  threat landscape.  Rely on suppliers whose products comply with recognised security standards and  certification schemes.  Apply trust models instead of concrete technical security controls (e.g. certificates).  Ensure security of digital supply chain by following secure software development lifecycle  for Industry 4.0 products and services.  13 See ENISA Infonote on Supply Chain Attacks: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/info-notes/supply-chain- attacks, August 2017  Supply chain  management  in the  manufacturing  sector is a well- known challenge  acknowledged  by the majority  of involved  actors and  stakeholders.  10  INDUSTRY 4.0 CYBERSECURITY: CHALLENGES & RECOMMENDATIONS May 2019  4. TECHNOLOGY  CHALLENGE: INTEROPERABILITY OF INDUSTRY 4.0 DEVICES,  PLATFORMS AND FRAMEWORKS  With the introduction and integration of Industry 4.0 devices, platforms and frameworks to  existing systems comes the issue of interoperability. In industrial environments, securing  interconnectivity between diverse devices is often challenging, especially when considering  devices that are long out of support. It is thus essential to promote secure solutions for  ensuring smooth integration of Industry 4.0 devices with legacy systems and among each  other, e.g. gateways to ensure transparent communication in the case of different networking  or other protocols.  Additionally, lack of interoperability relates to dedicated, proprietary protocols that are in  use by Industry 4.0 devices. In case of utilization of devices and platforms from different  vendors, ensuring interoperability may not always be possible. Ensuring interoperability  between devices / platforms is not only about seamless operation, but also about security. It is  therefore essential to address the problem of proprietary protocols that are not always secure  and adopt common frameworks in order to improve functionality and security of Industry 4.0  solutions.  Lastly, the notion of interoperability does not only refer to communication protocols and  different application frameworks. In the complex supply chains of Industry 4.0, the notion of  security interoperability emerges, meaning that it is very challenging to ensure a common,  baseline of security across platforms, devices, protocols and frameworks. The weakest link  of the chain can have detrimental effects on the entire chain, therefore ensuring a unifying  common cybersecurity layer across all these elements is a very challenging issue.  RECOMMENDATION: ESTABLISH INDUSTRY 4.0  BASELINES FOR SECURITY INTEROPERABILITY  The challenge of security interoperability is pertinent to the Industry 4.0 ecosystem  especially considering integration with legacy systems. Most of the interoperability and  security challenges derive from the interconnection of devices (both critical and non-critical  manufacturing components) from different manufacturers and different communication  protocols. Ensuring and fostering interoperability of Industry 4.0 devices, platforms and  frameworks, as well as security practices is therefore essential.  To establish Industry 4.0 baselines for security interoperability, ENISA recommends:  Encourage the use of interoperability frameworks14 that promote a common security  language and use of protocols for Industry 4.0 components.  Identify specific security levels between cooperation partners and companies across  the supply chain to cover all three cybersecurity facets, namely people, processes and  technologies.  Promote open and accessible interoperability laboratories and testbeds for security.  14 Notable examples in this direction involve the NIST Cyber Security Framework and IEC 62541 (OPC UA).  With the  introduction  and integration  of Industry  4.0 devices,  platforms and  frameworks  to existing  systems comes  the issue of  interoperability.  11  INDUSTRY 4.0 CYBERSECURITY: CHALLENGES & RECOMMENDATIONS May 2019  CHALLENGE: TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS HAMPERING  SECURITY IN INDUSTRY 4.0 AND SMART MANUFACTURING  Difficulties in ensuring security in Industry 4.0 result also from lack of technical capabilities  of connected industrial devices and systems, especially considering integration with legacy  infrastructures. Constraints in embedded systems brings about a major challenge, especially  when referring to low end ICSs and PLCs, as they face many issues with a direct impact on  their security. Indicatively one can consider the following limitations:  Limited processing capabilities and the need to ensure long time of operation while  maintaining a suitable size and competitive price of the device considerably affects  implementation of comprehensive security features in the design phase.  No consideration for fundamental protection mechanisms when designing Industry 4.0  devices adversely influences their security. Patching and software updates over-the-air  are in most cases not feasible solutions when it comes to low-end devices, as they do not  support such functionality.  Lack of more advanced security measures such as encryption or authentication for  example, lower the protection level of devices that are closest to the industrial process.  A quite common approach of only securing the network is insufficient, e.g. if an attacker  breaks into the network, the devices are vulnerable to attacks.  Finally, while considering gaps related to limited technical capabilities, it is worth mentioning  the fact that dedicated cybersecurity tools for Industry 4.0 systems are generally too few or  too expensive. Tools for network monitoring, automatic asset discovery, and configuration  and change management at the OT environment have increased the security level of such  systems and have raised their availability. Such tools however are not yet fully prepared for  handling new Industry 4.0 devices, thus creating a gap in terms of security. Addressing such  challenging issues by developing security solutions adapted for the Industry 4.0 world is  needed.  RECOMMENDATION: APPLY TECHNICAL MEASURES TO  ENSURE INDUSTRY 4.0 SECURITY  Given the complexity and scalability of the ecosystem, there is no one size fits all solution  for IoT and Industry 4.0 security. It is a matter of combining solutions and ensuring that  these solutions cater for flexibility and extensibility without sacrificing security, also taking  into account the factor of usability. The notion of flexibility in this context also refers to the  economics of cybersecurity, namely that adopted solutions should come as a result of a  systemic cost-benefit analysis, where evidently the benefit is that of secure and reliable  products and services.  Identifying baseline security recommendations for Industry 4.0 components, services and  processes based on risk analysis is a first step to approach a solution to the challenging  technical constraints of this domain. ENISA has published relevant guidelines from ENISA  both horizontally for the IoT ecosystem6, but also in the vertical sector of Industry 4.01.  Difficulties  in ensuring  security in  Industry 4.0  result also from  lack of technical  capabilities  of connected  industrial  devices and  systems,  especially  considering  integration  with legacy  infrastructures.  12  INDUSTRY 4.0 CYBERSECURITY: CHALLENGES & RECOMMENDATIONS May 2019  In terms of applying technical measures to ensure Industry 4.0 security, ENISA recommends:  Define a security architecture for Industry 4.0 taking into account a methodological risk  assessment.  Apply principles of security-by-design and privacy-by-design and by-default for all Industry  4.0 components, devices, services, protocols, communications and processes.  Assess the maturity of implemented cybersecurity solutions periodically, also considering  cyber threat intelligence to monitor ongoing and emerging threat landscape.  Monitor the cybersecurity posture of industries concerning Industry 4.0 deployments, also  catering for legacy systems and infrastructures.  Enable continuous updatability & upgradability of Industry 4.0 components and services  throughout their lifecycle, with failsafe and effective operation as guiding principle.  Keep track of developments in cybersecurity standards and best practices for Industry 4.0  cybersecurity and ensure proper implementation of relevant security measures subject to  risk assessment also considering removing unnecessary functionality.

INTRODUCTION  The ENISA study on \"Good Practices for Security of IoT in the context of Smart  Manufacturing\"1 focuses on addressing the security and privacy challenges related to the  evolution of industrial systems and services precipitated by the introduction of IoT innovations.  The main objectives are to collect good practices to ensure security of IoT in the context  of Industry 4.0/Smart Manufacturing, while mapping the relevant security and privacy  challenges, threats, risks and attack scenarios.  Building on this work, this document provides the results of a gap analysis conducted in  order to identify main challenges to the adoption of the security measures and security of  Industry 4.0 and Industrial IoT. Moreover, ENISA lists high-level recommendations to different  stakeholder groups in order to promote Industry 4.0 cybersecurity and facilitate wider take-up  of relevant innovations in a secure manner.  The adoption of the high-level recommendations proposed by ENISA aims at contributing  to the enhancement of Industry 4.0 cybersecurity across the European Union and at laying  the foundations of the relevant forthcoming work, as well as at serving as a basis for future  developments.  In this short paper, ENISA follows a holistic and comprehensive approach to the issues  related to cybersecurity in Industry 4.0, whereby challenges and recommendations are  associated with one of the following categories: People, Processes, and Technologies. This  ensures consistency with the relevant ENISA study1. Additionally, recommendations are also  categorised in terms the target audience groups to which they are addressed (the icons for  the 5 stakeholder groups identified below may be used as a guidance, i.e. the presence of an  icon next to a recommendation indicates that a particular set of recommendations is aimed at  the corresponding stakeholder group).  1 See ENISA study on \"Good Practices for Security of IoT in the context of Smart Manufacturing\": https://www.enisa. europa.eu/publications/good-practices-for-security-of-iot, November 2018  This document  provides the  results of  a gap analysis  conducted in  order to identify  main challenges  to the adoption  of the security  measures and  security of  Industry 4.0 and  Industrial IoT.

PEOPLE  CHALLENGE: NEED TO FOSTER AND ALIGN IT/OT SECURITY  EXPERTISE AND AWARENESS  Lack of sufficient information security expertise and awareness is a major barrier that hinders  the adoption of Industry 4.0 security measures. People involved in deployments of new  solutions usually have only knowledge of either IT or OT security, while Industry 4.0 and  Smart Manufacturing require expertise over several areas, e.g. network security, embedded  systems, OT and IT security to name a few. It is becoming increasingly difficult to find qualified  specialists who are well aware of security issues.  The emergence of Industry 4.0 introduces new technologies into traditional OT environments  and thus people familiar with OT that work in such environments need to adapt. These people  have knowledge on how to operate such environments for years and are nowadays faced with  adapting the way they work and embrace new Industry 4.0 capabilities. Being unfamiliar with  such technologies, employees lack new competences that are essential for secure utilization  of Industry 4.0 solutions within the Smart Manufacturing systems. Such new competences  would include, among others:  operational security knowledge and skills required to monitor, prevent, and detect  anomalies due to security violations;  security aspects of new protocols used by Industry 4.0 solutions;  skills to utilize security functionalities of the components and services (which may seem  overly complicated to users if not adequately explained);  methods of secure integration with legacy systems;  information systems security over complex supply chains.  Moreover, large manufacturing companies often are lagging in training employees who work  with OT equipment and instead employ security solutions for Industry 4.0 systems without first  ensuring take-up by employees. In addition, nowadays there are a limited number of state-of- the-art cybersecurity trainings dedicated to IT/OT convergence and Industry 4.0 systems and  in any case, such trainings in most cases do not cover all essential aspects of these areas,  are often very expensive and not always tailored to specific industry needs.  RECOMMENDATION: PROMOTE CROSS-FUNCTIONAL  KNOWLEDGE ON IT AND OT SECURITY  Raising awareness on basic industrial control security as well as on the secure way for  transitioning to Industry 4.0 and Smart manufacturing is of paramount importance. To address  the lack of IoT and Industry 4.0 security talent, it is essential is to cultivate such knowledge  both within and across organisational boundaries. Persons in charge of security within  Industry 4.0 organizations should invest in state-of-the-art dedicated cybersecurity trainings  that cover all necessary aspects specific to IT/OT convergence and Smart manufacturing.  Lastly, trainings and courses at schools and universities (considering localisation to reach a  wider audience) will further promote a better understanding of Industry 4.0 security among  younger generations and thus in the long-term will contribute to raising awareness.  The emergence  of Industry 4.0  introduces new  technologies  into traditional  OT environments  and thus people  familiar with OT  that work in such  environments  need to adapt.  4  INDUSTRY 4.0 CYBERSECURITY: CHALLENGES & RECOMMENDATIONS May 2019  To promote cross-functional knowledge on IT and OT security, ENISA recommends:  Encourage cross-functional security and safety knowledge exchange between IT and OT  experts respectively.  Launch security education and training in industries transitioning to Industry 4.0, including  knowledge of state-of-the-art, best practices, methodologies and tools for secure  convergence of IT and OT systems.  Establish tailor made training courses focused on Industry 4.0 security to increase  effectiveness of the training and assist OT and IT security experts to address relevant  cybersecurity issues more efficiently.  Develop competency profiles to provide IoT and Industry 4.0 specific awareness and  education training for all staff.  Introduce programs at schools and universities to address the lack of security and safety  knowledge across the industry and to empower the next generation of IT and OT security  experts.  Organise cyber-culture and cyber-hygiene induction courses for OT personnel and  conversely safety-culture and safety-hygiene courses for IT personnel, also involving all  staff. Introduce to OT people the notion of security and to IT people the notion of safety,  with special mentions to cases where the two notions may align or not.  CHALLENGE: INCOMPLETE ORGANISATIONAL POLICIES AND  RELUCTANCE TO FUND SECURITY  Industry 4.0 operators, which are at various stages of Industry 4.0 adoption, often do not have  appropriate governance structures in place for secure implementation of new technologies  and secure maintenance of the existing ones. Defined security programs are rarely in place  and in general comprehensive programs that consider security and safety in tandem are  lacking. It is also often noted that security related roles and responsibilities of employees  are not clearly defined and there is minimal planning to consider safety engineers within the  cybersecurity ecosystem. This results in companies’ lack of resilience and vulnerability to  potential security breaches.  This is because to date cybersecurity was traditionally not perceived as a Board-level topic,  since its impact on increasing revenue or optimizing cost remains generally unclear. This  results in the fact that the majority of technological transformations mostly focus on increased  functionality and business value rather than cybersecurity, i.e. hindering the potential negative  impact of associated risks. A typical example of this is the ongoing migration of manufacturing  companies towards Cloud. In general, companies decide to opt for Cloud solutions to  benefit from cost efficiency and ubiquitous access to information. During this migration,  security should be considered as a high priority issue –and accordingly it should play an  equally important role in decision-making as cost efficiency– especially when manufacturing  companies choose public clouds and thus increase the risk of exposing their data and  operations, while at the same time improving their resilience.  Furthermore, it is worth highlighting that ensuring security of a system or solution, both in the  context of Industry 4.0 vendors and operators, requires funding and commitment from top- level management. However, as there is no clearly discernible link to generate profits from  investing in cybersecurity, it is often the case that due consideration to cybersecurity is given  when a security breach directly leads to financial losses.  Striking the proper balance between  the costs and the need for security remains an open challenge.  Industry 4.0  operators,  which are at  various stages  of Industry 4.0  adoption, often  do not have  appropriate  governance  structures in  place for secure  implementation  of new  technologies  and secure  maintenance  of the existing  ones.  5  INDUSTRY 4.0 CYBERSECURITY: CHALLENGES & RECOMMENDATIONS May 2019  RECOMMENDATION: FOSTER ECONOMIC AND  ADMINISTRATIVE INCENTIVES FOR INDUSTRY 4.0 SECURITY  It is clear that lack of security has the potential to significantly affect business continuity.  Industry 4.0 is no exception given the criticality of related operations and the associated  impact on safety as well. In this respect, best practices for business continuity can serve as a  driver for investing in cybersecurity solutions and accordingly for supporting the unobstructed  operation of Industry 4.0 processes.  Investments in cybersecurity should not be driven only by fear of losing money. It is equally  if not more important, for industries and organisations to not look at cybersecurity only as a  cost, but to also start seeing it as an important business opportunity. Cybersecurity can be  an important competitive advantage for businesses, since it leads to having secure, reliable  and trustworthy products and services. Accordingly, cybersecurity is an enabler of business  opportunities, not a hindering factor and certainly not another item on a checklist.  Nonetheless, economic and administrative stimuli are also required to incentivize investments  in Industry 4.0 security, given that maturity and mentality of organisations and businesses  needs to grow further when it comes to identifying the role and importance of security.  To foster economic and administrative incentives for Industry 4.0 security, ENISA  recommends:  Establish administrative structures for top-level management to discuss and exchange  views with cybersecurity experts and CISOs.  Launch funding schemes for SMEs and other bodies to support their transition to a secure  Industry 4.0 ecosystem, including financial support for cooperative actions.  Incentivize innovation and R&D activities for securing IT and OT environments,  components and systems.  Ensure a homogeneous and stable legal environment for Industry 4.0 cybersecurity to  allow companies to plan long-term, sustainable business strategies including the aspect of  security.  Consider the development of certification schemes for Industry 4.0 security (taking into  account the inherent particularities when defining the target of evaluation), since they  promote harmonisation of the market, increase consumer trust and open up new business  opportunities.  Promote Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) focused on Industry 4.0 cybersecurity to  benefit from multi-stakeholder dialogues and much needed synergies.  Investments in  cybersecurity  should not be  driven only  by fear of  losing money.  It is equally  if not more  important, for  industries and  organisations  to not look at  cybersecurity  only as a cost,  but to also start  seeing it as  an important  business  opportunity.  6  INDUSTRY 4.0 CYBERSECURITY: CHALLENGES & RECOMMENDATIONS May 2019  3. PROCESSES  CHALLENGE: LIABILITY OVER INDUSTRY 4.0 PRODUCTS’  LIFECYCLE  IS POORLY DEFINED  Liability for Industry 4.0 cybersecurity is an open issue (a gap also identified for most of  emerging technologies) as accountability for Industry 4.0 cybersecurity incidents remains  unclear. There is a large number of stakeholders involved in the supply chain and in the use  lifecycle of Industry 4.0, therefore apportioning liability in the aftermath of a security incident  becomes challenging as currently, only general provisions of liability are applicable.  The major difficulty in finding a clear solution for liability stems for the inherent complexity of  the ecosystem. The majority of Industrial IoT devices are usually built from a large number  of components manufactured by multiple vendors, in disperse locations (possibly subject  to different administrative and legal constraints) and including vendors of the software  embedded in the devices. The complexity of the supply chain further exacerbates relevant  concerns. Apportioning liability thus remains an open challenge.  In the context of cybersecurity, an Industry 4.0 device manufacturer is broadly expected  to implement functionalities in its product that would enable a proper level of security. In  a similar fashion, the role of Industry 4.0 operators would see them using these available  security features and perform all security upgrades provided by the manufacturer. In reality,  the situation is more complicated. The long lifespan of Industry 4.0 solutions (especially  in comparison to IT systems) and the financial commitments related to their long-term  maintenance (e.g. software patching), both aggravate the requirements on manufactures,  users and operators of such solutions. Shared ownership of connected, Industry 4.0 solutions,  unclear or unspecified role assignments and lack of provisions in procurement contracts and  service level agreements further complicate the issue of liability.  RECOMMENDATION: CLARIFY LIABILITY AMONG  INDUSTRY 4.0 ACTORS  The Industry 4.0 paradigm introduces emerging technologies and services in manufacturing  and the industrial ecosystem in general. Given the cyber-physical nature of this paradigm,  security and safety are tightly intertwined. Therefore, it is of particular importance to address  liability concerns not only to protect end-users and consumers of such products and services,  but also to stimulate corresponding investments through a comprehensive and stable legal  framework. The European Commission has recently published a Staff Working Document  that sets the scene for liability issues in emerging technologies such as IoT and Artificial  Intelligence2. This will serve as a reference point for forthcoming work.  The question of where liability may fall lies between the different and diverse stakeholders  of the Industry 4.0 supply chain, such as developers, manufacturers, providers, vendors,  aftermarket support operators, third party providers and the end users, to name a few.  2 See EC Staff Working Document on “Liability for emerging digital technologies”: http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/ document.cfm?doc_id=51633, April 2018  The major  difficulty in  finding a clear  solution for  liability stems  for the inherent  complexity of the  ecosystem.  7  INDUSTRY 4.0 CYBERSECURITY: CHALLENGES & RECOMMENDATIONS May 2019  To clarify liability among Industry 4.0 actors, ENISA recommends:  Address liability issues in the context of European and national legislation and case law,  especially where gaps in existing legislation are identified.  Adjust procurement language to clarify liability among stakeholders in supply chains,  e.g. specify Industry 4.0 cybersecurity requirements as part of SLAs (Service Level  Agreements) and contracts during procurement.  Assess the potential of cyber-insurance policies to transfer residual cyber risk and reduce  the impact of cybersecurity incidents, for which an entity might be held liable.  Raise awareness of end users and consumers on their rights concerning liability  legislation.  Specify in a clear manner the legal obligations of Industry 4.0 operators when it comes to  liability.  CHALLENGE: FRAGMENTATION OF INDUSTRY 4.0 SECURITY  TECHNICAL STANDARDS  The current landscape of standards and policy initiatives related to IoT and Industry 4.0  cybersecurity is quite large, covering security aspects at both a horizontal and vertical  (application specific deployments, e.g. automotive, health, and consumer) manner. In the  context of IoT, many high-level reference documents have been published, as well as  baselines, good practices, checklists and general guidance3. Concerning connected industrial  systems and manufacturing systems in particular, there are also useful sources that may  serve as guidelines for relevant stakeholders4.  However, when it comes to Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing the situation is slightly  different. Given the nascent nature of these areas, comprehensive initiatives to address  security in a holistic manner are lagging behind. Nonetheless, it is important to refer to some  notable examples that already exist (such as IEC 624435 or the efforts under IUNO/Industrie  4.06 to name a few). Accordingly, interested parties currently utilize documentation that is only  partially applicable to the broad spectrum of Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing.  The fragmentation of Industry 4.0 security standards and initiatives is of particular importance  for the manufacturing sector. Large manufacturing companies commonly have sites spread  across the world. Accordingly, the lack of uniform standardization efforts at a global level  results in a situation when sites that belong to one organization cannot collaborate and share  security expertise and solutions with each other, as they are subject to different schemes.  Moreover, secure collaboration across companies is also hindered. At the same time, it is  promising that cross-mapping initiatives have started to evolve, e.g. ENISA Baseline Security  Recommendations for IoT7, UK Government Code of Practice for Consumer IoT Security8, NIST  Internal Report 82289. Whereas, such initiatives contribute to increasing homogeneity in the  area of IoT security, further work to expand them in the Industry 4.0 ecosystem is desirable10.  3 ENISA online tool for IoT and Smart Infrastructures Security maintains a continuously updated list of relevant efforts  mapped against the ENISA IoT Security Baseline: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/iot-tool 4 See Annex C of ENISA study on \"Good Practices for Security of IoT in the context of Smart Manufacturing\": https:// www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practices-for-security-of-iot 5 See IEC 62443 family of standards at:  https://www.iec.ch/index.htm 6 See IUNO project homepage at: https://iuno-projekt.de/ 7 See ENISA “Baseline IoT Security Recommendations” study at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/baseline- security-recommendations-for-iot, October 2017 8 See Code of Practice for Consumer IoT Security at: https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/secure-by-design 9 See NIST Internal Report 8228 (Draft) Considerations for Managing Internet of Things (IoT) Cybersecurity and  Privacy Risks at: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2018/NIST.IR.8228-draft.pdf 10 See Annex B of ENISA study on \"Good Practices for Security of IoT in the context of Smart Manufacturing\" for a  relevant effort: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practices-for-security-of-iot  The  fragmentation  of Industry  4.0 security  standards and  initiatives is  of particular  importance  for the  manufacturing  sector. Large  manufacturing  companies  commonly have  sites spread  across the world.  8  INDUSTRY 4.0 CYBERSECURITY: CHALLENGES & RECOMMENDATIONS May 2019  Moreover, there is a need for systematic recipes for implementing the recommendations  proposed in Industry 4.0 security standards and guidelines. Current lack of pragmatic ways to  achieve this objective is leading to significant diversities of systems and services security in  the manufacturing sector.  RECOMMENDATION: HARMONIZE EFFORTS ON INDUSTRY 4.0  SECURITY STANDARDS  To address the fragmentation of current technical standards for Industry 4.0 cybersecurity, it  is necessary to harmonize relevant efforts wherever there are significant gaps and overlaps.  One option towards this direction involves the introduction of baseline standards dedicated  to Industry 4.0 security. Along these lines, it is encouraging that such efforts have recently  emerged in the context of IoT11.  Alternatively, it is beneficial to explore initiatives and guidelines that map security standards  from many different sources to provide a complete point of reference and thus ensure all  necessary security controls are considered. At any rate, standardization activities should be  based on the input of the different actors of the Industry 4.0 ecosystem to ensure fair and  comprehensive representation of relevant requirements and eventually wider adoption.  To harmonize efforts on Industry 4.0 security standards, ENISA recommends:  Launch standardization activities addressing the entire spectrum of Industry 4.0 security.  Conduct analyses on current standards for Industry 4.0 security to examine potential gaps,  i.e. whether existing standards adequately address Industry 4.0 security requirements12.  Promote multi-stakeholder dialogues between Industry 4.0 actors to ensure consensus in  the development of relevant technical standards.  Develop and maintain mapping schemes between standardization activities (such as  the ones by ENISA2, NIST8, UK DCMS7) to explore cross-standard commonalities and  synergies.  CHALLENGE: SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT COMPLEXITY  Supply chain management in the manufacturing sector is a well-known challenge  acknowledged by the majority of involved actors and stakeholders. Although the supply  chain characteristics depend on the company (for example, a large corporation may be able  to control a significant part of the supply chain as it manufacturers its own components),  typically companies rely on others to take over part of this work. Recently, the situation  has become even more complicated as Smart Manufacturing introduced new capabilities  (End-to-End visibility, predictive analysis, automation and data-driven decision-making) that  have an additional impact on the supply chain. Accordingly, supply chains have become  more dynamic, flexible, interdependent and demanding in terms of performance. However,  increased inter-dependence of supply chains results in broader impact caused by existing  security risks and introduction of new ones.  Scalability is one of the most significant concerns, as a large number of people, organizations  and processes are involved. In such cases, companies need to make numerous decisions  (e.g. select vendors, agree on methods of collaboration, establish organizational processes),  11 See ETSI TS 103 645 “Cyber Security for Consumer Internet of Things”: https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103600_1 03699/103645/01.01.01_60/ts_103645v010101p.pdf, February 2019 12 See relevant ENISA study on “IoT Security Standards Gap Analysis”: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/iot- security-standards-gap-analysis, January 2019  Supply chain  management  in the  manufacturing  sector is a well- known challenge  acknowledged  by the majority  of involved  actors and  stakeholders.  9  INDUSTRY 4.0 CYBERSECURITY: CHALLENGES & RECOMMENDATIONS May 2019  on which the security of the final product will depend. Having an effective control over the  supply chain is essential, as not being able to track every component to its source further  erodes confidence in a product’s security. The notion of trustworthiness is also noteworthy,  since companies need to delineate the amount of trust they place on their partners as well as  to manage any residual risks.  The plethora of supply chain actors, who may be subject to different national legislative  frameworks, also means that security incidents may occur at various tiers and stages. Such  incidents may be related to the exchange of goods, services or information and consequently  may result in a propagation of errors and risks across the whole supply chain13. Detecting the  source of a problem becomes extremely challenging and possible cascade effects could be  very hard to predict. At any rate, it is evident that a security breach at any point of the supply  chain would have a negative impact on the final product’s security.  The complexity of the supply chain exacerbates the utilization of security standards and  solutions that are applicable across the different actors involved. Therefore, it is often that  diverse requirements apply to different actors and processes making this an even more  cumbersome issue.  RECOMMENDATION: SECURE SUPPLY CHAIN  MANAGEMENT PROCESSES  Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. When we talk about IoT and Industry 4.0, with  complex supply chains and several actors involved, this becomes an even more pressing  reality. In securing Industry 4.0, collaboration is everything. There are many players, many  interdependencies, and many facets. Trust is the root of a secure supply chain, since the  amount of trust that an organisation places on another that will eventually feed into the risk  assessment process and the introduction of appropriate security controls.  Addressing the complexity and the risks involved in large supply chains is  a matter of  identifying how much trust one can afford to place, and what residual risks it can accept in  order to define appropriate levels of security.  Another important consideration involves holistic management of security across the supply chain.  Securing the interaction between two entities is not adequate, when such an interaction is only  part of a longer supply chain. End-to-end security is a prerequisite for Industry 4.0 to succeed.  To fully understand and secure supply chain management processes, ENISA recommends:  Conduct risk assessment at periodic intervals to identify potential Industry 4.0 supply chain  risks.  Define amount of trust placed on each supplier and review this definition at periodic  intervals, also considering cyber threat intelligence to monitor ongoing and emerging  threat landscape.  Rely on suppliers whose products comply with recognised security standards and  certification schemes.  Apply trust models instead of concrete technical security controls (e.g. certificates).  Ensure security of digital supply chain by following secure software development lifecycle  for Industry 4.0 products and services.  13 See ENISA Infonote on Supply Chain Attacks: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/info-notes/supply-chain- attacks, August 2017  Supply chain  management  in the  manufacturing  sector is a well- known challenge  acknowledged  by the majority  of involved  actors and  stakeholders.  10  INDUSTRY 4.0 CYBERSECURITY: CHALLENGES & RECOMMENDATIONS May 2019  4. TECHNOLOGY  CHALLENGE: INTEROPERABILITY OF INDUSTRY 4.0 DEVICES,  PLATFORMS AND FRAMEWORKS  With the introduction and integration of Industry 4.0 devices, platforms and frameworks to  existing systems comes the issue of interoperability. In industrial environments, securing  interconnectivity between diverse devices is often challenging, especially when considering  devices that are long out of support. It is thus essential to promote secure solutions for  ensuring smooth integration of Industry 4.0 devices with legacy systems and among each  other, e.g. gateways to ensure transparent communication in the case of different networking  or other protocols.  Additionally, lack of interoperability relates to dedicated, proprietary protocols that are in  use by Industry 4.0 devices. In case of utilization of devices and platforms from different  vendors, ensuring interoperability may not always be possible. Ensuring interoperability  between devices / platforms is not only about seamless operation, but also about security. It is  therefore essential to address the problem of proprietary protocols that are not always secure  and adopt common frameworks in order to improve functionality and security of Industry 4.0  solutions.  Lastly, the notion of interoperability does not only refer to communication protocols and  different application frameworks. In the complex supply chains of Industry 4.0, the notion of  security interoperability emerges, meaning that it is very challenging to ensure a common,  baseline of security across platforms, devices, protocols and frameworks. The weakest link  of the chain can have detrimental effects on the entire chain, therefore ensuring a unifying  common cybersecurity layer across all these elements is a very challenging issue.  RECOMMENDATION: ESTABLISH INDUSTRY 4.0  BASELINES FOR SECURITY INTEROPERABILITY  The challenge of security interoperability is pertinent to the Industry 4.0 ecosystem  especially considering integration with legacy systems. Most of the interoperability and  security challenges derive from the interconnection of devices (both critical and non-critical  manufacturing components) from different manufacturers and different communication  protocols. Ensuring and fostering interoperability of Industry 4.0 devices, platforms and  frameworks, as well as security practices is therefore essential.  To establish Industry 4.0 baselines for security interoperability, ENISA recommends:  Encourage the use of interoperability frameworks14 that promote a common security  language and use of protocols for Industry 4.0 components.  Identify specific security levels between cooperation partners and companies across  the supply chain to cover all three cybersecurity facets, namely people, processes and  technologies.  Promote open and accessible interoperability laboratories and testbeds for security.  14 Notable examples in this direction involve the NIST Cyber Security Framework and IEC 62541 (OPC UA).  With the  introduction  and integration  of Industry  4.0 devices,  platforms and  frameworks  to existing  systems comes  the issue of  interoperability.  11  INDUSTRY 4.0 CYBERSECURITY: CHALLENGES & RECOMMENDATIONS May 2019  CHALLENGE: TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS HAMPERING  SECURITY IN INDUSTRY 4.0 AND SMART MANUFACTURING  Difficulties in ensuring security in Industry 4.0 result also from lack of technical capabilities  of connected industrial devices and systems, especially considering integration with legacy  infrastructures. Constraints in embedded systems brings about a major challenge, especially  when referring to low end ICSs and PLCs, as they face many issues with a direct impact on  their security. Indicatively one can consider the following limitations:  Limited processing capabilities and the need to ensure long time of operation while  maintaining a suitable size and competitive price of the device considerably affects  implementation of comprehensive security features in the design phase.  No consideration for fundamental protection mechanisms when designing Industry 4.0  devices adversely influences their security. Patching and software updates over-the-air  are in most cases not feasible solutions when it comes to low-end devices, as they do not  support such functionality.  Lack of more advanced security measures such as encryption or authentication for  example, lower the protection level of devices that are closest to the industrial process.  A quite common approach of only securing the network is insufficient, e.g. if an attacker  breaks into the network, the devices are vulnerable to attacks.  Finally, while considering gaps related to limited technical capabilities, it is worth mentioning  the fact that dedicated cybersecurity tools for Industry 4.0 systems are generally too few or  too expensive. Tools for network monitoring, automatic asset discovery, and configuration  and change management at the OT environment have increased the security level of such  systems and have raised their availability. Such tools however are not yet fully prepared for  handling new Industry 4.0 devices, thus creating a gap in terms of security. Addressing such  challenging issues by developing security solutions adapted for the Industry 4.0 world is  needed.  RECOMMENDATION: APPLY TECHNICAL MEASURES TO  ENSURE INDUSTRY 4.0 SECURITY  Given the complexity and scalability of the ecosystem, there is no one size fits all solution  for IoT and Industry 4.0 security. It is a matter of combining solutions and ensuring that  these solutions cater for flexibility and extensibility without sacrificing security, also taking  into account the factor of usability. The notion of flexibility in this context also refers to the  economics of cybersecurity, namely that adopted solutions should come as a result of a  systemic cost-benefit analysis, where evidently the benefit is that of secure and reliable  products and services.  Identifying baseline security recommendations for Industry 4.0 components, services and  processes based on risk analysis is a first step to approach a solution to the challenging  technical constraints of this domain. ENISA has published relevant guidelines from ENISA  both horizontally for the IoT ecosystem6, but also in the vertical sector of Industry 4.01.  Difficulties  in ensuring  security in  Industry 4.0  result also from  lack of technical  capabilities  of connected  industrial  devices and  systems,  especially  considering  integration  with legacy  infrastructures.  12  INDUSTRY 4.0 CYBERSECURITY: CHALLENGES & RECOMMENDATIONS May 2019  In terms of applying technical measures to ensure Industry 4.0 security, ENISA recommends:  Define a security architecture for Industry 4.0 taking into account a methodological risk  assessment.  Apply principles of security-by-design and privacy-by-design and by-default for all Industry  4.0 components, devices, services, protocols, communications and processes.  Assess the maturity of implemented cybersecurity solutions periodically, also considering  cyber threat intelligence to monitor ongoing and emerging threat landscape.  Monitor the cybersecurity posture of industries concerning Industry 4.0 deployments, also  catering for legacy systems and infrastructures.

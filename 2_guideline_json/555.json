Eighteen European Union Member States have  published a NCSS and some of these are now into the second iteration of their NCSS.  ENISA’s work in supporting these strategies has focused on the analysis of existing NCSS; on the  development and implementation of NCSS; and on outlining and raising awareness of good practice  to provide guidance and practical tools to the Member States for evaluating their NCSS. Specifically,  ENISA’s 2012 Practical Guide on NCSS noted four important steps: the development, implementation,  evaluation and adjustment of a NCSS.  The current study focuses on the evaluation aspect of the NCSS lifecycle, and has four goals, namely:  1. To perform a stocktaking exercise on the approaches currently used to perform evaluation of  NCSS;  2. To present recommendations and identify good practices on the implementation and  evaluation of NCSS;  3. To design and develop an evaluation framework;  4. To support the framework with a set of useful key performance indicators (KPIs) to adapt to  the varying needs of countries at different levels of maturity in their strategic planning.  To accomplish these goals we analysed 18 existing EU National Cyber Security Strategies and eight  non-EU strategies, conducted 11 key informant interviews and mapped out the components of NCSS.  From reviewing and analysing the evaluation components of the NCSS, it was noted that many  countries do not agree on the outcomes or impacts of their NCSS and on the ways to achieve them.  Within Europe, the approach taken to evaluation differs largely among Member States. While almost  all NCSS included in this study mention some elements of the review process, this was normally at a  very high level and frequently orientated around spending reviews.  The core of this document is the description of an evaluation framework. This evaluation framework  consists of the following elements: a blueprint logic model presenting conceptual building blocks and  a structure and a list of possible key performance indicators (KPIs); This model illustrates the  underlying logic behind recurring components of National Cyber Security Strategies, even though their  own intervention logic may not be made explicit in the individual documents. It also serves as an  illustration of a potential approach towards connecting the elements commonly contained within  national strategies. The key objectives (that should be measured) of a cyber security strategy  evaluation framework, based on the analysis are:   To develop cyber defence policies and capabilities;   To achieve cyber resilience;   To reduce cybercrime;   To support industry on cyber security;   To secure critical information infrastructures.  The suggested KPIs are mapped to the objectives of the evaluation model, making it easier for each  stakeholder to chooce the most useful (and measurable) key indicators according to their priorities.  The report aims to be a flexible, pragmatic tool based on principles rather than prescriptive checklists.  Finally, we point out a number of pitfalls to avoid in the application of this guidance, including those  relating to building capacity, securing budgetary support, achieving transparency and developing a  lessons learned culture.

However,  concerns about the security of this domain are becoming an increasingly pressing and salient issue.  Senior business leaders and government officials placed cyber security risks as having a greater impact  than those from terrorism when questioned by the World Economic Forum in 20131. According to the  European Commission’s projections in the 2010 ‘Digital Agenda for Europe’2  security is a high concern  for 50% of EU citizens in order to engage in e-commerce and e-Government by 2015 and for around a  third of Small to Medium Enterprises to offer online services.  If citizens and business owners lack  confidence in security, it stands to reason that they may avoid participating in online activities, thereby  inhibiting further development opportunities on cyberspace.  To help address this, many European Union Member States have published or are in the process of  publishing an NCSS. Of these, several (e.g., Czech Republic, Estonia, Netherlands and the United  Kingdom) have also updated their strategies since their first edition. National Cyber Security Strategies  aim to ensure that Member States are prepared to face serious risks, are aware of their consequences,  and are equipped to appropriately respond to breaches in the network and information system.  However, it is not always clear if and how the effectiveness of these strategies is evaluated. Evaluation  can be interpreted as a tool to assess if and how well the expected objectives have been achieved and  whether the costs involved were justified, given the changes which have been achieved3.  The European Commission understands that “there are still gaps across the EU, notably in terms of  national capabilities, coordination in cases of incidents spanning across borders, and in terms of  private sector involvement and preparedness”4.  The 2013 EU Cyber Security Strategy (EUCSS) asks  ENISA to “encourage good practice in information and network security” to assist and support  Member States in developing strong national cyber resilience capabilities, notably by building  expertise on security and resilience of industrial control systems, transport and energy infrastructure.  1.1  ENISA’s activities in the area of NCSS  As already mentioned, National Cyber Security Strategies have not yet been established or  implemented in all 28 Member States. Therefore, raising awareness of and promoting good practices  in relation to cyber security among the EU Member States continues to be an important task to do in  supporting national good practices.  In 2012, ENISA introduced the lifecycle of a NCSS in a practical guide on the development and  execution phase of NCSS5. This Practical Guide highlights the fact that the ability to implement and  evaluate the strategy is one of the two important steps governing NCSS (the other being the  development and implementation of the strategy)6.  1 World Economic Forum (2013) Global Risks Report Eighth Edition; p4 Global Risks Landscape 2013 versus 2012; Zurich, Switzerland  available at: http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GlobalRisks_Report_2013.pdf  2 Communication from the Commission of 19 May 2010 to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social  Committee and the Committee of the Regions – A Digital Agenda for Europe [COM(2010) 245 final]  3 Communication of 2 October 2013 on “Strengthening the foundations of Smart Regulation – improving evaluation.” [COM(2013)686]  4 High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.

Therefore, the objectives of this project were:  1. To perform a stocktaking exercise on the approaches currently used to perform evaluation of  NCSS;  2. To present recommendations and identify good practices on the evaluation of NCSS and to  collect them in an evaluation framework;  3. To design a set of capacity building tools for evaluating NCSS that adapt to the varying needs  of countries at different levels of maturity in their strategic planning.  1.3 Methodology  This project used a combination of three empirical techniques: 1) a literature review, 2) a  documentation review of NCSS and 3) logic modelling – “a means to encourage systematic thinking  about a programme” 8  - developed through internal interactions in the study team. Further  information on the methodology can be found in (Annex B: Methodology).  1.4 Target audience  It is envisaged that policy practitioners, experts and government officials responsible for designing,  implementing and evaluating an NCSS will find this report of use. In addition, it will be of value to  cyber security policy experts and other practitioners and researchers at national, European and  international level grappling with challenges of effectively managing cyber-security risks.  1.5 Structure  The remainder of this report is structured in the following way:  Chapter 2 discusses how the practice of evaluation can be applied to NCSS and why it is important to  evaluate these policy instruments.  Chapter 3 presents empirical evidence on where and how evaluation has been included in the NCSS  under analysis. This chapter summarises the landscape in the current practice of NCSS evaluation.  Chapter 4 describes a framework for evaluation of NCSS and elaborates on a roadmap for a NCSS  evaluation by offering practical tips on:  1. The use of the consolidated logic model consistent with the headings of the EUCSS;  2. Possible key performance indicators (which would allow measuring progress against the  objectives set out in the strategy);  Chapter 5 discusses some pitfalls to avoid for in the application of the guidance in Chapter 4.  Chapter 6 concludes the report.  7 ENISA Interactive map on NCSS available at: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies- ncsss/national-cyber-security-strategies-in-the-world  8 Ling T and Villalba Van Dijk, V.

The present guide, and this chapter in particular, look at the  potential benefits of NCSS evaluation. Some of the delegated acts, such as legislation and  implementation acts, which are foreseen by the strategies, may require their own impact assessments  and evaluations for a consistent policy framework.  2.1 Benefits and challenges of NCSS Evaluation  Evaluation offers several benefits to the specific programme and has the potential to improve the  wider policy environment by promoting evidence-based decisions. At the same time, implementing  an evaluation approach and dealing with potentially controversial or unforeseen outcomes can  present challenges. Table 1 below summarises these challenges and benefits based on the literature  identified in our review9.  Benefits  Challenges  a) Evaluation can inform about policy  changes and the framing of issues in the  long term; allow learning from past  experience.  b) Evidence of effectiveness or learning can  support the accountability of political  action.  c) Evidence base can give credibility towards  general public and international partners.  d) Evaluation can support outreach and  enhance public image as transparent  organisation.  e) Having facts on what works can help gain  traction in policy process.  f) Evaluation makes it necessary to compile  data sources on policy and its implications  for long-term planning.  g) Catalyses discussion with stakeholders.  h) Evaluation needs investment of resources.  i) Exposing flaws in policy can undermine  political priorities even when the priorities  themselves are supported.  j) Good practices can be of limited use due  to differences in national evaluation  cultures.  k) Outcomes are often challenging to define  and measure.  l)  Attributing changes to the strategy itself  can be difficult.

An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  8  2.2 Evaluation of cybersecurity strategies  Objectives in NCSS  The objectives of cyber security strategies reflect the differences in national contexts. However, there  are some similarities between the European strategies. Cyber security strategies often have objectives  articulated around the following clusters (Chapter 3), which are also reflected in the objectives of the  European Cybersecurity Strategy10:  - To achieve cyber resilience: develop capabilities and cooperating efficiently within the public  and private sector;  - To secure critical information infrastructures;  - To reduce cybercrime;  - To develop the industrial and technological resources for cybersecurity; and,  - To contribute to the establishment of an international cyberspace policy.  Within the national and international policy environment cyber security strategies have three further  distinct purposes. As strategic documents, they serve to:  - Align the whole of government by defining strategic directions;  - Give a focus and a structure to discussions with stakeholders; and,  - Convey Member State priorities towards international partners11.  Benefits and value of evaluation  Implementing evaluation frameworks can support reaching the objectives of NCSS in a variety of ways.  Below we discuss two examples of this support12.  Informing about policy change and supporting learning in the wider policy environment  One of the most important purposes of evaluation is that of informing affected stakeholders about  policy change. In this case, the results of an evaluation serve to steer policy in subsequent review  cycles. The evaluation shows which actions realised under the NCSS worked and helps policymakers  learn from mistakes13. The feedback on the policy resulting from an evidence-based approach can help  when using the cybersecurity strategies to drive discussion, prioritisation of objectives and funding  decisions14. Evaluation is also an important instrument for gaining traction within the policymaking  process. As such, evaluation results can help prove the legitimacy and credibility of interventions  under the strategy (e.g., the necessity of allocating funds to a specific type of capability-building  programme for fighting cybercrime) and increase the likelihood that CSS and the recommendations  flowing from the evaluation have the appropriate attention in the policymaking process.  Engaging stakeholders  Evaluation processes can serve as a catalyst to engaging stakeholders in a discussion about moving  the policy forward  as well as offering a framework for engaging stakeholders during the  10 High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.

Using evaluation for these purposes in the national context was considered particularly important by two of the  interviewees.

For example, the data collection necessary to support the  evaluation functions supports better overall availability of information on cybersecurity which can  facilitate the provision of information to stakeholders. Similarly, providing data and an objective  overview of the results of the policy can help  focus discussions with stakeholders.  Challenges and limitations to evaluating NCSS  Difficulties in quantifying and measuring results  The nature of these outcomes is not easy to define and measure. Strategies often aim to improve  confidence in doing business in the digital sphere, citizen/consumer trust in activities mediated by  cyberspace. Indicators that would allow policymakers to capture progress towards these outcomes  are often not readily available and can be challenging to construct in a reliable manner16.  Reviews and assessments of NCSS in some countries have taken forms of financial or value-for-money  audits in adherence to legal obligations. The US Government Accountability Office’s GAO’s review of  the US cyber security strategy17 and the UK National Audit Office’s evaluation of the NCSS18 are two  examples of in-depth financial audits. Even in countries where specific financial audits are not  published, government spending for implementing the NCSS is subject to the scrutiny of national audit  bodies. Although these audits offer insights into certain aspects of the implementation, they serve  different purposes than evaluation (that of verifying the correctness of financial statements, and  assessing how economically, effectively and efficiently the funds are spent)19.  From inputs to outcomes  The link between elements of the strategies and the explanation of how they support strategic  outcomes is often difficult to establish without ambiguity. For instance, it is often challenging to assess  what would have been the cyber security situation of the country if no action had been taken or in the  case of different interventions. Similarly, even if the outcomes (e.g., increased trust in technology use  by the population) are realised, it can be difficult to securely attribute them to the specific actions of  the strategy (such as an awareness raising campaign).  Lack of evaluation culture  NCSS display the same diversity of approaches to incorporating evidence from evaluations. Despite  the presence of good practices and implementation guides, implementation of evidence-based  practices also depends on the institutional setup, administrative traditions and the “soft”  characteristics of political systems, such as the national culture and traditions of transparency and  accountability. Therefore, adapting practices to an evidence-based, evaluation-oriented cyber security  policy framework may put considerable pressure on national administrative bodies, in particular in  countries where evaluation practices have not been embedded in the administrative culture20.  Implementing an evaluation culture in the field of cybersecurity also has to take into account the  national contexts. Cyber security and digital policies in particular, form an area where robust and  15 Luijf et al. (2013).  16 Robinson, N. & Horvath, V. (2013).

An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  10  methodologically rigorous evaluations have not yet become the norm, even in countries with a more  established track record in evaluation21. In addition, the configuration of the cyber security landscape  varies greatly between Member States, which in turn reflects to some extent the constitutional setup  of the country. This can for instance be illustrated by the  establishment of computer emergency  response teams (CERTs)  in Europe. CERTs’ presence, number and functions vary greatly between the  Member States, according to a more or less centralised institutional system and assumptions about  the role the new teams are supposed to play in implementing a secure cyberspace.  Evaluation in cyber security policy guidelines  ENISA’s interest in facilitating evaluation and supporting strategic programming for NCSS fits into a  larger picture of encouraging member states and EU institutions to incorporate evidence-based  approaches in their cyber security strategies. In the European Union, these strategies are included in  the “Digital Agenda for Europe” (DAE) and the proposal for a NIS Directive22, which also links the  purpose of the NCSS to the wider objectives of promoting an inclusive and secure digital society aimed  to foster economic growth. Member States monitor the progress of cyber security in compliance with  the relevant actions and submit monitoring reports on an annual basis. Based on these reports the  European Commission (EC) compares the performance of Member States against the areas for action  and objectives set up in the DAE.  The EU Cyber Security Strategy itself stresses the importance of establishing an “evidence-based risk  assessment and management culture” within the cyber security community in the EU and the  involvement of stakeholders in all its areas.  The most specific guidance on evaluation strategies in NCSS comes from ENISA’s good practice guide  on formulating strategies 23 . The strategy lifecycle model is illustrated in 1 below. As the figure  indicates, the evaluation activities refer to both one-off evaluations and on-going/periodical  evaluation.  Figure 1 Lifecycle of a national cybersecurity strategy (Source: ENISA, 2012)  21 Leeuw, F.L., & Leeuw, B. (2012).  22 http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_directive_en.pdf  23  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/national-cyber-security-strategies- an-implementation-guide  http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_directive_en.pdf  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  11  In recent years a number of international organisations emphasised the importance of evaluation in  cyber security policymaking, such as the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) in its  guidelines on implementing cyber security strategies24. The ITU guidance emphasises the importance  of SMART objective-setting, the definition of timelines and the adoption of a review mechanism for  the framework itself. It also offers a long list of suggested KPIs based on international standards and  network and information security indicators or the NATO NCSS framework manual25. In the NATO  guidance document, evaluation is presented as an instrument to progressively incorporate learning  from previous experiences into the policy framework in the light of technological and social change,  without weighing down the systems and processes.  Similarly,  the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) analysis of NCSS  published in the past five years has found that these strategies share a number of characteristics26.  Shared aspects (which could be relevant for evaluation initiatives) include multidisciplinarity, a view  encompassing the entirety of society, and a trend towards sharing fundamental assumptions, such as  those that cyber threats are increasing and that ICTs are essential for social development.  Interestingly, a call for rigorous evaluation processes, risk assessments and data-based planning was  made by stakeholders from the communications industry in the consultation process underpinning  the research for the report27.  24 Wamala, Frederick.

An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  12  3 Mapping cyber security strategies to evaluation objectives  As pointed out in the previous chapter, incorporating evaluation in the design and implementation of  NCSS can offer significant opportunities for realising  the objectives of the strategy. In this chapter, we  will survey the current state of evaluation-related aspects in a series of cyber security strategies in  Europe and beyond. Moreover, we will look at the contextual factors that can influence the way in  which strategies are set up and implemented. This aspect is particularly relevant for the EU due to  differences in the institutional setup and administrative cultures of the Member States; it is not  optimal to aim at identifying a one-size-fits-all approach to good practices in incorporating evaluation  in NCSS. Rather, the evidence-based approaches should be considered according to the particular  context of the country. Therefore, the evaluation framework that the present study is supporting will  adopt a model that is flexible enough to accomodate these differences.  3.1  Overview of the mapping exercise  One of the goals of the present study is to analyse the approaches taken by European cyber security  strategies, with a view towards a NCSS evaluation framework. The first step of the review has been to  identify the elements that can be used as part of an evaluation framework based on logic modelling  and programme theory. These include Objectives (and focal areas of action), Inputs, Activities,  Outputs,Outcomes and Impacts28.  A review of 18 EU strategies included in the exercise has identified and extracted elements that  correspond to each of these categories in the documents. Furthermore, some categories that relate  to the specific purpose of the study in assisting Member States in updating, implementing or drafting  a strategy, have been added. These summarise provisions related to stakeholder involvement and the  review processes.  For the purposes of visual simplification, the maps included do not aim to illustrate the entirety of the  elements included in the strategies, but rather to illustrate the multiplicity of approaches across the  EU. In the remainder of this section we present a short summary of the analysis based on the  mapping29.  The mapping exercise doesn’t aim to compare the countries to a benchmark; rather, to explore the  starting point for Member States in implementing and/or enhancing the evaluation aspects of their  strategies. Where evaluation exists, it is often limited to spending reviews, although some countries  are attempting to approach the effectiveness of expenditure through cost-benefit analysis. From the  results of the mapping presented below it emerges that an internal intervention logic is not  immediately clear from NCSS and it would have to be reconstructed for the evaluation purpose.  Overall, our review has found that most NCSS articulate objectives and outcomes in broad  socioeconomic terms. Action areas, available and projected resources and the processes that need to  be put into place while implementing the strategy are often not clearly defined. Outputs are often  easier to identify in the strategies; however, their relationship to the objectives is often not clearly  28 Summary of the terms (see e.g. Kellogg Foundation (2009): The objectives of a program relate to the short and long term goals of the  strategy which will usually be met by targeted actions and processes. Inputs are the resources needed to operate the program (including  human resources, financial resources but also others such as facilities and equipment). Activities are the actions or clusters of actions that  are needed to implement the program. Outputs are the direct product of programme activities and are typically tangible and quantifiable.  Outcomes are the intended and unintended results that are linked to programme objectives. They answer the question “What happened as  a result of the programme?” Typically, they can be categorised into short-medium and longer term outcomes.  Impacts are the fundamental  direct and indirect effects of programme activities (on a 7-10 year period) on the wider environment. These include socioeconomic, financial  and political effects.  29 Please note, references to the countries in this chapter always refer to the cybersecurity strategy of the country, which can be found in  the References section of the present report.  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  13  defined. Although these aspects may be captured in implementation guides, the programmatic  approach and agenda-setting that is often the goal of the adoption of the NCSS could be better  supported by clearly articulated lines of casuality and intervention logic.  Objectives  The objectives of any NCSS will relate to the short and long term goals of the strategy which will usually  be met by targeted actions and processes. While they may be related to the overall outcomes they  are usually be more focused and come about as a direct result of an action. However, some objectives  as set out in the NCSS are rather generic by stating that a nation can secure their vital functions against  cyber threats.  Figure 2 Examples of objectives in NCSS in the EU  The objectives as mapped are:   Establish and implement legislative framework;   Establish and clarify roles in collaboration between the public and private sector;   Invest in ICT and innovation for cybersecurity and privacy;   Protection and efficient functioning of critical information infrastructure;   Sustainability: shape an open, stable an secure cyberspace;   Citizens’ perception of sufficient data protection ;   Protect digital national information resources;   Education and training;   International leadership position;   Secure vital national functions and interests against cyber threats and attacks;   Preparedness, resilience and adequate response to cyberthreats and attacks;   Promote economy reliant on digitalized industry;  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  14   Awareness raising;   Tackle cybercrime;   Endorse and respect certain rules of behaviours in the digital arena consistent with national  values;   Safe use of information and communication in cyberdomain by citizens, business and  authorities;   Secure and safe place to do business;   Quality of IT and communication products and security standards   Secure cyber space with respect to fundamental rights and values  While not always the case, many objectives can be measured by defining success indicators and are  usually complemented by subsequent projected actions. As illustrated in the map, some of these  objectives are shared by a large number of countries (e.g. capability building, the revision of legal  frameworks or international cooperation), while others, such as striking a balance between human  rights and cybersecurity in legislation, are particular to the Member State. Poland, for instance, wishes  to increase the level of security within its ICT infrastructure which could be achieved through running  risk assessments and enabling the security of government internet portals. A number of other  objectives relate to tackling cyber crime (Netherlands, UK), strengthening or protecting critical  infrastructure (France, Romania, Belgium and others), building up a skills base in ICT or e-skills (UK,  Netherlands, and others) and enhancing safety standards (Hungary). Some NCSS mention defence  objectives by sharing their desire to become a world power in the area of cyber defence (France)30.  Specific objectives  Programme-level objectives, which tend to be defined at a high level, are often broken down into focal  areas of action. The distinction between the objectives and the areas of action serves as an  opportunity  to present the transversal areas of government and stakeholder activity that need to be  coordinated to realise the outputs and outcomes of the strategy. For instance, an objective of  international leadership in cyber security markets needs action to be taken at the level of the  legislative framework as well as in interactions with the stakeholders. The presentation of specific  objectives can support the theory of change and these could serve as a clear vehicle to connect broad  objectives with individual actions.  The areas are various: published EU strategies tend to frame these in a broader sense and encompass  socioeconomic areas (such as training and promoting a business environment) and put emphasis on  international cooperation. Overall, from the mapping it appears that the activity areas show similarity  across EU Member States. Some of these, such as critical infrastructure protection or risk assessments  occur in a large number of Member States, while others, such as standardisation or capability building  in the private sector are more rare.  In a number of the reviewed strategies these areas of action reflect transversal areas where action  needs to be taken to reach the objectives (e.g., in the case of Austria or France). In some cases, the  areas of action and the objectives of the strategy are not separated (Lithuania). Finland, for instance  lists a set of areas that are linked to the implementation process of the strategy i.e. putting into place  a review structure for the strategy and defining the division of tasks across stakeholders, and others  that are more outcome-related, i.e. improve the resilience of all societal actors.  In a nutshel, the main action points are:   Develop standards and norms, legislation;  30 In other Member States military cyberdefence objectives are covered in separate strategic documents which were outside the scope of  the present work.  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  15   Enhance strategic collaboration between autorities, business and academicia;   Invest on international cooperation;   Protect critical information infrastructure;   Create a culture of security: inform, educate and raise awareness;   Research, development and innovation;   Security of services delivered in cyberspace;   Support competence and capabilities building in involved actors;   Counter national and international criminal activities;   Perform threat tracking, risk assessment and response.  Figure 3 Examples of specific objectives indicated in EU NCSS  Inputs  Inputs indicate the resources that are made available for the implementation of the NCSS at both  strategy and programme level, originated from the specific objectives of the NCSS. These include  financial, human and relational resources, among others. Only some of the NCSS reviewed for this  study listed financial resources among the inputs (examples include the UK, or the projected budgets  included in the Slovak strategy). Based on the interviews, it appears as though, at least in a few  European Member States, there is not a central funding scheme for the implementation of the  strategy. The budget for implementation is part of a departmental or institutional budget. Another  approach would be to introduce a national separate budget line for the NCSS, once drafting of the  strategy is complete.  Acknowledging the need for a dedicated cyber security budget line within  budgets could be an important instrument of supporting cyber security policy actions. This view is  indirectly supported by the perspective that financial support for the implementation is quite weak  since it relies on existing departmental budgets, as observed by another interviewee.  Other often-cited resources include cyber security tools (such as information security tools for the  systems of public administrations), educational resources and incentives (such as tax breaks or  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  16  procurement rules) for producing safe systems. Several of the documents concentrate on leveraging  legal resources to pursue the objectives of the strategy and align it to European and international good  practice. Standards are also an important tool in promoting secure practices. In many cases, outputs  and inputs interact in a circular manner (the outputs of one action serve as inputs to realising  subsequent actions). This is the case for instance of the resources involved in establishing new centres  that later exercise function in Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) or fight against  cybercrime (Luxembourg, Finland). Planned evaluation frameworks will need to find a way to capture  this circularity.  Figure 4 Examples of input indicators in EU NCSS  The input indicators:   Legislative measures;   Increasing law enforcement and judiciary capabilities;   Participation in international and regional cooperation;   Establish/improve processes and coordinating structures;   Tools and organisational components;   Support research and development;   Introduce CS in curicula of education system;   Feasbility study on separate public and private vital network;   Incentives and funding for initiatives supporting secure systems;   Guidelines and internal information on information security.  Activities  Activities are the core interventions through which the outputs and outcomes of the project are  pursued. It is fundamental that they are defined in a way that encompasses all inputs and the  projected outcomes. At the national level the activities are often described and periodically updated  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  17  through the implementation plans of the national strategies, which in turn are usually not published.  The country’s legislative framework provides for many of the activities (e.g. those involved in creating  and revising new legislation). In some cases, such as the UK, where centralised funding is available,  central government bodies are more heavily involved in defining the activities. However, in countries  with more decentralised systems and where cyber security activities are financed out of the standing  budget lines of the entities involved, such as the Netherlands, activities are sometimes designed by  the departments themselves.  Capacity building, legislative reviews and assessments of risks and threats are examples of procedural  activity which many strategies incorporate (e.g. Spain and the Netherlands). Furthermore, awareness- raising activities are mentioned by all reviewed strategies. Where available, the activities rarely cover  all objectives specified in the strategy. Overall, activities are not discussed in detail in the strategies to  be identifiable and allow mapping.  Outputs  Outputs are the direct results of programme activities. These are usually linked to key performance  indicators as they are relatively easy to measure quantitatively and qualitatively, and can be audited  to ensure sound financial management of implementation activities; individual policy units have  greater control over outputs or activities than outcomes or impacts. Therefore, outputs form the  backbone of separate implementation reports linked to cyber security frameworks and, as a result,  they are covered in the main body of the national strategy to a limited extent. Where mentioned, they  tend to not be linked to the specific areas of action and scattered throughout the document. Examples  of outputs include implementation plans (Lithuania, Slovakia), the legislative frameworks foreseen by  the strategy (Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary), the units or task forces that are supposed to be  established and the products of the periodic review processes (Slovakia and UK).  Figure 5 Examples of outputs in EU NCSS  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  18  Usual outputs:   Annual reports;   Minimum cybersecurity standards;   Improved regulatory frameworks;   Improved capabilities (processes, tools and coordinating structures);   Actions and emergency response plans;   International cooperation;   Support research and development (actual investment);   people: professional training and self-education tools for citizens;   public private partnership;   capabilities to counter cybercrime;   warning and reposting systems;   Civil and human right in cybersecurity;   Training and material supplied by security companies to individual business.  Evaluation planning needs to ensure that outputs are linked to outcomes and long-term impact of the  programme. Moreover, as several outputs also serve as inputs to subsequent stages of  implementation, these relationships need to be reflected in evaluation frameworks.  Outcomes and impacts  Outcomes reflect the short and medium-term results of the programme, while impacts represent the  longer term (e.g. 10+ years) results, which are also more broadly defined and take place at the social  level. They are usually situated in context with the objectives and the areas of action: for instance,  short and medium-term outcomes are incremental changes in resilience and collaboration which  directly flow from the activities envisaged in the strategy.  Impacts are long-term goals relating to the  security of cyberspace as a result of the outcomes realised by the programme in the short- and  medium-term.  Although this is an important distinction between the types of results that a  programme can generate, NCSS reviewed for this study did not distinguish between foreseen  outcomes and impacts. Therefore, Figure 6 lists outcomes and impacts together.  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  19  Figure 6 Examples of outcomes in EU NCSS  There are varying projected outcomes and impacts both among the NCSS and within them, the most  common of which is to create a safe or secure online environment (France, Romania, Hungary,  Belgium and UK). Some NCSS envisage outcomes in wider terms. For example, Estonia wishes to  reduce cyberspace vulnerabilities within the nation while the Netherlands expects the Dutch society  to understand the safe utilisation of cyberspace as a result of awareness raising on cyber security risks.  This study also uncovered a number of desired outcomes relating to the protection of critical  infrastructures (Italy), helping businesses to continue their work (UK), preserving their national  security (UK, Austria, Romania), protecting individual rights (Czech Republic) and enabling  international cooperation (Belgium and Italy).  Since many of these outcomes are defined in complex socioeconomic terms, their measurement can  be challenging. However, it is possible to quantify some of the outcomes in terms of a KPI, and set up  appropriate measurement methods through the European or national statistics offices. Examples of  such indicators are: surveying public trust in online transactions and the level of internationalisation  of web commerce. Several such indicators are already monitored at the EU level, allowing a broad  grasp of the quality of cyber security, despite the fact that there are methodological limitations to the  establishment of cause-consequence relationships between digital strategies and this kind of society- level outcome31. Other potential measures (such as the number of breaches and attacks taking place  in the country) are often much more challenging to efficiently measure and frame as an outcome of  national-level cyber programmes32.  31 See e.g., Eurobarometer. (2013). Special report on Cybersecurity, Eurobarometer 404.  32 See e.g., Robinson and Horvath. (2013).  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  20  Evaluation processes  Almost all NCSS reviewed within the scope of the study include provisions on a review and evaluation  process for the document (exceptions include e.g., Hungary and Spain). In Finland, ensuring a review  and evaluation of the strategy is one of the ten strategic areas of action. In other strategies (UK,  Germany, France) the evaluation also serves the purpose of keeping the legislative framework up-to- date with regards to recent developments in the technology landscape. In several strategies, the  frequency of the evaluation cycle is established at a yearly (Lithuania, Slovakia, Netherlands) or  biannual (Austria) frequency. In all NCSS, however, the details of the evaluation process are included  in a separate act or in the implementation plan. Even where the review processes are not specified in  the NCSS, the delegated acts and actions foreseen by them are subject to the scrutiny of public audit  bodies, depending on the institutional setup of the country. In other strategies the actors involved are  also specified (Austria, Estonia, Germany). The review mechanisms that are discussed cover both the  programme-level evaluations (i.e. a review on the process of realising the actions foreseen by the  framework) and effective reviews on reaching the proposed objectives and outcomes of the strategy.  Furthermore, they also extend to reviews at the level of individual projects under the cyber security  framework. In Italy, for instance, education and on-the-job cyber security training programmes, two  of the action areas of the strategy, are specifically mentioned as being subject to review.  Figure 7 Examples of evaluation processes in EU NCSS  Some evaluation approaches:   Regular progress reports;   Cyber Security Council or Security Committee assesses the implementation and progress of  specified objectives;   Participating institutions provide an update;  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  21   Presidency of the council of ministers drafts a text on the activities in relation to cyberspace  protection (annexed to annual report to the parliament on national security strategy and  policies);   Promote the use of questionnaires among stakeholders to understand the training needs;   Regular evaluation of security policies;   Regular review;   Specific measures to evaluate the effectiveness of projects;   Testing the efficiency of processes designed to deal with security risks.  Overall, the description of the evaluation process tends to prioritised in the NCSS. In addition,  documents describing the methodologies that are applied to evaluation are often not accessible to  the public. As a consequence, the approach taken to define evaluation benchmarks and criteria is  difficult to gauge from a review of the strategy itself.  With respect to the entity responsible for the evaluation, the guidelines provided by ENISA with  regards to carrying out an evaluation of an NCSS prescribe the identification of an independent entity  to ensure segregation of duties. In certain Member States, a National Cyber Security Council is  responsible for the evaluation of the implementation of the strategy. In other Member States, the  government auditing body is responsible for the evaluation.  Either way, this is an important indication  that the entity responsible for the evaluation is independent of the entity responsible of the execution  of the strategy in order to guarantee an impartial evaluation.  3.1.7.1 Computer Emergency Response Teams - CERTs  In the evaluation process in the majority of the cases CERTs play a vital role. CERTs, due to their critical  placement with respect to incident response, can provide unique input about cyber security progress.  In one Member State, for example, the monitoring of KPIs depends on the National CERT since the  team is responsible for measuring information security. A similar structure is available in the  Netherlands, where the National Cyber Security Centre, which includes the CERT capacity for the  Dutch government, leads the Cyber Security Assessment, which is published several times per year.  CERTs have overview on a number of aspects which can feed into KPIs, such as number of advisories  about vulnerabilities, as well as potential malware infections and developments, and, as previously  mentioned, cyber security incidents. Particularly, the latter could be an indicator that CERTs could  contribute to measure the level of information security across various years. This is, however, subject  to a number of other influential variables, such as a potential increase in sophistication due to the  introduction of breach notification obligations across different sectors.  An important issue that must be taken into account when considering the involvement of CERTs in the  evaluation process is the sharp contrast between their usual informal working practices, which rely on  a trust model among an informal network of contacts and the professionalisation and formalisation  of the cyber security landscape. The right balance should maintain the benefits of the informal manner  of working in CERTs. This is particularly important as the landscape evolved and CERTs became part of  a National Cyber Security Centre, as occurred in, for example, the Netherlands. One interviewee noted  how the questions related to CERTs should also focus on National Cyber Security Centres. This is  probably due to the close connection between the roles of National Cyber Security Centres and CERTs.  3.1.7.2 Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP)  Critical infrastructure protection deserves special attention when discussing cyber security in general  as well as government strategies. This is due to two factors. First, critical infrastructure concerns the  protection of vital services for society to function and, as such, receives a higher priority and often  more stringent security requirements due to their sensitive or delicate nature. Therefore, the mapping  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  22  and identifying of services  to be part of CIP is essential. One Member State interviewed used a variety  of indicators, including legal definitions, but also the potential impact of an interruption measured  through how many people would be affected within a given timeframe, including a potential number  of casualties in the event that services became unavailabe. These metrics assisted in the mapping and  idenfitication of vital services.  The second factor concerns the lack of direct government control in the majority of Member States  over the critical infrastructure sector, since most critical infrastructure are in the hands of private  actors. In one Member State, CIP was dealt with in a separate document, which focused more on crisis  management. In other Member States, CIP was a key area of action or a key objective included in the  strategy. For one Member State, the separate department responsible for CIP provided a yearly report  on the progress made in the area. As such, CIP may and can be hosted elsewhere in the governmental  landscape but still maintains a connection to cyber security evaluation.  3.1.7.3 National regulatory authorities  Even though not all the national regulatory authorities (NRA) have a mandate on cyber security, their  role remains important in the improvement of resilience at the national level. Starting with the  implementation of incident reporting in the telecoms sector (Article 13a of the Telecoms Act33) or the  data breach notification (Article 4 of the Privacy Directive34), the NRAs are becoming the national hub  of information on cyber incidents. In the proposed NIS Directive35, in which the incident reporting  provision would apply to the critical sectors (energy, water, transport, health, finance etc), the NRAs  have again an important role. It is evident that their responsibilities will increase turning them into an  important actor also in the evaluation of the national strategy as they will have all indications to  measure the level of resilience and cyber security in the different sectors in a national level.  3.2 Stakeholder involvement  Given the borderless nature of cyberspace, all that use it are stakeholders by default. Some NCSS call  for participation of the private sector on a taskforce (Netherlands, SMEs in Germany), the  establishment of working groups for sectorial issues (Spain, Czech Republic) or public-private  partnerships36 (Italy). A couple of interviewees noted how stakeholders also play a key role in the  review process, especially during consultation sessions. For others, the private sector receives a more  prominent role due to external developments such as the proposed NIS Directive. Since the NIS  Directive is perceived to have a significant impact on the cyber security landscape, the public sector is  presently involved in an ongoing public discussion on the Directive. As a result, private sector  stakeholders are presently very involved on a practical level. Once roles and approaches are defined  it is then key to determine the directional nature of ensuring stakeholder involvement: do  stakeholders have almost equal contribution to defining actions (horizontal structure) or is one  stakeholder more authoritative than the other (top-down structure)?  Finland, for example, follows a top-down approach whereby the state outlines roles and approaches  applicable to different groups operating within society. The UK appears to have a more horizontal  structure in which it allows for the private sector to seek business-driven solutions and Slovakia calls  on the private sector to contribute financial resources. Each case utilises the public-private partnership  in different ways. In the UK and Slovakia, the private sector contributes substantial resources  33 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting  34 http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/  35 http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_directive_en.pdf  36 Public private partnerships or PPPs are important scheme for information sharing (like ISACs etc) ENISA has been working on the topics  offering an overview of the EU PPPs currently developed http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/public-private- partnership/national-public-private-partnerships-ppps (to be updated in 2014)  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/ http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_directive_en.pdf http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/public-private-partnership/national-public-private-partnerships-ppps http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/public-private-partnership/national-public-private-partnerships-ppps  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  23  (expertise, use of its infrastructure, finance) and the Finnish private sector takes its lead from the  state.  The added value of the development of a national strategy has been often found by interviewees to  include externalities such as the potential of the framework created to encourage dialogue between  levels of government and different stakeholders. For instance, the cooperation between levels of  government can take the form of periodical reports to Parliament by the organisation responsible for  overseeing the implementation of the strategy, on a yearly or biannual basis (UK, Austria). Such  network-building processes are further reinforced by the multidisciplinary nature of cyber security,  central funding where applicable and the consequent need for government departments and  stakeholder organisations to act in a coordinated manner. This is an aspect that, while often  contributing to the setup of policymaking processes, is frequently not captured in the evaluation of  the strategy. Review mechanisms must be tailored specifically to each case in both the evaluation of  stakeholders and involving stakeholders, ensuring the highest level of transparency. According to the  findings of a preliminary scoping study conducted for the present study, the value of stakeholder  involvement is often absent from evaluations.  Figure 8 Examples of stakeholder involvement mechanisms in EU NCSS  Several NCSS which discuss mechanisms for the review or evaluation concentrate on practices  involving releasing reports (Estonia, Netherlands, Austria, Lithuania and Slovakia). However not all of  these include a clear definition of their measures for success or how they are to obtain the information  required to successfully evaluate stakeholders. Focus groups (working groups, taskforces, etc.)  envisaged under the strategy would guarantee a certain level of evaluation of self-examination, yet it  is unclear as to how these will be operated.  In collaborating with the government or competent authority for the implementation of a cyber  security strategy, stakeholders are investing in their interests (commercial, personal, data related,  etc.). It is important that stakeholders understand their responsibilities and what is required of them.  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  24  The role of each stakeholder differs depending on their capacities and their resources. For example,  Slovakia expects the private sector to fund some activities within the paradigm of cyber security and  the UK looks to business driven solutions to the cyber security question. The Italian state assumes  responsibility as one of the key stakeholders but invites the private sector to collaborate as they also  have a lot to gain from a secure cyberspace. The majority of other NCSS rely on the public and private  sector and individuals to work on implementing some activities within their strategies while other  countries, such as Japan, call more specifically on those controlling critical infrastructure to play a part  in securing their interests. Individuals, for their part, are expected to become aware of threats and  vulnerabilities across the board and responsibility can then fall to the government to conduct  awareness raising campaigns and promote educational programmes.

Table 2 Examples of stakeholder involvement in NCSS in the EU  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  25  4 Evaluation Framework for NCSS  As earlier chapters have shown, the approach taken to the evaluation of NCSS differs largely among  European Member States. From several interviews it also transpired that the policy departments that  are responsible for overseeing the implementation of the programme are often not utilising  systematic program-level evaluation frameworks. This part of the deliverable presents elements of a  framework for national cyber security strategies, describing three tools that could help Member States  enhance their programme-level evaluation work37. The framework has been designed drawing on the  insights gained through the systematic review of existing cyber security strategies, interviews with  Member States, feedback from Member States on the draft logic model, and academic and grey  literature on policy evaluation. It also draws on the principles listed in Chapter 3 of the 2012 ENISA  guide on cyber security38.  The proposed evaluation framework consists of the following elements:  a) A blueprint logic model presenting conceptual building blocks and a structure;  b) A list of possible key performance indicators (KPIs);  While the present chapter offers a brief overview on the suggested tools, it is by no means a  comprehensive guide to their implementation. Annex B offers further resources for policymakers  wishing to know more about the details of these approaches and detailed advice on applying them. In  this section we provide a short summary of the methodologies included in the evaluation framework  and the rationale behind their inclusion. Depending on the legal obligations and review practices  which are currently in place in the individual Member States, the policymakers responsible for the  NCSS may benefit from drawing on some or all of these tools in planning and understanding the impact  of their activities.  4.1 Logic Modelling  Logic modelling is an evaluation tool which is useful to deploy in order to understand the logic of the  NCSS and its implementation. In brief, Logic Modelling permits the mapping of all the different  ingredients of the initiative. Given the complexity of cross organisational strategies like NCSS, a degree  of simplification is necessary to apply in order to show the connections between the different  elements. A Logic Model associated with a programme must be kept updated to ensure that it is  relevant to the programme as time progresses. Reference information on Logic Modelling can be  found in annex B.  Based on the review of the national strategies as well as the literature and an internal working session,  we have identified the elements that are present in the reviewed strategies and the policy and  academic literature. Subsequently, we mapped these components out in a comprehensive logic model  that reflects the architecture of the EU Cyber Security Strategy. The following figures illustrate the  outcomes of this exercise. These models illustrate the underlying logic behind recurring components  of national cyber security strategies, even though their own intervention logic may not be made  explicit in the individual documents.  37 While below we present a compendium of tools, a complete evaluation framework would have to rely on a conceptual framework that  defines how these tools are applied in the national context and how the results of these exercises are interpreted.  38 ENISA. (2012b).  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  26  Figure 9 Logic model elements from the review I.  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  27  Figure 10 Logic model elements from the review II.  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  28  The blueprint logic model illustrates the building blocks that can be used to map the “logic” behind  the actions taken and how these support the goals of the NCSS. This tool can be used to detect and  summarise the relationship between the inputs, processes, outputs and outcomes involved in the  strategy. The streams of activity in the blueprint logic model have been defined in a manner that  allows Member States to align the articulation of their strategy to the overall goals of the European  Cybersecurity Strategy. However, national contexts vary greatly across Member States. Therefore, the  structure contains only suggestions for potential elements and clusters to take into account without  prescribing in detail what these areas of activity should contain and what kind of relationship should  persist between the individual elements. These elements in more detail:  Developping cyber defence policies and capabilities  The activities are based on the EU strategic guidance and/or NATO strategic guidance (and other policy  documents that give guidelines on cyber defence) and include:   Participation in EU cyber defence initiatives   Capability building   Technology development  The outcome would be to have improved cyber defence capabilities, in mid term to have improved  resilience through cooperation and new assets against cyber attacks and in long term to have the level  of cyber attack protection higly increased.  Achieving cyber resilience: developing capabilities and cooperating efficiently within public and  private sector  The inputs are the feedback provided by the different stakeholders, CERTs, National Security (or cyber  security) agencies, NRAs etc. From the public sector the information received depends on the  coordination structures, on the organisational structures and on the intra-government.The specific  activities include:   Perform risk and threat analysis in national level   Participating in national and international cyber exercises   Invest time on mutual learning activities (trainings, workshops)   Enhance community building  The results should be to facilitate cooperation in CERT activities and enhance good security practices  between authorities, to improve capabilities and tools and to eliminate discruption of service  availability. In the mid term the confidentiality, availability and integrity of electronic and information  services should be ensured; and in the long term the improved conditions and awareness result in  increased resilience against threats and attacks. In parallel, increased awareness results in safer online  practices and trust in online services including the digital market and more good practice on policy  making in the cyber security domain.  Reducing cyber crime  The input to achieve this goal should include the EU and national cybercrime legal frameworks existing  already. The specific activities would be to identify the needs and gaps in law enforcement agencies  (LEAs), to update the national technical assets, to develop and use best practice guides, to create and  invest in centers of excellence and to establish collaboration mechanisms with national and  international organisations. The immediate results would be a list of the state of the art technical  assets of a national range, a registry of best practices and the creation of centers of excellence and  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  29  cooperation with the private sector and academia. In international collaboration aspect more  specifically the results should be:   To enhance the capabilities of dealing with cross border incidents (related to cybercrime);   To reduce barriers in forensics investigations (multi jurisdictional issues that are difficult to  overcome);   To gain access to state of the art tools.  Develop the industrial and technological resources for cybersecurity  In order to develop industrial and technological recources on cyber security the country should invest  from a finance and resources perspective; and put effort on R&D projects and demand-side  procurement. The immediate goals would be to develop industry related standards (of national range)  and to diffuse the results of the research projects in the market. In a long term perspective this will  provide grounds for the creation of competitive European products (and support the EU market on  secure solutions) and will introduce them to the international market  secure products.  Secure critical information infrastructure  On the CIIP perspective by having as input the identification of critical infrastructures and  vulnerabilities (a ‘must do’ in all countries at national and regional level), the identification of critical  assets and their interdependencies, some very useful results would emerge:   Risk registry ands risk assessment results;   Risk management plans and business continuity plans;   List of identified CIIs and their interdependencies;   Trusted information sharing mechanisms (ISACs, PPPs).  In a long term vision this would result to more resilient CIIs (faster and more efficient response  mechanisms) and into better cooperation between actors.  4.2 Key Performance Indicators  Key performance indicators (KPIs) are important criteria which may be selected to measure  performance or progress of a policy initiative such as NCSS. On the other hand, output indicators39  measure mostly the quantity of goods and services produced after a plan was followed; in this study,  we focus more on the qualitative criteria, which is why we focus on key performance indicators. Key  performance indicator can also be quantitative, but our focus is more on the long term outlook, so the  qualitative measures. Defining key performance indicators at the design phase of an NCSS allows  policymakers to track progress towards the objectives of the strategy during its implementation. They  can also be used in evaluation and supporting the revision of objectives during the lifecycle of the  program.  KPIs can be mapped for the planning and evaluation process using a matrix of characteristics.  However, it might be challenging to identify KPIs for NCSS given the difficulties of obtaining data and  the fact that outcomes for an NCSS are often highly influenced by other factors. As KPIs are often  difficult to create, we outline some illustrative examples.  The examples of KPIs are categorised per  objective and according to the phase of the process they are addressed (inputs, activities, outputs  etc.). As a result some KPIs are binary because based on the feedback received from the MSs there is  not enough maturity at the moment to go one step further that the typical binary indicators. This  study raises awareness on the specific issue.  39  http://www.hfrp.org/publications-resources/browse-our-publications/indicators-definition-and-use-in-a-results-based-accountability-  system  http://www.hfrp.org/publications-resources/browse-our-publications/indicators-definition-and-use-in-a-results-based-accountability-system http://www.hfrp.org/publications-resources/browse-our-publications/indicators-definition-and-use-in-a-results-based-accountability-system  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  30  The first table presents KPIs on developing capabilities on cyber security; part of this are awareness  raising, training and CERT activities. The collaboration between public and private sector is also  important but KPIs on this topic will be included in the next tables as well, as it is a horizontal aspect  of cyber security. The KPIs are categorized per objective to achieve in the strategy; this way the  evaluation is more focused and results into more concrete actions.  Key objective 1: Developing cyberdefence policy and capabilities  The first objective to be achieved after the implementation of a national strategy is the development  of cyberdefence policy and capabilities.  Key Performance Indicator Evidence (what we should measure)  Existence of a strategic national plan on cyber  defence (doctrine, concepts, stakeholders involved,  specific responsibilities)  Existence and status of such a plan, activity reports,  action plan and responsibilities  Degree of participation in EU cyberdefence initiatives  (capability building)  Indication of participation, level of participation  Identification and structure of military CERT (mili  CERT, military policy level)  Capability assessments; Policy documents; internal  operational documents  Existence of training (for required types of  personnel) and level of influence  Capability assessments; Policy documents; internal  operational documents  Interoperability (extent to which CD capabilities  interact with others outside mil area)  Capability assessments; Policy documents; internal  operational documents  Increased resilience through cooperation and new  assets against military cyberattacks (Faster  detection, response and recovery from sophisticated  attacks, Cost efficient development through  collaboration, robust, available and clear  communication channels)  Capability assessments, Incident reports, Activity  reports  Table 3 KPIs on developing cyberdefence policies and capabilities  Key objective 2: Achieving cyber resilience: develop capabilities and efficient cooperation within  public and private sector  The key notion for this objective is the collaboration between sector and the later development of  cyber security capabilities in joint actions. Raising awareness is also part of this key objective. Some  key performance indicators could be:  Key Performance Indicator Evidence (what we should measure)  Setup of CERTs and/or National Security Agencies Existence and mandate of the institutional actors  (mission scope, agencies/ bodies mandate)  Existence or setup of public private partnerships on  cyber security  Identification and structure of those partnerships,  bodies involved and their role, activity reports  Identified risk and threats landscape Risk analysis, threat analysis (conducted by CERTs or  National Security Agencies)  Existence of organised national cyber security  exercises  Activity reports  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  31  Enhanced capabilities: organised trainings for the  public and private sector, mutual learning activities  (workshops and conference).  Activity reports, event title, companies/stakeholders  participated  Awareness raising activities for end-users (material,  campaigns, events)  Material disseminated, campaigns/event organised,  survey on citizens perception  National coordination actions among all actors in  the national cyber security field (National Security  Agencies)  Activity reports, mandates, collaborative activities  Existence of developed  response capabilities (react- recovery plans, early warning systems etc)  protect-detect-react-recover plan, early warning  systems and simulation models, activity report  Increase safety of public IT systems  Vulnerabilities detection (report-CERTs or National  Security Agencies), document the frequency of  software upgrades/patches and make procedures,  adopt security standards for ICT systems.  Table 4 KPIs on achieving cyber resilience  Key objective 3: Reduce cybercrime  In part we provide a set of KPIs to measure the activities to reduce cybercrime first in a national level  and then in international. These KPIs are focused more on the operation of law enforcement agencies  (LEAs) and national security agencies.  Key Performance Indicator Evidence (what we should measure)  National institutional framework for cyber crime  reduction (LEAs, CERTs etc)  Structured and documented framework  Enforcement of LEA (gap analysis, identification of  needs, state of art technical assets, use of best  practices)  Documentation on gaps identified and on mitigation  actions to support LEAs with mandate on cyber crime  reduction, capability assessment, registry of best  practices, pprocedures documentation  Existence of collaboration mechanisms with EC3,  CEPOL, Eurojust , international organisations & other  MS  Activity reports and common actions  National cybercrime cases resolution  Statistics from LEAs on cases of cyber crimes  (investigations solved, prosecutions etc)  International collaboration:   Enhanced abilities in combating cybercrime  across borders   reduced barriers to investigations   access to up-to-date tools   lower cost for combating cybercrimes  Procedures for cross border cooperation between  authorities (LEAs, CERTs etc), statistics of  investigations and resolutions, budgetary reports  Safer cyberspace for all users (users are protected  from cybercrime)  Statistics (Law enforcement agencies, Surveys,  National statistical offices)  Table 5 KPIs on reducing cybercrime  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  32  Key Objective 4: Develop the industrial and technological resources for cybersecurity  The concept of this key objective is tha industry and technological advancements (through academia  etc) would support the level of national cyber security in the market products. Some KPIs to measure  this:  Key Performance Indicator Evidence (what we should measure)  Support standardisation and development of  trustmarks & safety labels  Compliance with security standards, audits and  certification mechanisms in place by the regularoty  authorities, adoption rate of standards and safety  labels  Funding research through EU and national research  programmes  EU databases on research project, Science funding  agencies.

These are not meant as an exhaustive list but rather a selection of issues  which we consider might have the potential to adversely affect the implementation of an evaluation  framework for NCSS.  5.1 Human Capacity  Recruiting the right human resources, skilling and retaining them is critical to any policy  implementation, none more so than in a complex area like cyber security strategies where there is a  high demand for coordination across different organisations. Failing to recruit the right people and to  implement an engagement strategy, alongside any programme, would not bode well for its eventual  success. As evaluation is newly introduced, additional resources that would be dedicated in  monitoring the process of the strategy would be a rare action to take.  5.2 Budgetary support  Adequate budgets, whilst related to the question of human resources (personnel) is distinct in so far  as it provides resources for critical activities such as studies, reports, conferences and workshops that  help to achieve the ultimate impacts of an NCSS as set out in our blueprint. Without budgetary  support, there is a risk that those establishing and maintaining an NCSS and any associated programme  might become side-lined, lose visibility or have their efforts hampered by internal struggles between  administrative departments. A good evaluation (and a adjustment) framework would require an  annually set budget to fulfil all the objectives.  5.3 Communications and engagement  A third potential challenge of an evaluation framework relates to communications and engagement.  Cyber security, like other forms of complex security challenges that characterise the risky, uncertain  world we live in, requires a joined up or “comprehensive” approach. In practice, this means that  government bodies and agencies, previously able to work within clear mandates and boundaries, must  be encouraged to work across their institutional remits, for benefits that might not directly accrue to  their efforts but to society and government as a whole. This is even more the case with the private  sector, which must recognise that in certain domains (e.g., CII) they must better balance security and  business rationales.  5.4 Transparency and public accountability  As NCSS is an example of a public policy intervention, that is using public money to benefit the society  and economy, it is vitally important to engage citizens in an accessible way in relation to the rationale  for the intervention, the expected benefits, levels of spending on the intervention and what practical  steps would be involved (subject of course to specific rules regarding classified Action Plans). Given  the current deficiency in public accountability and low levels of public trust in governments40, being  seen to be accountable for efforts in a complex and intangible domain as cyber security will no doubt  be challenging. In trying to do so, it will be critical to illustrate the rationale for NCSS which might have  budgetary consequences (such as additional spending) and its expected benefits for the average  40  Eurobarometer Standard  79 Spring 2013; Public Opinion in the European Union available at:  http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb79/eb79_first_en.pdf  file:///C:/Users/vhorvath/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.Outlook/215XUR45/Eurobarometer  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  35  citizen. So the evaluation of the strategy should take into account this very delicate matter and express  the final results in a way that invests on this transparency of the government to the citizens.  5.5 Developing a lessons learned culture  As outlined in Chapter 3, part of the benefits of implementing an evaluation framework is being able  to create and sustain a culture of identifying and learning lessons. This is important to create a  continuous positive feedback loop, where mistakes can be identified and resolutions offered and  implemented. This requires a step-change in behaviour, however.   Firstly, it requires encouraging the mind-set of evaluation amongst policy practitioners  charged with designing, implementing and evaluating an NCSS (e.g. so that they ask  themselves the question: “How would I measure the impact of this or that element of our  NCSS?”);   Secondly,  the organisational and human capacity is needed to identify and learn lessons in a  constructive environment and have been embedded into practice.  5.6 Dealing with uncertainty  Finally, a potential pitfall of evaluation of an action plan/strategy which cannot be avoided is  uncertainty and what to do when things do not work out as planned (what if the evaluation results  are not so good as expected). The ‘building block’ approach outlined in this report does not preclude  the possibility that despite the design and implementation of all the elements identified in this report,  cyber-security goals might not necessarily be reached. This is due to the inherent nature of uncertainty  of cyber security, where sudden systemic emergent risks can upset even the most carefully planned  NCSS.  In this case, policy practitioners should be equipped to deal with adverse political and public  reaction (in addition to the usual consequence management, business continuity practices), as well as  having capacities to implement sound crisis management to enable them to  manage risks as and when  they arise. This requires strong capacity for crisis communication skills.  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  36  6 Concluding summary  In this report, we have outlined, in the context of the main themes of the 2013 EU Cyber Security  Strategy (namely resilience, tackling cybercrime, national security capabilities, cyber defence, critical  information infrastructures protection and as horizontal themes education and international co- operation) two empirically based methods that can be used to evaluation of an NCSS.  The evaluation  activities we have described can be classified according to whether they apply to the content or to the  processes of the design or implementation of an NCSS.  We have identified that from those NCSS reviewed, there is a somewhat fragmented approach to the  ultimate impacts that a NCSS is expected to provide. To a certain extent this is understandable,  because each country will have its own priorities and issues. Indeed, in cyber security, there is no  policy prescription that fits every situation. However, this inconsistency and fragmented approach  belies a need for the application of broad framework through which NCSS can be evaluated, both in  the practical sense of effectiveness, but also in the broader and more important sense of whether the  extensive investments of time and effort are worthwhile in reaching stated goals.  After a presentation of empirical evidence, this report offered a number of suggestions and advice in  the form of practical tools to assist policy practitioners in evaluating NCSS. The main objective of this  reports is to offer:  A generic framework, classified along the themes of the EU Cyber Security Strategy, for evaluation in  NCSS, and a set of practical advice in the form of a roadmap, covering:  1. A consolidated logic model consistent with the headlines of the EUCSS;  2. Suggested advice on possible key performance indicators (which would allow progress  against the objectives set out in the logic model to be measured).  The roadmap in particular provides practical advice and tips aimed to support the practitioner in  translating the good practice identified from the desk research into their own particular contexts. It is  hoped that this roadmap will be of use across the broadest user base as it aims to be a flexible  pragmatic tool based on principles rather than prescriptive checklists. Finally, in a similar vein, this  report has identified some pitfalls that policy practitioners must be aware of when evaluating the  strategy.  This report completes the ENISA doctrine on the lifecycle of cyber security strategies (together with  the practical guide on development and execution-2012), namely the last steps of evaluation and  adjustment of a cybersecurity strategy. This way it addressed both the countries that are now new in  the field of the cyber security strategy but also the ones that have a certain level of maturity and would  like to enrich it. ENISA offers the complete set of recommendations and tools to the EU Member States  to draft and implement a sustainable and efficient strategy that will indeed increase the level of cyber  security in the country. The next step would be to offer an automated tool to perform this evaluation,  to show different maturity stages and  to combine different criteria in the final result.

Eighteen European Union Member States have  published a NCSS and some of these are now into the second iteration of their NCSS.  ENISA’s work in supporting these strategies has focused on the analysis of existing NCSS; on the  development and implementation of NCSS; and on outlining and raising awareness of good practice  to provide guidance and practical tools to the Member States for evaluating their NCSS. Specifically,  ENISA’s 2012 Practical Guide on NCSS noted four important steps: the development, implementation,  evaluation and adjustment of a NCSS.  The current study focuses on the evaluation aspect of the NCSS lifecycle, and has four goals, namely:  1. To perform a stocktaking exercise on the approaches currently used to perform evaluation of  NCSS;  2. To present recommendations and identify good practices on the implementation and  evaluation of NCSS;  3. To design and develop an evaluation framework;  4. To support the framework with a set of useful key performance indicators (KPIs) to adapt to  the varying needs of countries at different levels of maturity in their strategic planning.  To accomplish these goals we analysed 18 existing EU National Cyber Security Strategies and eight  non-EU strategies, conducted 11 key informant interviews and mapped out the components of NCSS.  From reviewing and analysing the evaluation components of the NCSS, it was noted that many  countries do not agree on the outcomes or impacts of their NCSS and on the ways to achieve them.  Within Europe, the approach taken to evaluation differs largely among Member States. While almost  all NCSS included in this study mention some elements of the review process, this was normally at a  very high level and frequently orientated around spending reviews.  The core of this document is the description of an evaluation framework. This evaluation framework  consists of the following elements: a blueprint logic model presenting conceptual building blocks and  a structure and a list of possible key performance indicators (KPIs); This model illustrates the  underlying logic behind recurring components of National Cyber Security Strategies, even though their  own intervention logic may not be made explicit in the individual documents. It also serves as an  illustration of a potential approach towards connecting the elements commonly contained within  national strategies. The key objectives (that should be measured) of a cyber security strategy  evaluation framework, based on the analysis are:   To develop cyber defence policies and capabilities;   To achieve cyber resilience;   To reduce cybercrime;   To support industry on cyber security;   To secure critical information infrastructures.  The suggested KPIs are mapped to the objectives of the evaluation model, making it easier for each  stakeholder to chooce the most useful (and measurable) key indicators according to their priorities.  The report aims to be a flexible, pragmatic tool based on principles rather than prescriptive checklists.  Finally, we point out a number of pitfalls to avoid in the application of this guidance, including those  relating to building capacity, securing budgetary support, achieving transparency and developing a  lessons learned culture.

However,  concerns about the security of this domain are becoming an increasingly pressing and salient issue.  Senior business leaders and government officials placed cyber security risks as having a greater impact  than those from terrorism when questioned by the World Economic Forum in 20131. According to the  European Commission’s projections in the 2010 ‘Digital Agenda for Europe’2  security is a high concern  for 50% of EU citizens in order to engage in e-commerce and e-Government by 2015 and for around a  third of Small to Medium Enterprises to offer online services.  If citizens and business owners lack  confidence in security, it stands to reason that they may avoid participating in online activities, thereby  inhibiting further development opportunities on cyberspace.  To help address this, many European Union Member States have published or are in the process of  publishing an NCSS. Of these, several (e.g., Czech Republic, Estonia, Netherlands and the United  Kingdom) have also updated their strategies since their first edition. National Cyber Security Strategies  aim to ensure that Member States are prepared to face serious risks, are aware of their consequences,  and are equipped to appropriately respond to breaches in the network and information system.  However, it is not always clear if and how the effectiveness of these strategies is evaluated. Evaluation  can be interpreted as a tool to assess if and how well the expected objectives have been achieved and  whether the costs involved were justified, given the changes which have been achieved3.  The European Commission understands that “there are still gaps across the EU, notably in terms of  national capabilities, coordination in cases of incidents spanning across borders, and in terms of  private sector involvement and preparedness”4.  The 2013 EU Cyber Security Strategy (EUCSS) asks  ENISA to “encourage good practice in information and network security” to assist and support  Member States in developing strong national cyber resilience capabilities, notably by building  expertise on security and resilience of industrial control systems, transport and energy infrastructure.  1.1  ENISA’s activities in the area of NCSS  As already mentioned, National Cyber Security Strategies have not yet been established or  implemented in all 28 Member States. Therefore, raising awareness of and promoting good practices  in relation to cyber security among the EU Member States continues to be an important task to do in  supporting national good practices.  In 2012, ENISA introduced the lifecycle of a NCSS in a practical guide on the development and  execution phase of NCSS5. This Practical Guide highlights the fact that the ability to implement and  evaluate the strategy is one of the two important steps governing NCSS (the other being the  development and implementation of the strategy)6.  1 World Economic Forum (2013) Global Risks Report Eighth Edition; p4 Global Risks Landscape 2013 versus 2012; Zurich, Switzerland  available at: http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GlobalRisks_Report_2013.pdf  2 Communication from the Commission of 19 May 2010 to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social  Committee and the Committee of the Regions – A Digital Agenda for Europe [COM(2010) 245 final]  3 Communication of 2 October 2013 on “Strengthening the foundations of Smart Regulation – improving evaluation.” [COM(2013)686]  4 High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.

Therefore, the objectives of this project were:  1. To perform a stocktaking exercise on the approaches currently used to perform evaluation of  NCSS;  2. To present recommendations and identify good practices on the evaluation of NCSS and to  collect them in an evaluation framework;  3. To design a set of capacity building tools for evaluating NCSS that adapt to the varying needs  of countries at different levels of maturity in their strategic planning.  1.3 Methodology  This project used a combination of three empirical techniques: 1) a literature review, 2) a  documentation review of NCSS and 3) logic modelling – “a means to encourage systematic thinking  about a programme” 8  - developed through internal interactions in the study team. Further  information on the methodology can be found in (Annex B: Methodology).  1.4 Target audience  It is envisaged that policy practitioners, experts and government officials responsible for designing,  implementing and evaluating an NCSS will find this report of use. In addition, it will be of value to  cyber security policy experts and other practitioners and researchers at national, European and  international level grappling with challenges of effectively managing cyber-security risks.  1.5 Structure  The remainder of this report is structured in the following way:  Chapter 2 discusses how the practice of evaluation can be applied to NCSS and why it is important to  evaluate these policy instruments.  Chapter 3 presents empirical evidence on where and how evaluation has been included in the NCSS  under analysis. This chapter summarises the landscape in the current practice of NCSS evaluation.  Chapter 4 describes a framework for evaluation of NCSS and elaborates on a roadmap for a NCSS  evaluation by offering practical tips on:  1. The use of the consolidated logic model consistent with the headings of the EUCSS;  2. Possible key performance indicators (which would allow measuring progress against the  objectives set out in the strategy);  Chapter 5 discusses some pitfalls to avoid for in the application of the guidance in Chapter 4.  Chapter 6 concludes the report.  7 ENISA Interactive map on NCSS available at: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies- ncsss/national-cyber-security-strategies-in-the-world  8 Ling T and Villalba Van Dijk, V.

The present guide, and this chapter in particular, look at the  potential benefits of NCSS evaluation. Some of the delegated acts, such as legislation and  implementation acts, which are foreseen by the strategies, may require their own impact assessments  and evaluations for a consistent policy framework.  2.1 Benefits and challenges of NCSS Evaluation  Evaluation offers several benefits to the specific programme and has the potential to improve the  wider policy environment by promoting evidence-based decisions. At the same time, implementing  an evaluation approach and dealing with potentially controversial or unforeseen outcomes can  present challenges. Table 1 below summarises these challenges and benefits based on the literature  identified in our review9.  Benefits  Challenges  a) Evaluation can inform about policy  changes and the framing of issues in the  long term; allow learning from past  experience.  b) Evidence of effectiveness or learning can  support the accountability of political  action.  c) Evidence base can give credibility towards  general public and international partners.  d) Evaluation can support outreach and  enhance public image as transparent  organisation.  e) Having facts on what works can help gain  traction in policy process.  f) Evaluation makes it necessary to compile  data sources on policy and its implications  for long-term planning.  g) Catalyses discussion with stakeholders.  h) Evaluation needs investment of resources.  i) Exposing flaws in policy can undermine  political priorities even when the priorities  themselves are supported.  j) Good practices can be of limited use due  to differences in national evaluation  cultures.  k) Outcomes are often challenging to define  and measure.  l)  Attributing changes to the strategy itself  can be difficult.

An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  8  2.2 Evaluation of cybersecurity strategies  Objectives in NCSS  The objectives of cyber security strategies reflect the differences in national contexts. However, there  are some similarities between the European strategies. Cyber security strategies often have objectives  articulated around the following clusters (Chapter 3), which are also reflected in the objectives of the  European Cybersecurity Strategy10:  - To achieve cyber resilience: develop capabilities and cooperating efficiently within the public  and private sector;  - To secure critical information infrastructures;  - To reduce cybercrime;  - To develop the industrial and technological resources for cybersecurity; and,  - To contribute to the establishment of an international cyberspace policy.  Within the national and international policy environment cyber security strategies have three further  distinct purposes. As strategic documents, they serve to:  - Align the whole of government by defining strategic directions;  - Give a focus and a structure to discussions with stakeholders; and,  - Convey Member State priorities towards international partners11.  Benefits and value of evaluation  Implementing evaluation frameworks can support reaching the objectives of NCSS in a variety of ways.  Below we discuss two examples of this support12.  Informing about policy change and supporting learning in the wider policy environment  One of the most important purposes of evaluation is that of informing affected stakeholders about  policy change. In this case, the results of an evaluation serve to steer policy in subsequent review  cycles. The evaluation shows which actions realised under the NCSS worked and helps policymakers  learn from mistakes13. The feedback on the policy resulting from an evidence-based approach can help  when using the cybersecurity strategies to drive discussion, prioritisation of objectives and funding  decisions14. Evaluation is also an important instrument for gaining traction within the policymaking  process. As such, evaluation results can help prove the legitimacy and credibility of interventions  under the strategy (e.g., the necessity of allocating funds to a specific type of capability-building  programme for fighting cybercrime) and increase the likelihood that CSS and the recommendations  flowing from the evaluation have the appropriate attention in the policymaking process.  Engaging stakeholders  Evaluation processes can serve as a catalyst to engaging stakeholders in a discussion about moving  the policy forward  as well as offering a framework for engaging stakeholders during the  10 High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.

An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  9  implementation of the program 15 . For example, the data collection necessary to support the  evaluation functions supports better overall availability of information on cybersecurity which can  facilitate the provision of information to stakeholders. Similarly, providing data and an objective  overview of the results of the policy can help  focus discussions with stakeholders.  Challenges and limitations to evaluating NCSS  Difficulties in quantifying and measuring results  The nature of these outcomes is not easy to define and measure. Strategies often aim to improve  confidence in doing business in the digital sphere, citizen/consumer trust in activities mediated by  cyberspace. Indicators that would allow policymakers to capture progress towards these outcomes  are often not readily available and can be challenging to construct in a reliable manner16.  Reviews and assessments of NCSS in some countries have taken forms of financial or value-for-money  audits in adherence to legal obligations. The US Government Accountability Office’s GAO’s review of  the US cyber security strategy17 and the UK National Audit Office’s evaluation of the NCSS18 are two  examples of in-depth financial audits. Even in countries where specific financial audits are not  published, government spending for implementing the NCSS is subject to the scrutiny of national audit  bodies. Although these audits offer insights into certain aspects of the implementation, they serve  different purposes than evaluation (that of verifying the correctness of financial statements, and  assessing how economically, effectively and efficiently the funds are spent)19.  From inputs to outcomes  The link between elements of the strategies and the explanation of how they support strategic  outcomes is often difficult to establish without ambiguity. For instance, it is often challenging to assess  what would have been the cyber security situation of the country if no action had been taken or in the  case of different interventions. Similarly, even if the outcomes (e.g., increased trust in technology use  by the population) are realised, it can be difficult to securely attribute them to the specific actions of  the strategy (such as an awareness raising campaign).  Lack of evaluation culture  NCSS display the same diversity of approaches to incorporating evidence from evaluations. Despite  the presence of good practices and implementation guides, implementation of evidence-based  practices also depends on the institutional setup, administrative traditions and the “soft”  characteristics of political systems, such as the national culture and traditions of transparency and  accountability. Therefore, adapting practices to an evidence-based, evaluation-oriented cyber security  policy framework may put considerable pressure on national administrative bodies, in particular in  countries where evaluation practices have not been embedded in the administrative culture20.  Implementing an evaluation culture in the field of cybersecurity also has to take into account the  national contexts. Cyber security and digital policies in particular, form an area where robust and  15 Luijf et al. (2013).  16 Robinson, N. & Horvath, V. (2013).

An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  10  methodologically rigorous evaluations have not yet become the norm, even in countries with a more  established track record in evaluation21. In addition, the configuration of the cyber security landscape  varies greatly between Member States, which in turn reflects to some extent the constitutional setup  of the country. This can for instance be illustrated by the  establishment of computer emergency  response teams (CERTs)  in Europe. CERTs’ presence, number and functions vary greatly between the  Member States, according to a more or less centralised institutional system and assumptions about  the role the new teams are supposed to play in implementing a secure cyberspace.  Evaluation in cyber security policy guidelines  ENISA’s interest in facilitating evaluation and supporting strategic programming for NCSS fits into a  larger picture of encouraging member states and EU institutions to incorporate evidence-based  approaches in their cyber security strategies. In the European Union, these strategies are included in  the “Digital Agenda for Europe” (DAE) and the proposal for a NIS Directive22, which also links the  purpose of the NCSS to the wider objectives of promoting an inclusive and secure digital society aimed  to foster economic growth. Member States monitor the progress of cyber security in compliance with  the relevant actions and submit monitoring reports on an annual basis. Based on these reports the  European Commission (EC) compares the performance of Member States against the areas for action  and objectives set up in the DAE.  The EU Cyber Security Strategy itself stresses the importance of establishing an “evidence-based risk  assessment and management culture” within the cyber security community in the EU and the  involvement of stakeholders in all its areas.  The most specific guidance on evaluation strategies in NCSS comes from ENISA’s good practice guide  on formulating strategies 23 . The strategy lifecycle model is illustrated in 1 below. As the figure  indicates, the evaluation activities refer to both one-off evaluations and on-going/periodical  evaluation.  Figure 1 Lifecycle of a national cybersecurity strategy (Source: ENISA, 2012)  21 Leeuw, F.L., & Leeuw, B. (2012).  22 http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_directive_en.pdf  23  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/national-cyber-security-strategies- an-implementation-guide  http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_directive_en.pdf  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  11  In recent years a number of international organisations emphasised the importance of evaluation in  cyber security policymaking, such as the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) in its  guidelines on implementing cyber security strategies24. The ITU guidance emphasises the importance  of SMART objective-setting, the definition of timelines and the adoption of a review mechanism for  the framework itself. It also offers a long list of suggested KPIs based on international standards and  network and information security indicators or the NATO NCSS framework manual25. In the NATO  guidance document, evaluation is presented as an instrument to progressively incorporate learning  from previous experiences into the policy framework in the light of technological and social change,  without weighing down the systems and processes.  Similarly,  the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) analysis of NCSS  published in the past five years has found that these strategies share a number of characteristics26.  Shared aspects (which could be relevant for evaluation initiatives) include multidisciplinarity, a view  encompassing the entirety of society, and a trend towards sharing fundamental assumptions, such as  those that cyber threats are increasing and that ICTs are essential for social development.  Interestingly, a call for rigorous evaluation processes, risk assessments and data-based planning was  made by stakeholders from the communications industry in the consultation process underpinning  the research for the report27.  24 Wamala, Frederick.

An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  12  3 Mapping cyber security strategies to evaluation objectives  As pointed out in the previous chapter, incorporating evaluation in the design and implementation of  NCSS can offer significant opportunities for realising  the objectives of the strategy. In this chapter, we  will survey the current state of evaluation-related aspects in a series of cyber security strategies in  Europe and beyond. Moreover, we will look at the contextual factors that can influence the way in  which strategies are set up and implemented. This aspect is particularly relevant for the EU due to  differences in the institutional setup and administrative cultures of the Member States; it is not  optimal to aim at identifying a one-size-fits-all approach to good practices in incorporating evaluation  in NCSS. Rather, the evidence-based approaches should be considered according to the particular  context of the country. Therefore, the evaluation framework that the present study is supporting will  adopt a model that is flexible enough to accomodate these differences.  3.1  Overview of the mapping exercise  One of the goals of the present study is to analyse the approaches taken by European cyber security  strategies, with a view towards a NCSS evaluation framework. The first step of the review has been to  identify the elements that can be used as part of an evaluation framework based on logic modelling  and programme theory. These include Objectives (and focal areas of action), Inputs, Activities,  Outputs,Outcomes and Impacts28.  A review of 18 EU strategies included in the exercise has identified and extracted elements that  correspond to each of these categories in the documents. Furthermore, some categories that relate  to the specific purpose of the study in assisting Member States in updating, implementing or drafting  a strategy, have been added. These summarise provisions related to stakeholder involvement and the  review processes.  For the purposes of visual simplification, the maps included do not aim to illustrate the entirety of the  elements included in the strategies, but rather to illustrate the multiplicity of approaches across the  EU. In the remainder of this section we present a short summary of the analysis based on the  mapping29.  The mapping exercise doesn’t aim to compare the countries to a benchmark; rather, to explore the  starting point for Member States in implementing and/or enhancing the evaluation aspects of their  strategies. Where evaluation exists, it is often limited to spending reviews, although some countries  are attempting to approach the effectiveness of expenditure through cost-benefit analysis. From the  results of the mapping presented below it emerges that an internal intervention logic is not  immediately clear from NCSS and it would have to be reconstructed for the evaluation purpose.  Overall, our review has found that most NCSS articulate objectives and outcomes in broad  socioeconomic terms. Action areas, available and projected resources and the processes that need to  be put into place while implementing the strategy are often not clearly defined. Outputs are often  easier to identify in the strategies; however, their relationship to the objectives is often not clearly  28 Summary of the terms (see e.g. Kellogg Foundation (2009): The objectives of a program relate to the short and long term goals of the  strategy which will usually be met by targeted actions and processes. Inputs are the resources needed to operate the program (including  human resources, financial resources but also others such as facilities and equipment). Activities are the actions or clusters of actions that  are needed to implement the program. Outputs are the direct product of programme activities and are typically tangible and quantifiable.  Outcomes are the intended and unintended results that are linked to programme objectives. They answer the question “What happened as  a result of the programme?” Typically, they can be categorised into short-medium and longer term outcomes.  Impacts are the fundamental  direct and indirect effects of programme activities (on a 7-10 year period) on the wider environment. These include socioeconomic, financial  and political effects.  29 Please note, references to the countries in this chapter always refer to the cybersecurity strategy of the country, which can be found in  the References section of the present report.  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  13  defined. Although these aspects may be captured in implementation guides, the programmatic  approach and agenda-setting that is often the goal of the adoption of the NCSS could be better  supported by clearly articulated lines of casuality and intervention logic.  Objectives  The objectives of any NCSS will relate to the short and long term goals of the strategy which will usually  be met by targeted actions and processes. While they may be related to the overall outcomes they  are usually be more focused and come about as a direct result of an action. However, some objectives  as set out in the NCSS are rather generic by stating that a nation can secure their vital functions against  cyber threats.  Figure 2 Examples of objectives in NCSS in the EU  The objectives as mapped are:   Establish and implement legislative framework;   Establish and clarify roles in collaboration between the public and private sector;   Invest in ICT and innovation for cybersecurity and privacy;   Protection and efficient functioning of critical information infrastructure;   Sustainability: shape an open, stable an secure cyberspace;   Citizens’ perception of sufficient data protection ;   Protect digital national information resources;   Education and training;   International leadership position;   Secure vital national functions and interests against cyber threats and attacks;   Preparedness, resilience and adequate response to cyberthreats and attacks;   Promote economy reliant on digitalized industry;  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  14   Awareness raising;   Tackle cybercrime;   Endorse and respect certain rules of behaviours in the digital arena consistent with national  values;   Safe use of information and communication in cyberdomain by citizens, business and  authorities;   Secure and safe place to do business;   Quality of IT and communication products and security standards   Secure cyber space with respect to fundamental rights and values  While not always the case, many objectives can be measured by defining success indicators and are  usually complemented by subsequent projected actions. As illustrated in the map, some of these  objectives are shared by a large number of countries (e.g. capability building, the revision of legal  frameworks or international cooperation), while others, such as striking a balance between human  rights and cybersecurity in legislation, are particular to the Member State. Poland, for instance, wishes  to increase the level of security within its ICT infrastructure which could be achieved through running  risk assessments and enabling the security of government internet portals. A number of other  objectives relate to tackling cyber crime (Netherlands, UK), strengthening or protecting critical  infrastructure (France, Romania, Belgium and others), building up a skills base in ICT or e-skills (UK,  Netherlands, and others) and enhancing safety standards (Hungary). Some NCSS mention defence  objectives by sharing their desire to become a world power in the area of cyber defence (France)30.  Specific objectives  Programme-level objectives, which tend to be defined at a high level, are often broken down into focal  areas of action. The distinction between the objectives and the areas of action serves as an  opportunity  to present the transversal areas of government and stakeholder activity that need to be  coordinated to realise the outputs and outcomes of the strategy. For instance, an objective of  international leadership in cyber security markets needs action to be taken at the level of the  legislative framework as well as in interactions with the stakeholders. The presentation of specific  objectives can support the theory of change and these could serve as a clear vehicle to connect broad  objectives with individual actions.  The areas are various: published EU strategies tend to frame these in a broader sense and encompass  socioeconomic areas (such as training and promoting a business environment) and put emphasis on  international cooperation. Overall, from the mapping it appears that the activity areas show similarity  across EU Member States. Some of these, such as critical infrastructure protection or risk assessments  occur in a large number of Member States, while others, such as standardisation or capability building  in the private sector are more rare.  In a number of the reviewed strategies these areas of action reflect transversal areas where action  needs to be taken to reach the objectives (e.g., in the case of Austria or France). In some cases, the  areas of action and the objectives of the strategy are not separated (Lithuania). Finland, for instance  lists a set of areas that are linked to the implementation process of the strategy i.e. putting into place  a review structure for the strategy and defining the division of tasks across stakeholders, and others  that are more outcome-related, i.e. improve the resilience of all societal actors.  In a nutshel, the main action points are:   Develop standards and norms, legislation;  30 In other Member States military cyberdefence objectives are covered in separate strategic documents which were outside the scope of  the present work.  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  15   Enhance strategic collaboration between autorities, business and academicia;   Invest on international cooperation;   Protect critical information infrastructure;   Create a culture of security: inform, educate and raise awareness;   Research, development and innovation;   Security of services delivered in cyberspace;   Support competence and capabilities building in involved actors;   Counter national and international criminal activities;   Perform threat tracking, risk assessment and response.  Figure 3 Examples of specific objectives indicated in EU NCSS  Inputs  Inputs indicate the resources that are made available for the implementation of the NCSS at both  strategy and programme level, originated from the specific objectives of the NCSS. These include  financial, human and relational resources, among others. Only some of the NCSS reviewed for this  study listed financial resources among the inputs (examples include the UK, or the projected budgets  included in the Slovak strategy). Based on the interviews, it appears as though, at least in a few  European Member States, there is not a central funding scheme for the implementation of the  strategy. The budget for implementation is part of a departmental or institutional budget. Another  approach would be to introduce a national separate budget line for the NCSS, once drafting of the  strategy is complete.  Acknowledging the need for a dedicated cyber security budget line within  budgets could be an important instrument of supporting cyber security policy actions. This view is  indirectly supported by the perspective that financial support for the implementation is quite weak  since it relies on existing departmental budgets, as observed by another interviewee.  Other often-cited resources include cyber security tools (such as information security tools for the  systems of public administrations), educational resources and incentives (such as tax breaks or  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  16  procurement rules) for producing safe systems. Several of the documents concentrate on leveraging  legal resources to pursue the objectives of the strategy and align it to European and international good  practice. Standards are also an important tool in promoting secure practices. In many cases, outputs  and inputs interact in a circular manner (the outputs of one action serve as inputs to realising  subsequent actions). This is the case for instance of the resources involved in establishing new centres  that later exercise function in Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) or fight against  cybercrime (Luxembourg, Finland). Planned evaluation frameworks will need to find a way to capture  this circularity.  Figure 4 Examples of input indicators in EU NCSS  The input indicators:   Legislative measures;   Increasing law enforcement and judiciary capabilities;   Participation in international and regional cooperation;   Establish/improve processes and coordinating structures;   Tools and organisational components;   Support research and development;   Introduce CS in curicula of education system;   Feasbility study on separate public and private vital network;   Incentives and funding for initiatives supporting secure systems;   Guidelines and internal information on information security.  Activities  Activities are the core interventions through which the outputs and outcomes of the project are  pursued. It is fundamental that they are defined in a way that encompasses all inputs and the  projected outcomes. At the national level the activities are often described and periodically updated  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  17  through the implementation plans of the national strategies, which in turn are usually not published.  The country’s legislative framework provides for many of the activities (e.g. those involved in creating  and revising new legislation). In some cases, such as the UK, where centralised funding is available,  central government bodies are more heavily involved in defining the activities. However, in countries  with more decentralised systems and where cyber security activities are financed out of the standing  budget lines of the entities involved, such as the Netherlands, activities are sometimes designed by  the departments themselves.  Capacity building, legislative reviews and assessments of risks and threats are examples of procedural  activity which many strategies incorporate (e.g. Spain and the Netherlands). Furthermore, awareness- raising activities are mentioned by all reviewed strategies. Where available, the activities rarely cover  all objectives specified in the strategy. Overall, activities are not discussed in detail in the strategies to  be identifiable and allow mapping.  Outputs  Outputs are the direct results of programme activities. These are usually linked to key performance  indicators as they are relatively easy to measure quantitatively and qualitatively, and can be audited  to ensure sound financial management of implementation activities; individual policy units have  greater control over outputs or activities than outcomes or impacts. Therefore, outputs form the  backbone of separate implementation reports linked to cyber security frameworks and, as a result,  they are covered in the main body of the national strategy to a limited extent. Where mentioned, they  tend to not be linked to the specific areas of action and scattered throughout the document. Examples  of outputs include implementation plans (Lithuania, Slovakia), the legislative frameworks foreseen by  the strategy (Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary), the units or task forces that are supposed to be  established and the products of the periodic review processes (Slovakia and UK).  Figure 5 Examples of outputs in EU NCSS  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  18  Usual outputs:   Annual reports;   Minimum cybersecurity standards;   Improved regulatory frameworks;   Improved capabilities (processes, tools and coordinating structures);   Actions and emergency response plans;   International cooperation;   Support research and development (actual investment);   people: professional training and self-education tools for citizens;   public private partnership;   capabilities to counter cybercrime;   warning and reposting systems;   Civil and human right in cybersecurity;   Training and material supplied by security companies to individual business.  Evaluation planning needs to ensure that outputs are linked to outcomes and long-term impact of the  programme. Moreover, as several outputs also serve as inputs to subsequent stages of  implementation, these relationships need to be reflected in evaluation frameworks.  Outcomes and impacts  Outcomes reflect the short and medium-term results of the programme, while impacts represent the  longer term (e.g. 10+ years) results, which are also more broadly defined and take place at the social  level. They are usually situated in context with the objectives and the areas of action: for instance,  short and medium-term outcomes are incremental changes in resilience and collaboration which  directly flow from the activities envisaged in the strategy.  Impacts are long-term goals relating to the  security of cyberspace as a result of the outcomes realised by the programme in the short- and  medium-term.  Although this is an important distinction between the types of results that a  programme can generate, NCSS reviewed for this study did not distinguish between foreseen  outcomes and impacts. Therefore, Figure 6 lists outcomes and impacts together.  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  19  Figure 6 Examples of outcomes in EU NCSS  There are varying projected outcomes and impacts both among the NCSS and within them, the most  common of which is to create a safe or secure online environment (France, Romania, Hungary,  Belgium and UK). Some NCSS envisage outcomes in wider terms. For example, Estonia wishes to  reduce cyberspace vulnerabilities within the nation while the Netherlands expects the Dutch society  to understand the safe utilisation of cyberspace as a result of awareness raising on cyber security risks.  This study also uncovered a number of desired outcomes relating to the protection of critical  infrastructures (Italy), helping businesses to continue their work (UK), preserving their national  security (UK, Austria, Romania), protecting individual rights (Czech Republic) and enabling  international cooperation (Belgium and Italy).  Since many of these outcomes are defined in complex socioeconomic terms, their measurement can  be challenging. However, it is possible to quantify some of the outcomes in terms of a KPI, and set up  appropriate measurement methods through the European or national statistics offices. Examples of  such indicators are: surveying public trust in online transactions and the level of internationalisation  of web commerce. Several such indicators are already monitored at the EU level, allowing a broad  grasp of the quality of cyber security, despite the fact that there are methodological limitations to the  establishment of cause-consequence relationships between digital strategies and this kind of society- level outcome31. Other potential measures (such as the number of breaches and attacks taking place  in the country) are often much more challenging to efficiently measure and frame as an outcome of  national-level cyber programmes32.  31 See e.g., Eurobarometer. (2013). Special report on Cybersecurity, Eurobarometer 404.  32 See e.g., Robinson and Horvath. (2013).  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  20  Evaluation processes  Almost all NCSS reviewed within the scope of the study include provisions on a review and evaluation  process for the document (exceptions include e.g., Hungary and Spain). In Finland, ensuring a review  and evaluation of the strategy is one of the ten strategic areas of action. In other strategies (UK,  Germany, France) the evaluation also serves the purpose of keeping the legislative framework up-to- date with regards to recent developments in the technology landscape. In several strategies, the  frequency of the evaluation cycle is established at a yearly (Lithuania, Slovakia, Netherlands) or  biannual (Austria) frequency. In all NCSS, however, the details of the evaluation process are included  in a separate act or in the implementation plan. Even where the review processes are not specified in  the NCSS, the delegated acts and actions foreseen by them are subject to the scrutiny of public audit  bodies, depending on the institutional setup of the country. In other strategies the actors involved are  also specified (Austria, Estonia, Germany). The review mechanisms that are discussed cover both the  programme-level evaluations (i.e. a review on the process of realising the actions foreseen by the  framework) and effective reviews on reaching the proposed objectives and outcomes of the strategy.  Furthermore, they also extend to reviews at the level of individual projects under the cyber security  framework. In Italy, for instance, education and on-the-job cyber security training programmes, two  of the action areas of the strategy, are specifically mentioned as being subject to review.  Figure 7 Examples of evaluation processes in EU NCSS  Some evaluation approaches:   Regular progress reports;   Cyber Security Council or Security Committee assesses the implementation and progress of  specified objectives;   Participating institutions provide an update;  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  21   Presidency of the council of ministers drafts a text on the activities in relation to cyberspace  protection (annexed to annual report to the parliament on national security strategy and  policies);   Promote the use of questionnaires among stakeholders to understand the training needs;   Regular evaluation of security policies;   Regular review;   Specific measures to evaluate the effectiveness of projects;   Testing the efficiency of processes designed to deal with security risks.  Overall, the description of the evaluation process tends to prioritised in the NCSS. In addition,  documents describing the methodologies that are applied to evaluation are often not accessible to  the public. As a consequence, the approach taken to define evaluation benchmarks and criteria is  difficult to gauge from a review of the strategy itself.  With respect to the entity responsible for the evaluation, the guidelines provided by ENISA with  regards to carrying out an evaluation of an NCSS prescribe the identification of an independent entity  to ensure segregation of duties. In certain Member States, a National Cyber Security Council is  responsible for the evaluation of the implementation of the strategy. In other Member States, the  government auditing body is responsible for the evaluation.  Either way, this is an important indication  that the entity responsible for the evaluation is independent of the entity responsible of the execution  of the strategy in order to guarantee an impartial evaluation.  3.1.7.1 Computer Emergency Response Teams - CERTs  In the evaluation process in the majority of the cases CERTs play a vital role. CERTs, due to their critical  placement with respect to incident response, can provide unique input about cyber security progress.  In one Member State, for example, the monitoring of KPIs depends on the National CERT since the  team is responsible for measuring information security. A similar structure is available in the  Netherlands, where the National Cyber Security Centre, which includes the CERT capacity for the  Dutch government, leads the Cyber Security Assessment, which is published several times per year.  CERTs have overview on a number of aspects which can feed into KPIs, such as number of advisories  about vulnerabilities, as well as potential malware infections and developments, and, as previously  mentioned, cyber security incidents. Particularly, the latter could be an indicator that CERTs could  contribute to measure the level of information security across various years. This is, however, subject  to a number of other influential variables, such as a potential increase in sophistication due to the  introduction of breach notification obligations across different sectors.  An important issue that must be taken into account when considering the involvement of CERTs in the  evaluation process is the sharp contrast between their usual informal working practices, which rely on  a trust model among an informal network of contacts and the professionalisation and formalisation  of the cyber security landscape. The right balance should maintain the benefits of the informal manner  of working in CERTs. This is particularly important as the landscape evolved and CERTs became part of  a National Cyber Security Centre, as occurred in, for example, the Netherlands. One interviewee noted  how the questions related to CERTs should also focus on National Cyber Security Centres. This is  probably due to the close connection between the roles of National Cyber Security Centres and CERTs.  3.1.7.2 Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP)  Critical infrastructure protection deserves special attention when discussing cyber security in general  as well as government strategies. This is due to two factors. First, critical infrastructure concerns the  protection of vital services for society to function and, as such, receives a higher priority and often  more stringent security requirements due to their sensitive or delicate nature. Therefore, the mapping  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  22  and identifying of services  to be part of CIP is essential. One Member State interviewed used a variety  of indicators, including legal definitions, but also the potential impact of an interruption measured  through how many people would be affected within a given timeframe, including a potential number  of casualties in the event that services became unavailabe. These metrics assisted in the mapping and  idenfitication of vital services.  The second factor concerns the lack of direct government control in the majority of Member States  over the critical infrastructure sector, since most critical infrastructure are in the hands of private  actors. In one Member State, CIP was dealt with in a separate document, which focused more on crisis  management. In other Member States, CIP was a key area of action or a key objective included in the  strategy. For one Member State, the separate department responsible for CIP provided a yearly report  on the progress made in the area. As such, CIP may and can be hosted elsewhere in the governmental  landscape but still maintains a connection to cyber security evaluation.  3.1.7.3 National regulatory authorities  Even though not all the national regulatory authorities (NRA) have a mandate on cyber security, their  role remains important in the improvement of resilience at the national level. Starting with the  implementation of incident reporting in the telecoms sector (Article 13a of the Telecoms Act33) or the  data breach notification (Article 4 of the Privacy Directive34), the NRAs are becoming the national hub  of information on cyber incidents. In the proposed NIS Directive35, in which the incident reporting  provision would apply to the critical sectors (energy, water, transport, health, finance etc), the NRAs  have again an important role. It is evident that their responsibilities will increase turning them into an  important actor also in the evaluation of the national strategy as they will have all indications to  measure the level of resilience and cyber security in the different sectors in a national level.  3.2 Stakeholder involvement  Given the borderless nature of cyberspace, all that use it are stakeholders by default. Some NCSS call  for participation of the private sector on a taskforce (Netherlands, SMEs in Germany), the  establishment of working groups for sectorial issues (Spain, Czech Republic) or public-private  partnerships36 (Italy). A couple of interviewees noted how stakeholders also play a key role in the  review process, especially during consultation sessions. For others, the private sector receives a more  prominent role due to external developments such as the proposed NIS Directive. Since the NIS  Directive is perceived to have a significant impact on the cyber security landscape, the public sector is  presently involved in an ongoing public discussion on the Directive. As a result, private sector  stakeholders are presently very involved on a practical level. Once roles and approaches are defined  it is then key to determine the directional nature of ensuring stakeholder involvement: do  stakeholders have almost equal contribution to defining actions (horizontal structure) or is one  stakeholder more authoritative than the other (top-down structure)?  Finland, for example, follows a top-down approach whereby the state outlines roles and approaches  applicable to different groups operating within society. The UK appears to have a more horizontal  structure in which it allows for the private sector to seek business-driven solutions and Slovakia calls  on the private sector to contribute financial resources. Each case utilises the public-private partnership  in different ways. In the UK and Slovakia, the private sector contributes substantial resources  33 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting  34 http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/  35 http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_directive_en.pdf  36 Public private partnerships or PPPs are important scheme for information sharing (like ISACs etc) ENISA has been working on the topics  offering an overview of the EU PPPs currently developed http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/public-private- partnership/national-public-private-partnerships-ppps (to be updated in 2014)  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/ http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_directive_en.pdf http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/public-private-partnership/national-public-private-partnerships-ppps http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/public-private-partnership/national-public-private-partnerships-ppps  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  23  (expertise, use of its infrastructure, finance) and the Finnish private sector takes its lead from the  state.  The added value of the development of a national strategy has been often found by interviewees to  include externalities such as the potential of the framework created to encourage dialogue between  levels of government and different stakeholders. For instance, the cooperation between levels of  government can take the form of periodical reports to Parliament by the organisation responsible for  overseeing the implementation of the strategy, on a yearly or biannual basis (UK, Austria). Such  network-building processes are further reinforced by the multidisciplinary nature of cyber security,  central funding where applicable and the consequent need for government departments and  stakeholder organisations to act in a coordinated manner. This is an aspect that, while often  contributing to the setup of policymaking processes, is frequently not captured in the evaluation of  the strategy. Review mechanisms must be tailored specifically to each case in both the evaluation of  stakeholders and involving stakeholders, ensuring the highest level of transparency. According to the  findings of a preliminary scoping study conducted for the present study, the value of stakeholder  involvement is often absent from evaluations.  Figure 8 Examples of stakeholder involvement mechanisms in EU NCSS  Several NCSS which discuss mechanisms for the review or evaluation concentrate on practices  involving releasing reports (Estonia, Netherlands, Austria, Lithuania and Slovakia). However not all of  these include a clear definition of their measures for success or how they are to obtain the information  required to successfully evaluate stakeholders. Focus groups (working groups, taskforces, etc.)  envisaged under the strategy would guarantee a certain level of evaluation of self-examination, yet it  is unclear as to how these will be operated.  In collaborating with the government or competent authority for the implementation of a cyber  security strategy, stakeholders are investing in their interests (commercial, personal, data related,  etc.). It is important that stakeholders understand their responsibilities and what is required of them.  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  24  The role of each stakeholder differs depending on their capacities and their resources. For example,  Slovakia expects the private sector to fund some activities within the paradigm of cyber security and  the UK looks to business driven solutions to the cyber security question. The Italian state assumes  responsibility as one of the key stakeholders but invites the private sector to collaborate as they also  have a lot to gain from a secure cyberspace. The majority of other NCSS rely on the public and private  sector and individuals to work on implementing some activities within their strategies while other  countries, such as Japan, call more specifically on those controlling critical infrastructure to play a part  in securing their interests. Individuals, for their part, are expected to become aware of threats and  vulnerabilities across the board and responsibility can then fall to the government to conduct  awareness raising campaigns and promote educational programmes.

Table 2 Examples of stakeholder involvement in NCSS in the EU  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  25  4 Evaluation Framework for NCSS  As earlier chapters have shown, the approach taken to the evaluation of NCSS differs largely among  European Member States. From several interviews it also transpired that the policy departments that  are responsible for overseeing the implementation of the programme are often not utilising  systematic program-level evaluation frameworks. This part of the deliverable presents elements of a  framework for national cyber security strategies, describing three tools that could help Member States  enhance their programme-level evaluation work37. The framework has been designed drawing on the  insights gained through the systematic review of existing cyber security strategies, interviews with  Member States, feedback from Member States on the draft logic model, and academic and grey  literature on policy evaluation. It also draws on the principles listed in Chapter 3 of the 2012 ENISA  guide on cyber security38.  The proposed evaluation framework consists of the following elements:  a) A blueprint logic model presenting conceptual building blocks and a structure;  b) A list of possible key performance indicators (KPIs);  While the present chapter offers a brief overview on the suggested tools, it is by no means a  comprehensive guide to their implementation. Annex B offers further resources for policymakers  wishing to know more about the details of these approaches and detailed advice on applying them. In  this section we provide a short summary of the methodologies included in the evaluation framework  and the rationale behind their inclusion. Depending on the legal obligations and review practices  which are currently in place in the individual Member States, the policymakers responsible for the  NCSS may benefit from drawing on some or all of these tools in planning and understanding the impact  of their activities.  4.1 Logic Modelling  Logic modelling is an evaluation tool which is useful to deploy in order to understand the logic of the  NCSS and its implementation. In brief, Logic Modelling permits the mapping of all the different  ingredients of the initiative. Given the complexity of cross organisational strategies like NCSS, a degree  of simplification is necessary to apply in order to show the connections between the different  elements. A Logic Model associated with a programme must be kept updated to ensure that it is  relevant to the programme as time progresses. Reference information on Logic Modelling can be  found in annex B.  Based on the review of the national strategies as well as the literature and an internal working session,  we have identified the elements that are present in the reviewed strategies and the policy and  academic literature. Subsequently, we mapped these components out in a comprehensive logic model  that reflects the architecture of the EU Cyber Security Strategy. The following figures illustrate the  outcomes of this exercise. These models illustrate the underlying logic behind recurring components  of national cyber security strategies, even though their own intervention logic may not be made  explicit in the individual documents.  37 While below we present a compendium of tools, a complete evaluation framework would have to rely on a conceptual framework that  defines how these tools are applied in the national context and how the results of these exercises are interpreted.  38 ENISA. (2012b).  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  26  Figure 9 Logic model elements from the review I.  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  27  Figure 10 Logic model elements from the review II.  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  28  The blueprint logic model illustrates the building blocks that can be used to map the “logic” behind  the actions taken and how these support the goals of the NCSS. This tool can be used to detect and  summarise the relationship between the inputs, processes, outputs and outcomes involved in the  strategy. The streams of activity in the blueprint logic model have been defined in a manner that  allows Member States to align the articulation of their strategy to the overall goals of the European  Cybersecurity Strategy. However, national contexts vary greatly across Member States. Therefore, the  structure contains only suggestions for potential elements and clusters to take into account without  prescribing in detail what these areas of activity should contain and what kind of relationship should  persist between the individual elements. These elements in more detail:  Developping cyber defence policies and capabilities  The activities are based on the EU strategic guidance and/or NATO strategic guidance (and other policy  documents that give guidelines on cyber defence) and include:   Participation in EU cyber defence initiatives   Capability building   Technology development  The outcome would be to have improved cyber defence capabilities, in mid term to have improved  resilience through cooperation and new assets against cyber attacks and in long term to have the level  of cyber attack protection higly increased.  Achieving cyber resilience: developing capabilities and cooperating efficiently within public and  private sector  The inputs are the feedback provided by the different stakeholders, CERTs, National Security (or cyber  security) agencies, NRAs etc. From the public sector the information received depends on the  coordination structures, on the organisational structures and on the intra-government.The specific  activities include:   Perform risk and threat analysis in national level   Participating in national and international cyber exercises   Invest time on mutual learning activities (trainings, workshops)   Enhance community building  The results should be to facilitate cooperation in CERT activities and enhance good security practices  between authorities, to improve capabilities and tools and to eliminate discruption of service  availability. In the mid term the confidentiality, availability and integrity of electronic and information  services should be ensured; and in the long term the improved conditions and awareness result in  increased resilience against threats and attacks. In parallel, increased awareness results in safer online  practices and trust in online services including the digital market and more good practice on policy  making in the cyber security domain.  Reducing cyber crime  The input to achieve this goal should include the EU and national cybercrime legal frameworks existing  already. The specific activities would be to identify the needs and gaps in law enforcement agencies  (LEAs), to update the national technical assets, to develop and use best practice guides, to create and  invest in centers of excellence and to establish collaboration mechanisms with national and  international organisations. The immediate results would be a list of the state of the art technical  assets of a national range, a registry of best practices and the creation of centers of excellence and  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  29  cooperation with the private sector and academia. In international collaboration aspect more  specifically the results should be:   To enhance the capabilities of dealing with cross border incidents (related to cybercrime);   To reduce barriers in forensics investigations (multi jurisdictional issues that are difficult to  overcome);   To gain access to state of the art tools.  Develop the industrial and technological resources for cybersecurity  In order to develop industrial and technological recources on cyber security the country should invest  from a finance and resources perspective; and put effort on R&D projects and demand-side  procurement. The immediate goals would be to develop industry related standards (of national range)  and to diffuse the results of the research projects in the market. In a long term perspective this will  provide grounds for the creation of competitive European products (and support the EU market on  secure solutions) and will introduce them to the international market  secure products.  Secure critical information infrastructure  On the CIIP perspective by having as input the identification of critical infrastructures and  vulnerabilities (a ‘must do’ in all countries at national and regional level), the identification of critical  assets and their interdependencies, some very useful results would emerge:   Risk registry ands risk assessment results;   Risk management plans and business continuity plans;   List of identified CIIs and their interdependencies;   Trusted information sharing mechanisms (ISACs, PPPs).  In a long term vision this would result to more resilient CIIs (faster and more efficient response  mechanisms) and into better cooperation between actors.  4.2 Key Performance Indicators  Key performance indicators (KPIs) are important criteria which may be selected to measure  performance or progress of a policy initiative such as NCSS. On the other hand, output indicators39  measure mostly the quantity of goods and services produced after a plan was followed; in this study,  we focus more on the qualitative criteria, which is why we focus on key performance indicators. Key  performance indicator can also be quantitative, but our focus is more on the long term outlook, so the  qualitative measures. Defining key performance indicators at the design phase of an NCSS allows  policymakers to track progress towards the objectives of the strategy during its implementation. They  can also be used in evaluation and supporting the revision of objectives during the lifecycle of the  program.  KPIs can be mapped for the planning and evaluation process using a matrix of characteristics.  However, it might be challenging to identify KPIs for NCSS given the difficulties of obtaining data and  the fact that outcomes for an NCSS are often highly influenced by other factors. As KPIs are often  difficult to create, we outline some illustrative examples.  The examples of KPIs are categorised per  objective and according to the phase of the process they are addressed (inputs, activities, outputs  etc.). As a result some KPIs are binary because based on the feedback received from the MSs there is  not enough maturity at the moment to go one step further that the typical binary indicators. This  study raises awareness on the specific issue.  39  http://www.hfrp.org/publications-resources/browse-our-publications/indicators-definition-and-use-in-a-results-based-accountability-  system  http://www.hfrp.org/publications-resources/browse-our-publications/indicators-definition-and-use-in-a-results-based-accountability-system http://www.hfrp.org/publications-resources/browse-our-publications/indicators-definition-and-use-in-a-results-based-accountability-system  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  30  The first table presents KPIs on developing capabilities on cyber security; part of this are awareness  raising, training and CERT activities. The collaboration between public and private sector is also  important but KPIs on this topic will be included in the next tables as well, as it is a horizontal aspect  of cyber security. The KPIs are categorized per objective to achieve in the strategy; this way the  evaluation is more focused and results into more concrete actions.  Key objective 1: Developing cyberdefence policy and capabilities  The first objective to be achieved after the implementation of a national strategy is the development  of cyberdefence policy and capabilities.  Key Performance Indicator Evidence (what we should measure)  Existence of a strategic national plan on cyber  defence (doctrine, concepts, stakeholders involved,  specific responsibilities)  Existence and status of such a plan, activity reports,  action plan and responsibilities  Degree of participation in EU cyberdefence initiatives  (capability building)  Indication of participation, level of participation  Identification and structure of military CERT (mili  CERT, military policy level)  Capability assessments; Policy documents; internal  operational documents  Existence of training (for required types of  personnel) and level of influence  Capability assessments; Policy documents; internal  operational documents  Interoperability (extent to which CD capabilities  interact with others outside mil area)  Capability assessments; Policy documents; internal  operational documents  Increased resilience through cooperation and new  assets against military cyberattacks (Faster  detection, response and recovery from sophisticated  attacks, Cost efficient development through  collaboration, robust, available and clear  communication channels)  Capability assessments, Incident reports, Activity  reports  Table 3 KPIs on developing cyberdefence policies and capabilities  Key objective 2: Achieving cyber resilience: develop capabilities and efficient cooperation within  public and private sector  The key notion for this objective is the collaboration between sector and the later development of  cyber security capabilities in joint actions. Raising awareness is also part of this key objective. Some  key performance indicators could be:  Key Performance Indicator Evidence (what we should measure)  Setup of CERTs and/or National Security Agencies Existence and mandate of the institutional actors  (mission scope, agencies/ bodies mandate)  Existence or setup of public private partnerships on  cyber security  Identification and structure of those partnerships,  bodies involved and their role, activity reports  Identified risk and threats landscape Risk analysis, threat analysis (conducted by CERTs or  National Security Agencies)  Existence of organised national cyber security  exercises  Activity reports  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  31  Enhanced capabilities: organised trainings for the  public and private sector, mutual learning activities  (workshops and conference).  Activity reports, event title, companies/stakeholders  participated  Awareness raising activities for end-users (material,  campaigns, events)  Material disseminated, campaigns/event organised,  survey on citizens perception  National coordination actions among all actors in  the national cyber security field (National Security  Agencies)  Activity reports, mandates, collaborative activities  Existence of developed  response capabilities (react- recovery plans, early warning systems etc)  protect-detect-react-recover plan, early warning  systems and simulation models, activity report  Increase safety of public IT systems  Vulnerabilities detection (report-CERTs or National  Security Agencies), document the frequency of  software upgrades/patches and make procedures,  adopt security standards for ICT systems.  Table 4 KPIs on achieving cyber resilience  Key objective 3: Reduce cybercrime  In part we provide a set of KPIs to measure the activities to reduce cybercrime first in a national level  and then in international. These KPIs are focused more on the operation of law enforcement agencies  (LEAs) and national security agencies.  Key Performance Indicator Evidence (what we should measure)  National institutional framework for cyber crime  reduction (LEAs, CERTs etc)  Structured and documented framework  Enforcement of LEA (gap analysis, identification of  needs, state of art technical assets, use of best  practices)  Documentation on gaps identified and on mitigation  actions to support LEAs with mandate on cyber crime  reduction, capability assessment, registry of best  practices, pprocedures documentation  Existence of collaboration mechanisms with EC3,  CEPOL, Eurojust , international organisations & other  MS  Activity reports and common actions  National cybercrime cases resolution  Statistics from LEAs on cases of cyber crimes  (investigations solved, prosecutions etc)  International collaboration:   Enhanced abilities in combating cybercrime  across borders   reduced barriers to investigations   access to up-to-date tools   lower cost for combating cybercrimes  Procedures for cross border cooperation between  authorities (LEAs, CERTs etc), statistics of  investigations and resolutions, budgetary reports  Safer cyberspace for all users (users are protected  from cybercrime)  Statistics (Law enforcement agencies, Surveys,  National statistical offices)  Table 5 KPIs on reducing cybercrime  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  32  Key Objective 4: Develop the industrial and technological resources for cybersecurity  The concept of this key objective is tha industry and technological advancements (through academia  etc) would support the level of national cyber security in the market products. Some KPIs to measure  this:  Key Performance Indicator Evidence (what we should measure)  Support standardisation and development of  trustmarks & safety labels  Compliance with security standards, audits and  certification mechanisms in place by the regularoty  authorities, adoption rate of standards and safety  labels  Funding research through EU and national research  programmes  EU databases on research project, Science funding  agencies.

The KPIs that cover them are described below:  Key Performance Indicator Evidence (what we should measure)  Identification of critical information infrastructures  i.e. critical assets, vulnerabilities, dependencies,  risks  List of CIIs (in national level), list of national critical  assets and dependencies, risks and vulnerability  registries (CERTs, governmental agency, National  security authority)  Risk assessment and risk management  prcedures/plans  Division of responsibilities and procedure to be  followed (including frequency of updates)  Setup incident reporting and breach notification  procedures  Description of procedure, roles and responsibilities,  bodies involved, cooperation between countries  Design and implement tools that address market  failures (PPPs, breach disclosure regulations)  Strategic program documents; implementation  guides  Business recovery and continuity plans for critical  infrastructures  Strategic documents, implementation guides, bodies  involved, responsabilites and roles of different  bodies  Successful information sharing and trusted  cooperation between different players  Trusted channels for communication , regular  meetings, engagement of stakeholders  Faster and more efficient response in case of  national level incident (less downtime in case of  attacks/incidents)  Reduction in speed of response; reduction in  uncertainty of response  Transparency and accountability of systems Number and type of  documentation available to the  public, measure people’s awareness  Table 7 KPIs for securing CIIs  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  33  General evaluation objectives  In this section we describe high level evaluation indicators that should also be taken into account when  discussing the overall cyber security level reached by the national strategy and the action plan.

These are not meant as an exhaustive list but rather a selection of issues  which we consider might have the potential to adversely affect the implementation of an evaluation  framework for NCSS.  5.1 Human Capacity  Recruiting the right human resources, skilling and retaining them is critical to any policy  implementation, none more so than in a complex area like cyber security strategies where there is a  high demand for coordination across different organisations. Failing to recruit the right people and to  implement an engagement strategy, alongside any programme, would not bode well for its eventual  success. As evaluation is newly introduced, additional resources that would be dedicated in  monitoring the process of the strategy would be a rare action to take.  5.2 Budgetary support  Adequate budgets, whilst related to the question of human resources (personnel) is distinct in so far  as it provides resources for critical activities such as studies, reports, conferences and workshops that  help to achieve the ultimate impacts of an NCSS as set out in our blueprint. Without budgetary  support, there is a risk that those establishing and maintaining an NCSS and any associated programme  might become side-lined, lose visibility or have their efforts hampered by internal struggles between  administrative departments. A good evaluation (and a adjustment) framework would require an  annually set budget to fulfil all the objectives.  5.3 Communications and engagement  A third potential challenge of an evaluation framework relates to communications and engagement.  Cyber security, like other forms of complex security challenges that characterise the risky, uncertain  world we live in, requires a joined up or “comprehensive” approach. In practice, this means that  government bodies and agencies, previously able to work within clear mandates and boundaries, must  be encouraged to work across their institutional remits, for benefits that might not directly accrue to  their efforts but to society and government as a whole. This is even more the case with the private  sector, which must recognise that in certain domains (e.g., CII) they must better balance security and  business rationales.  5.4 Transparency and public accountability  As NCSS is an example of a public policy intervention, that is using public money to benefit the society  and economy, it is vitally important to engage citizens in an accessible way in relation to the rationale  for the intervention, the expected benefits, levels of spending on the intervention and what practical  steps would be involved (subject of course to specific rules regarding classified Action Plans). Given  the current deficiency in public accountability and low levels of public trust in governments40, being  seen to be accountable for efforts in a complex and intangible domain as cyber security will no doubt  be challenging. In trying to do so, it will be critical to illustrate the rationale for NCSS which might have  budgetary consequences (such as additional spending) and its expected benefits for the average  40  Eurobarometer Standard  79 Spring 2013; Public Opinion in the European Union available at:  http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb79/eb79_first_en.pdf  file:///C:/Users/vhorvath/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.Outlook/215XUR45/Eurobarometer  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  35  citizen. So the evaluation of the strategy should take into account this very delicate matter and express  the final results in a way that invests on this transparency of the government to the citizens.  5.5 Developing a lessons learned culture  As outlined in Chapter 3, part of the benefits of implementing an evaluation framework is being able  to create and sustain a culture of identifying and learning lessons. This is important to create a  continuous positive feedback loop, where mistakes can be identified and resolutions offered and  implemented. This requires a step-change in behaviour, however.   Firstly, it requires encouraging the mind-set of evaluation amongst policy practitioners  charged with designing, implementing and evaluating an NCSS (e.g. so that they ask  themselves the question: “How would I measure the impact of this or that element of our  NCSS?”);   Secondly,  the organisational and human capacity is needed to identify and learn lessons in a  constructive environment and have been embedded into practice.  5.6 Dealing with uncertainty  Finally, a potential pitfall of evaluation of an action plan/strategy which cannot be avoided is  uncertainty and what to do when things do not work out as planned (what if the evaluation results  are not so good as expected). The ‘building block’ approach outlined in this report does not preclude  the possibility that despite the design and implementation of all the elements identified in this report,  cyber-security goals might not necessarily be reached. This is due to the inherent nature of uncertainty  of cyber security, where sudden systemic emergent risks can upset even the most carefully planned  NCSS.  In this case, policy practitioners should be equipped to deal with adverse political and public  reaction (in addition to the usual consequence management, business continuity practices), as well as  having capacities to implement sound crisis management to enable them to  manage risks as and when  they arise. This requires strong capacity for crisis communication skills.  An evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies  November 2014  Page  36  6 Concluding summary  In this report, we have outlined, in the context of the main themes of the 2013 EU Cyber Security  Strategy (namely resilience, tackling cybercrime, national security capabilities, cyber defence, critical  information infrastructures protection and as horizontal themes education and international co- operation) two empirically based methods that can be used to evaluation of an NCSS.  The evaluation  activities we have described can be classified according to whether they apply to the content or to the  processes of the design or implementation of an NCSS.  We have identified that from those NCSS reviewed, there is a somewhat fragmented approach to the  ultimate impacts that a NCSS is expected to provide. To a certain extent this is understandable,  because each country will have its own priorities and issues. Indeed, in cyber security, there is no  policy prescription that fits every situation. However, this inconsistency and fragmented approach  belies a need for the application of broad framework through which NCSS can be evaluated, both in  the practical sense of effectiveness, but also in the broader and more important sense of whether the  extensive investments of time and effort are worthwhile in reaching stated goals.  After a presentation of empirical evidence, this report offered a number of suggestions and advice in  the form of practical tools to assist policy practitioners in evaluating NCSS. The main objective of this  reports is to offer:  A generic framework, classified along the themes of the EU Cyber Security Strategy, for evaluation in  NCSS, and a set of practical advice in the form of a roadmap, covering:  1. A consolidated logic model consistent with the headlines of the EUCSS;  2. Suggested advice on possible key performance indicators (which would allow progress  against the objectives set out in the logic model to be measured).  The roadmap in particular provides practical advice and tips aimed to support the practitioner in  translating the good practice identified from the desk research into their own particular contexts. It is  hoped that this roadmap will be of use across the broadest user base as it aims to be a flexible  pragmatic tool based on principles rather than prescriptive checklists. Finally, in a similar vein, this  report has identified some pitfalls that policy practitioners must be aware of when evaluating the  strategy.  This report completes the ENISA doctrine on the lifecycle of cyber security strategies (together with  the practical guide on development and execution-2012), namely the last steps of evaluation and  adjustment of a cybersecurity strategy. This way it addressed both the countries that are now new in  the field of the cyber security strategy but also the ones that have a certain level of maturity and would  like to enrich it. ENISA offers the complete set of recommendations and tools to the EU Member States  to draft and implement a sustainable and efficient strategy that will indeed increase the level of cyber  security in the country. The next step would be to offer an automated tool to perform this evaluation,  to show different maturity stages and  to combine different criteria in the final result.

    "abstract": "ENISA work on the evaluation of National Cyber Security Strategies (NCSS) addressing to policy experts and government officials who design, implement and evaluate an NCSS policy. It aims to be a flexible and pragmatic tool based on principles rather than prescriptive checklists, in alignment with the provisions of the EU Cyber Security Strategy. The evaluation framework developed by ENISA, consists of a logic model presenting a set of steps and a list of possible key performance indicators (KPIs); illustrating the underlying logic of recurring components of NCSS. The suggested KPIs are mapped to the objectives of the evaluation model, making it easier for stakeholders to choose the most useful according to their priorities. "

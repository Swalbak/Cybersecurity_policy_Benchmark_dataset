While all economic and societal activities today rely  upon information systems and communication networks,  the development of European digital society can only be  sustainably achieved with the establishment of proper  network and information security (NIS) practices, policies,  organizations and capacities.  As the European Network and Information Security  Agency, ENISA has actively contributed to the raising of  awareness of NIS challenges in Europe since it was set  up in 2004, to the development of Member States NIS  capacities and to the reinforcement of the cooperation of  Member States and other NIS stakeholders.  Whereas NIS has been set high in the EU political agenda  notably in the European Cybersecurity Strategy (2013),  the European Cyberdefence Policy Framework (2014) and  in the European Digital Single Market (2015), ENISA will in  the future, more than ever, need to accompany the efforts  of Member States and Union institutions in reinforcing  NIS across Europe. Above all, the recent adoption of the  European directive of the European Parliament and the  Council concerning measures to ensure a high common  level of network and information security, further calls for  enhanced commitment of ENISA in supporting a coherent  approach towards NIS across Europe.  While ENISA should continue its well-established activities  – from the support to the reinforcement of Member  States national capacities to the organization of cyber crisis  exercises – the adoption of the NIS Directive will require  the development of further areas of action in order to  accompany the evolution of NIS in Europe. ENISA will, in  particular, play a key role in: steering the NIS operational  cooperation by actively supporting Member States’ CSIRTs’  cooperation within the future European CSIRT network  between the MS and the Institutions; providing input  and expertise into policy level collaboration between  national competent authorities in the framework of the  Cooperation Group, supporting the reinforcement of  the NIS of Union institutions in strong cooperation with  CERT-EU and with the institutions themselves; ENISA  will furthermore contribute to the reinforcement of NIS  as a driver of the DSM and more generally of economic  growth in Europe, including the development of NIS and  related ICT industries in Europe.  While many Union institutions develop activities related  to cybersecurity (Europol, European Defence, European  External Action Service, Agency, etc.) ENISA aims to be  the key point of reference for analysis and advice on NIS  issues among Union institutions, entities and bodies and  engage with relevant ones, in order to share its experience  and expertise and support them in their activities.  Furthermore, ENISA will support other stakeholders, in  particular the private sector, to engage in Europe’s efforts  to ensure a significant improvement of the state of  cybersecurity in Europe.  This paper provides ENISA’s strategic vision which will  ensure the coherence of its actions in years to come and  significantly enhance its impact.  Copyright ©Shutterstock  In a more practical way, the strategy will  Support ENISA’s Executive Director and MB in the  elaboration and adoption of consistent multiannual and  annual work programmes8. As a consequence, the four  objectives detailed below, will provide long term strategic  objectives to ENISA, to help in prioritizing and focus activities  on a multi-annual and annual basis and will offer a stable  structure for these documents9  Guide ENISA’s management and staff in the  implementation of their activities.  The strategy is established for an indicative period of 5 years  until the end of the current mandate (June 2020)10. Should  the mandate undergo an anticipated revision, or otherwise  beyond this 5 years period, the strategy will be updated,  following a careful evaluation of its implementation. The strategy should be made public on ENISA’s website,  after formal adoption by the MB.  SUMMARY OF THE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES  ENISA’s strategic objectives are derived from the ENISA  regulation, inputs from the Member States and relevant  communities, including private sector. In cooperation and in support to the Member States and the  Union institutions, ENISA will in priority seek to achieve:  # Expertise - Anticipate and support Europe in facing  emerging network and information security challenges,  by collating, analysing and making available information  and expertise on key NIS issues potentially impacting  the EU taking into account the evolutions of the digital  environment.  # Policy  - Promote network and information security as  an EU policy priority, by assisting the European Union  institutions and Member States in developing and  implementing EU policies and law related to NIS.  # Capacity  - Support Europe maintaining state-of- the-art network and information security capacities,  by assisting the Member States and European Union  bodies in reinforcing their NIS capacities.  # Community  - Foster the emerging European network  and information security community, by reinforcing  cooperation at EU level among Member States,  European Union bodies and relevant NIS stakeholders,  including the private sector.  # Enabling  - Reinforce ENISA’s impact, by improving  the management of its resources and engaging more  efficiently with its stakeholders, including Member Sta tes  and Union Institutions, as well as at international level.  CONTEXT  ENISA is the European Union Agency for Network and  Information Security (NIS), established in 2004.  As set out in 2013 in its renewed mandate , ENISA has  been set up “for the purpose of contributing to a high  level of Network and Information Security within the  Union [...] thus contributing to the establishment and  proper functioning of the internal market”1, contributing  to growth and employment in Europe.  The mission of ENISA is to contribute to securing  Europe’s information society by raising “awareness of  network and information security and to develop and  promote a culture, of network and information security in  society for the benefit of citizens, consumers, enterprises  and public sector organizations in the Union”2.  In doing so, ENISA will act “without prejudice to the  competences of the Member States” regarding their  national security3 and in compliance with the right  of initiative of the European Commission. In order to  achieve its mission, several objectives and tasks4 have  been attributed to ENISA, “without prejudice to the  competences of the Member States regarding network  and information security and in any case to activities  concerning public security, defence, national security”5.  In line with these objectives and tasks, the Agency  carries out its operations in accordance with an annual  and multiannual work programme, containing all of its  planned activities, drawn up by the Executive Director of  ENISA and adopted by ENISA’s management board (MB).  ENISA’s approach is strongly impact driven, based on the  involvement of all relevant stakeholder communities. The  Agency also provides the Union institutions, bodies and  agencies (hereinafter: “Union institutions”) and the Member  States with a mechanism allowing them to call upon its ser- vices to support their NIS capability development6, resulting  in a more agile and flexible approach to achieving its mission.  PURPOSE  In the light of its recommendations on NIS strategies7  and with a view to offering a focused and coherent  implementation to its mandate, this document defines  a strategy for ENISA (hereinafter “the strategy”) identifying  long term core priority objectives for the Agency and  presenting them in a structured and concise manner.  8 Annual and multiannual work programmes referred to in the Article 5 §2 of ENISA Regulation (EU) No 526/2013  9 In order to achieve the 5 year strategic objectives laid out in this document, the multiannual work programme will provide prioritized mid-term  operational objectives to be achieved by ENISA within a period of 3 years. Annual concrete activities (outputs) will be identified in the annual work  programmes, according to a recursive approach in order to achieve the mid-term operational objectives and in the long term the strategic objectives. 10 Article 36 of ENISA Regulation (EU) No 526/2013  6 7  INTRODUCTION  1 Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council of 21 May 2013, article 1(1).  2 Article 1(1) of ENISA Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 3 Article 1(2) of ENISA Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 4 Article 2 and 3 of ENISA Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 5 Article 1(2) of ENISA Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 6 Article 14 of ENISA Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 7“An evaluation framework for cybersecurity strategies” (2014), “National cybersecurity strategies: an implementation guide” (2012),  “National cybersecurity strategies: current status of cybersecurity strategies within the European Union”  98  1. #EXPERTISE – ANTICIPATE AND  SUPPORT EUROPE IN FACING  EMERGING NETWORK AND  INFORMATION SECURITY CHALLENGES  ENISA will collate, analyze and make available  information on global cyber issues with a view to  developing insights on issues of high added-value for  the EU. In this analysis, ENISA will cover both existing  as well as new technologies and their integration, such  as smart infrastructures, Internet of Things, Cloud and  Big Data and evaluate their impact on NIS and related  challenges such as NIS aspects of data protection.  To that end, ENISA will bring together Member States  relevant stakeholders, such as industry, providers  of electronic communications networks or services  available to the public, consumer groups, academic  experts in network and information security, and  representatives of national regulatory authorities11  related to NIS in order to discuss and explore NIS  problems and challenges that they have encountered.  By compiling, comparing and evaluating these  experiences alongside publicly available data, ENISA  will help to anticipate future risks and threats and  identify those technologies and services that pose  specific security challenges in particular with regard to  critical infrastructures, businesses at large and citizen’s  private data.  In response to this the agency will develop and  disseminate best practices which can be used to  inform across a number of different horizontal fields  including research and development, innovation,  standardization, IT Security certification and other  relevant industrial practices.  11  Article 12(2) of of ENISA Regulation (EU) No 526/2013  Activity: In order to achieve this objective,  ENISA will collate, analyse and make available  information and expertise on key NIS issues  potentially impacting the EU taking into account  the evolutions of the digital environment.  1110  3. #CAPACITY – SUPPORT EUROPE  IN MAINTAINING STATE-OF-THE-ART  NETWORK AND INFORMATION  SECURITY CAPACITIES  2. #POLICY – PROMOTE NETWORK  AND INFORMATION SECURITY  AS AN EU POLICY PRIORITY  ENISA will support capacity building across the Union  to make national public and private sectors and the  Union institutions’ networks more resilient and secure.  This will involve working closely with Member States  and liaising, in cooperation with them, with various  different stakeholders across the Union to develop skills  and competencies in the field of NIS. ENISA will focus its  effort on the following actors:  Member States: ENISA will support the  development of Member States’ national NIS  capabilities by providing recommendations on  key dimensions of NIS capacity building and will  focus in priority on those highlighted in the NIS  Directive, including on the development and efficient  functioning of National/Governmental CSIRTs and  policy level collaboration between national competent  authorities in the framework of the Cooperation  Group, the development of national strategies, the  establishment of necessary national frameworks to aid  implementation of national incident reporting schemes  and on training to improve skills. ENISA will as well offer,  upon their request, direct to support to single Member  States14. To that end, the Agency will develop proactive  relationships with Governments across the EU.  Private sector: ENISA will support Member States  to engage with private sector on their NIS, encouraging  companies to take a whole-business approach to cyber  threats from the top of the board down.

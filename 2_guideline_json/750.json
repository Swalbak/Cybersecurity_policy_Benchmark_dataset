With so much  commerce now taking place online, websites are critical – making them a prime  target for a cyber attack. Protect your website from cybercriminals with these  three cyber security wins.  Website Wins. Win #1.  Use HTTPS. Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is  used to send encrypted data between a web  browser (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Edge or Safari)  and a website. This encryption provides security  for sensitive information such as passwords  and credit card details, as well as privacy of  the content you visit online.  HTTPS improves your website’s ranking in  Google searches – a reward for being secure.  To check if your website is using HTTPS,  look for ‘https’ at the start of the URL: Correct.  https://www.example.com. Incorrect.  http://www.example.com.  For websites that don’t use HTTPS, many web  browsers now tell users that the website is  “not secure” and will warn them not to enter  any sensitive information.  You can explore and set up HTTPS yourself  via free and automatic options, such as  Let’s Encrypt, or direct your website developer  to our publication Implementing Certificates,  TLS, HTTPS and Opportunistic TLS (available at  cyber.gov.au) and ask them to set up HTTPS  and renew certificates automatically before  they expire.  Win #2.  Secure your website’s  content management systems  and plugins. Ensure that your website’s content management  systems and any plugins are updated regularly  to address security vulnerabilities. If your website  is managed by a third-party or external  provider, contact them to discuss  regular patching and updates.  Quick Wins  |  for your Website2  https://letsencrypt.org/  https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/publications/implementing-certificates-tls-https-and-opportunistic-tls https://www.cyber.gov.au/  Quick Wins for your Website.  Win #3.  Secure access to your website using  multi-factor authentication (MFA).  Ideally, your web hosting provider or content management  system should offer multi-factor authentication (MFA)  to increase your website’s security and protect it from  unauthorised access.  Enable MFA for your website administration accounts and  servers, where possible.  If MFA is not available, use a passphrase to secure website  administration accounts. A passphrase uses four or more  random words as your password, e.g. “crystal onion clay  pretzel”. Passphrases are hard for cybercriminals to guess,  but easy for you to remember. Make sure your  passphrase is unique – do not reuse it elsewhere.  For more information  about MFA and passphrases,  or cyber security advice  for your business,  visit cyber.gov.au.  Securing e-commerce websites.  Any Australian business that accepts card  payments needs to comply with the Payment  Card Industry Data Security Standards  (PCI DSS), regardless of business size.  If your website is an e-commerce website  that accepts card payments, ensure your  business is PCI compliant.  If your e-commerce website uses a payment  gateway provider to process transactions,  ensure they are also PCI compliant.  Meeting these cyber security standards will  help you protect your data and customers’  information from breaches and theft.  For more information visit business.gov.au.

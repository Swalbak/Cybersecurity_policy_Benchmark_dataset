The event was organised by ANSSI (Asociatia Nationala pentru  Securitatea Sistemelor Informatice) and CERT.RO (Centrul national de raspuns la incidente de  securitate cibernetica) at Palace of the Parliament.  Each country was represented at the ECSC final by a team of 10 contestants, comprised of the  winners of the national competitions. Half of the team members are within the range of ages of  14-20 years old and half in the 21-25 range. In total, 300 people (contestants, coaches and  judges) representing 20 EU and EFTA countries (Austria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark,  Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Netherlands,  Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom) competed in the  ECSC final in Bucharest. The participants investigated vulnerabilities in web applications,  binaries and document files, solved crypto puzzles and hacked hardware systems. However,  technical skills are just one part of the whole story. Teamwork and presentation skills were also  evaluated. A significant part of the skillset, which is important for working in an IT security team,  is thus tested. The finalists of ECSC 2019 were the teams from Romania, Italia and Austria.  ENISA is currently hosting different platforms and performing different activities to support the  European Cyber Security Challenge hosting country and the evolution of the project, this  includes among others: ECSC main website, ECSC planning platform, public affairs strategy,  challenges creation, governance framework of the competition, secretariat support, etc…  In order to ensure appropriate and transparent reporting to the Steering Committee, the  following key observations were made by independent third-party observers that have attended  the ECSC planning meetings and the actual event. These observations have been produced  based on the feedback collected from participants, members of the ECSC Jury, members of the  ECSC Steering Committee, and attendees to the event. In addition, these observations reflect  the feedback provided by organisers and participants collected by an online evaluation survey:   Roles and responsibilities were clearly defined and respected during ECSC planning  meetings. The different organisational stakeholders and ECSC Steering Committee  members were documented in an ECSC WhoisWho, which aimed at ensuring  transparency about the individual stakeholders and their role in the competition.   The total reach on social media for the #ECSC2019 campaign from February 1st, 2019  up until October 21st, 2019 is estimated at 1.2 million people and the total amount of  mentions on social media is estimated at 2113.The total amount of interactions on  social media is estimated at 22 240.   The introduction of an independent jury body in the competition was considered a  great achievement for this year edition.   The participating teams have successfully adopted the key messages embedded in the  ECSC Public Affairs Strategy. An increased level of activity by the national teams has  been observed.   The network infrastructure for the platform was reliable and stable. No major issues or  incidents took place with regards to the availability of network infrastructure.  Network  capacity and speed was meeting expectations.

INTRODUCTION  The growing need for IT security professionals is widely acknowledged. According to recent  estimates, is expected that more than 3,5 million cybersecurity professionals will be needed  worldwide by 20211 in order to be able to prevent, react and protect their citizens against cyber  threats. Europe has to make an effort to retain and attract talent to cybersecurity and, at the  same time, create solid and powerful education, entrepreneur and business structures on cyber  security.  To help mitigate this shortage of skills, many countries launched national cyber security  competitions addressed towards students, university graduates or even non-ICT professionals  with a clear aim:  ‘Identify new and young cyber talents and encourage young people to pursue a career in cyber  security.’  The European Cyber Security Challenge (ECSC) https://www.europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/  leverages on these competitions by adding a pan-European layer. Top cyber talents from each  participating country meet to network and collaborate and finally compete against each other.  Contestants are challenged in solving security related tasks from different domains.  In a nutshell, ECSC is the annual European event that brings together young talent from across  Europe to have fun and compete in cyber security. Its main aim is to highlight the importance of the  national competition.  1.1 ECSC BACKGROUND  The project was initiated under the umbrella of the EU Cyber Security Strategy (Feb 2013):  ‘The European Commission will organise, with the support of ENISA, a cybersecurity  Championship in 2014, where university students will compete in proposing NIS solutions.’  As of 2014, ENISA has been supporting the organisation of the ECSC. ENISA is actively  organising the meetings of the governance structures, supporting the development of the  competition rules and games and is part of the ECSC Jury. As of 2016, ENISA is the acting  secretariat of the ESCS Steering Committee.  In the edition of 2018, 200 participants (contestants, coaches and judges) representing 17 EU  and EFTA countries (Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France,  Germany, Greece, Italy, Liechtenstein, Norway, Romania, Spain, Switzerland, and United  Kingdom) competed in the ECSC final at London.  The 2019 edition of the European Cyber Security Challenge took place in the Parliament  building in Bucharest, Romania, from 9th to11th October 2019. For the first time, teams from 20  countries participated at the final (Austria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France,  Germany, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland,  Portugal, Romania, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom).The participants investigated  vulnerabilities in web applications, binaries and document files, solved crypto puzzles and hack  1 https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/08/09/the-cybersecurity-talent-gap-is-an-industry-crisis  ECSC is the  annual European  event that brings  together young  talent from  across Europe to  have fun and  compete in cyber  security.  https://www.europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/ https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/08/09/the-cybersecurity-talent-gap-is-an-industry-crisis  ECSC 2019 ANALYSIS REPORT  December 2019  7  hardware systems. However, technical skills are just one part of the whole story. As time and  resources were limited, teamwork and presentation skills were also evaluated. The finalists of  ECSC 2019 were the teams from Romania, Italy and Austria.  The 2020 edition of the European Cyber Security Challenge will take place Vienna, Austria  between 3rd and 7th November  1.2 ECSC SETUP  Each country is represented at the ECSC final by a team of 10 contestants, comprised by the  winners of the national round. Half of them are within the range of ages of 14-20 years old and  half in the 21-25 range.  Two preparatory pilot phases of ECSC have been held in 2014 (in Austria) and 2015 (in  Switzerland) with attendance by 3 and 6 countries, respectively.  Since 2015, ENISA is lending  its experience and position to coordinate and organise the ECSC effort to reach its full maturity  by 2020.  The activities of the ECSC are supervised by a Steering Committee, composed of  representatives of the attending countries. ENISA facilitates the meetings of this group and  provides strategic guidance. The decision-making processes are described in the ECSC  Charter, which is revised and approved every year by the ECSC Steering Committee.  ENISA is currently hosting different platforms and performing different activities to support the  European Cyber Security Challenge hosting country and the evolution of the project, this  includes among others: the ECSC main website, the ECSC information-sharing platform, the  public affairs strategy, challenges creation, etc…  In addition, ENISA is working closely with the host of each edition, in order to ensure  appropriate and transparent reporting to the Steering Committee.  During the year, two Steering Committee meetings are held prior the execution of the event:   Initial Planning Conference (IPC), held in Bucharest, 6th -7thof March in DG Connect   Main Planning Conference (MPC), held in Bucharest during 20th-21th of June  ENISA organised these preparatory events and was overall responsible for the efficient running  of the project, including meetings minutes and the follow-up of the proposed actions.

ENISA CONTRIBUTION TO  ECSC2019  4.1 STEERING COMMITTEE MANAGEMENT  The activities of the ECSC are supervised by a Steering Committee (SC) composed of  representatives of the attending countries. ENISA facilitates the meetings of this group and  provides strategic guidance. The decision-making processes are described in the ECSC  Charter, which is approved every year.  During the preparation of ECSC 2019, ENISA was responsible for the following activities related  with the management of the Steering Committee:   Platforms maintenance and update   Mail list management   Update and creation of SC related documentation   Organization of the IPC in Brussels   Support the organization of the MPC in Bucharest   Accommodation, execution and follow-up of SC requests   Implementation of changes and suggestions collected using surveys and the feedback  from previous editions   Creation and management of an independent jury   Creation of an internal ‘Who is who’ document to support the jury and teams activities   Realisation of a ‘Comcheck’ prior to the competition   Organization of a Hot wash meeting after the execution of the competition in Bucharest   Feedback collection: Lessons learnt report and surveys to the participants  4.2 JURY MANAGEMENT  The proposal for this year edition was the creation of an independent jury body, instead of the  format of the previous editions of having ‘jury members’ appointed by each participating country.  By Steering Committee decision, the independent jury was composed of 5 members: 3  independent + 2 members by the following organizing countries, Austria and Czech Republic  To guarantee the full transparency and the independency of the selection of Jury members, the  procedure for selecting the jury was the following:   ENISA opened a period to nominate candidates in order to collect as many potential  candidates as possible. ENISA also contributed to the list by providing names from its  stakeholders’ lists.   Creation of a list of candidates: The list is a living document and is and is  updated/refreshed at regular intervals. After the release of each update, there is a  period where any member of the SC has the right to exercise his/her reservations to  any proposed candidate in the list.   If a SC member decides to exercise the right to veto to any of the candidates in the list,  the name will be removed after official communication.   Once the final deadline for exercising the possibility of veto, the list of candidates is  considered final. Any name in the list is considered equally eligible   The final selection of candidates was done by ENISA who is also responsible for  contacting the candidates and check for availability  ECSC 2019 ANALYSIS REPORT  December 2019  11   The final jury was kept in secret until the day of the competition, to avoid possible  interferences or contacts with the jury members  The final composition of the jury was the following:   Alex Zacharis: Security Engineer for the European Global Navigation Satellite Systems  Agency (GSA).   Simone Fisher: Professor at the Department of Computer Science at Karlstad  University. Member of the Information Security Council at the Swedish Civil  Contingencies Agency   Mateusz Szymaniec: Security specialist at CERT Polska,   Paul Varga: Teacher for IT Security at the university of applied sciences Technikum-  Wien. Representative by Austria   Petr Jirásek: AFCEA Regional Vice President for Central Eastern European and Baltic  Region. Representative by Czech Republic  As for previous editions, the following activities related to jury management were carried out:   An updated “Jury guidelines” document was populated, summing up the most  important points to take in to account. The Jury members and captains from all teams  could use this document as a reference.   Jury meetings were scheduled at regular intervals in order to improve the efficiency of  the competition: Jury members met at predefined times during the competition to  discuss and resolve complaints and queries received during the period in between two  jury meetings. In addition, a framework was created in the case an “extraordinary jury  meeting” was necessary for issues that may affect severely the running of the  competition.   The jury coordinator: In charge of acting as a PoC, receiving and collecting complains  from participants, captains and jury members.  In general, during the competition the role of the jury was:   Attend jury meetings   Resolve disputes with impartiality   Attend and evaluate presentations   Attend to any other issue that may need the expertise of the jury.  Definition of a clear workflow in case of complaints. The workflow is depicted in Fig. 3.  ECSC 2019 ANALYSIS REPORT  December 2019  12  Figure 3: ECSC Complaints to jury workflow  4.3 PRESENTATIONS MANAGEMENT  For ECSC 2019, ENISA by SC decision updated and incorporated new guidelines and rules for  the presentation of the contracts (released on the document “ECSC contract presentations  guidelines”). During the event, the teams had the chance to present a contract of their choice,  earning additional cash rewards.  The final grade varied between:   Good (extra 60% cash reward of a contract)   Very good (extra 80% cash reward of a contract)   Excellent (extra 100% cash reward of a contract)  All the 20 teams presented during the competition with the following grades.

The main objective of this Public  Affairs strategy is to create, distribute and manage a coherent information flow to inform  relevant audiences and participating countries about the ECSC final. Moreover, the Strategy  provides the input for the Dissemination plan that ensures coherent and synchronised  communication.  These documents will contribute to the maturity enhancement of the European Cyber Security  Challenge and increase brand exposure. This will draw interested parties from the private sector  in context of sponsor opportunities and attract more countries and participants to enrol in future  ECSC editions.  The hosting country and ENISA implemented the strategy and the participants were provided  with an official media pack, which included the lines to take, brand identity information and  press releases. In addition, ENISA provided a Dissemination Plan that facilitates timely and  coordinated implementation of the strategy amongst all participants and ECSC stakeholders.  This year, also, a ECSC promotional video from ENISA was released and regular meetings  during the competition were scheduled in order to align the media teams from different countries  and try to share material and ideas.  4.8.1 Women in Cybersecurity in the context of the European  Cybersecurity Challenge  With its mission to address the shortage of cybersecurity talent in Europe, the ECSC is also  concerned with gender diversity. As a well-established platform, the ECSC is an opportunity to  attract more women to the cyber profession.  As part of the public affairs campaign of the  ECSC, ENISA is investing efforts to attract and identify young women in cyber to join the  biggest hacking contest in Europe.  The outputs achieved in raising awareness on the urgency  to address the talent shortage in cybersecurity before, during and after the competition are the  following:   Before the competition, Deloitte conducted calls with ENISA Public Affairs Team and  the Members of the Steering Board to gather their views on the topic and ask them to  share national initiatives that aim to bridge the existing gender gap.  Deloitte drafted a  Whitepaper on women in cybersecurity in the context of the European Cyber Security  Challenge.   During the competition, interviews to young females competing at the ECSC were  conducted, and will be published soon.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3JpbPpVXos  ECSC 2019 ANALYSIS REPORT  December 2019  19   After the competition, the final version of the whitepaper on women in cyber was  leveraged on social media channels of ENISA, published on the ECSC website and  through the Deloitte Cyber Team social media powers. In addition, a collage with  testimonials and gif animations on young females that participated to short interviews  on the topic of women in cyber at the ECSC2019 (in progress). “Working together to  change the gender diversity in cybersecurity” or “ lifting gender diversity in  cybersecurity professions”  Female participants at ECSC2019  The intention in the medium-term is to continue and target these actions under a broader ENISA  Women in Cyber initiative. Ultimately, the ECSC can serve as an enabler for achieving a more  balanced cybersecurity workforce.  4.9 GALA NIGHT SPEAKER  In a similar way to the way that the independent jury body was selected, a proposal from ENISA  to bring a professional speaker to the gala night was launched.  Martina Lindorfer during her presentation  https://europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/about/women-in-cybersecurity.pdf  ECSC 2019 ANALYSIS REPORT  December 2019  20  A list with names was proposed and the Steering committee members voted a selection of three  preferred candidates. Finally, Martina Lindorfer3 was selected to perform a motivational speech  to the young participants during the awards.  4.10 SOCIAL MEDIA IMPACT  Together with the public affairs strategy a social media report was created, collecting the  reactions during the event, according to the report, some of the most remarkable facts regarding  to social media impact were the following:  Figure 8: Social media impact  4.11 CONTINOUS IMPROVEMENT: IMPROVEMENTS TO THIS YEAR  EDITIONS  Following the feedback from previous editions and the requests by the Steering committee  representatives, the following improvements were implemented this year:   No photo policy: Stickers to participants that do not want to be photographed   Improvements on jury management and independent jury body   Commcheck prior the competition   Release of the Who is who document   Telegram group for internal communication   Improvement on the problem troubleshooting during the competition   Improvements to ESCS scoreboard   Use of Github for pull request, issues and bug reporting   Alignment of the ECSC in woman in cyber security activities   Watchdogs, rules and jury enforcement role explained to participants before the  competition   Creation of media meetings during the competition   Introduction of a speaker for the award dinner/ gala night dinner   New website with a new look and feel  3 https://martina.lindorfer.in/  https://martina.lindorfer.in/  ECSC 2019 ANALYSIS REPORT  December 2019  21  5.

LESSONS LEARNT  A lesson-learnt report has been developed by an external observer on behalf of ENISA. It takes  into account the feedback provided by ECSC organisers, the ECSC Steering Committee, the  Jury, and participants regarding to the following domains:  1. Governance and decision-making aspects  2. Public Affairs: Improvements on the social media communication strategy  3. Challenge: Aspects of the competition to be improved related to the development and  setup of the challenge and exercises  4. Logistics: Aspects of the competition related with venue, catering, hotel, transportation,  etc.  5. Side Events: Aspects of the competition related with social events and networking  meetings  6. Compliance: Aspects of the competition to be improved related with compliance with  laws and standards  6.1 GOVERNANCE AND DECISION-MAKING ASPECTS  Table 4: Lesson learnt on governance and decision-making aspects  Parameter Observations /Recommendation  Roles and  responsibilities   Roles and responsibilities were clearly defined and respected during ECSC  planning meetings. The different organisational stakeholders and ECSC  Steering Committee members were documented in an ECSC WhosWho which  aimed at ensuring transparency about the individual stakeholders and their role  in the competition.   Jury members were selected in a clear and transparent manner. The Jury team  was established prior to the competition and introduced to the ECSC Steering  Committee on the night before the competition so it was clear during the  competition who the Jury members were and what their role and  responsibilities were. The Jury members applied impartial and objective  judgement in their activities.   The Jury members were announced to the participants and were visually  identifiable by means of a blue scarf bound around their arms.   Clear \"who is who\" document, including pictures and role description of ECSC  Steering Committee members, Jury members, watchdogs, team coaches, and  team captains. The who is who document was disseminated to the participating  national teams prior to the competition.   Participants have a decent idea on who to contact in case of questions or  technical difficulties during the competition. There was a direct communication  line from the participants to the technical staff by means of Signal.   Ad hoc Jury meetings during the second day of the competition prevented the  Jury members from monitoring the competition area to spot possible infractions  of the ECSC rules.  Decision-making of  the Steering  Committee and Jury   ECSC Steering Committee decision-making process efficient and effective  during IPC (Brussels) and MPC (Bucharest). Meeting minutes were taken by  the Secretariat in order to create an inventory of decisions taken during the  planning meetings and an overview of actions to take prior to kick-off of the  ECSC main event.   Decision-making in between the Mid Planning Conference and the actual event  was on an ad-hoc basis via email, e.g. in relation to the age threshold.   There was an effective and efficient decision-making process between jury  members ensured a clear and consistent approach towards incident that  ECSC 2019 ANALYSIS REPORT  December 2019  24  occurred during the ECSC finals. All incidents and issues were approached  correctly and treated in a timely manner.   Technical support staff and platform providers were invited on an ad-hoc basis  to the Jury meetings, leading to adequate transparency from a technical  perspective allowing the Jury and Steering Committee to make informed  decisions with regard to technical aspects of the Challenge.   Team captains and coaches were invited on an ad-hoc basis to the Jury and  Steering Committee meetings, leading to adequate transparency about issues  and incidents, allowing the Jury and ECSC Steering Committee to take  appropriate action and decisions towards award of points for solving a  challenge, cheating etc.   Preparatory Steering Committee meetings were held in a constructive manner  in preparation of the main competition.  Transparency   A dedicated communication channel was established for in-game  communication between SC and Jury members, for example in relation to  changes to the official ECSC2019 agenda, practicalities in relation the event  etc.   Questions from participants during the competition, for example, in relation to  technical difficulties, were answered in a different way, depending on who gave  the answer. When there was a question from one of the participating teams,  the answer was not shared through the microphone with all the teams.  National  Participation   The amount of participating countries increased from 17 during ECSC2018 to  20 during ECSC2019. In addition, there were some new countries that  attended the ECSC competition as an observer.   Newcomers to the competition were Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Ireland.   Two observing countries were present at ECSC2019, Malta and Finland.  6.2 PUBLIC AFFAIRS  Table 5: Lesson learnt on public affairs  Parameter Recommendation  Monitoring, measurement and  analysis (KPIs)   Key Performance Indicators have been defined in the ECSC  Public Affairs Strategy in accordance with the Public Affairs  goals.   KPIs were monitored and measured by a social media  monitoring tool.   ECSC2019 KPIs were analysed and compared with KPIs  reported for ECSC2018.   Social media statistics were reported via digital media impact  reports to ENISA and the SC on a monthly basis.  Dissemination Plan   A public affairs dissemination plan was updated as part of the  Public Affairs Strategy.   The public affairs dissemination plan was communicated to the  individual SC stakeholders and participating teams.   The public affairs dissemination plan was implemented by the  majority of the national teams leading to high exposure.  Key Messages   Key messages were updated compared to ECSC2018 according  to the engagement phases as detailed in the dissemination  timeline.   The participating teams have successfully adopted the key  messages embedded in the ECSC Public Affairs Strategy. An  increased level of activity by the national teams has been  observed.  ECSC 2019 ANALYSIS REPORT  December 2019  25  Engagement and reach   The total reach on social media for the #ECSC2019 campaign  from February 1st, 2019 up until October 21st, 2019 is estimated  at 1.2 million.   The total amount of mentions on social media for the  #ECSC2019 campaign from February 1st, 2019 up until October  21st, 2019 is estimated at 2113.   The total amount of interactions on social media for the  #ECSC2019 campaign from February 1st, 2019 up until October  21st, 2019 is estimated at 22 240 (of which 4654 shares and 17  583 likes).   Although the total number of social media reach has decreased  as compared to last year, the quality of mentions and amount of  interactions has increased.   In order to facilitate a structured and coordinated approach  towards public affairs activities, the ENISA Public Affairs Team  organised an operational meeting with the Steering Committee,  with the support of Deloitte.  Social Media   The ECSC Public Affairs Strategy details specific key messages  that can be shared across social media networks in order to  reach the different target audiences during the different  engagement phases as defined in the Strategy. These key  messages have been updated compared to the previous version  of the ECSC Public Affairs Strategy in order to achieve  maximum audience engagement.   Social media platforms were used by ENISA, the members of  the ECSC Steering Committee, participating national teams and  other relevant ECSC stakeholders prior to, during and after the  competition in order to increase awareness about the ECSC.  Website   The ECSC website was only updated very shortly before the  competition took place.   The official ECSC website (www.ecsc.eu) has been updated  prior to the ECSC competition in order to make it more user- friendly, easy to navigate and to strengthen the ECSC branding.   The ECSC website included a real-time feed to the scoreboard,  allowing externals to monitor the progress of national teams,  leading to transparency in the competition and increased  engagement by the target audience, for example, by sharing  posts on Twitter on LinkedIn.  Visibility   Similar to the previous edition of ECSC, communications about  the event were disseminated through relevant channels as  detailed in the ECSC Public Affairs Strategy.   There is very limited presence of communications on ECSC on  social media platforms used by the participants such as  Instagram and Facebook.  6.3 CHALLENGES  Table 6: Lesson learnt on challenges  Parameter Recommendation  Design   In general, participants were satisfied with the level of  difficulty/complexity of the challenges. The challenges included a  reasonable learning curve compared to the average level of the  participants.   For some challenges, it was not clear to the participants what to  submit so it was not possible to solve the challenge.  ECSC 2019 ANALYSIS REPORT  December 2019  26   Some challenges only required guessing skills and did not  require any hard skills from the participants to solve the  challenge.   The majority of the participants was satisfied by the physical  security challenge \"Free Eddie\".   There was not enough diversity in the range of challenges  included in the competition, which includes that only a limited set  of skills is tested during the competition.   The focus of the challenges was too much on competition  instead of collaboration.  Service Providers   Service provider was present and supported the participants in  technical troubleshooting.   Communication from the service provider to the participants was  efficient and effective and supported by instant messaging. In  case of emergencies, the technical support staff was available to  help participants with troubleshooting.   The service provider has offered a stable and high quality  technical network infrastructure to support the challenge.   The service provider communicated transparently and effectively  to the Jury and Steering Committee as requested.  Rules   Although clearly defined, there was little awareness amongst the  participants of the rules.   Rules are ambiguous and unclear to the participants, questions  about the rules were not answered in a clear and consistent  manner.   Rules about the age limit of the participants was changed  between the Main Planning Conference and the competition  leading to unclarity up until days before the challenge. The SC  has addressed this ad-hoc via email.   No in-game changes were made to the rules. The Jury members  ensured a consistent application of all ECSC game rules during  the competition.  Enforcement   A breach of the rules was approached, treated and followed up  by the members of the Jury in a consistent manner.  Consequences were agreed upon by the members of the Jury  and were communicated in a transparent manner to the SC  members and subsequently, to the participants.   Technical capabilities were installed to allow monitoring of  infringement of the rules.  Presentations   The agenda for the presentations was confirmed and clearly  communicated to the SC members and subsequently to the  participants.   The five best presentations were presented again during the  conference on the third day of ECSC.   The presentations are considered an important aspect of the  competition.   The order of the presentations was decided based on the score  of the participating teams at the end of the first.   The meeting room in which the presentations took place was  right in front of the entrance of the competition venue. As a  result, there was a lot of noise and people walking by the  presentations. This was distracting to the presenters and the  Jury members.   A template for the presentations was provided upfront and  respect by the majority of participating teams.  Platform   The were access controls preventing participants to start solving  challenges before the competition has kicked off.   The ECSC platform as first introduced during ECSC2018 has  been successfully deployed in ECSC2019. The overall  ECSC 2019 ANALYSIS REPORT  December 2019  27  experience of participants with the platform was positive and in  line with their expectations.  Infrastructure   The network infrastructure for the platform was reliable and  stable. No major issues or incidents took place with regards to  the availability of network infrastructure.   Network capacity and speed was meeting expectations.   There was WiFi available for attendees, organisers and other  non-participants in the competition venue. However, it was not  able to activate VPN.  Complexity   In general, participants were satisfied with the level of  difficulty/complexity of the challenges. The challenges included a  reasonable learning curve compared to the average level of the  participants.   Some challenges only required guessing skills and did not  require any hard skills from the participants to solve the  challenge.  Scoring   Exceptions on scoring were voted by the Jury.   Scoring of teams was transparent, both internally as externally.   Scoring was not altered during or after the challenge.  6.4 LOGISTICS  Table 7: Lesson learnt on logistic  Parameter Recommendation  Venue   Some of the accommodations (hotels) did not have an easy  connection to the ECSC venue.   The competition venue was large enough for all the teams.   The ventilation of the competition area was poor. There was no  fresh air so it became very hot after a couple of hours.  Catering   The quality of the food was poor, especially on the first day. The  second day, the organiser has made an effort to offer more  qualitative food.   The catering did not indicate the ingredients of the food that was  prepared for the participants and the organisers so there was no  information on potential allergies.   In the competition venue, there were two restaurants where  participants could have lunch.  In-event communication   Clear in-game communication.   A screen was presented on the wall with an overview of the live  scores.   In-event communication between participants and organisers  was facilitated by a secure instant-messaging platform.  Accomodation   The selected accommodations were qualitative and was up to  the expectations of the participants.   Some of the accommodations were too far away from the ECSC  venue and from the locations where social events were  organised.  ECSC 2019 ANALYSIS REPORT  December 2019  28  6.5 SIDE EVENTS  Table 8: Lesson learnt on side events  Parameter Recommendation  Social event   The social events did not strengthen the connection between the  teams as they were not organised in such a way as to increase  the connection between the teams.   As participants were allowed to continue working on write-ups  and presentations during the evening, some chose not to join the  social event, but instead, to focus on the challenge.  Relevance   No conferences or job fairs were organised alongside the  competition. However, some of the key sponsors had  representatives at the competition venue.  Format   No conferences or job fairs were organised alongside the  competition. However, some of the key sponsors had  representatives at the competition venue.  Logistics   Access for disabled people was taken into account at the  competition venue but was not taken into account during the  social events.   Social events were organised in locations that were too far away  from some of the accommodations (hotels).  6.6 COMPLIANCE  Table 9: Lesson learnt on compliance  Parameter Recommendation  Data protection   Stickers were available for participants to indicate they did not  want their picture to be taken by photographers, but they were  not used in practice.   There was no clear communication about how personal data of  the participants would be processed by the ECSC organisation.   Pictures were taken of people who were wearing no-photo  stickers.   The WiFi available at the competition venue for participants,  organisers and visitors did not allow to set up a VPN connection,  therefore, not giving its users a safe environment to do  secure/private work during the competition.

The event was organised by ANSSI (Asociatia Nationala pentru  Securitatea Sistemelor Informatice) and CERT.RO (Centrul national de raspuns la incidente de  securitate cibernetica) at Palace of the Parliament.  Each country was represented at the ECSC final by a team of 10 contestants, comprised of the  winners of the national competitions. Half of the team members are within the range of ages of  14-20 years old and half in the 21-25 range. In total, 300 people (contestants, coaches and  judges) representing 20 EU and EFTA countries (Austria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark,  Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Netherlands,  Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom) competed in the  ECSC final in Bucharest. The participants investigated vulnerabilities in web applications,  binaries and document files, solved crypto puzzles and hacked hardware systems. However,  technical skills are just one part of the whole story. Teamwork and presentation skills were also  evaluated. A significant part of the skillset, which is important for working in an IT security team,  is thus tested. The finalists of ECSC 2019 were the teams from Romania, Italia and Austria.  ENISA is currently hosting different platforms and performing different activities to support the  European Cyber Security Challenge hosting country and the evolution of the project, this  includes among others: ECSC main website, ECSC planning platform, public affairs strategy,  challenges creation, governance framework of the competition, secretariat support, etc…  In order to ensure appropriate and transparent reporting to the Steering Committee, the  following key observations were made by independent third-party observers that have attended  the ECSC planning meetings and the actual event. These observations have been produced  based on the feedback collected from participants, members of the ECSC Jury, members of the  ECSC Steering Committee, and attendees to the event. In addition, these observations reflect  the feedback provided by organisers and participants collected by an online evaluation survey:   Roles and responsibilities were clearly defined and respected during ECSC planning  meetings. The different organisational stakeholders and ECSC Steering Committee  members were documented in an ECSC WhoisWho, which aimed at ensuring  transparency about the individual stakeholders and their role in the competition.   The total reach on social media for the #ECSC2019 campaign from February 1st, 2019  up until October 21st, 2019 is estimated at 1.2 million people and the total amount of  mentions on social media is estimated at 2113.The total amount of interactions on  social media is estimated at 22 240.   The introduction of an independent jury body in the competition was considered a  great achievement for this year edition.   The participating teams have successfully adopted the key messages embedded in the  ECSC Public Affairs Strategy. An increased level of activity by the national teams has  been observed.   The network infrastructure for the platform was reliable and stable. No major issues or  incidents took place with regards to the availability of network infrastructure.  Network  capacity and speed was meeting expectations.

INTRODUCTION  The growing need for IT security professionals is widely acknowledged. According to recent  estimates, is expected that more than 3,5 million cybersecurity professionals will be needed  worldwide by 20211 in order to be able to prevent, react and protect their citizens against cyber  threats. Europe has to make an effort to retain and attract talent to cybersecurity and, at the  same time, create solid and powerful education, entrepreneur and business structures on cyber  security.  To help mitigate this shortage of skills, many countries launched national cyber security  competitions addressed towards students, university graduates or even non-ICT professionals  with a clear aim:  ‘Identify new and young cyber talents and encourage young people to pursue a career in cyber  security.’  The European Cyber Security Challenge (ECSC) https://www.europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/  leverages on these competitions by adding a pan-European layer. Top cyber talents from each  participating country meet to network and collaborate and finally compete against each other.  Contestants are challenged in solving security related tasks from different domains.  In a nutshell, ECSC is the annual European event that brings together young talent from across  Europe to have fun and compete in cyber security. Its main aim is to highlight the importance of the  national competition.  1.1 ECSC BACKGROUND  The project was initiated under the umbrella of the EU Cyber Security Strategy (Feb 2013):  ‘The European Commission will organise, with the support of ENISA, a cybersecurity  Championship in 2014, where university students will compete in proposing NIS solutions.’  As of 2014, ENISA has been supporting the organisation of the ECSC. ENISA is actively  organising the meetings of the governance structures, supporting the development of the  competition rules and games and is part of the ECSC Jury. As of 2016, ENISA is the acting  secretariat of the ESCS Steering Committee.  In the edition of 2018, 200 participants (contestants, coaches and judges) representing 17 EU  and EFTA countries (Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France,  Germany, Greece, Italy, Liechtenstein, Norway, Romania, Spain, Switzerland, and United  Kingdom) competed in the ECSC final at London.  The 2019 edition of the European Cyber Security Challenge took place in the Parliament  building in Bucharest, Romania, from 9th to11th October 2019. For the first time, teams from 20  countries participated at the final (Austria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France,  Germany, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland,  Portugal, Romania, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom).The participants investigated  vulnerabilities in web applications, binaries and document files, solved crypto puzzles and hack  1 https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/08/09/the-cybersecurity-talent-gap-is-an-industry-crisis  ECSC is the  annual European  event that brings  together young  talent from  across Europe to  have fun and  compete in cyber  security.  https://www.europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/ https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/08/09/the-cybersecurity-talent-gap-is-an-industry-crisis  ECSC 2019 ANALYSIS REPORT  December 2019  7  hardware systems. However, technical skills are just one part of the whole story. As time and  resources were limited, teamwork and presentation skills were also evaluated. The finalists of  ECSC 2019 were the teams from Romania, Italy and Austria.  The 2020 edition of the European Cyber Security Challenge will take place Vienna, Austria  between 3rd and 7th November  1.2 ECSC SETUP  Each country is represented at the ECSC final by a team of 10 contestants, comprised by the  winners of the national round. Half of them are within the range of ages of 14-20 years old and  half in the 21-25 range.  Two preparatory pilot phases of ECSC have been held in 2014 (in Austria) and 2015 (in  Switzerland) with attendance by 3 and 6 countries, respectively.  Since 2015, ENISA is lending  its experience and position to coordinate and organise the ECSC effort to reach its full maturity  by 2020.  The activities of the ECSC are supervised by a Steering Committee, composed of  representatives of the attending countries. ENISA facilitates the meetings of this group and  provides strategic guidance. The decision-making processes are described in the ECSC  Charter, which is revised and approved every year by the ECSC Steering Committee.  ENISA is currently hosting different platforms and performing different activities to support the  European Cyber Security Challenge hosting country and the evolution of the project, this  includes among others: the ECSC main website, the ECSC information-sharing platform, the  public affairs strategy, challenges creation, etc…  In addition, ENISA is working closely with the host of each edition, in order to ensure  appropriate and transparent reporting to the Steering Committee.

ENISA CONTRIBUTION TO  ECSC2019  4.1 STEERING COMMITTEE MANAGEMENT  The activities of the ECSC are supervised by a Steering Committee (SC) composed of  representatives of the attending countries. ENISA facilitates the meetings of this group and  provides strategic guidance. The decision-making processes are described in the ECSC  Charter, which is approved every year.  During the preparation of ECSC 2019, ENISA was responsible for the following activities related  with the management of the Steering Committee:   Platforms maintenance and update   Mail list management   Update and creation of SC related documentation   Organization of the IPC in Brussels   Support the organization of the MPC in Bucharest   Accommodation, execution and follow-up of SC requests   Implementation of changes and suggestions collected using surveys and the feedback  from previous editions   Creation and management of an independent jury   Creation of an internal ‘Who is who’ document to support the jury and teams activities   Realisation of a ‘Comcheck’ prior to the competition   Organization of a Hot wash meeting after the execution of the competition in Bucharest   Feedback collection: Lessons learnt report and surveys to the participants  4.2 JURY MANAGEMENT  The proposal for this year edition was the creation of an independent jury body, instead of the  format of the previous editions of having ‘jury members’ appointed by each participating country.  By Steering Committee decision, the independent jury was composed of 5 members: 3  independent + 2 members by the following organizing countries, Austria and Czech Republic  To guarantee the full transparency and the independency of the selection of Jury members, the  procedure for selecting the jury was the following:   ENISA opened a period to nominate candidates in order to collect as many potential  candidates as possible. ENISA also contributed to the list by providing names from its  stakeholders’ lists.   Creation of a list of candidates: The list is a living document and is and is  updated/refreshed at regular intervals. After the release of each update, there is a  period where any member of the SC has the right to exercise his/her reservations to  any proposed candidate in the list.   If a SC member decides to exercise the right to veto to any of the candidates in the list,  the name will be removed after official communication.   Once the final deadline for exercising the possibility of veto, the list of candidates is  considered final. Any name in the list is considered equally eligible   The final selection of candidates was done by ENISA who is also responsible for  contacting the candidates and check for availability  ECSC 2019 ANALYSIS REPORT  December 2019  11   The final jury was kept in secret until the day of the competition, to avoid possible  interferences or contacts with the jury members  The final composition of the jury was the following:   Alex Zacharis: Security Engineer for the European Global Navigation Satellite Systems  Agency (GSA).   Simone Fisher: Professor at the Department of Computer Science at Karlstad  University. Member of the Information Security Council at the Swedish Civil  Contingencies Agency   Mateusz Szymaniec: Security specialist at CERT Polska,   Paul Varga: Teacher for IT Security at the university of applied sciences Technikum-  Wien. Representative by Austria   Petr Jirásek: AFCEA Regional Vice President for Central Eastern European and Baltic  Region. Representative by Czech Republic  As for previous editions, the following activities related to jury management were carried out:   An updated “Jury guidelines” document was populated, summing up the most  important points to take in to account. The Jury members and captains from all teams  could use this document as a reference.   Jury meetings were scheduled at regular intervals in order to improve the efficiency of  the competition: Jury members met at predefined times during the competition to  discuss and resolve complaints and queries received during the period in between two  jury meetings. In addition, a framework was created in the case an “extraordinary jury  meeting” was necessary for issues that may affect severely the running of the  competition.   The jury coordinator: In charge of acting as a PoC, receiving and collecting complains  from participants, captains and jury members.  In general, during the competition the role of the jury was:   Attend jury meetings   Resolve disputes with impartiality   Attend and evaluate presentations   Attend to any other issue that may need the expertise of the jury.  Definition of a clear workflow in case of complaints. The workflow is depicted in Fig. 3.  ECSC 2019 ANALYSIS REPORT  December 2019  12  Figure 3: ECSC Complaints to jury workflow  4.3 PRESENTATIONS MANAGEMENT  For ECSC 2019, ENISA by SC decision updated and incorporated new guidelines and rules for  the presentation of the contracts (released on the document “ECSC contract presentations  guidelines”). During the event, the teams had the chance to present a contract of their choice,  earning additional cash rewards.  The final grade varied between:   Good (extra 60% cash reward of a contract)   Very good (extra 80% cash reward of a contract)   Excellent (extra 100% cash reward of a contract)  All the 20 teams presented during the competition with the following grades.

The main objective of this Public  Affairs strategy is to create, distribute and manage a coherent information flow to inform  relevant audiences and participating countries about the ECSC final. Moreover, the Strategy  provides the input for the Dissemination plan that ensures coherent and synchronised  communication.  These documents will contribute to the maturity enhancement of the European Cyber Security  Challenge and increase brand exposure. This will draw interested parties from the private sector  in context of sponsor opportunities and attract more countries and participants to enrol in future  ECSC editions.  The hosting country and ENISA implemented the strategy and the participants were provided  with an official media pack, which included the lines to take, brand identity information and  press releases. In addition, ENISA provided a Dissemination Plan that facilitates timely and  coordinated implementation of the strategy amongst all participants and ECSC stakeholders.  This year, also, a ECSC promotional video from ENISA was released and regular meetings  during the competition were scheduled in order to align the media teams from different countries  and try to share material and ideas.  4.8.1 Women in Cybersecurity in the context of the European  Cybersecurity Challenge  With its mission to address the shortage of cybersecurity talent in Europe, the ECSC is also  concerned with gender diversity. As a well-established platform, the ECSC is an opportunity to  attract more women to the cyber profession.  As part of the public affairs campaign of the  ECSC, ENISA is investing efforts to attract and identify young women in cyber to join the  biggest hacking contest in Europe.  The outputs achieved in raising awareness on the urgency  to address the talent shortage in cybersecurity before, during and after the competition are the  following:   Before the competition, Deloitte conducted calls with ENISA Public Affairs Team and  the Members of the Steering Board to gather their views on the topic and ask them to  share national initiatives that aim to bridge the existing gender gap.  Deloitte drafted a  Whitepaper on women in cybersecurity in the context of the European Cyber Security  Challenge.   During the competition, interviews to young females competing at the ECSC were  conducted, and will be published soon.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3JpbPpVXos  ECSC 2019 ANALYSIS REPORT  December 2019  19   After the competition, the final version of the whitepaper on women in cyber was  leveraged on social media channels of ENISA, published on the ECSC website and  through the Deloitte Cyber Team social media powers. In addition, a collage with  testimonials and gif animations on young females that participated to short interviews  on the topic of women in cyber at the ECSC2019 (in progress). “Working together to  change the gender diversity in cybersecurity” or “ lifting gender diversity in  cybersecurity professions”  Female participants at ECSC2019  The intention in the medium-term is to continue and target these actions under a broader ENISA  Women in Cyber initiative. Ultimately, the ECSC can serve as an enabler for achieving a more  balanced cybersecurity workforce.  4.9 GALA NIGHT SPEAKER  In a similar way to the way that the independent jury body was selected, a proposal from ENISA  to bring a professional speaker to the gala night was launched.  Martina Lindorfer during her presentation  https://europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/about/women-in-cybersecurity.pdf  ECSC 2019 ANALYSIS REPORT  December 2019  20  A list with names was proposed and the Steering committee members voted a selection of three  preferred candidates. Finally, Martina Lindorfer3 was selected to perform a motivational speech  to the young participants during the awards.  4.10 SOCIAL MEDIA IMPACT  Together with the public affairs strategy a social media report was created, collecting the  reactions during the event, according to the report, some of the most remarkable facts regarding  to social media impact were the following:  Figure 8: Social media impact  4.11 CONTINOUS IMPROVEMENT: IMPROVEMENTS TO THIS YEAR  EDITIONS  Following the feedback from previous editions and the requests by the Steering committee  representatives, the following improvements were implemented this year:   No photo policy: Stickers to participants that do not want to be photographed   Improvements on jury management and independent jury body   Commcheck prior the competition   Release of the Who is who document   Telegram group for internal communication   Improvement on the problem troubleshooting during the competition   Improvements to ESCS scoreboard   Use of Github for pull request, issues and bug reporting   Alignment of the ECSC in woman in cyber security activities   Watchdogs, rules and jury enforcement role explained to participants before the  competition   Creation of media meetings during the competition   Introduction of a speaker for the award dinner/ gala night dinner   New website with a new look and feel  3 https://martina.lindorfer.in/  https://martina.lindorfer.in/  ECSC 2019 ANALYSIS REPORT  December 2019  21  5.

The different organisational stakeholders and ECSC  Steering Committee members were documented in an ECSC WhosWho which  aimed at ensuring transparency about the individual stakeholders and their role  in the competition.   Jury members were selected in a clear and transparent manner. The Jury team  was established prior to the competition and introduced to the ECSC Steering  Committee on the night before the competition so it was clear during the  competition who the Jury members were and what their role and  responsibilities were. The Jury members applied impartial and objective  judgement in their activities.   The Jury members were announced to the participants and were visually  identifiable by means of a blue scarf bound around their arms.   Clear \"who is who\" document, including pictures and role description of ECSC  Steering Committee members, Jury members, watchdogs, team coaches, and  team captains. The who is who document was disseminated to the participating  national teams prior to the competition.   Participants have a decent idea on who to contact in case of questions or  technical difficulties during the competition. There was a direct communication  line from the participants to the technical staff by means of Signal.   Ad hoc Jury meetings during the second day of the competition prevented the  Jury members from monitoring the competition area to spot possible infractions  of the ECSC rules.  Decision-making of  the Steering  Committee and Jury   ECSC Steering Committee decision-making process efficient and effective  during IPC (Brussels) and MPC (Bucharest). Meeting minutes were taken by  the Secretariat in order to create an inventory of decisions taken during the  planning meetings and an overview of actions to take prior to kick-off of the  ECSC main event.   Decision-making in between the Mid Planning Conference and the actual event  was on an ad-hoc basis via email, e.g. in relation to the age threshold.   There was an effective and efficient decision-making process between jury  members ensured a clear and consistent approach towards incident that  ECSC 2019 ANALYSIS REPORT  December 2019  24  occurred during the ECSC finals. All incidents and issues were approached  correctly and treated in a timely manner.   Technical support staff and platform providers were invited on an ad-hoc basis  to the Jury meetings, leading to adequate transparency from a technical  perspective allowing the Jury and Steering Committee to make informed  decisions with regard to technical aspects of the Challenge.   Team captains and coaches were invited on an ad-hoc basis to the Jury and  Steering Committee meetings, leading to adequate transparency about issues  and incidents, allowing the Jury and ECSC Steering Committee to take  appropriate action and decisions towards award of points for solving a  challenge, cheating etc.   Preparatory Steering Committee meetings were held in a constructive manner  in preparation of the main competition.  Transparency   A dedicated communication channel was established for in-game  communication between SC and Jury members, for example in relation to  changes to the official ECSC2019 agenda, practicalities in relation the event  etc.   Questions from participants during the competition, for example, in relation to  technical difficulties, were answered in a different way, depending on who gave  the answer. When there was a question from one of the participating teams,  the answer was not shared through the microphone with all the teams.  National  Participation   The amount of participating countries increased from 17 during ECSC2018 to  20 during ECSC2019. In addition, there were some new countries that  attended the ECSC competition as an observer.   Newcomers to the competition were Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Ireland.   Two observing countries were present at ECSC2019, Malta and Finland.  6.2 PUBLIC AFFAIRS  Table 5: Lesson learnt on public affairs  Parameter Recommendation  Monitoring, measurement and  analysis (KPIs)   Key Performance Indicators have been defined in the ECSC  Public Affairs Strategy in accordance with the Public Affairs  goals.   KPIs were monitored and measured by a social media  monitoring tool.   ECSC2019 KPIs were analysed and compared with KPIs  reported for ECSC2018.   Social media statistics were reported via digital media impact  reports to ENISA and the SC on a monthly basis.  Dissemination Plan   A public affairs dissemination plan was updated as part of the  Public Affairs Strategy.   The public affairs dissemination plan was communicated to the  individual SC stakeholders and participating teams.   The public affairs dissemination plan was implemented by the  majority of the national teams leading to high exposure.  Key Messages   Key messages were updated compared to ECSC2018 according  to the engagement phases as detailed in the dissemination  timeline.   The participating teams have successfully adopted the key  messages embedded in the ECSC Public Affairs Strategy. An  increased level of activity by the national teams has been  observed.  ECSC 2019 ANALYSIS REPORT  December 2019  25  Engagement and reach   The total reach on social media for the #ECSC2019 campaign  from February 1st, 2019 up until October 21st, 2019 is estimated  at 1.2 million.   The total amount of mentions on social media for the  #ECSC2019 campaign from February 1st, 2019 up until October  21st, 2019 is estimated at 2113.   The total amount of interactions on social media for the  #ECSC2019 campaign from February 1st, 2019 up until October  21st, 2019 is estimated at 22 240 (of which 4654 shares and 17  583 likes).   Although the total number of social media reach has decreased  as compared to last year, the quality of mentions and amount of  interactions has increased.   In order to facilitate a structured and coordinated approach  towards public affairs activities, the ENISA Public Affairs Team  organised an operational meeting with the Steering Committee,  with the support of Deloitte.  Social Media   The ECSC Public Affairs Strategy details specific key messages  that can be shared across social media networks in order to  reach the different target audiences during the different  engagement phases as defined in the Strategy. These key  messages have been updated compared to the previous version  of the ECSC Public Affairs Strategy in order to achieve  maximum audience engagement.   Social media platforms were used by ENISA, the members of  the ECSC Steering Committee, participating national teams and  other relevant ECSC stakeholders prior to, during and after the  competition in order to increase awareness about the ECSC.  Website   The ECSC website was only updated very shortly before the  competition took place.   The official ECSC website (www.ecsc.eu) has been updated  prior to the ECSC competition in order to make it more user- friendly, easy to navigate and to strengthen the ECSC branding.   The ECSC website included a real-time feed to the scoreboard,  allowing externals to monitor the progress of national teams,  leading to transparency in the competition and increased  engagement by the target audience, for example, by sharing  posts on Twitter on LinkedIn.  Visibility   Similar to the previous edition of ECSC, communications about  the event were disseminated through relevant channels as  detailed in the ECSC Public Affairs Strategy.   There is very limited presence of communications on ECSC on  social media platforms used by the participants such as  Instagram and Facebook.  6.3 CHALLENGES  Table 6: Lesson learnt on challenges  Parameter Recommendation  Design   In general, participants were satisfied with the level of  difficulty/complexity of the challenges. The challenges included a  reasonable learning curve compared to the average level of the  participants.   For some challenges, it was not clear to the participants what to  submit so it was not possible to solve the challenge.  ECSC 2019 ANALYSIS REPORT  December 2019  26   Some challenges only required guessing skills and did not  require any hard skills from the participants to solve the  challenge.   The majority of the participants was satisfied by the physical  security challenge \"Free Eddie\".   There was not enough diversity in the range of challenges  included in the competition, which includes that only a limited set  of skills is tested during the competition.   The focus of the challenges was too much on competition  instead of collaboration.  Service Providers   Service provider was present and supported the participants in  technical troubleshooting.   Communication from the service provider to the participants was  efficient and effective and supported by instant messaging. In  case of emergencies, the technical support staff was available to  help participants with troubleshooting.   The service provider has offered a stable and high quality  technical network infrastructure to support the challenge.   The service provider communicated transparently and effectively  to the Jury and Steering Committee as requested.  Rules   Although clearly defined, there was little awareness amongst the  participants of the rules.   Rules are ambiguous and unclear to the participants, questions  about the rules were not answered in a clear and consistent  manner.   Rules about the age limit of the participants was changed  between the Main Planning Conference and the competition  leading to unclarity up until days before the challenge. The SC  has addressed this ad-hoc via email.   No in-game changes were made to the rules. The Jury members  ensured a consistent application of all ECSC game rules during  the competition.  Enforcement   A breach of the rules was approached, treated and followed up  by the members of the Jury in a consistent manner.  Consequences were agreed upon by the members of the Jury  and were communicated in a transparent manner to the SC  members and subsequently, to the participants.   Technical capabilities were installed to allow monitoring of  infringement of the rules.  Presentations   The agenda for the presentations was confirmed and clearly  communicated to the SC members and subsequently to the  participants.   The five best presentations were presented again during the  conference on the third day of ECSC.   The presentations are considered an important aspect of the  competition.   The order of the presentations was decided based on the score  of the participating teams at the end of the first.   The meeting room in which the presentations took place was  right in front of the entrance of the competition venue. As a  result, there was a lot of noise and people walking by the  presentations. This was distracting to the presenters and the  Jury members.   A template for the presentations was provided upfront and  respect by the majority of participating teams.  Platform   The were access controls preventing participants to start solving  challenges before the competition has kicked off.   The ECSC platform as first introduced during ECSC2018 has  been successfully deployed in ECSC2019. The overall  ECSC 2019 ANALYSIS REPORT  December 2019  27  experience of participants with the platform was positive and in  line with their expectations.

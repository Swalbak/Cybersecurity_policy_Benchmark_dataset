Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  Page  iv  Executive summary  Smart grids are complex systems. A smart grid is a system of systems delivering energy to  consumers. Smart grid stores, transports and manages energy. Smart grid is a de facto Critical  Infrastructure1 as energy is important for the well-functioning of the society and economy. Being the  blending of the energy and telecommunication critical infrastructures, smart grids should operate  securely and by respecting end users’ privacy. Moreover, the protection of the smart grid is the key  to energy availability. In this document we elaborate on cyber security issues with regards to smart  grid information infrastructure.  The security of a complex system is also a complex matter. In order to cope with this complex  environment, this document leverages the following principles for simplifying the problem:  Consider external and internal threats: In cyber-security the external environment are the cyber- threats. This cyber-threat environment originates from threat agents, the adversaries utilizing cyber- threats and launching cyber-attacks. Although dynamically changing, the cyber-threat landscape can  be described and has finite elements. An understanding of the cyber-threat landscape is  indispensable for the identification of the necessary protection measures. In this document, we  provide a threat landscape affecting smart grid components. Internal threats are considered as well:  a variety of threats emanating from errors and insider attacks are also taken into account.  Decompose and classify the elements: A decomposition of smart grid components is one of the main  tasks to tackle its complexity. This task is currently being performed by various experts around  Europe and the World. Within this report, we have adopted the smart grid decomposition provided  in the document Smart Grid Reference Architecture10 of the Smart Grid Standardization  Coordination Group of CEN-CENELEC-ETSI. This is because this work is a highly reputed document  among the security experts in Europe.  Capture available knowledge: What have others done in the area of smart grid protection? This has  been addressed by taking stock of available cyber-security approaches, protection approaches and  good practices developed recently.  In response to the urgent question of many stakeholders: How does this document support me in my  work?  this document provides tools to assess risk exposure of smart grid assets and will show what  others have done in this respect. It elaborates on the threats smart grid components are exposed to  and on the security controls to reduce threat exposure. But the assessment on the living object can  be done only by the asset owner, just because asset owners master the complexity of infrastructures  and the interdependencies among various assets. This task cannot be done as a generic exercise or it  would have low value.  Concluding, one should note that the use of these tools will depend on the capabilities of the expert  users. In cyber-security preparedness, however, much depends on the capabilities of the adversary,  which are not always known and certain;  “That which depends on me, I can do; that which depends on the enemy cannot be certain. Therefore  it is said that one may know how to win, but cannot necessarily do so” (Sun Tzu2).  1  http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/crisis-and-terrorism/critical- infrastructure/index_en.htm, accessed 13 Nov 2013.  2  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War, accessed 13 Nov 2013.  http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/crisis-and-terrorism/critical-infrastructure/index_en.htm http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/crisis-and-terrorism/critical-infrastructure/index_en.htm http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  Page  v  Being knowledgeable about what can be achieved is one thing.

Being an ENISA deliverable in the area of  Threat Landscape, it comprises a detailed threat assessment in the area of smart grids, based on  input form the generic ENISA Threat Landscape activities13. The rationale behind this piece of work is  to “deepen” the generic threat assessment by taking into account specificities of smart grids, a vital  CIIP sector.  By doing so, the objective is to complement various activities going on both within and outside  ENISA, that is:   To perform a threat assessment on the basis of which smart grid security measures will be  based. This activity is in support of related activities of the Commission: DG-ENER, in close  cooperation with ENISA and DG CNECT, has decided to task the EG2 working group29 with the  organisation of consultations security requirements with national cyber security authorities and  the energy and ICT industry.   To deliver input to other international activities, in particular in the area of standardisation3,4. In  this context, the threat analysis provided in this document will be reused in the definition of  security measures for smart grid infrastructure models (scenarios).  The present work is based on information developed within the ENISA Threat Landscape (ETL):  relevant information about top threats is included in this document. The threats have been mapped  to smart grid assets: this indicates the kind of exposure each asset has. Moreover, threat agents  have been identified as originators of these threats. Through the established relationship among  threats->assets->threat agents it becomes evident what threats smart grid assets are exposed to.  Moreover, the capabilities of possible adversaries are also identified. This information is useful for a  variety of security related activities in the area of smart grids, such as risk assessments, formulation  of security requirements, identification of protection requirements, etc.  This work is concluded with a good practice guide, consisting of an overview of smart grid security  approaches. In particular, it is demonstrated how available smart grid controls from various existing  standards protect against the identified threats.  The structure of this report has been agreed with the expert group that has supported this ENISA  work. Moreover, a contribution to the ENISA work on security measures for smart grids has been  generated.  Policy Context  The Cyber Security Strategy for the EU5 stresses the importance of threat analysis and emerging  trends in cyber security. The ENISA Threat Landscape is an activity towards the achievement of  objectives formulated in this regulation, in particular by contributing to the identification of  emerging trends in cyber-threats and understanding the evolution of cyber-crime (see 2.4 regarding  proposed role of ENISA).  Moreover, the new ENISA regulation6 mentions the necessity to analyse current and emerging risks  (and their components), stating: “the Agency, in cooperation with Member States and, as  3  http://www.cen.eu/cen/Sectors/Sectors/UtilitiesAndEnergy/SmartGrids/Pages/default.aspx#, accessed 11 November  2013.  4  http://www.cenelec.eu/aboutcenelec/whatwedo/technologysectors/smartgrids.html, accessed 11 November 2013.  5  http://www.ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-  and-opportunity-cyber-security, accessed 28 Nov 2013.  6  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:165:0041:0058:EN:PDF, accessed 28 Nov 2013.  http://www.cen.eu/cen/Sectors/Sectors/UtilitiesAndEnergy/SmartGrids/Pages/default.aspx http://www.cenelec.eu/aboutcenelec/whatwedo/technologysectors/smartgrids.html http://www.ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security http://www.ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:165:0041:0058:EN:PDF  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  2  appropriate, with statistical bodies and others, collects relevant information”. In particular, under  Art. 3, Tasks, d), iii), the new ENISA regulations states that ENISA should “enable effective responses  to current and emerging network and information security risks and threats”.  From the above points it becomes apparent that the ENISA Threat Landscape is a significant  contribution to the EU Cyber Security Strategy by streamlining and consolidating available  information on cyber-threats and their evolution.  Detailing the ENISA Threat Landscape for various emerging areas provides valuable contextual  information to existing policy measures established by the commission. In the area of smart grids, in  particular, this work supports a recommendation of the Commission: the European Commission  included a number of data protection, privacy and security measures in the March 2012 Commission  Recommendation on preparations for the roll-out of Smart Metering systems7. Furthermore, it  initiated action under the auspices of the smart grids Task Force with a dedicated Expert Group29  (EG2) focusing on two key concrete outcomes to be delivered in 2013, namely: 1) a Data Protection  Impact Assessment (DPIA) template as a response to consumer concerns related to data protection  and privacy; and 2) a cyber-security assessment framework as a response to investor and industry  concerns related to system security. The cyber security assessment framework is composed of two  sub-deliverables. First, a set of Best Available Techniques (BATs) pinpoints the potential cyber  security risks inherent to each of the common minimal functional requirements for Smart Metering  Systems recommended in the March 2012 Recommendation8 and identifies optimal controls and  Privacy Enhancing Technologies to mitigate each of these risks. Second, a blueprint for a network will  be elaborated, where information about incidents, threats, vulnerabilities and good practices can be  shared for critical infrastructure protection9.  This work aims to provide a significant contribution towards assessing cyber threat exposure of  smart grid infrastructures. As such it will directly contribute to the assessment of cyber security and  comes to support investor and industry concerns.  Target Audience  This material is a tool for smart grid asset owners who wish to perform threat analysis and risk  assessment according to their particular needs (i.e. asset protection level based on asset impact,  vulnerabilities and detail of mitigation measures). While in this document the threat exposure of  smart grid assets is being presented, asset owners may deepen their threat analysis and risk  assessment by using asset and threat details provided in this document. A deeper analysis will be  based on assessed threats, vulnerabilities and impact statements with regard to the concrete assets  participating in a smart grid infrastructure scenario (see also specific threats in section 5).  Moreover, the smart grid threat landscape will be of interest for policy makers: current threats and  threat trend may be important input in policy actions in the area of cyber-security, critical  infrastructure protection and smart grid in particular.  Through the large number of collected reports, the smart grid threat landscape provides a unique  collection of information regarding cyber-security threats. Hence, a further target group of this  document are individuals who would like to obtain access to these sources in order to use them for  their own purposes.  7  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:073:0009:0022:EN:PDF, accessed 3 December 2013.  8  defined in points 3.f and 18 of the Recommendation 2012/148/EU  9  \"Evaluation of available methodologies for a trustworthy network sharing vulnerabilities and threats analysis  of Smart Grid and Smart Metering systems among stakeholders\"  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:073:0009:0022:EN:PDF  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  3  Structure of this document  The rest of this document is organised as follows:   The rationale of the smart grid threat landscape is presented   A section that presents asset types that are typical for a smart grid environment. Moreover,  composite assets are being presented, covering various asset types as they are foreseen within  the Smart Grid Reference Architecture Model (SGAM)10;   A section on the threat categories smart grid assets are exposed to. In this section, smart grid  specific threats are presented as they emerged from the performed information collection and  analysis.   A section showing the smart grid asset types exposure to the threats and   A section showing which threats emerge from which threat agent groups.   A chapter with available smart grid security good practices indicating their protection against the  identified threats.   A conclusion summarizes various issues and gives an outlook of activities/open issues and  upcoming actions in this area.  It is worth mentioning that in order to keep the size of this text as short as possible and enhance  readability, detailed material is being provided by means of Annexes. This information is important  for smart grid owners who wish to perform risk assessment and/or adapt the proposed security  measures to their particular environment and needs.  10  http://ec.europa.eu/energy/gas_electricity/smartgrids/doc/xpert_group1_reference_architecture.pdf,  accessed 10 Sept 2013.  http://ec.europa.eu/energy/gas_electricity/smartgrids/doc/xpert_group1_reference_architecture.pdf  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  4  2 Method  In order to identify required protection levels of valuable assets it is common to perform a risk  assessment. Subsequently, security measures have to be introduced to achieve the target level of  protection by mitigating (part of) the assessed risks. As discussed below, threats are an important  element in risk assessment.  In this chapter we present the rationale and method followed within the Smart Grid Threat  Landscape (SGTL). It consists of a number of threats to which smart grid assets are exposed. Hence,  the presented SGTL is an important tool for those who want to assess the risks within a smart grid  environment. Based on these risks, appropriate security measures can be selected to achieve risk  mitigation.  The role of threats in the risk assessment activity becomes evident when looking at the components  of risks. According to the widely accepted ISO 27005 definition risks emerge when: “Threats abuse  vulnerabilities of assets to generate harm for the organization”. In more detailed terms, we consider  risk as taking into account the following elements:  Asset (Vulnerabilities, Controls), Threat (Threat Agent Profile, Likelihood) and Impact  The elements of risks are graphically depicted in the figure below:  Figure 1: Threats targeting an asset by trying to exploit its vulnerabilities.  This figure has been adopted from ISO 13335-4 and shows how threats try to exploit asset  vulnerabilities in order to harm/take over the asset. The asset owner has implemented security  measures to protect the asset, that is, to eliminate its vulnerabilities. The impact achieved by the  potential materialization of a threat is the final element to evaluate the risk of an asset (see also risk  definition above).  While the definition of risks for an asset is a quite straight forward task, in complex environments it  is often a challenge to assess risks. This is in particular the case in smart grids due to their technical  complexity, interdependencies among components, multiplicity in operational responsibilities and  Asset  T Threat  Vulnerability  Measure  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  5  complex supply processes. The present document is generic, hence it does not assume any particular  smart grid environment and/or the processes implemented through it. As such, it is impossible to  make any valid assumptions about impact and vulnerabilities of assets. These are activities that can  solely be performed by the asset owner. Hence, the need for supporting tools for the performance  of risk assessments becomes obvious and essential for the asset owner in this complex environment.  In this document, we provide information on threats and threat exposure of typical smart grid  assets, independently of any infrastructure scenarios. In other words, the smart grid Threat  Landscape consists of a list of assets, and the threats applying to these assets.  Further, by means of the presented good practices, we identify various security measures found in  smart grid security approaches. By mapping these measures against threats we show how security  measures are the used to avoid the assumed threat exposure.  Given this information, the asset owner will need to assess vulnerabilities and impact in order to  assess the risk and find risk mitigation measures (eventually among the ones from the processed  good practices).  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  6  3 Smart Grid Assets  A smart grid may consist of a plethora of asset types. For the sake of information security, we  consider assets that are mainly related to information and communication technology. Due to the  massive deployment of IT-based components in the area of electricity and transport network, some  assets that are characteristic for smart grids have been added. These assets generate or process data  and as such are exposed to cyber-security threats. In addition to the IT-assets, some non-IT assets  have been included that are tightly related to the proper operation of IT assets. Examples hereto  are: some electrical assets such as cables and relays, facilities, human resources, non-IT media, etc.  The figure bellow gives an overview of the smart grid assets structure into relevant categories  according to their use (see Figure 2). A more detailed description of these assets is given in Annex A.  Besides these smart grid assets, some composite, more complex assets have been identified. These  assets have been taken from the Smart Grid Architecture Model (SGAM)10. By considering these  assets, our intention is to take into account this standard, while at the same time showing the  decomposition of the SGAM10 assets by means of the assets of Figure 2. This will allow interested  individuals to find threats applying to such complex assets by cumulating the threats of their  counterparts.  Given the relatively young age of smart grid, it has to be taken as given that smart grid environments  might grow over what is today being considered to be part of a smart grid infrastructure. Examples  of such assets might be elements currently considered as part of Smart Cities11 and Smart Mobility12.  Indicatively for this type of assets, we have included a relevant part of e-Mobility in the smart grid  asset types. Hence, the asset taxonomy presented should be considered as a snapshot of the current  state-of-play and as such non-exhaustive.  11  http://www.smart-cities.eu/press-ressources.html, accessed 5 September 2013.  12  http://www.mobincity.eu/, accessed 5 September 2013.  http://www.smart-cities.eu/press-ressources.html http://www.mobincity.eu/  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  7  Smart Grid  Hardware  Software  Infrastructure  Services  Persons  Information  Inventory of  Electrical Assets  Operational  information about  Electrical Assets  Historical  Information  Trending  Information  Trading  Information  System  Configuration  Cables  Relays  Transformers  Power Switches  Earth Switches  Status  Alerts  Events  Shortage/Disturbance  Information  Network  Topology  IP Address  Allocation  Inventory of  MAC Addresses  Security Parameters  User Permissions  Configuration Files  Geolocation  Applications  Standard Software  Operating System  Device Driver  Firmware  Database  Web Server  Office Suite  File  Mail  Terminal  Print  Network  Name  Address  Authentication  SaaS (Cloud)  IasS (Cloud)  Smart Grid  Smart  Meter  Server  Client  Network  Media  Displays  HID  Keyboard  Mouse  Monitor  Beamer  SSD  Mag.

The threats included in this  collection of threats are all applicable to the smart grid assets presented in the previous section. The  presented threat taxonomy covers mainly cyber-security threats, that is, threats applying to  information and communication technology assets. Some additional non-IT threats have been  assumed in order to cover threats to physical assets that are necessary to operate the considered  ICT-assets. It is worth mentioning that the presented threats are a consolidation of threats from the  ENISA Threat Landscape13 and threats used within a smart grid assessment performed by DG  CONNECT14. Moreover, the threats presented reflect the experience made within the ENISA Annual  Incident Report 2012 regarding incidents in the telecommunication sector 15 . This report is  considered relevant, as attack methods and threats in smart grid and the telecommunication sector  are considered to be very similar (i.e. as applying to similar IT-assets).  The threats presented in Figure 3 are an overview. A detailed listing of these threats can be found in  Annex B. This material contains additional information on threats such as:   Threat details: this field explains further details of a threat as they have been found in analysed  material on cyber-threats.   Threat Agent: This field explains which threat agent group is considered to deploy attacks based  on this threat.   Trend: This field indicates assessed trends for each particular threat. Such trends have been  assessed by analysing publicly available threat reports. Threats that do not have a value in the  trend field are not subject of ENISA Threat Landscape. They are mentioned because they might  be potentially useful for risk assessments.  It should be noted, that the details presented reflect the current state of play within the ENISA  Threat Landscape16 and are subject to changes according to new developments in that area and  emerging threat issues (i.e. being a living document reflecting dynamic changes in the cyber-threat  environment).  13  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/ENISA_Threat_Landscape,  accessed 5 September 2013.  14  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?action=display&doc_id=1763, accessed 5  September 2013.  15  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports- 2012/at_download/fullReport, accessed 5 September 2013.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/ENISA_Threat_Landscape http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?action=display&doc_id=1763 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2012/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2012/at_download/fullReport  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  10  Figure 3: Overview of threats assumed for smart grid assets  Threats  Deliberate  physical  attacks  Unintentional  data damage  Failures,  Malfunction  Eavesdropping,  Interception,  Hijacking  Legal  Nefarious  Activity, Abuse  Outages  Damage, Loss  of IT assets  Natural  Disaster  Identity theft  Unsolicited e-mail  Denial of service  Malicious code, activity  Social Engineering  Abuse of Information Leakage  Generation and use of rogue certificates  Manipulation of HW and SW  Manipulation of information  Misuse of audit tools  Falsification of records  Misuse of information, information systems  Unauthorised use of administration  Unauthorised access to systems  Unauthorised software installation  Unauthorised use of software  Compromising confidential information  Abuse of authorizations  Hoax  Badware  Remore activity (execution)  Targeted attacks  Lack of resources  Energy outage  Shortage of personnel  Strike  Loss of support services  Internet outage  Network outage  Damage by third party  Damage, corruption from testing  Integrity loss of information  Loss of devices, media, documents  Destruction of records, devices, media  Information leakage  Natural disaster  Environmental disaster  Fire  Flood  Polution, dust, corrosion  Thunder stroke  Unfavourable climatic conditions  Major environmental events  Bomb attack, threat  Sabotage  Vandalism  Theft (device, media)  Information leakage, sharing  Unauthorised physical access  Erroneous information  sharing, lekage  Erroneous use or adminisration  of devices, systems  Usage of information  from unreliable source  Unintentional alteration of data  Inadequate design,  planning, adaptation  Failures of devices and services  Failure, disruption of  communication links  Failure, disruption of main  sypply functions  Failure, disruption of  service providers  Malfunction of devices,  systems  War driving  Intercepting,  compromizing emissions  Interception of information  Interferring radiation  Replay of messages  Network  reconnaissance,  information gathering  Man in the middle,  session hijacking  Repudiation of actions  Violation of laws, breach of legislation  Failure to meet contractual agreements  Unauthorized use of copyright material  Fraud  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  11  5 Specific Smart Grid Threats  By analysing existing literature on smart grid security (see references and collected information in  Annex D), we have identified specific threats that have been taken into account in existing  assessments. The analysed material covers parts of smart grid infrastructure, in particular smart  meters and some generic smart grid infrastructures within research projects. Thus, the specific smart  grid threats presented in this section reflect the state-of-play in relevant available documents and,  as such, are not exhaustive. Due to the complexity of smart grid infrastructures, one should argue  that the set of threats presented in this chapter still have relevance for prospective infrastructure  configurations and should be considered within risk assessments when relevant assets are part of  the scenario at hand.  The specific smart grids encountered in the analysed literature are structured according to the  categories mentioned in Figure 3. They are presented by means of threat details of particular threats  and threat groups. It should be noted that the sequence of the specific smart grid threats presented  below is not prioritized. This is because the analysed material has not provided any information that  would allow prioritizing threats. Given the fact that no significant experience exists in this domain  from existing implementations (i.e. through incident statistics in this area), no attempt has been  undertaken to introduce any priorities for these threats. For obtaining a priority list of current cyber- threats, we suggest interested readers to visit the ENISA Threat Landscape report16,17,18.  In the presentation of specific smart grid threats below, we use the same threat classification as the  one used in Figure 3.  Threat Group: Damage/Loss  Threat: Loss of devices, media and documents  In smart grid environments this threat involves rummaging through disposed magnetic media for  retrieving sensitive data that is left behind on it. In particular, it is assumed that unauthorized people  might come to possession of data related to Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI)  communication19.  Threat: Information leakage  Attacks of this type target various smart grid components and their main aim is to acquire private  sensitive information (energy consumption, credit cards, session data, access control data)19,20.  Threat Group: Eavesdropping/Interception/Hijacking  Threat: Interfering radiation  Electro ‐Magnetic/ Radio Frequency interception is a threat that aims at performing unauthorized  interception of private communication. In particular, it is assumed that unauthorized people might  come to possession of data related to Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) communication19.  16  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat- environment/ENISA_Threat_Landscape/at_download/fullReport, accessed 11 Nov 2013.  17  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat- landscape-mid-year-2013/at_download/fullReport, accessed 11 Nov 2103.  18  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat- landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats/at_download/fullReport, accessed 11 Dec  2013.  19  http://www.energy.ca.gov/2013publications/CEC-500-2013-056/CEC-500-2013-056.pdf, accessed 11 Nov  2013.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/ENISA_Threat_Landscape/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/ENISA_Threat_Landscape/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-mid-year-2013/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-mid-year-2013/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats/at_download/fullReport http://www.energy.ca.gov/2013publications/CEC-500-2013-056/CEC-500-2013-056.pdf  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  12  This threat materialises when threat agents are trying to interfere with the physical transmission and  reception of wireless communications. It is one of the most efficient ways to launch physical-layer  DoS attacks, especially targeting wireless communications. This can severely impact smart grid  operations as they use wireless communication for various tasks20.  Another threat of this type in smart grid regards the extraction of data by analysis of various types of  electromagnetic radiation emitted by a CPU, display, keyboard, etc. In case of smart grids, these  attacks are viable because equipment is installed in the field, geographically distributed and they are  accessible19.  Threat: Man in the middle, session hijacking  In smart grid environments, interactions of AMI components with the infrastructure can be  compromised. That could lead to unauthorized access to AMI communication information,  modification of AMI data, denial of service to authorized users, and repudiation of actions19.  Threat: Interception of information  Through interception of information several networks of different natures can be affected, such as  WIFI, Zegbee and fixed networks. Particular variations of this threat may include:   Hijacking of the meter connection though a kind of unauthorized devices / messages to  communicate with the DR system19.   Intercepting information by side-channel attacks. Such attacks are based on physical accessibility  (Substation, smart meters, collectors, etc.) to gain information from the physical implementation  of a cryptosystem as the components of the smart grid are geographically distributed.   Intercepting and examining messages in order to deduce information from patterns in  communication20.   Sniffer attacks whereby an attacker with the appropriate access captures and analyses the  messages transmitted over the network19,20,21.   Use of External Traffic with the aim to intercepting and examining messages in order to deduce  information from patterns in communication19.  Threat: Network reconnaissance and information gathering  Information gathering attacks of mobile communication (in particular 802.16e) may target the  Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cipher providing strong confidentiality on user data19.  Threat: Replay of messages  Acknowledges forgery is a threat where an attacker knows the DNS value and can send a false  acknowledgement messages to the sender saying that the receiver has received the message when,  in fact, it hasn't19.  Threat Group: Failures/Malfunction  Threat: Failure of devices and systems  Given the complexity of smart grids and the multiplicity of devices and systems, it should be taken as  given that a significant amount of incidents will be attributed to failures, misconfiguration and  20  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistir/ir7628/introduction-to-nistir-7628.pdf, accessed 11 Nov 2013.  21 http://www.ece.ncsu.edu/netwis/papers/13wl-comnet.pdf, accessed 11 Von 2013.  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistir/ir7628/introduction-to-nistir-7628.pdf http://www.ece.ncsu.edu/netwis/papers/13wl-comnet.pdf  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  13  errors. This has been confirmed by incidents communicated to ENISA in the area of  telecommunications22, a sector with equally complex infrastructure.  Threat: Failure or disruption of communication links (communication networks)  Attacks abusing implementations of standards are based on missing or weak implementations of  security mechanisms, in particular when standards used have not been developed with security in  mind23.  Threat Group: Nefarious Activity/Abuse  Threat: Unsolicited e-mail  Personnel engaged by various players in smart grid can be victims of anonymous, unsolicited e-mail  attacks. This might be part of a targeted campaign20.  Threat: Denial of Service attacks  These attacks attempt to make smart grid resources unavailable to its intended users (internal and  external). They can target to different layers of network and applications (physical / data-link)20,21.  Such attacks can be also performed by jamming the power-line24.  Threat: Manipulation of hard- and software  Through manipulation, an attacker may manipulate scheduling by disabling antenna and changing  Programmable Communicating Thermostat (PCT) Time locally19. In particular:   Break into EWS, use engineering software to access field controllers and change their logic24.   Get access to the operator station and perform targeted operator actions to stop all machines24.   Manipulation of firmware of smart e-meters. This may include manipulated firmware that is sent  from Central System to E-meter of manipulated firmware that is sent from Central system (via  Data Concentrator)24.   Compromise Central Systems to (1) switch off homes with E-meters; (2) delete all keys for the E- meters; and (3) distribute malicious firmware24.  Threat: Malicious code /Activity  These threats affect smart grid as all the functioning of all involved IT components depends on the  installed software. In detail, this threat consists of:   Exploit kits are a widely deployed form attack. Through exploit kits virus and malware infections  are performed.  Infected devices may be manipulated by the attacker. Malware infected  operator stations may send targeted commands to DCS Server to disturb or manipulate they  operation24.   In smart grid, worms may be distributed by using the network to send copies to other nodes  (computers on the network)19. Worms may affect the operation of all smart grid components  connected to the network.   Trojans are pieces of malware that facilitate unauthorized access to a computer system19.  Worms may affect the operation of all smart grid components connected to the network.  22  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual- incident-reports-2012/at_download/fullReport, accessed 11 Nov 2013.  23  http://www.etsi.org/WebSite/document/0905_RA%20smart%20grids-Bdef.pdf, accessed 11 Nov 2013.  24  Crisalis Project EU (http://www.crisalis-project.eu/), Deliverable D2.2 Final Requirement Definition.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2012/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2012/at_download/fullReport http://www.etsi.org/WebSite/document/0905_RA%20smart%20grids-Bdef.pdf http://www.crisalis-project.eu/  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  14   Backdoor / trapdoor is an undocumented entry point into a computer program, which is  generally inserted by a programmer to allow access to the program19. Vendors of smart meters,  for example, may have installed firmware with backdoors or some hidden functionality24 to  facilitate access to the device.   Service Spoofing is an attack in which the adversary successfully masquerades as another by  falsifying data and thereby gaining an illegitimate advantage19. A concrete example of spoofing is  ARP spoofing in the MAC layer: the management frames are not authenticated in 802.11. Every  frame has a source address. The attackers take advantage of the spoofed frame to redirect the  traffic and corrupt the ARP tables19.   With an ICMP-flooding attack, an adversary can flood a gateway with ICMP packets, thereby  creating difficulties in the operation of clients associated to the same IP to send and receive  packet.  A special case of a malicious activity that is leading to numerous incidents in all environments is that  of “insider threat”. With this approach, adversaries would take advantage of access to systems at the  operator’s end of the AMI system. The systems that the insider may be able to access include  multiple appliances of a smart grid environment, including AMI, the system containing pricing  information (either EMS or ICCP server to an ISO or generation entity), as well as the network  infrastructure supporting those systems. Which malicious activity an insider uses, depends on their  access to the various smart grid systems19.  Threat: Unauthorized access to information system / network  External disclosure of information is an attack occurring when information is being disclosed to  unauthorized entities. Smart grids manage privacy data, hence this threat is relevant in this  environment.  Regarding the unauthorized access to systems/network, the attacker may gain unauthorized access  to the information system / network from different locations19,21,25 of the smart grid such as:   Customer endpoint: There is a potential for AMI to allow access to the bulk electric grid from the  residential or small business customer endpoint. The adversary can suborn the customer  endpoint, intervene in wireless communication between the AMI meter and other endpoint  equipment, or from the AMI meter to the local concentrator. These attacks will expose the head  end equipment and systems to which the head end are connected. The exact details of this  attack are greatly dependent on the implementation of AMI, particularly at the head end.  Certain configurations would allow an attacker to affect the bulk electric grid.  Through violation of the privacy of the consumer (1) disclose meter data or configuration data  (Meter, Gateway or CLS configuration) or parts of it when transmitted between gateway and  external entities in the WAN; (2) disclose meter data transmitted between the TOE and the  meter. This threat is of specific importance if meters of more than one consumer are served by  one gateway27.   Remote access: Unauthorized remote access to SCADA systems via remote access from outside  the smart grid network.   Remote access or physical access to the network: compromise DCS Server and disturb / disable  communication with controllers in the field network24. Compromise DCS Server and send  commands to control and manipulate the configuration (parameters) of controllers. Compromise  25  http://www.ijsgce.com/uploadfile/2012/1011/20121011121836539.pdf, accessed 11 Nov 2013.  http://www.ijsgce.com/uploadfile/2012/1011/20121011121836539.pdf  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  15  DCS Server and stop communication with Operator Station (stop delivery of data to Operator  Station)24. Compromise RTU and send commands directly to controller24.  Threat: Manipulation of information  This threat includes all kinds of manipulative activity regarding smart grid information, in particular  AMI data and repudiation related information (e.g. AMI data, pricing information, invoicing  information, etc.). This threat relates to information of all software used, but also certificates19,20.  This threat might be deployed by means of the following methods:   Through buffer overflow attacks by inserting an incorrect value in the message fields, thus  affecting message processing or sets the DFC flag. This might cause, for example, an outstation  device to appear busy to the master. These attacks can result in data corruption, unexpected  actions and device crashes21.   Load redistribution attack is an injection of realistic false data with limited access to specific  measurement data26.   Delivery of wrong data to operator station that looks valid and harmless24.   Manipulation of data received from TSO plant will cause working with wrong values, thus  affecting the operation of RTU24.   Manipulation of data sent to TSO and Energy Management Center, thus affecting the operation  of RTU24.   Attacker compromises an existing data concentrator and causes sending wrong data to the  central system24.   Attacker alters meter data when transmitted between meter and Gateway, Gateway and  consumer or Gateway and external entities. The objective can be to alter billing-relevant  information or grid status information; the attack may be performed via any interface (e.g. LMN,  HAN or WAN)27.   Attacker alters meter data, gateway configuration data, meter configuration data, CLS  configuration data or a firmware update when transmitted between the gateway and an  external entity in the Wan27.   False data are injected by an attacker in the smart grid traffic. The attacker injects false or  malicious DR events in DRAS (Demand Response Automation Server), causing blackouts and  instability of the grid. Attacker modifies configuration data in the DRAS such as DR program data,  customer list and shed event information, affecting the DR program behavior19.   Through time modification of the Gateway time attackers aim at changing the relation between  date / time measured consumption or production values in the meter data records27.  Threat: Misuse of information/Information Systems  In the absence of end-to-end encryption, a compromised data concentrator can be misused to  monitor data of other customers24 .  26  http://www.iitmicrogrid.net/event/greatlake2012/publication/PPTs/32- Smart%20Grid%20Monitoring%20and%20Cyber%20Security/32-ZuyiLi- Load%20Redistribution%20Attacks%20and%20Protection%20Strategy%20in%20Electric%20Power%20Syste ms.pdf, accessed 11 Nov 2013.  27  https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/SmartMeter/PP- SmartMeter.pdf?__blob=publicationFile, accessed 11 Nov 2013.  http://www.iitmicrogrid.net/event/greatlake2012/publication/PPTs/32-Smart%20Grid%20Monitoring%20and%20Cyber%20Security/32-ZuyiLi-Load%20Redistribution%20Attacks%20and%20Protection%20Strategy%20in%20Electric%20Power%20Systems.pdf http://www.iitmicrogrid.net/event/greatlake2012/publication/PPTs/32-Smart%20Grid%20Monitoring%20and%20Cyber%20Security/32-ZuyiLi-Load%20Redistribution%20Attacks%20and%20Protection%20Strategy%20in%20Electric%20Power%20Systems.pdf http://www.iitmicrogrid.net/event/greatlake2012/publication/PPTs/32-Smart%20Grid%20Monitoring%20and%20Cyber%20Security/32-ZuyiLi-Load%20Redistribution%20Attacks%20and%20Protection%20Strategy%20in%20Electric%20Power%20Systems.pdf http://www.iitmicrogrid.net/event/greatlake2012/publication/PPTs/32-Smart%20Grid%20Monitoring%20and%20Cyber%20Security/32-ZuyiLi-Load%20Redistribution%20Attacks%20and%20Protection%20Strategy%20in%20Electric%20Power%20Systems.pdf https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/SmartMeter/PP-SmartMeter.pdf?__blob=publicationFile https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/SmartMeter/PP-SmartMeter.pdf?__blob=publicationFile  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  16  Threat Group: Physical attack  Threat: Fraud  Within a reverse engineering attack, the customer at an endpoint would achieve reduction of cost of  electric and/or natural gas use. They would use information freely available from the AMI meter  vendor or the standard used within AMI meters to reset the meter and reprogram it to report false  information. If the information is not freely available, the attacker would reverse‐engineer a meter  to develop a way to modify it. This is very similar to the many cable modem attacks that are openly  available. Either the configuration settings from the utility or the actual firmware controlling the  operation of the meter would be modified in this attack24. With the same objective, AMI meters can  be removed from one home and placed to another24.  6 Smart Grid assets exposure to cyber threats  In this section the threat exposure of smart grid assets is presented. The association between  assumed threats from Figure 3 and assets from Figure 2 is established through Table 2 below. As  such, this table shows the threat exposure of assets and can be used as guidance in identification of  security needs. This table has been used within the document “Appropriate Security Measures”28  that have been developed by ENISA on behalf of EG2 working group of the Commission29.

For smart grid asset owners it is considered important  to know which threats emerge from which threat agent group. This information is significant to  decide on the kind of risks that should be mitigated: threat agent groups are indicative of the  determination behind launched attacks and capability level. Given the importance of smart grids and  the potential impact of attacks, smart grid asset owners will need to spend some thoughts on which  protection might be appropriate in order to avoid exposure to attacks from a certain type of threat  agent. The threat agents considered within this document are as follows:   Corporations: This kind of threat refers to corporations/organizations/enterprises that adopt  and/or are engaged in offensive tactics. In this context, corporations are considered as hostile  threat agents and their motivation is to build competitive advantage over competitors, who also  make up their main target. Depending on their size and sector, corporations usually possess  significant capabilities, ranging from technology up to human engineering intelligence, especially  in their area of expertise.   Cybercriminals: Cybercriminals are hostile by nature. Moreover, their motivation is usually  financial gain and their skill level is, nowadays, quite high. Cybercriminals can be organised on a  local, national or even international level. It should be taken as given, that a certain degree of  networking between cybercriminals is being maintained.   Employees: This category refers to the staff, contractors, operational staff or security guards of a  company. They can have insider access to company’s resources and they are considered as both  non-hostile threat agents (i.e. distracted employees) as well as hostile ones (i.e. disgruntled  employees). This kind of threat agents possesses a significant amount of knowledge that allows  them to place effective attacks against assets of their organization.   Hacktivists: Hacktivists are politically and socially motivated individuals that use computer  systems in order to protest and promote their cause. Moreover, they are usually targeting high  profile websites, corporations, intelligence agencies and military institutions.   Nation States: Nation states can have offensive cyber capabilities and use them against an  adversary. Nation states have recently become a prominent threat agent due to the deployment  of sophisticated attacks that are considered as cyber weapons. From the sophistication of these  malware it can be confirmed that nation states have a plethora of resources and they have a  high level of skills and expertise.   Natural disasters: Natural disasters are also threat agents and organizations are influenced by  them, as they can cause potential physical damage. Natural disasters include lightning, fires,  floods, earthquakes, windstorms etc. Although not a human threat agent, natural disasters are  considered as such, as they can cause severe physical damage and impact the availability of  information systems.   Terrorists: Terrorists have expanded their activities and engage also in cyber-attacks. Their  motivation can be political or religious and their capability varies from low to high. Preferred  targets of cyber terrorists are mostly critical infrastructures (e.g. public health, energy  production, telecommunication etc.), as their failures causes severe impact in society and  government. It has to be noted, that in the public material analyses, the profile of cyber  terrorists still seems to be blurry.  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  22   Cyber fighters: an emerging phenomenon is that of patriotic motivated groups of citizens with  the potential to launch cyber-attacks30. Such groups might have strong feelings when their  political, national or religious values seem to be threatened by another group and are capable of  launching cyber-attacks31. Having said that, one can argue that such groups are special cases  (maybe an evolution or yet another instance) of hacktivism. To an extent, such groups may be  supporters of totalitarian regimes and, rightly or wrongly, act on behalf of their supporting  parties (i.e. governments) by contributing to national activities in the cyber-space32. Their  activities may include conflicts with other groups (i.e. hacktivists)33.  Based on these short threat agent profiles, the threats presented in this document can be assigned  to relevant groups. This assignment is based on the threat agent group profile and in particular on  assumed motives. Table 3 below presents the potential involvement of threat agent groups in the  threats considered for smart grid assets.  Corporation  Cyber- criminals  Employee s  Hackti- vists  Nation  States  Natural  Disasters  Terrorists  Cyber  fighters  Physical attacks  √  √  Unintentional  damage  √  Failures /  Malfunction  √ √ √ √  √  Eavesdropping  / Interception /  Hacking  √ √ √ √ √  √ √  Legal  √  Nefarious  activity / abuse  √ √ √ √ √  √ √  Outages  √  √ √  Damage / Loss  (IT-Assets)  √ √ √ √ √  √ √  Disaster  √ √  Table 3: Involvement of Threat Agents in the threats  30  http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/06/iranian-elections-bring-lull-in-bank-attacks/ ,  accessed 13 Nov 2013.  31  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2313652/AP-Twitter-hackers-break-news-White-House- explosions-injured-Obama.html  32  http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-hacktivism.pdf  33  http://mashable.com/2012/08/10/syrian-electronic-army/  http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/06/iranian-elections-bring-lull-in-bank-attacks/ http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2313652/AP-Twitter-hackers-break-news-White-House-explosions-injured-Obama.html http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2313652/AP-Twitter-hackers-break-news-White-House-explosions-injured-Obama.html http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-hacktivism.pdf http://mashable.com/2012/08/10/syrian-electronic-army/  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  23  8 Vulnerabilities and Risks in Smart Grid  In this section some reflections are provided on smart grid vulnerabilities and risks. Before going into  the findings, one should note that both developments of smart grid infrastructures and smart grid  security are at an early stage of maturity. This is mainly because not very many such infrastructures  are operational for a sufficient period such that experiences have been gained, analysed and shared.  On the other hand, smart grid developments and security assessments are in many cases managed  confidentially, either for reasons of competitiveness or for security reasons. Hence, publicly available  information on smart grid security issues originates from research and standardisation activities and  is based on requirements and generic assumptions. The validation of this material through real-life  experience/examples is currently not feasible, at least at European level.  Due to the immense investments that are necessary to set up a smart grid environment,  standardisation activities are an important issue towards security of investments. Hence, a big  amount of effort is currently invested in standardisation activities. Such activities are based on  generic assumptions (i.e. infrastructure components, scenarios, security requirements, etc.) and are  aiming at establishing a context that will serve as basis for industrial developments.  Having said that, some interesting information on vulnerabilities and risk has been found in the  collected documents20,24,25. Given the general situation in smart grids the following vulnerabilities  and risks were assessed:   Smart grid vulnerabilities: Currently, vulnerabilities assumed within smart grid environments  related to some areas that are not differentiated from other IT systems. In particular we have  seen vulnerabilities related to the areas25: of customer security, physical security (in particular of  publicly accessible devices), implicit trust between used components, teams with different skills  and competences, involvement of multiple stakeholders (supply chain issues).  Further, through to the utilization of wireless communication, relevant components might be  vulnerable to threats targeting such components. Besides typical vulnerabilities in the area of  wireless communication34, some relevant material can be found in20. In the same document a  number of generic non-smart grid related vulnerabilities can also be found.  Concluding, one should mention that in the public domain there is a lack of information of  vulnerabilities related to smart grid specific infrastructures, scenarios and components. There  are some European projects that would cover this gap24. Also the analysis has identified a  Spanish Centre35 that is currently working in two European projects related with vulnerabilities  in smart grids: n-SHIELD (www.newshield.eu/) and RISC (DG-HOME CIPS call).   Smart grid risks: Regarding smart grid risks, only one document has been found that provides a  comprehensive assessment of risks24. The risks assessed are related to the unavailability of some  key smart grid components such as DCS and RTU; and AMI related components such as data  concentrators, smart meters and central system to control and manage smart meters. The risks  related to key smart grid components are mainly impact the stability and availability of the smart  grid through manipulations in hard- and software (see nefarious activity, eavesdropping, and  physical attack threat groups in Figure 3).  Risks assessed for AMI are related to manipulation of components by users in order to perform  fraud (i.e. primarily manipulating billing information and secondary affect operations of multiple  meters). (see nefarious activity, eavesdropping, and physical attack threat groups in Figure 3).  34  Vast amount of material does exist in this area.

As already stated, more assessments  will be necessary, ideally based on real infrastructures (even at the level of a laboratory) in order  to achieve a better maturity in the implementation of smart grid cyber security measures.  Concluding, one should note that due to the fact that a smart grid is a system of systems, it is  important to understand the dependencies among involved components. Certainly, work that has  been done in the area of SCADA is highly relevant to smart grid environments. Moreover, with  increasing proliferation of mobile devices in industrial systems work on mobile security is another  important part of such a complex system. Hence, vulnerability and risk assessment will depend on  the particular mix of components, processes and human infrastructure involved in a particular  scenario.  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  25  9 Good Practice of Smart Grid Security Measures  In order to elaborate on good practices we took stock of publicly available smart grid security  approaches. In doing so, existing literature has been analysed and security measures/controls  proposed by these approaches have been identified. The security measures have been categorised  in:   Security measures related to IT Systems and Logical Networks used within smart grid infrastructures: Such  measures are related to assets such as Wide Area Networks, Gateways, Home Area Network (HAN) and  Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4) protocol, Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), Master Terminal Unit (MTU) and  Remote Terminal Unit (RTU)   Security measures related to Supply Chain of smart grid: Such measures are related to Providers,  Distribution and Logistics and Customers.  In the following sections, the identified security measures are presented with indication of their  origin.  In summary it is noticeable that three existing good practices provide a comprehensive set of  security measures19,20,36,. The majority of other documents analysed cover only a relatively small part  of security measures21,37,38,39,40,41,42. This is quite natural thought, as this material is dedicated to  some specific portions of smart grid infrastructure.  ENISA has also performed some work on security measures for smart grid. A report has been  published on the minimum security measures for smart grids in 201243. Based on this report, ENISA,  in collaboration with the Commission, has initiated a number of consultations with both private and  public sector stakeholders, under the umbrella of EG229, aiming at delivering a report with a set of  smart grid appropriate cyber security measures which might end up to a Commission  Recommendation on minimum cyber security requirements for smart grids in 2014. Both the ENISA  report on minimum security measures and the contribution to EG2 are not covered within this good  practice guide. The coverage of security measures proposed by ENISA with regard to threats  mentioned in the present document can be found in the ENISA contribution to EG2 and are not  repeated in this report.  The identified security measures are then mapped to the threats, completing thus the picture  between threat exposure and proposed security measure.

Best practices related to security measures for  protection of IT systems and logical networks are:  1. Align cyber-security to the organization’s overall IT strategy based on the defined risk  profile19,20.  2. Establish a rigorous, on-going risk management process19,20.  3. Establish effective configuration management process19.  4. Utilities to formally publish internal security program (policies, guidelines, procedures) and  ensure compliance19,20.  5. Develop cyber-security around IEC 6235119,20.  6. Adopt the security measures regarding the defined SGIS Security Levels (SGIS-SL)19.  7. Adopt the defined smart grid Data Protection classes (SG-DPC) 19.  8. Document network architecture and identify systems that serve critical functions or contain  sensitive information that require additional levels of protection19,20.  9. Conduct routine self-assessments19.  10. Ensure Interoperability and Testing/Certification19,20.  11. Implement a Security View per Layer, that is, establish a network protection strategy based on  the principle of defence-in-depth19,20.  12. Establish 24-hour-a-day incident monitoring and logging and audit systems20,37.  13. Implement attack mitigation mechanisms and network security proactive measures: prevention,  detection and analysis of vulnerabilities, correlation of events, etc19,20,21.  14. Implement internal and external Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Attack detection  tools20,21,37.  15. Establish incident response mechanisms: a breach is inevitable since no system can be 100%  secure. Incident response procedures must be developed so that it is used in the event of an  incident. Incident response includes disaster-recovery and business-continuity plans19,20.  16. Maintain safe start, stop and fail modes for smart grid components: systems shall be capable of  operating in an operational or non-operational state according to some policies. These may  include activities allowed during initialization state, management functions necessary for  element configuration, policy establishment and security domain establishment. The system  shall transition into the operational state only upon completion of the critical initialization  activities. The system shall transition into the non-operational state upon detection of a critical  failure and transition into the operational state when the critical failure has been solved. At this  point, the system shall be able to operating in a degraded mode while in an operational state.  Also, supporting activities pertaining to the health of the system (e.g., diagnostics, maintenance,  training, etc.) shall only be allowed during the operational state19,20.  17. Establish system backups and disaster recovery plans19,20.  18. Apply regular updates: applying software patches on a regular basis to the SCADA operation  system, applications and components in the smart grid19,20.  19. Removing or disabling unnecessary services37,20.  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  27  20. Perform technical audits of SCADA devices and networks, and any other connected networks, to  identify security concerns: analyse identified vulnerabilities to determine their significance, and  take corrective actions as appropriate. Track corrective actions and analyse this information to  identify trends. Additionally, retest systems after corrective actions have been taken to ensure  that vulnerabilities were actually eliminated. Scan non-production environments actively to  identify and address potential problems37.  21. Conduct physical security surveys and assess all remote sites connected to the SCADA network  to evaluate their security37.  22. Identify and develop a comprehensive understanding of all connections to SCADA networks and  evaluate and strengthen the security of these connections in order to protect them: internal  local area and wide area networks, including business networks, Internet, wireless network  devices, including satellite uplinks, modem or dial-up connections, connections to business  partners, vendors or regulatory agencies, etc37,19. Some security measures can be adopted to  protect these connections, such as, conduct penetration testing or vulnerability analysis, use of  firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), and other appropriate security measures at each  point of entry37,20.  23. Disconnect unnecessary connections to the SCADA network or isolate the SCADA network from  other network connections: isolate the SCADA network from other networks as possible using  “Demilitarized Zones” (DMZs) and data warehousing19,37.  24. Establish strong controls over any medium that is used as a backdoor into the SCADA  network19,37.  25. Do not rely on proprietary protocols to protect your system: additionally, demand that vendors  disclose any backdoors or vendor interfaces to your SCADA systems, and expect them to  provide systems that are capable of being secured37.  26. Implant Identification, Authentication and Access Control to all network devices, systems and  users19,20,21.  27. Support of biometric authentication for user access to critical components 19,20.  28. Establish a Role-based Access Control (RBAC): roles or responsibilities that a subject or a user  has within the organization and on rules which determine what access rights are permitted for  the subject in a given role. Clearly define cyber security roles, responsibilities, and authorities  for managers, system administrators, and users19,20.  29. Establish an Access Control List (ACL) and a Discretionary Access Control (DAC): list of  permissions associated with an object that is used to specify which subjects, users, process,  components or systems are allowed to access that particular object as well as which operations  the subject can perform on that particular object19,20.  30. Establish the necessary Capability Lists (CL): list of objects associated with the permission to it19.  31. Establish a Mandatory Access Control (MAC): access policy used in multiple-level systems that  require highly sensitive data19,20.  32. Data Classification and Retention: data classification refers to classifying data according their  security (confidentiality, integrity, or availability) level. Retention refers to how long data is kept  before destroyed19.  33. Define a strong Password Requirements and Guidelines and follow them19,20.  34. Follow a correct policy of Control Key Management: all cryptographic keys, load control  commands and network management commands must be encrypted before being shared on  the network and only the intended recipients must possess the decryption keys19,20.  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  28  35. Protect sensitive information using cryptographic functions to avoid external or not authorized  access to it19,20,21. Sensitive information should be assessed by means of proper risk assessment.  36. Encrypt consumer usage data: only entities that are authorized to view the data possess the  decryption keys19,20.  37. Keep personally identifiable information in a minimum number of systems from which it may be  securely accessed19,20.  38. Encrypt the application level load control commands with the trust centre link key: Replay  protection will be provided for this command by using a monotonically increasing sequence  number19.  39. Use Smart Energy Profile 2 (SEP 2) protocol: end-to-end Network Authentication and  Authorization. Application Authentication (ACL). Authorization context (HTTPS, TLS). Digital  Signatures ECDSA-SHA256 and X.509v3 Certificates. Cryptography: ECDHE, ECDSA, AES12820,38.  40. The network key will be exchanged only with devices that successfully complete the join  procedure: the join procedure requires the joining devices to establish a shared secret with the  trust centre and use that to initiate communications. The shared key must be derived from the  device installation code and shared with the trust centre using a secure out-of-band  mechanism. Once the device joins the network successfully, the trust centre sends it the  network key encrypted with the shared secret19.  41. Avoid any unnecessary trade-offs between privacy and legitimate objectives of smart grid  projects19.  42. Visible and transparent to consumers — engaging in accountable business practices — to  ensure that new smart grid systems operate according to stated objectives19,20.  43. Make privacy a core functionality in the design and architecture of smart grid systems and  practices19,20.  44. Build in privacy end-to-end, throughout the entire life cycle of any personal information  collected19,20.  45. The trust centre must ensure availability: the centre must implement mechanisms for high  availability including protection from denial of service attacks, resource starvation, or network  congestion19,20.  Some best practices are related to specific asset type, such as Wireless Neighbourhood Area  Network (WNAN), Demand Response (DR) systems, Gateway, Home Area Network (HAN), Advanced  Metering Infrastructure (AMI), or Master Terminal Unit (MTU).

Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  35  10 Conclusions  Based on the experience gained within this activity, a number of issues have been identified that are  worth further elaboration and/or action from relevant stakeholders. In particular:   Develop attack scenarios for smart grid components. The next step towards facilitating risk  assessments for smart grid infrastructures would be to develop some kind of threat  intelligence in the form of attack scenarios.   Elaborate on criticality assessment. Stakeholders have expressed the necessity to develop  criteria that allow assessing criticality of smart grid components. This would facilitate impact  identification and necessary protection levels.   Develop assessments for various scenarios. It seems to be very advantageous to come up with  some smart grid scenarios. Risk assessments would contribute to the specification of  appropriate security measures for these scenarios.   Elaborate on levels of impact for smart grid incidents. Discussions with stakeholders have  shown the need to define impact thresholds for incidents in the area of smart grids. Such  thresholds would be important parameters for the definition of security levels, identification  and management of critical situations, etc.   As in all CIIP areas, words matter: develop and maintain smart grid security terms and  definitions.   Establish better coordination of European/International activities in the area of smart grids,  including standardisation. Currently, various activities are on-going in this area, involving  multiple organisations and stakeholders. It is important to identify common areas and  coordinate the agendas. This will enable coherence and exploitation of synergies.   Elaborate on the overlapping issues of safety vs. security: smart grid is a traditional  engineering sector in which safety standards are implemented. Cyber security overlaps with  safety as it concerns the operation of parts of the grid. These overlaps need to be identified  and interfaces need to be established.   Establish a platform for information exchange on smart grid security. Following the  coordination of activities, it is important to establish the platform for information flow. This  will enable coherence and exploitation of synergies.   Initiate a debate on need/importance maturity/compliance/certification approaches for (areas  of) smart grid security. As in any industrial area, and in particular in CIIP, it is important to  discuss the importance in setting criteria for measuring security maturity in smart grids.   Track developments in smart grid security and update relevant material. Both smart grid and  cyber security are in a dynamic phase of change/development. This will make updates  important in order to maintain their usability.   Link smart grid activities with other related emerging areas such as smart cities, smart (home)  environments, eMobility, Future Internet, and liaise with related stakeholders. As the scope of  all these areas is quite wide and overlapping, it will be important to identify interfaces and  coordinate common topics.   Create circles of trust to share information about smart grid security. Smart grid security is  falls into CIIP and as such parts of the work need to be kept in confidentiality. For this  purpose, circles of trust among relevant stakeholders need to be developed and modalities  need to be developed for managing this information.  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  36  Annex A:  Description of Smart Grid assets  Information  Information is a valuable asset as, depending on it, machines and staff will make decisions. It can  travel by different supports or represent different meanings. Information assets identified are:   Inventory of electrical assets: physical components that storage the information while it is  travelling or it is being converted: cables, relays, transformers, power switches, earth  switches, controllable/regulating inverter, distribution automation, sensors, equipment  health sensor, fault current limiter, FACTS devices.   Operational information about electrical assets: status indicators, alerts, events and  shortage - disturbance information.   Historical information: information related to the past that must be storage by law or due to  its value / nature.   Trending information: information related to the past that can be used to predict future  behaviour, and so, to be prepared for it.   Trading information: information related with commercial issues.   System Configuration: information related with the network itself: network topology, IP  addresses Allocation, inventory of MAC addresses, user credentials, user permissions,  configuration files, geolocation.  Different information may be susceptible to the security principles: confidentiality, integrity,  availability.  Software  The Software of an infrastructure will let us manage the information (access it, modify it and store  new information). No availability of the required software will mean any access to information.  Main software in a smart grid is:   Applications: we will find different types of applications with different connectivity:  connected with the Internet but only accessed by the staff of the company; application  oriented to end users, to access its own information; real time applications (utility IT  information system capable of integrating, organizing, displaying and analysing real-time or  near real-time electric distribution data to offer a wide range of operational benefits; SCADA  systems: the application that will control industrial processes, in general no connected with  Internet.   Standard Software: software needed to make the applications work.  o Database.  o Web server.   Operating System.   Device Driver: software installed in the different used drivers as USBs, CDs, DVDs, printers,  scanners.   Firmware.  When we analyse this asset, we will need to think about: the origin of the software (is this origin  trustworthy? Do we know the source code?); access to it (who is able to access it and with what kind  of permissions? What procedures of access does it have?); real location of the software (where is the  server that holds is located?).  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  37  Services  The services are activities between a client and a provider. They are considered as valuable assets  because its correct functioning is needed to the correct functioning of the smart grid.  Services oriented to the staff of the smart grid:   Mail Service.   Terminal Service.   Print Service.   Authentication Service.  Services oriented to the network itself and to make possible the necessary communications:   File Service.   Network Service.   Name Service.   Address Service.  Cloud services:   Software as a service.   Infrastructure as a service.  Hardware  The hardware components considered as main assets of a smart grids are:   Smart grid:  o Remote Terminal Unit (RTU): microprocessor-controlled electronic device that  interfaces objects in the physical world to a distributed control system or SCADA  (supervisory control and data acquisition) system by transmitting telemetry data to a  master system, and by using messages from the master supervisory system to  control connected objects.  o Intelligent Electronic Device (IED): term used in the electric power industry to  describe microprocessor-based controllers of power system equipment, such as  circuit breakers, transformers, and capacitor banks.  o Programmable Logic Controller (PLC): digital computer used for automation of  electromechanical processes, such as control of machinery on factory assembly  lines, amusement rides, or light fixtures.  o Distributed Control System (DCS): is a system used in manufacturing to control set of  devices in a distributed environment.   Micro grid: electrical systems that include multiple loads and distributed energy resources  that can be operated in parallel with the grid or as an electrical island; Micro grid Controller:  devices that control and enable the establishment of micro grids.   Smart Meter: electrical meter that records consumption of electric energy in intervals of an  hour or less and communicates that information at least daily back to the utility for  monitoring and billing purposes. The components of smart meters to take into account are:  o Metering End Device, which let us read date at the end points: Electricity; Gas;  Water; Heat.  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  38  o Local Network Access Point (LNAP).  o Neighbourhood Network Access Point (NNAP).  o External Display.  o Home Automation Components.  o AMI Head End (Advanced Metering Infrastructure).   Servers: related with hardware, computer hardware that holds the necessary software to  run an infrastructure.   Clients: devices from which personal staff, end users and potential clients will connect with  available applications:  o PC.  o Notebook.  o Tablet.  o ThinClient.  o PDA.  o (Mobil-)Phone.  o Printer.  o Smart Appliances and Equipment (Customer): home appliances and devices (i.e.,  thermostats, pool pumps, clothes washers/dryers, water heaters, etc.) that use  wireless technology to receive real-time data from the AMI system to control or  modulate their operation.   Network Components: physical devices needed for the correct functioning of the network:  o Advanced Interrupting Switch: switches or technologies that can detect and clear  faults more quickly or without a traditional reclosing sequence.  o Switch.  o Router.  o Bridge.  o Repeater.  o Modem.  o Gateway.  o Firewall.  o WLAN Access Point.   Media: physical support to storage the information:  o Semiconductor Storage.  o Magnetic Storage.  o Optical Storage  o Paper  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  39  o Human   Displays: devices to present the information to the user:  o Monitor  o Beamer   Human Interaction Devices (HID): devices to let the user introduce information to the  system.  o Keyboard  o Mouse  A main issue talking about hardware is the supply chain. For the critical hardware, the supply chain  should be controlled by the owner of the infrastructure.  Infrastructure  Infrastructures are also main assets to protect. There are several types of infrastructures:   Facilities:  o Premises  o Building  o Server Room  o Office  o Auxiliary Room  o Collector  o Data centre   Power:  o Transformer  o Emergency Generator  o UPS   Air Conditioning   Cabling  Personnel  Personnel are now considered a main asset in all the organizations, due to its knowledge and  experience. The existing profiles of personnel in a smart grid are:   User   Operator   Administrator   Developer  Every profile has different access to the rest of the assets.  eMobility  EMobility represents the concept of using electric powertrain technologies, in-vehicle information,  and communication technologies and connected infrastructures to enable the electric propulsion of  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  40  vehicles and fleets. Powertrain technologies include full electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids, as well  as hydrogen fuel cell vehicles that convert hydrogen into electricity. The main assets are:   Electric Vehicle Charging Station.   Vehicles  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  41  Annex B:  Threats assumed for Smart Grid assets  Threat Group Threat Threat details Threat Agent Trend44 Comments  Physical attack  (deliberate/  intentional)  Bomb attack /  threat  Fraud  Fraud by  employees  Employees  Increasing  Sabotage  Corporations  Cybercriminals  Employees  Hacktivists  Nation States  Terrorists45  Vandalism  Employees  Terrorists  Rioter  Theft (of devices,  storage media and  documents)  Theft of  mobile devices  (smartphones/  tablets)  Corporations  Employees  Nation States  Terrorists  Increasing  Stable (theft  internal  staff)  Theft of other  hardware  Corporations  Employees  Nation States  Terrorists  Stable  Information  leakage/sharing  Corporations  Cybercriminals  Employees  Hacktivists  Nation States  Terrorists  Increasing  Unauthorized  physical access /  Unauthorised  entry to premises  Employees  Hacktivists  Terrorists  Coercion, extortion  or corruption  Corporations  Cybercriminals  Employees  Hacktivists  Nation States  Terrorists  44  Threats that have been assigned a trend are the ones that have been encountered within the  ENISA Threat Landscape 2012.  45  Terrorists as a Threat Agent: Based on the publicly available information resources, the profile of  cyber terrorists still seems to be blurry due to lack of concrete evidence. There are opinions in the  literature that cyber criminals and cyber terrorists are involved in similar activities with the  difference being solely in their content. On the other hand, it is reported that terrorists are involved  mostly in sabotage attacks against high impact targets and their capability resources vary from low  to average. Finally, it is often reported that cybercriminals can be engaged by individuals with  terroristic motive to perform an attack on their behalf.

Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  Page  iv  Executive summary  Smart grids are complex systems. A smart grid is a system of systems delivering energy to  consumers. Smart grid stores, transports and manages energy. Smart grid is a de facto Critical  Infrastructure1 as energy is important for the well-functioning of the society and economy. Being the  blending of the energy and telecommunication critical infrastructures, smart grids should operate  securely and by respecting end users’ privacy. Moreover, the protection of the smart grid is the key  to energy availability. In this document we elaborate on cyber security issues with regards to smart  grid information infrastructure.  The security of a complex system is also a complex matter. In order to cope with this complex  environment, this document leverages the following principles for simplifying the problem:  Consider external and internal threats: In cyber-security the external environment are the cyber- threats. This cyber-threat environment originates from threat agents, the adversaries utilizing cyber- threats and launching cyber-attacks. Although dynamically changing, the cyber-threat landscape can  be described and has finite elements. An understanding of the cyber-threat landscape is  indispensable for the identification of the necessary protection measures. In this document, we  provide a threat landscape affecting smart grid components. Internal threats are considered as well:  a variety of threats emanating from errors and insider attacks are also taken into account.  Decompose and classify the elements: A decomposition of smart grid components is one of the main  tasks to tackle its complexity. This task is currently being performed by various experts around  Europe and the World. Within this report, we have adopted the smart grid decomposition provided  in the document Smart Grid Reference Architecture10 of the Smart Grid Standardization  Coordination Group of CEN-CENELEC-ETSI. This is because this work is a highly reputed document  among the security experts in Europe.  Capture available knowledge: What have others done in the area of smart grid protection? This has  been addressed by taking stock of available cyber-security approaches, protection approaches and  good practices developed recently.  In response to the urgent question of many stakeholders: How does this document support me in my  work?  this document provides tools to assess risk exposure of smart grid assets and will show what  others have done in this respect. It elaborates on the threats smart grid components are exposed to  and on the security controls to reduce threat exposure. But the assessment on the living object can  be done only by the asset owner, just because asset owners master the complexity of infrastructures  and the interdependencies among various assets. This task cannot be done as a generic exercise or it  would have low value.  Concluding, one should note that the use of these tools will depend on the capabilities of the expert  users. In cyber-security preparedness, however, much depends on the capabilities of the adversary,  which are not always known and certain;  “That which depends on me, I can do; that which depends on the enemy cannot be certain. Therefore  it is said that one may know how to win, but cannot necessarily do so” (Sun Tzu2).  1  http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/crisis-and-terrorism/critical- infrastructure/index_en.htm, accessed 13 Nov 2013.  2  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War, accessed 13 Nov 2013.  http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/crisis-and-terrorism/critical-infrastructure/index_en.htm http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/crisis-and-terrorism/critical-infrastructure/index_en.htm http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  Page  v  Being knowledgeable about what can be achieved is one thing. The other is to reduce the impact. In  cyber-security – an environment with asymmetric approaches - this can be achieved through  common effort and coordination.

Being an ENISA deliverable in the area of  Threat Landscape, it comprises a detailed threat assessment in the area of smart grids, based on  input form the generic ENISA Threat Landscape activities13. The rationale behind this piece of work is  to “deepen” the generic threat assessment by taking into account specificities of smart grids, a vital  CIIP sector.  By doing so, the objective is to complement various activities going on both within and outside  ENISA, that is:   To perform a threat assessment on the basis of which smart grid security measures will be  based. This activity is in support of related activities of the Commission: DG-ENER, in close  cooperation with ENISA and DG CNECT, has decided to task the EG2 working group29 with the  organisation of consultations security requirements with national cyber security authorities and  the energy and ICT industry.   To deliver input to other international activities, in particular in the area of standardisation3,4. In  this context, the threat analysis provided in this document will be reused in the definition of  security measures for smart grid infrastructure models (scenarios).  The present work is based on information developed within the ENISA Threat Landscape (ETL):  relevant information about top threats is included in this document. The threats have been mapped  to smart grid assets: this indicates the kind of exposure each asset has. Moreover, threat agents  have been identified as originators of these threats. Through the established relationship among  threats->assets->threat agents it becomes evident what threats smart grid assets are exposed to.  Moreover, the capabilities of possible adversaries are also identified. This information is useful for a  variety of security related activities in the area of smart grids, such as risk assessments, formulation  of security requirements, identification of protection requirements, etc.  This work is concluded with a good practice guide, consisting of an overview of smart grid security  approaches. In particular, it is demonstrated how available smart grid controls from various existing  standards protect against the identified threats.  The structure of this report has been agreed with the expert group that has supported this ENISA  work. Moreover, a contribution to the ENISA work on security measures for smart grids has been  generated.  Policy Context  The Cyber Security Strategy for the EU5 stresses the importance of threat analysis and emerging  trends in cyber security. The ENISA Threat Landscape is an activity towards the achievement of  objectives formulated in this regulation, in particular by contributing to the identification of  emerging trends in cyber-threats and understanding the evolution of cyber-crime (see 2.4 regarding  proposed role of ENISA).  Moreover, the new ENISA regulation6 mentions the necessity to analyse current and emerging risks  (and their components), stating: “the Agency, in cooperation with Member States and, as  3  http://www.cen.eu/cen/Sectors/Sectors/UtilitiesAndEnergy/SmartGrids/Pages/default.aspx#, accessed 11 November  2013.  4  http://www.cenelec.eu/aboutcenelec/whatwedo/technologysectors/smartgrids.html, accessed 11 November 2013.  5  http://www.ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-  and-opportunity-cyber-security, accessed 28 Nov 2013.  6  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:165:0041:0058:EN:PDF, accessed 28 Nov 2013.  http://www.cen.eu/cen/Sectors/Sectors/UtilitiesAndEnergy/SmartGrids/Pages/default.aspx http://www.cenelec.eu/aboutcenelec/whatwedo/technologysectors/smartgrids.html http://www.ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security http://www.ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:165:0041:0058:EN:PDF  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  2  appropriate, with statistical bodies and others, collects relevant information”. In particular, under  Art. 3, Tasks, d), iii), the new ENISA regulations states that ENISA should “enable effective responses  to current and emerging network and information security risks and threats”.  From the above points it becomes apparent that the ENISA Threat Landscape is a significant  contribution to the EU Cyber Security Strategy by streamlining and consolidating available  information on cyber-threats and their evolution.  Detailing the ENISA Threat Landscape for various emerging areas provides valuable contextual  information to existing policy measures established by the commission. In the area of smart grids, in  particular, this work supports a recommendation of the Commission: the European Commission  included a number of data protection, privacy and security measures in the March 2012 Commission  Recommendation on preparations for the roll-out of Smart Metering systems7. Furthermore, it  initiated action under the auspices of the smart grids Task Force with a dedicated Expert Group29  (EG2) focusing on two key concrete outcomes to be delivered in 2013, namely: 1) a Data Protection  Impact Assessment (DPIA) template as a response to consumer concerns related to data protection  and privacy; and 2) a cyber-security assessment framework as a response to investor and industry  concerns related to system security. The cyber security assessment framework is composed of two  sub-deliverables. First, a set of Best Available Techniques (BATs) pinpoints the potential cyber  security risks inherent to each of the common minimal functional requirements for Smart Metering  Systems recommended in the March 2012 Recommendation8 and identifies optimal controls and  Privacy Enhancing Technologies to mitigate each of these risks. Second, a blueprint for a network will  be elaborated, where information about incidents, threats, vulnerabilities and good practices can be  shared for critical infrastructure protection9.  This work aims to provide a significant contribution towards assessing cyber threat exposure of  smart grid infrastructures. As such it will directly contribute to the assessment of cyber security and  comes to support investor and industry concerns.  Target Audience  This material is a tool for smart grid asset owners who wish to perform threat analysis and risk  assessment according to their particular needs (i.e. asset protection level based on asset impact,  vulnerabilities and detail of mitigation measures). While in this document the threat exposure of  smart grid assets is being presented, asset owners may deepen their threat analysis and risk  assessment by using asset and threat details provided in this document. A deeper analysis will be  based on assessed threats, vulnerabilities and impact statements with regard to the concrete assets  participating in a smart grid infrastructure scenario (see also specific threats in section 5).  Moreover, the smart grid threat landscape will be of interest for policy makers: current threats and  threat trend may be important input in policy actions in the area of cyber-security, critical  infrastructure protection and smart grid in particular.  Through the large number of collected reports, the smart grid threat landscape provides a unique  collection of information regarding cyber-security threats. Hence, a further target group of this  document are individuals who would like to obtain access to these sources in order to use them for  their own purposes.  7  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:073:0009:0022:EN:PDF, accessed 3 December 2013.  8  defined in points 3.f and 18 of the Recommendation 2012/148/EU  9  \"Evaluation of available methodologies for a trustworthy network sharing vulnerabilities and threats analysis  of Smart Grid and Smart Metering systems among stakeholders\"  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:073:0009:0022:EN:PDF  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  3  Structure of this document  The rest of this document is organised as follows:   The rationale of the smart grid threat landscape is presented   A section that presents asset types that are typical for a smart grid environment. Moreover,  composite assets are being presented, covering various asset types as they are foreseen within  the Smart Grid Reference Architecture Model (SGAM)10;   A section on the threat categories smart grid assets are exposed to. In this section, smart grid  specific threats are presented as they emerged from the performed information collection and  analysis.   A section showing the smart grid asset types exposure to the threats and   A section showing which threats emerge from which threat agent groups.   A chapter with available smart grid security good practices indicating their protection against the  identified threats.   A conclusion summarizes various issues and gives an outlook of activities/open issues and  upcoming actions in this area.  It is worth mentioning that in order to keep the size of this text as short as possible and enhance  readability, detailed material is being provided by means of Annexes. This information is important  for smart grid owners who wish to perform risk assessment and/or adapt the proposed security  measures to their particular environment and needs.  10  http://ec.europa.eu/energy/gas_electricity/smartgrids/doc/xpert_group1_reference_architecture.pdf,  accessed 10 Sept 2013.  http://ec.europa.eu/energy/gas_electricity/smartgrids/doc/xpert_group1_reference_architecture.pdf  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  4  2 Method  In order to identify required protection levels of valuable assets it is common to perform a risk  assessment. Subsequently, security measures have to be introduced to achieve the target level of  protection by mitigating (part of) the assessed risks. As discussed below, threats are an important  element in risk assessment.  In this chapter we present the rationale and method followed within the Smart Grid Threat  Landscape (SGTL). It consists of a number of threats to which smart grid assets are exposed. Hence,  the presented SGTL is an important tool for those who want to assess the risks within a smart grid  environment. Based on these risks, appropriate security measures can be selected to achieve risk  mitigation.  The role of threats in the risk assessment activity becomes evident when looking at the components  of risks. According to the widely accepted ISO 27005 definition risks emerge when: “Threats abuse  vulnerabilities of assets to generate harm for the organization”. In more detailed terms, we consider  risk as taking into account the following elements:  Asset (Vulnerabilities, Controls), Threat (Threat Agent Profile, Likelihood) and Impact  The elements of risks are graphically depicted in the figure below:  Figure 1: Threats targeting an asset by trying to exploit its vulnerabilities.  This figure has been adopted from ISO 13335-4 and shows how threats try to exploit asset  vulnerabilities in order to harm/take over the asset. The asset owner has implemented security  measures to protect the asset, that is, to eliminate its vulnerabilities. The impact achieved by the  potential materialization of a threat is the final element to evaluate the risk of an asset (see also risk  definition above).  While the definition of risks for an asset is a quite straight forward task, in complex environments it  is often a challenge to assess risks. This is in particular the case in smart grids due to their technical  complexity, interdependencies among components, multiplicity in operational responsibilities and  Asset  T Threat  Vulnerability  Measure  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  5  complex supply processes. The present document is generic, hence it does not assume any particular  smart grid environment and/or the processes implemented through it. As such, it is impossible to  make any valid assumptions about impact and vulnerabilities of assets. These are activities that can  solely be performed by the asset owner. Hence, the need for supporting tools for the performance  of risk assessments becomes obvious and essential for the asset owner in this complex environment.  In this document, we provide information on threats and threat exposure of typical smart grid  assets, independently of any infrastructure scenarios. In other words, the smart grid Threat  Landscape consists of a list of assets, and the threats applying to these assets.  Further, by means of the presented good practices, we identify various security measures found in  smart grid security approaches. By mapping these measures against threats we show how security  measures are the used to avoid the assumed threat exposure.  Given this information, the asset owner will need to assess vulnerabilities and impact in order to  assess the risk and find risk mitigation measures (eventually among the ones from the processed  good practices).  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  6  3 Smart Grid Assets  A smart grid may consist of a plethora of asset types. For the sake of information security, we  consider assets that are mainly related to information and communication technology. Due to the  massive deployment of IT-based components in the area of electricity and transport network, some  assets that are characteristic for smart grids have been added. These assets generate or process data  and as such are exposed to cyber-security threats. In addition to the IT-assets, some non-IT assets  have been included that are tightly related to the proper operation of IT assets. Examples hereto  are: some electrical assets such as cables and relays, facilities, human resources, non-IT media, etc.  The figure bellow gives an overview of the smart grid assets structure into relevant categories  according to their use (see Figure 2). A more detailed description of these assets is given in Annex A.  Besides these smart grid assets, some composite, more complex assets have been identified. These  assets have been taken from the Smart Grid Architecture Model (SGAM)10. By considering these  assets, our intention is to take into account this standard, while at the same time showing the  decomposition of the SGAM10 assets by means of the assets of Figure 2. This will allow interested  individuals to find threats applying to such complex assets by cumulating the threats of their  counterparts.  Given the relatively young age of smart grid, it has to be taken as given that smart grid environments  might grow over what is today being considered to be part of a smart grid infrastructure. Examples  of such assets might be elements currently considered as part of Smart Cities11 and Smart Mobility12.  Indicatively for this type of assets, we have included a relevant part of e-Mobility in the smart grid  asset types. Hence, the asset taxonomy presented should be considered as a snapshot of the current  state-of-play and as such non-exhaustive.  11  http://www.smart-cities.eu/press-ressources.html, accessed 5 September 2013.  12  http://www.mobincity.eu/, accessed 5 September 2013.  http://www.smart-cities.eu/press-ressources.html http://www.mobincity.eu/  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  7  Smart Grid  Hardware  Software  Infrastructure  Services  Persons  Information  Inventory of  Electrical Assets  Operational  information about  Electrical Assets  Historical  Information  Trending  Information  Trading  Information  System  Configuration  Cables  Relays  Transformers  Power Switches  Earth Switches  Status  Alerts  Events  Shortage/Disturbance  Information  Network  Topology  IP Address  Allocation  Inventory of  MAC Addresses  Security Parameters  User Permissions  Configuration Files  Geolocation  Applications  Standard Software  Operating System  Device Driver  Firmware  Database  Web Server  Office Suite  File  Mail  Terminal  Print  Network  Name  Address  Authentication  SaaS (Cloud)  IasS (Cloud)  Smart Grid  Smart  Meter  Server  Client  Network  Media  Displays  HID  Keyboard  Mouse  Monitor  Beamer  SSD  Mag.

The threats included in this  collection of threats are all applicable to the smart grid assets presented in the previous section. The  presented threat taxonomy covers mainly cyber-security threats, that is, threats applying to  information and communication technology assets. Some additional non-IT threats have been  assumed in order to cover threats to physical assets that are necessary to operate the considered  ICT-assets. It is worth mentioning that the presented threats are a consolidation of threats from the  ENISA Threat Landscape13 and threats used within a smart grid assessment performed by DG  CONNECT14. Moreover, the threats presented reflect the experience made within the ENISA Annual  Incident Report 2012 regarding incidents in the telecommunication sector 15 . This report is  considered relevant, as attack methods and threats in smart grid and the telecommunication sector  are considered to be very similar (i.e. as applying to similar IT-assets).  The threats presented in Figure 3 are an overview. A detailed listing of these threats can be found in  Annex B. This material contains additional information on threats such as:   Threat details: this field explains further details of a threat as they have been found in analysed  material on cyber-threats.   Threat Agent: This field explains which threat agent group is considered to deploy attacks based  on this threat.   Trend: This field indicates assessed trends for each particular threat. Such trends have been  assessed by analysing publicly available threat reports. Threats that do not have a value in the  trend field are not subject of ENISA Threat Landscape. They are mentioned because they might  be potentially useful for risk assessments.  It should be noted, that the details presented reflect the current state of play within the ENISA  Threat Landscape16 and are subject to changes according to new developments in that area and  emerging threat issues (i.e. being a living document reflecting dynamic changes in the cyber-threat  environment).  13  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/ENISA_Threat_Landscape,  accessed 5 September 2013.  14  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?action=display&doc_id=1763, accessed 5  September 2013.  15  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports- 2012/at_download/fullReport, accessed 5 September 2013.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/ENISA_Threat_Landscape http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?action=display&doc_id=1763 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2012/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2012/at_download/fullReport  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  10  Figure 3: Overview of threats assumed for smart grid assets  Threats  Deliberate  physical  attacks  Unintentional  data damage  Failures,  Malfunction  Eavesdropping,  Interception,  Hijacking  Legal  Nefarious  Activity, Abuse  Outages  Damage, Loss  of IT assets  Natural  Disaster  Identity theft  Unsolicited e-mail  Denial of service  Malicious code, activity  Social Engineering  Abuse of Information Leakage  Generation and use of rogue certificates  Manipulation of HW and SW  Manipulation of information  Misuse of audit tools  Falsification of records  Misuse of information, information systems  Unauthorised use of administration  Unauthorised access to systems  Unauthorised software installation  Unauthorised use of software  Compromising confidential information  Abuse of authorizations  Hoax  Badware  Remore activity (execution)  Targeted attacks  Lack of resources  Energy outage  Shortage of personnel  Strike  Loss of support services  Internet outage  Network outage  Damage by third party  Damage, corruption from testing  Integrity loss of information  Loss of devices, media, documents  Destruction of records, devices, media  Information leakage  Natural disaster  Environmental disaster  Fire  Flood  Polution, dust, corrosion  Thunder stroke  Unfavourable climatic conditions  Major environmental events  Bomb attack, threat  Sabotage  Vandalism  Theft (device, media)  Information leakage, sharing  Unauthorised physical access  Erroneous information  sharing, lekage  Erroneous use or adminisration  of devices, systems  Usage of information  from unreliable source  Unintentional alteration of data  Inadequate design,  planning, adaptation  Failures of devices and services  Failure, disruption of  communication links  Failure, disruption of main  sypply functions  Failure, disruption of  service providers  Malfunction of devices,  systems  War driving  Intercepting,  compromizing emissions  Interception of information  Interferring radiation  Replay of messages  Network  reconnaissance,  information gathering  Man in the middle,  session hijacking  Repudiation of actions  Violation of laws, breach of legislation  Failure to meet contractual agreements  Unauthorized use of copyright material  Fraud  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  11  5 Specific Smart Grid Threats  By analysing existing literature on smart grid security (see references and collected information in  Annex D), we have identified specific threats that have been taken into account in existing  assessments. The analysed material covers parts of smart grid infrastructure, in particular smart  meters and some generic smart grid infrastructures within research projects. Thus, the specific smart  grid threats presented in this section reflect the state-of-play in relevant available documents and,  as such, are not exhaustive. Due to the complexity of smart grid infrastructures, one should argue  that the set of threats presented in this chapter still have relevance for prospective infrastructure  configurations and should be considered within risk assessments when relevant assets are part of  the scenario at hand.  The specific smart grids encountered in the analysed literature are structured according to the  categories mentioned in Figure 3. They are presented by means of threat details of particular threats  and threat groups. It should be noted that the sequence of the specific smart grid threats presented  below is not prioritized. This is because the analysed material has not provided any information that  would allow prioritizing threats. Given the fact that no significant experience exists in this domain  from existing implementations (i.e. through incident statistics in this area), no attempt has been  undertaken to introduce any priorities for these threats. For obtaining a priority list of current cyber- threats, we suggest interested readers to visit the ENISA Threat Landscape report16,17,18.  In the presentation of specific smart grid threats below, we use the same threat classification as the  one used in Figure 3.  Threat Group: Damage/Loss  Threat: Loss of devices, media and documents  In smart grid environments this threat involves rummaging through disposed magnetic media for  retrieving sensitive data that is left behind on it. In particular, it is assumed that unauthorized people  might come to possession of data related to Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI)  communication19.  Threat: Information leakage  Attacks of this type target various smart grid components and their main aim is to acquire private  sensitive information (energy consumption, credit cards, session data, access control data)19,20.  Threat Group: Eavesdropping/Interception/Hijacking  Threat: Interfering radiation  Electro ‐Magnetic/ Radio Frequency interception is a threat that aims at performing unauthorized  interception of private communication. In particular, it is assumed that unauthorized people might  come to possession of data related to Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) communication19.  16  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat- environment/ENISA_Threat_Landscape/at_download/fullReport, accessed 11 Nov 2013.  17  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat- landscape-mid-year-2013/at_download/fullReport, accessed 11 Nov 2103.  18  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat- landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats/at_download/fullReport, accessed 11 Dec  2013.  19  http://www.energy.ca.gov/2013publications/CEC-500-2013-056/CEC-500-2013-056.pdf, accessed 11 Nov  2013.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/ENISA_Threat_Landscape/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/ENISA_Threat_Landscape/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-mid-year-2013/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-mid-year-2013/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats/at_download/fullReport http://www.energy.ca.gov/2013publications/CEC-500-2013-056/CEC-500-2013-056.pdf  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  12  This threat materialises when threat agents are trying to interfere with the physical transmission and  reception of wireless communications. It is one of the most efficient ways to launch physical-layer  DoS attacks, especially targeting wireless communications. This can severely impact smart grid  operations as they use wireless communication for various tasks20.  Another threat of this type in smart grid regards the extraction of data by analysis of various types of  electromagnetic radiation emitted by a CPU, display, keyboard, etc. In case of smart grids, these  attacks are viable because equipment is installed in the field, geographically distributed and they are  accessible19.  Threat: Man in the middle, session hijacking  In smart grid environments, interactions of AMI components with the infrastructure can be  compromised. That could lead to unauthorized access to AMI communication information,  modification of AMI data, denial of service to authorized users, and repudiation of actions19.  Threat: Interception of information  Through interception of information several networks of different natures can be affected, such as  WIFI, Zegbee and fixed networks. Particular variations of this threat may include:   Hijacking of the meter connection though a kind of unauthorized devices / messages to  communicate with the DR system19.   Intercepting information by side-channel attacks. Such attacks are based on physical accessibility  (Substation, smart meters, collectors, etc.) to gain information from the physical implementation  of a cryptosystem as the components of the smart grid are geographically distributed.   Intercepting and examining messages in order to deduce information from patterns in  communication20.   Sniffer attacks whereby an attacker with the appropriate access captures and analyses the  messages transmitted over the network19,20,21.   Use of External Traffic with the aim to intercepting and examining messages in order to deduce  information from patterns in communication19.  Threat: Network reconnaissance and information gathering  Information gathering attacks of mobile communication (in particular 802.16e) may target the  Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cipher providing strong confidentiality on user data19.  Threat: Replay of messages  Acknowledges forgery is a threat where an attacker knows the DNS value and can send a false  acknowledgement messages to the sender saying that the receiver has received the message when,  in fact, it hasn't19.  Threat Group: Failures/Malfunction  Threat: Failure of devices and systems  Given the complexity of smart grids and the multiplicity of devices and systems, it should be taken as  given that a significant amount of incidents will be attributed to failures, misconfiguration and  20  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistir/ir7628/introduction-to-nistir-7628.pdf, accessed 11 Nov 2013.  21 http://www.ece.ncsu.edu/netwis/papers/13wl-comnet.pdf, accessed 11 Von 2013.  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistir/ir7628/introduction-to-nistir-7628.pdf http://www.ece.ncsu.edu/netwis/papers/13wl-comnet.pdf  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  13  errors. This has been confirmed by incidents communicated to ENISA in the area of  telecommunications22, a sector with equally complex infrastructure.  Threat: Failure or disruption of communication links (communication networks)  Attacks abusing implementations of standards are based on missing or weak implementations of  security mechanisms, in particular when standards used have not been developed with security in  mind23.  Threat Group: Nefarious Activity/Abuse  Threat: Unsolicited e-mail  Personnel engaged by various players in smart grid can be victims of anonymous, unsolicited e-mail  attacks. This might be part of a targeted campaign20.  Threat: Denial of Service attacks  These attacks attempt to make smart grid resources unavailable to its intended users (internal and  external). They can target to different layers of network and applications (physical / data-link)20,21.  Such attacks can be also performed by jamming the power-line24.  Threat: Manipulation of hard- and software  Through manipulation, an attacker may manipulate scheduling by disabling antenna and changing  Programmable Communicating Thermostat (PCT) Time locally19. In particular:   Break into EWS, use engineering software to access field controllers and change their logic24.   Get access to the operator station and perform targeted operator actions to stop all machines24.   Manipulation of firmware of smart e-meters. This may include manipulated firmware that is sent  from Central System to E-meter of manipulated firmware that is sent from Central system (via  Data Concentrator)24.   Compromise Central Systems to (1) switch off homes with E-meters; (2) delete all keys for the E- meters; and (3) distribute malicious firmware24.  Threat: Malicious code /Activity  These threats affect smart grid as all the functioning of all involved IT components depends on the  installed software. In detail, this threat consists of:   Exploit kits are a widely deployed form attack. Through exploit kits virus and malware infections  are performed.  Infected devices may be manipulated by the attacker. Malware infected  operator stations may send targeted commands to DCS Server to disturb or manipulate they  operation24.   In smart grid, worms may be distributed by using the network to send copies to other nodes  (computers on the network)19. Worms may affect the operation of all smart grid components  connected to the network.   Trojans are pieces of malware that facilitate unauthorized access to a computer system19.  Worms may affect the operation of all smart grid components connected to the network.  22  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual- incident-reports-2012/at_download/fullReport, accessed 11 Nov 2013.  23  http://www.etsi.org/WebSite/document/0905_RA%20smart%20grids-Bdef.pdf, accessed 11 Nov 2013.  24  Crisalis Project EU (http://www.crisalis-project.eu/), Deliverable D2.2 Final Requirement Definition.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2012/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2012/at_download/fullReport http://www.etsi.org/WebSite/document/0905_RA%20smart%20grids-Bdef.pdf http://www.crisalis-project.eu/  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  14   Backdoor / trapdoor is an undocumented entry point into a computer program, which is  generally inserted by a programmer to allow access to the program19. Vendors of smart meters,  for example, may have installed firmware with backdoors or some hidden functionality24 to  facilitate access to the device.   Service Spoofing is an attack in which the adversary successfully masquerades as another by  falsifying data and thereby gaining an illegitimate advantage19. A concrete example of spoofing is  ARP spoofing in the MAC layer: the management frames are not authenticated in 802.11. Every  frame has a source address. The attackers take advantage of the spoofed frame to redirect the  traffic and corrupt the ARP tables19.   With an ICMP-flooding attack, an adversary can flood a gateway with ICMP packets, thereby  creating difficulties in the operation of clients associated to the same IP to send and receive  packet.  A special case of a malicious activity that is leading to numerous incidents in all environments is that  of “insider threat”. With this approach, adversaries would take advantage of access to systems at the  operator’s end of the AMI system. The systems that the insider may be able to access include  multiple appliances of a smart grid environment, including AMI, the system containing pricing  information (either EMS or ICCP server to an ISO or generation entity), as well as the network  infrastructure supporting those systems. Which malicious activity an insider uses, depends on their  access to the various smart grid systems19.  Threat: Unauthorized access to information system / network  External disclosure of information is an attack occurring when information is being disclosed to  unauthorized entities. Smart grids manage privacy data, hence this threat is relevant in this  environment.  Regarding the unauthorized access to systems/network, the attacker may gain unauthorized access  to the information system / network from different locations19,21,25 of the smart grid such as:   Customer endpoint: There is a potential for AMI to allow access to the bulk electric grid from the  residential or small business customer endpoint. The adversary can suborn the customer  endpoint, intervene in wireless communication between the AMI meter and other endpoint  equipment, or from the AMI meter to the local concentrator. These attacks will expose the head  end equipment and systems to which the head end are connected. The exact details of this  attack are greatly dependent on the implementation of AMI, particularly at the head end.  Certain configurations would allow an attacker to affect the bulk electric grid.  Through violation of the privacy of the consumer (1) disclose meter data or configuration data  (Meter, Gateway or CLS configuration) or parts of it when transmitted between gateway and  external entities in the WAN; (2) disclose meter data transmitted between the TOE and the  meter. This threat is of specific importance if meters of more than one consumer are served by  one gateway27.   Remote access: Unauthorized remote access to SCADA systems via remote access from outside  the smart grid network.   Remote access or physical access to the network: compromise DCS Server and disturb / disable  communication with controllers in the field network24. Compromise DCS Server and send  commands to control and manipulate the configuration (parameters) of controllers. Compromise  25  http://www.ijsgce.com/uploadfile/2012/1011/20121011121836539.pdf, accessed 11 Nov 2013.  http://www.ijsgce.com/uploadfile/2012/1011/20121011121836539.pdf  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  15  DCS Server and stop communication with Operator Station (stop delivery of data to Operator  Station)24. Compromise RTU and send commands directly to controller24.  Threat: Manipulation of information  This threat includes all kinds of manipulative activity regarding smart grid information, in particular  AMI data and repudiation related information (e.g. AMI data, pricing information, invoicing  information, etc.). This threat relates to information of all software used, but also certificates19,20.  This threat might be deployed by means of the following methods:   Through buffer overflow attacks by inserting an incorrect value in the message fields, thus  affecting message processing or sets the DFC flag. This might cause, for example, an outstation  device to appear busy to the master. These attacks can result in data corruption, unexpected  actions and device crashes21.   Load redistribution attack is an injection of realistic false data with limited access to specific  measurement data26.   Delivery of wrong data to operator station that looks valid and harmless24.   Manipulation of data received from TSO plant will cause working with wrong values, thus  affecting the operation of RTU24.   Manipulation of data sent to TSO and Energy Management Center, thus affecting the operation  of RTU24.   Attacker compromises an existing data concentrator and causes sending wrong data to the  central system24.   Attacker alters meter data when transmitted between meter and Gateway, Gateway and  consumer or Gateway and external entities. The objective can be to alter billing-relevant  information or grid status information; the attack may be performed via any interface (e.g. LMN,  HAN or WAN)27.   Attacker alters meter data, gateway configuration data, meter configuration data, CLS  configuration data or a firmware update when transmitted between the gateway and an  external entity in the Wan27.   False data are injected by an attacker in the smart grid traffic. The attacker injects false or  malicious DR events in DRAS (Demand Response Automation Server), causing blackouts and  instability of the grid. Attacker modifies configuration data in the DRAS such as DR program data,  customer list and shed event information, affecting the DR program behavior19.   Through time modification of the Gateway time attackers aim at changing the relation between  date / time measured consumption or production values in the meter data records27.  Threat: Misuse of information/Information Systems  In the absence of end-to-end encryption, a compromised data concentrator can be misused to  monitor data of other customers24 .  26  http://www.iitmicrogrid.net/event/greatlake2012/publication/PPTs/32- Smart%20Grid%20Monitoring%20and%20Cyber%20Security/32-ZuyiLi- Load%20Redistribution%20Attacks%20and%20Protection%20Strategy%20in%20Electric%20Power%20Syste ms.pdf, accessed 11 Nov 2013.  27  https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/SmartMeter/PP- SmartMeter.pdf?__blob=publicationFile, accessed 11 Nov 2013.  http://www.iitmicrogrid.net/event/greatlake2012/publication/PPTs/32-Smart%20Grid%20Monitoring%20and%20Cyber%20Security/32-ZuyiLi-Load%20Redistribution%20Attacks%20and%20Protection%20Strategy%20in%20Electric%20Power%20Systems.pdf http://www.iitmicrogrid.net/event/greatlake2012/publication/PPTs/32-Smart%20Grid%20Monitoring%20and%20Cyber%20Security/32-ZuyiLi-Load%20Redistribution%20Attacks%20and%20Protection%20Strategy%20in%20Electric%20Power%20Systems.pdf http://www.iitmicrogrid.net/event/greatlake2012/publication/PPTs/32-Smart%20Grid%20Monitoring%20and%20Cyber%20Security/32-ZuyiLi-Load%20Redistribution%20Attacks%20and%20Protection%20Strategy%20in%20Electric%20Power%20Systems.pdf http://www.iitmicrogrid.net/event/greatlake2012/publication/PPTs/32-Smart%20Grid%20Monitoring%20and%20Cyber%20Security/32-ZuyiLi-Load%20Redistribution%20Attacks%20and%20Protection%20Strategy%20in%20Electric%20Power%20Systems.pdf https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/SmartMeter/PP-SmartMeter.pdf?__blob=publicationFile https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/SmartMeter/PP-SmartMeter.pdf?__blob=publicationFile  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  16  Threat Group: Physical attack  Threat: Fraud  Within a reverse engineering attack, the customer at an endpoint would achieve reduction of cost of  electric and/or natural gas use. They would use information freely available from the AMI meter  vendor or the standard used within AMI meters to reset the meter and reprogram it to report false  information. If the information is not freely available, the attacker would reverse‐engineer a meter  to develop a way to modify it. This is very similar to the many cable modem attacks that are openly  available. Either the configuration settings from the utility or the actual firmware controlling the  operation of the meter would be modified in this attack24. With the same objective, AMI meters can  be removed from one home and placed to another24.  6 Smart Grid assets exposure to cyber threats  In this section the threat exposure of smart grid assets is presented. The association between  assumed threats from Figure 3 and assets from Figure 2 is established through Table 2 below. As  such, this table shows the threat exposure of assets and can be used as guidance in identification of  security needs.

For smart grid asset owners it is considered important  to know which threats emerge from which threat agent group. This information is significant to  decide on the kind of risks that should be mitigated: threat agent groups are indicative of the  determination behind launched attacks and capability level. Given the importance of smart grids and  the potential impact of attacks, smart grid asset owners will need to spend some thoughts on which  protection might be appropriate in order to avoid exposure to attacks from a certain type of threat  agent. The threat agents considered within this document are as follows:   Corporations: This kind of threat refers to corporations/organizations/enterprises that adopt  and/or are engaged in offensive tactics. In this context, corporations are considered as hostile  threat agents and their motivation is to build competitive advantage over competitors, who also  make up their main target. Depending on their size and sector, corporations usually possess  significant capabilities, ranging from technology up to human engineering intelligence, especially  in their area of expertise.   Cybercriminals: Cybercriminals are hostile by nature. Moreover, their motivation is usually  financial gain and their skill level is, nowadays, quite high. Cybercriminals can be organised on a  local, national or even international level. It should be taken as given, that a certain degree of  networking between cybercriminals is being maintained.   Employees: This category refers to the staff, contractors, operational staff or security guards of a  company. They can have insider access to company’s resources and they are considered as both  non-hostile threat agents (i.e. distracted employees) as well as hostile ones (i.e. disgruntled  employees). This kind of threat agents possesses a significant amount of knowledge that allows  them to place effective attacks against assets of their organization.   Hacktivists: Hacktivists are politically and socially motivated individuals that use computer  systems in order to protest and promote their cause. Moreover, they are usually targeting high  profile websites, corporations, intelligence agencies and military institutions.   Nation States: Nation states can have offensive cyber capabilities and use them against an  adversary. Nation states have recently become a prominent threat agent due to the deployment  of sophisticated attacks that are considered as cyber weapons. From the sophistication of these  malware it can be confirmed that nation states have a plethora of resources and they have a  high level of skills and expertise.   Natural disasters: Natural disasters are also threat agents and organizations are influenced by  them, as they can cause potential physical damage. Natural disasters include lightning, fires,  floods, earthquakes, windstorms etc. Although not a human threat agent, natural disasters are  considered as such, as they can cause severe physical damage and impact the availability of  information systems.   Terrorists: Terrorists have expanded their activities and engage also in cyber-attacks. Their  motivation can be political or religious and their capability varies from low to high. Preferred  targets of cyber terrorists are mostly critical infrastructures (e.g. public health, energy  production, telecommunication etc.), as their failures causes severe impact in society and  government. It has to be noted, that in the public material analyses, the profile of cyber  terrorists still seems to be blurry.  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  22   Cyber fighters: an emerging phenomenon is that of patriotic motivated groups of citizens with  the potential to launch cyber-attacks30. Such groups might have strong feelings when their  political, national or religious values seem to be threatened by another group and are capable of  launching cyber-attacks31. Having said that, one can argue that such groups are special cases  (maybe an evolution or yet another instance) of hacktivism. To an extent, such groups may be  supporters of totalitarian regimes and, rightly or wrongly, act on behalf of their supporting  parties (i.e. governments) by contributing to national activities in the cyber-space32. Their  activities may include conflicts with other groups (i.e. hacktivists)33.  Based on these short threat agent profiles, the threats presented in this document can be assigned  to relevant groups. This assignment is based on the threat agent group profile and in particular on  assumed motives. Table 3 below presents the potential involvement of threat agent groups in the  threats considered for smart grid assets.  Corporation  Cyber- criminals  Employee s  Hackti- vists  Nation  States  Natural  Disasters  Terrorists  Cyber  fighters  Physical attacks  √  √  Unintentional  damage  √  Failures /  Malfunction  √ √ √ √  √  Eavesdropping  / Interception /  Hacking  √ √ √ √ √  √ √  Legal  √  Nefarious  activity / abuse  √ √ √ √ √  √ √  Outages  √  √ √  Damage / Loss  (IT-Assets)  √ √ √ √ √  √ √  Disaster  √ √  Table 3: Involvement of Threat Agents in the threats  30  http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/06/iranian-elections-bring-lull-in-bank-attacks/ ,  accessed 13 Nov 2013.  31  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2313652/AP-Twitter-hackers-break-news-White-House- explosions-injured-Obama.html  32  http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-hacktivism.pdf  33  http://mashable.com/2012/08/10/syrian-electronic-army/  http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/06/iranian-elections-bring-lull-in-bank-attacks/ http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2313652/AP-Twitter-hackers-break-news-White-House-explosions-injured-Obama.html http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2313652/AP-Twitter-hackers-break-news-White-House-explosions-injured-Obama.html http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-hacktivism.pdf http://mashable.com/2012/08/10/syrian-electronic-army/  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  23  8 Vulnerabilities and Risks in Smart Grid  In this section some reflections are provided on smart grid vulnerabilities and risks. Before going into  the findings, one should note that both developments of smart grid infrastructures and smart grid  security are at an early stage of maturity. This is mainly because not very many such infrastructures  are operational for a sufficient period such that experiences have been gained, analysed and shared.  On the other hand, smart grid developments and security assessments are in many cases managed  confidentially, either for reasons of competitiveness or for security reasons. Hence, publicly available  information on smart grid security issues originates from research and standardisation activities and  is based on requirements and generic assumptions. The validation of this material through real-life  experience/examples is currently not feasible, at least at European level.  Due to the immense investments that are necessary to set up a smart grid environment,  standardisation activities are an important issue towards security of investments. Hence, a big  amount of effort is currently invested in standardisation activities. Such activities are based on  generic assumptions (i.e. infrastructure components, scenarios, security requirements, etc.) and are  aiming at establishing a context that will serve as basis for industrial developments.  Having said that, some interesting information on vulnerabilities and risk has been found in the  collected documents20,24,25. Given the general situation in smart grids the following vulnerabilities  and risks were assessed:   Smart grid vulnerabilities: Currently, vulnerabilities assumed within smart grid environments  related to some areas that are not differentiated from other IT systems. In particular we have  seen vulnerabilities related to the areas25: of customer security, physical security (in particular of  publicly accessible devices), implicit trust between used components, teams with different skills  and competences, involvement of multiple stakeholders (supply chain issues).  Further, through to the utilization of wireless communication, relevant components might be  vulnerable to threats targeting such components. Besides typical vulnerabilities in the area of  wireless communication34, some relevant material can be found in20. In the same document a  number of generic non-smart grid related vulnerabilities can also be found.  Concluding, one should mention that in the public domain there is a lack of information of  vulnerabilities related to smart grid specific infrastructures, scenarios and components. There  are some European projects that would cover this gap24. Also the analysis has identified a  Spanish Centre35 that is currently working in two European projects related with vulnerabilities  in smart grids: n-SHIELD (www.newshield.eu/) and RISC (DG-HOME CIPS call).   Smart grid risks: Regarding smart grid risks, only one document has been found that provides a  comprehensive assessment of risks24. The risks assessed are related to the unavailability of some  key smart grid components such as DCS and RTU; and AMI related components such as data  concentrators, smart meters and central system to control and manage smart meters. The risks  related to key smart grid components are mainly impact the stability and availability of the smart  grid through manipulations in hard- and software (see nefarious activity, eavesdropping, and  physical attack threat groups in Figure 3).  Risks assessed for AMI are related to manipulation of components by users in order to perform  fraud (i.e. primarily manipulating billing information and secondary affect operations of multiple  meters). (see nefarious activity, eavesdropping, and physical attack threat groups in Figure 3).  34  Vast amount of material does exist in this area. The reference give is just an example:  http://www.ijarcce.com/upload/2013/july/49-h-marigowda- security%20vulnerability%20issues%20in%20wireless.pdf accessed 11 Nov 2013.  35  http://www.tecnalia.com/, accessed 11 Nov 2013.  http://www.newshield.eu/ http://www.ijarcce.com/upload/2013/july/49-h-marigowda-security%20vulnerability%20issues%20in%20wireless.pdf http://www.ijarcce.com/upload/2013/july/49-h-marigowda-security%20vulnerability%20issues%20in%20wireless.pdf http://www.tecnalia.com/  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  24  Although thoroughly done, this assessment covers only a part of the smart grid infrastructure  and takes into account a reduced number of vulnerabilities. As already stated, more assessments  will be necessary, ideally based on real infrastructures (even at the level of a laboratory) in order  to achieve a better maturity in the implementation of smart grid cyber security measures.  Concluding, one should note that due to the fact that a smart grid is a system of systems, it is  important to understand the dependencies among involved components. Certainly, work that has  been done in the area of SCADA is highly relevant to smart grid environments. Moreover, with  increasing proliferation of mobile devices in industrial systems work on mobile security is another  important part of such a complex system. Hence, vulnerability and risk assessment will depend on  the particular mix of components, processes and human infrastructure involved in a particular  scenario.  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  25  9 Good Practice of Smart Grid Security Measures  In order to elaborate on good practices we took stock of publicly available smart grid security  approaches. In doing so, existing literature has been analysed and security measures/controls  proposed by these approaches have been identified. The security measures have been categorised  in:   Security measures related to IT Systems and Logical Networks used within smart grid infrastructures: Such  measures are related to assets such as Wide Area Networks, Gateways, Home Area Network (HAN) and  Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4) protocol, Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), Master Terminal Unit (MTU) and  Remote Terminal Unit (RTU)   Security measures related to Supply Chain of smart grid: Such measures are related to Providers,  Distribution and Logistics and Customers.  In the following sections, the identified security measures are presented with indication of their  origin.  In summary it is noticeable that three existing good practices provide a comprehensive set of  security measures19,20,36,. The majority of other documents analysed cover only a relatively small part  of security measures21,37,38,39,40,41,42. This is quite natural thought, as this material is dedicated to  some specific portions of smart grid infrastructure.  ENISA has also performed some work on security measures for smart grid. A report has been  published on the minimum security measures for smart grids in 201243. Based on this report, ENISA,  in collaboration with the Commission, has initiated a number of consultations with both private and  public sector stakeholders, under the umbrella of EG229, aiming at delivering a report with a set of  smart grid appropriate cyber security measures which might end up to a Commission  Recommendation on minimum cyber security requirements for smart grids in 2014. Both the ENISA  report on minimum security measures and the contribution to EG2 are not covered within this good  practice guide. The coverage of security measures proposed by ENISA with regard to threats  mentioned in the present document can be found in the ENISA contribution to EG2 and are not  repeated in this report.  The identified security measures are then mapped to the threats, completing thus the picture  between threat exposure and proposed security measure.

Best practices related to security measures for  protection of IT systems and logical networks are:  1. Align cyber-security to the organization’s overall IT strategy based on the defined risk  profile19,20.  2. Establish a rigorous, on-going risk management process19,20.  3. Establish effective configuration management process19.  4. Utilities to formally publish internal security program (policies, guidelines, procedures) and  ensure compliance19,20.  5. Develop cyber-security around IEC 6235119,20.  6. Adopt the security measures regarding the defined SGIS Security Levels (SGIS-SL)19.  7. Adopt the defined smart grid Data Protection classes (SG-DPC) 19.  8. Document network architecture and identify systems that serve critical functions or contain  sensitive information that require additional levels of protection19,20.  9. Conduct routine self-assessments19.  10. Ensure Interoperability and Testing/Certification19,20.  11. Implement a Security View per Layer, that is, establish a network protection strategy based on  the principle of defence-in-depth19,20.  12. Establish 24-hour-a-day incident monitoring and logging and audit systems20,37.  13. Implement attack mitigation mechanisms and network security proactive measures: prevention,  detection and analysis of vulnerabilities, correlation of events, etc19,20,21.  14. Implement internal and external Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Attack detection  tools20,21,37.  15. Establish incident response mechanisms: a breach is inevitable since no system can be 100%  secure. Incident response procedures must be developed so that it is used in the event of an  incident. Incident response includes disaster-recovery and business-continuity plans19,20.  16. Maintain safe start, stop and fail modes for smart grid components: systems shall be capable of  operating in an operational or non-operational state according to some policies. These may  include activities allowed during initialization state, management functions necessary for  element configuration, policy establishment and security domain establishment. The system  shall transition into the operational state only upon completion of the critical initialization  activities. The system shall transition into the non-operational state upon detection of a critical  failure and transition into the operational state when the critical failure has been solved. At this  point, the system shall be able to operating in a degraded mode while in an operational state.  Also, supporting activities pertaining to the health of the system (e.g., diagnostics, maintenance,  training, etc.) shall only be allowed during the operational state19,20.  17. Establish system backups and disaster recovery plans19,20.  18. Apply regular updates: applying software patches on a regular basis to the SCADA operation  system, applications and components in the smart grid19,20.  19. Removing or disabling unnecessary services37,20.  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  27  20. Perform technical audits of SCADA devices and networks, and any other connected networks, to  identify security concerns: analyse identified vulnerabilities to determine their significance, and  take corrective actions as appropriate. Track corrective actions and analyse this information to  identify trends. Additionally, retest systems after corrective actions have been taken to ensure  that vulnerabilities were actually eliminated. Scan non-production environments actively to  identify and address potential problems37.  21. Conduct physical security surveys and assess all remote sites connected to the SCADA network  to evaluate their security37.  22. Identify and develop a comprehensive understanding of all connections to SCADA networks and  evaluate and strengthen the security of these connections in order to protect them: internal  local area and wide area networks, including business networks, Internet, wireless network  devices, including satellite uplinks, modem or dial-up connections, connections to business  partners, vendors or regulatory agencies, etc37,19. Some security measures can be adopted to  protect these connections, such as, conduct penetration testing or vulnerability analysis, use of  firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), and other appropriate security measures at each  point of entry37,20.  23. Disconnect unnecessary connections to the SCADA network or isolate the SCADA network from  other network connections: isolate the SCADA network from other networks as possible using  “Demilitarized Zones” (DMZs) and data warehousing19,37.  24. Establish strong controls over any medium that is used as a backdoor into the SCADA  network19,37.  25. Do not rely on proprietary protocols to protect your system: additionally, demand that vendors  disclose any backdoors or vendor interfaces to your SCADA systems, and expect them to  provide systems that are capable of being secured37.  26. Implant Identification, Authentication and Access Control to all network devices, systems and  users19,20,21.  27. Support of biometric authentication for user access to critical components 19,20.  28. Establish a Role-based Access Control (RBAC): roles or responsibilities that a subject or a user  has within the organization and on rules which determine what access rights are permitted for  the subject in a given role. Clearly define cyber security roles, responsibilities, and authorities  for managers, system administrators, and users19,20.  29. Establish an Access Control List (ACL) and a Discretionary Access Control (DAC): list of  permissions associated with an object that is used to specify which subjects, users, process,  components or systems are allowed to access that particular object as well as which operations  the subject can perform on that particular object19,20.  30. Establish the necessary Capability Lists (CL): list of objects associated with the permission to it19.  31. Establish a Mandatory Access Control (MAC): access policy used in multiple-level systems that  require highly sensitive data19,20.  32. Data Classification and Retention: data classification refers to classifying data according their  security (confidentiality, integrity, or availability) level. Retention refers to how long data is kept  before destroyed19.  33. Define a strong Password Requirements and Guidelines and follow them19,20.  34. Follow a correct policy of Control Key Management: all cryptographic keys, load control  commands and network management commands must be encrypted before being shared on  the network and only the intended recipients must possess the decryption keys19,20.  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  28  35. Protect sensitive information using cryptographic functions to avoid external or not authorized  access to it19,20,21. Sensitive information should be assessed by means of proper risk assessment.  36. Encrypt consumer usage data: only entities that are authorized to view the data possess the  decryption keys19,20.  37. Keep personally identifiable information in a minimum number of systems from which it may be  securely accessed19,20.  38. Encrypt the application level load control commands with the trust centre link key: Replay  protection will be provided for this command by using a monotonically increasing sequence  number19.  39. Use Smart Energy Profile 2 (SEP 2) protocol: end-to-end Network Authentication and  Authorization. Application Authentication (ACL). Authorization context (HTTPS, TLS). Digital  Signatures ECDSA-SHA256 and X.509v3 Certificates. Cryptography: ECDHE, ECDSA, AES12820,38.  40. The network key will be exchanged only with devices that successfully complete the join  procedure: the join procedure requires the joining devices to establish a shared secret with the  trust centre and use that to initiate communications. The shared key must be derived from the  device installation code and shared with the trust centre using a secure out-of-band  mechanism. Once the device joins the network successfully, the trust centre sends it the  network key encrypted with the shared secret19.  41. Avoid any unnecessary trade-offs between privacy and legitimate objectives of smart grid  projects19.  42. Visible and transparent to consumers — engaging in accountable business practices — to  ensure that new smart grid systems operate according to stated objectives19,20.  43. Make privacy a core functionality in the design and architecture of smart grid systems and  practices19,20.  44. Build in privacy end-to-end, throughout the entire life cycle of any personal information  collected19,20.  45. The trust centre must ensure availability: the centre must implement mechanisms for high  availability including protection from denial of service attacks, resource starvation, or network  congestion19,20.  Some best practices are related to specific asset type, such as Wireless Neighbourhood Area  Network (WNAN), Demand Response (DR) systems, Gateway, Home Area Network (HAN), Advanced  Metering Infrastructure (AMI), or Master Terminal Unit (MTU).  WAN 9.1.1  This group of security measures covers all wireless communication that is necessary within smart  grids. It covers WNAN (Wireless Neighbourhood Area Network, Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)  and Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN).  1. IEEE 802.11: Use Media Access Control (MAC) address filtering; Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA);  IEEE 802.11w-2009 (an approved amendment to IEEE 802.11 to increase security of the  management frames. The objective of this protocol is to increase the security by providing data  confidentiality of management frames, mechanisms that enable data integrity, data origin  authenticity, and replay protection) 19,20.  2. IEEE 802.15.4: Use MAC address filtering; Flash memories; AES encryption; Source Node  Authentication19,20.  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  29  3.

Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  35  10 Conclusions  Based on the experience gained within this activity, a number of issues have been identified that are  worth further elaboration and/or action from relevant stakeholders. In particular:   Develop attack scenarios for smart grid components. The next step towards facilitating risk  assessments for smart grid infrastructures would be to develop some kind of threat  intelligence in the form of attack scenarios.   Elaborate on criticality assessment. Stakeholders have expressed the necessity to develop  criteria that allow assessing criticality of smart grid components. This would facilitate impact  identification and necessary protection levels.   Develop assessments for various scenarios. It seems to be very advantageous to come up with  some smart grid scenarios. Risk assessments would contribute to the specification of  appropriate security measures for these scenarios.   Elaborate on levels of impact for smart grid incidents. Discussions with stakeholders have  shown the need to define impact thresholds for incidents in the area of smart grids. Such  thresholds would be important parameters for the definition of security levels, identification  and management of critical situations, etc.   As in all CIIP areas, words matter: develop and maintain smart grid security terms and  definitions.   Establish better coordination of European/International activities in the area of smart grids,  including standardisation. Currently, various activities are on-going in this area, involving  multiple organisations and stakeholders. It is important to identify common areas and  coordinate the agendas. This will enable coherence and exploitation of synergies.   Elaborate on the overlapping issues of safety vs. security: smart grid is a traditional  engineering sector in which safety standards are implemented. Cyber security overlaps with  safety as it concerns the operation of parts of the grid. These overlaps need to be identified  and interfaces need to be established.   Establish a platform for information exchange on smart grid security. Following the  coordination of activities, it is important to establish the platform for information flow. This  will enable coherence and exploitation of synergies.   Initiate a debate on need/importance maturity/compliance/certification approaches for (areas  of) smart grid security. As in any industrial area, and in particular in CIIP, it is important to  discuss the importance in setting criteria for measuring security maturity in smart grids.   Track developments in smart grid security and update relevant material. Both smart grid and  cyber security are in a dynamic phase of change/development. This will make updates  important in order to maintain their usability.   Link smart grid activities with other related emerging areas such as smart cities, smart (home)  environments, eMobility, Future Internet, and liaise with related stakeholders. As the scope of  all these areas is quite wide and overlapping, it will be important to identify interfaces and  coordinate common topics.   Create circles of trust to share information about smart grid security. Smart grid security is  falls into CIIP and as such parts of the work need to be kept in confidentiality. For this  purpose, circles of trust among relevant stakeholders need to be developed and modalities  need to be developed for managing this information.  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  36  Annex A:  Description of Smart Grid assets  Information  Information is a valuable asset as, depending on it, machines and staff will make decisions. It can  travel by different supports or represent different meanings. Information assets identified are:   Inventory of electrical assets: physical components that storage the information while it is  travelling or it is being converted: cables, relays, transformers, power switches, earth  switches, controllable/regulating inverter, distribution automation, sensors, equipment  health sensor, fault current limiter, FACTS devices.   Operational information about electrical assets: status indicators, alerts, events and  shortage - disturbance information.   Historical information: information related to the past that must be storage by law or due to  its value / nature.   Trending information: information related to the past that can be used to predict future  behaviour, and so, to be prepared for it.   Trading information: information related with commercial issues.   System Configuration: information related with the network itself: network topology, IP  addresses Allocation, inventory of MAC addresses, user credentials, user permissions,  configuration files, geolocation.  Different information may be susceptible to the security principles: confidentiality, integrity,  availability.  Software  The Software of an infrastructure will let us manage the information (access it, modify it and store  new information). No availability of the required software will mean any access to information.  Main software in a smart grid is:   Applications: we will find different types of applications with different connectivity:  connected with the Internet but only accessed by the staff of the company; application  oriented to end users, to access its own information; real time applications (utility IT  information system capable of integrating, organizing, displaying and analysing real-time or  near real-time electric distribution data to offer a wide range of operational benefits; SCADA  systems: the application that will control industrial processes, in general no connected with  Internet.   Standard Software: software needed to make the applications work.  o Database.  o Web server.   Operating System.   Device Driver: software installed in the different used drivers as USBs, CDs, DVDs, printers,  scanners.   Firmware.  When we analyse this asset, we will need to think about: the origin of the software (is this origin  trustworthy? Do we know the source code?); access to it (who is able to access it and with what kind  of permissions? What procedures of access does it have?); real location of the software (where is the  server that holds is located?).  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  37  Services  The services are activities between a client and a provider. They are considered as valuable assets  because its correct functioning is needed to the correct functioning of the smart grid.  Services oriented to the staff of the smart grid:   Mail Service.   Terminal Service.   Print Service.   Authentication Service.  Services oriented to the network itself and to make possible the necessary communications:   File Service.   Network Service.   Name Service.   Address Service.  Cloud services:   Software as a service.   Infrastructure as a service.  Hardware  The hardware components considered as main assets of a smart grids are:   Smart grid:  o Remote Terminal Unit (RTU): microprocessor-controlled electronic device that  interfaces objects in the physical world to a distributed control system or SCADA  (supervisory control and data acquisition) system by transmitting telemetry data to a  master system, and by using messages from the master supervisory system to  control connected objects.  o Intelligent Electronic Device (IED): term used in the electric power industry to  describe microprocessor-based controllers of power system equipment, such as  circuit breakers, transformers, and capacitor banks.  o Programmable Logic Controller (PLC): digital computer used for automation of  electromechanical processes, such as control of machinery on factory assembly  lines, amusement rides, or light fixtures.  o Distributed Control System (DCS): is a system used in manufacturing to control set of  devices in a distributed environment.   Micro grid: electrical systems that include multiple loads and distributed energy resources  that can be operated in parallel with the grid or as an electrical island; Micro grid Controller:  devices that control and enable the establishment of micro grids.   Smart Meter: electrical meter that records consumption of electric energy in intervals of an  hour or less and communicates that information at least daily back to the utility for  monitoring and billing purposes. The components of smart meters to take into account are:  o Metering End Device, which let us read date at the end points: Electricity; Gas;  Water; Heat.  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  38  o Local Network Access Point (LNAP).  o Neighbourhood Network Access Point (NNAP).  o External Display.  o Home Automation Components.  o AMI Head End (Advanced Metering Infrastructure).   Servers: related with hardware, computer hardware that holds the necessary software to  run an infrastructure.   Clients: devices from which personal staff, end users and potential clients will connect with  available applications:  o PC.  o Notebook.  o Tablet.  o ThinClient.  o PDA.  o (Mobil-)Phone.  o Printer.  o Smart Appliances and Equipment (Customer): home appliances and devices (i.e.,  thermostats, pool pumps, clothes washers/dryers, water heaters, etc.) that use  wireless technology to receive real-time data from the AMI system to control or  modulate their operation.   Network Components: physical devices needed for the correct functioning of the network:  o Advanced Interrupting Switch: switches or technologies that can detect and clear  faults more quickly or without a traditional reclosing sequence.  o Switch.  o Router.  o Bridge.  o Repeater.  o Modem.  o Gateway.  o Firewall.  o WLAN Access Point.   Media: physical support to storage the information:  o Semiconductor Storage.  o Magnetic Storage.  o Optical Storage  o Paper  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  39  o Human   Displays: devices to present the information to the user:  o Monitor  o Beamer   Human Interaction Devices (HID): devices to let the user introduce information to the  system.  o Keyboard  o Mouse  A main issue talking about hardware is the supply chain. For the critical hardware, the supply chain  should be controlled by the owner of the infrastructure.  Infrastructure  Infrastructures are also main assets to protect. There are several types of infrastructures:   Facilities:  o Premises  o Building  o Server Room  o Office  o Auxiliary Room  o Collector  o Data centre   Power:  o Transformer  o Emergency Generator  o UPS   Air Conditioning   Cabling  Personnel  Personnel are now considered a main asset in all the organizations, due to its knowledge and  experience. The existing profiles of personnel in a smart grid are:   User   Operator   Administrator   Developer  Every profile has different access to the rest of the assets.  eMobility  EMobility represents the concept of using electric powertrain technologies, in-vehicle information,  and communication technologies and connected infrastructures to enable the electric propulsion of  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  40  vehicles and fleets. Powertrain technologies include full electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids, as well  as hydrogen fuel cell vehicles that convert hydrogen into electricity. The main assets are:   Electric Vehicle Charging Station.   Vehicles  Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide  9 December 2013  41  Annex B:  Threats assumed for Smart Grid assets  Threat Group Threat Threat details Threat Agent Trend44 Comments  Physical attack  (deliberate/  intentional)  Bomb attack /  threat  Fraud  Fraud by  employees  Employees  Increasing  Sabotage  Corporations  Cybercriminals  Employees  Hacktivists  Nation States  Terrorists45  Vandalism  Employees  Terrorists  Rioter  Theft (of devices,  storage media and  documents)  Theft of  mobile devices  (smartphones/  tablets)  Corporations  Employees  Nation States  Terrorists  Increasing  Stable (theft  internal  staff)  Theft of other  hardware  Corporations  Employees  Nation States  Terrorists  Stable  Information  leakage/sharing  Corporations  Cybercriminals  Employees  Hacktivists  Nation States  Terrorists  Increasing  Unauthorized  physical access /  Unauthorised  entry to premises  Employees  Hacktivists  Terrorists  Coercion, extortion  or corruption  Corporations  Cybercriminals  Employees  Hacktivists  Nation States  Terrorists  44  Threats that have been assigned a trend are the ones that have been encountered within the  ENISA Threat Landscape 2012.  45  Terrorists as a Threat Agent: Based on the publicly available information resources, the profile of  cyber terrorists still seems to be blurry due to lack of concrete evidence. There are opinions in the  literature that cyber criminals and cyber terrorists are involved in similar activities with the  difference being solely in their content. On the other hand, it is reported that terrorists are involved  mostly in sabotage attacks against high impact targets and their capability resources vary from low  to average. Finally, it is often reported that cybercriminals can be engaged by individuals with  terroristic motive to perform an attack on their behalf.

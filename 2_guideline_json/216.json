Despite the spill-overs  and direct attacks, by-and-large the EU has been able to deal with the cyber threats posed  by the Russian aggression through the resilience of its Member States and across Europe,  as well as forging support and cooperation with Ukraine and other allies and partners.  Within this context, ENISA’s challenge is both to keep pace and set the pace in supporting  the Union in achieving a high common level of cybersecurity across Europe. This Single  Programming Document (SPD) for the years 2023-2025 represents another step in  bringing this about.  Firstly, it puts emphasis on strengthening the resilience of Member States and EU  institutions, bodies and agencies. In 2023, approximately half of ENISA’s operational  resources, both budget and human resources, will be dedicated to enhancing operational  cooperation and building capacity. Together with the one-off support of up to 15 million  EUR, which the European Commission allocated to ENISA in Autumn 2022, the Agency  will be able to massively scale up and expand its ex-ante and ex-post services to Member  States in 2023.  Secondly, building on the outcomes of strategic discussions within its Management Board  throughout 2022, the Agency has developed service packages in key areas of its mandate.  They integrate ENISA’s various outputs across different activities, help the agency to  prioritise its actions, build and make use of internal synergies, and ensure that adequate  resources are reserved across the Agency in a transparent manner.  Thirdly, through this work-programme ENISA will endeavour to help Member States to  prepare for the transposition of the reviewed NIS Directive, as well as to prepare the  ground for the roll-out and implementation of the EU cybersecurity certification schemes.  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 5  Finally, recognising the growing need to bring together the EU's activities and resources  across the cybersecurity communities, this SPD establishes a new activity in the area  of research and innovation to structure the Agency’s cooperation and collaboration with  the European Cybersecurity Competence Centre (ECCC) and its emerging networks.  All those areas also accentuate the resource constraints under which the Agency now  operates. The foreseen budget increase for the 2023 work programme has been fully  absorbed by the increase in staff expenditure and inflation. Due to a shortfall of over  3 million EUR, the Agency has had to reduce the scope of some of its operational activities,  limiting the number of exercises and training it rolls-out or postponing its actions in  countering ransomware.  Such reductions mean drawbacks in certain areas and might become a real obstacle if  new tasks should be added to the Agency without a parallel increase in its resources. Thus,  though ENISA welcomes the pioneering set of cybersecurity initiatives being put forward in  2022 and relishes the different and varied roles they imply for the Agency, it needs to have  the right level of human and financial resourcing to match those aims and ambitions.  The EU has been mastering cybersecurity initiatives and structures not least through  a unique general consensus across parties and across Member States as its prime driving  force. This consensus should now also include the resourcing of the Agency. This would give  the Union the ability it needs to steer cybersecurity developments in the years to come.  Juhan Lepassaar Executive Director  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 7  This is the main body of the Work Programme  describing, in terms of its operational and corporate  activities, what the Agency aims to deliver in the year  2023 towards achieving its strategy and the expected  results. Ten operational activities and two corporate  activities in total have been identified to support the  implementation of ENISA’s mandate in 2023.  The activities of the work programme seek to mirror  and align with the tasks set out in chapter two of the  CSA, demonstrating concretely not only the specific  objectives, results and outputs expected for each task  but also the resources assigned.  WORK�PROGRAMME�2023  8  ACTIVITY 1: Providing assistance in policy  development  Overview of activity  This activity delivers assistance and advice to the EU and Member States in developing cybersecurity policy and  sector-specific policy and legislative initiatives on matters related to cybersecurity and on the basis of the 2020  EU Cybersecurity Strategy. Aspects such as privacy and personal data protection are taken into consideration  (including encryption).  The activity seeks to bolster policy initiatives on novel or emerging technology areas by providing technical, fact- driven and tailor-made cybersecurity advice and recommendations. ENISA will support the EC and MSs on new  policy initiatives1 through evidence-based inputs into the process of policy development. ENISA, in coordination  with the EC and Member States will also conduct policy scouting to support them in identifying potential areas  for policy development based on technological, societal and economic trends as well as in developing monitoring  capabilities and tools to regularly and consistently be able to provide advice on the effectiveness of existing  Union policy and law in accordance with the EU’s institutional competencies in the area.  This activity also contributes to the service package INDEX by providing data used in the cybersecurity index  (Activity 8), by providing input that can be used for future certification schemes (CERTI service package ) and by  providing findings and recommendations for the service packages offered to critical NIS sectors (Activity 2).  The added value of this activity is to support decision-makers in a timely manner on developments at the  technological, societal and economic market levels which might affect the cybersecurity policy framework (see  also Activity 8). Given the cross-cutting nature of cybersecurity across the policy landscape, the activity will  provide an up-to-date risk-based analysis of cybersecurity not only in the areas of critical infrastructure and  sectors, but also by providing advice across the field in an integrated and holistic manner. The legal basis for this  activity is Article 5 of the CSA.  •  Foster cybersecurity as an integral part of EU policy (existing and new)  •  Ensure that EU policy makers are regularly informed about the effectiveness of the existing frameworks, and  EU policy makers and stakeholders are provided with timely and tailor-made policy recommendations on  future cybersecurity challenges and opportunities  1 Policy initiatives such as the forthcoming Cyber Resilience Act and initiatives on Artificial Intelligence (AI), 5G, quantum computing,  blockchain, big data, data spaces, digital resilience and response to current and future crises  Objectives  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 9  Work Programme 2023  Stakeholders and levels of engagement3  2 in accordance with Art 20(4) of CSA 3 Stakeholders and levels of engagement stem from the implementation of the ENISA stakeholder strategy  Outputs  1.1.  Assist and advise the EC and Member States  in reviewing the effectiveness of current  cybersecurity policy frameworks  1.2  Assist and advise the EC and MS on new  policy developments, as well as carrying out  preparatory work  1.3  Support policy monitoring of existing  and emerging policy areas and maintain  a catalogue of all relevant cybersecurity  legislations and policies at the EU level  Partners  DG Connect, NIS Cooperation Group, National  Competent Authorities, other formally established  groups, European Commission Directorate  General’s Office and Agencies – depending on  policy area (e.g. DG GROW, European Insurance  and Occupational Pensions Authority)  Involve / Engage  ENISA National Liaison Officers, operators of  essential services, digital service providers and  industry associations or representatives.

Actions  include establishing synergies with and between the various national cybersecurity communities (including the  civilian, law enforcement, cyber diplomacy and cyber defence) and EU actors notably CERT-EU with a view to  exchanging know-how, best practices, providing advice and issuing guidance.  In addition, inline with NIS2 requirements ENISA will continue to support Member States in the CSIRTs Network  in respect of operational cooperation. Moreover with the formal establishement of the EU CyCLONe (Cyber Crisis  Liason Organization Network) in NISD2, ENISA will support tthe coordination of cyber crises by advising and  assisting both networks.  Under this activity ENISA is supporting operational communities through helping to develop and maintain  secure and highly available networks and IT platforms and communication channels to ensure, in particular, the  maintenance, deployment and uptake of the MeliCERTes platform16. Furthemore, in view of the implementation  of the NIS2 Directive, this activity supports coordinated vulnerability disclosure by designated CSIRTs in the  CSIRTs Network and the implementation of a European vulnerability database.  In view of the EC Recommendation 4520 (2021) and Council Conclusions of the 20 October 2021 (ST 13048 2021)  on ‘exploring the potential of the Joint Cyber Unit initiative – complementing the EU Coordinated Response to  Large-Scale Cybersecurity Incidents and Crises’, ENISA will engage in exploring the potential of the JCU, along the  lines and the roles defined according to ongoing discussions amongst MSs and relevant EU institutions, bodies  and agencies. In addition, this activity implements the ENISA Cybersecurity Support Action17.  This activity underpins the Situational Awareness service package and contributes to INDEX and NIS service packages.  The legal basis for this activity is Article 7 of the CSA.

ACTIVITY 11: Performance and risk  management  Overview of activity  This activity seeks to achieve the requirements set out in Art 4(1) of the CSA that sets an objective for the Agency  to: 'be a centre of expertise on cybersecurity by virtue of its independence, the scientific and technical quality of  the advice and assistance it delivers, the information it provides, the transparency of its operating procedures,  the methods of operation, and its diligence in carrying out its tasks'. This objective requires an efficient  performance and risk management framework, and the development of single administrative practices. It also  includes building an internal capacity for contribution, e.g. via shared services, to the EU Agencies network and in  key areas of the Agency’s expertise (e.g. cybersecurity risk management).  Under this activity ENISA will confinue to enhance the key objectives of the renewed organisation, as described  in the MB decision No MB/2020/5, including the need to address the gaps in the Agency’s quality assessment  framework, enhance proper and functioning internal controls and compliance checks. In terms of resource  management the budget management committee ensures the Agency adheres to sound financial management.  The legal basis for this activity is Art 4(1) and Art 32 of the CSA, the latter of which focuses strongly on sound  financial management principles with a view to maximising value to stakeholders.

The actions which will be pursued under this activity will focus on making sure that the Agency’s HR resources fit  the needs and objectives of ENISA, by attracting, retaining and developing talent and building ENISA’s reputation  as an agile and knowledge-based organisation where staff can evolve personally and professionaly, where staff  are kept engaged, motivated and have a sense of belonging. Emphasis will be placed on the development of  competency and ways to make ENISA an ‘employer of choice’ in order to support ENISA’s objectives This activity  will seek to build an attractive workspace by establishing an effective framework enabling teleworking outside the  place of assignment, developing and maintaining excellent working conditions (premises, layout of office space)  and implementing modern user-centric IT and teleconferencing tools delivering state-of-the-art corporate services  and supporting ENISA's business owners and stakeholders in line with the Agency’s objectives.  ENISA will strive to maximise the efficiency of its resources by maintaining its focus on developing a flexible,  highly-skilled and fit-for-purpose workforce through strategic workforce planning in order to ensure the effective  functioning of the Agency and to maintain high quality services in the administrative and operational areas.  ENISA will further improve the support given to it in strategic planning and resource management, leading to  a constant optimisation of resources under short- and long-range time-frames. This will enable ENISA to enhance  its capabilities in future-readiness and continue its path towards an agile, knowledge-based and matrix way of  working. The Agency will continue to look into flexible (50/50) working arrangements to better balance work  requirements in a pragmatic manner.  In parallel, ENISA will continue to enhance its secure operational environment to the highest level, and strive  for excellence in its infrastructure services based on best practices and frameworks. It will also explore cloud- enabled services that are fit for purpose and provide services in accordance with recognised standards. Besides  that, ENISA will strive to promote and foster eco-system solutions, explore opportunities for shared services  with other EU agencies, leverage standard technologies where possible and support flexible ways of working.  As ENISA aspires to become a trusted partner it will continue to provide customer-focused multi-disciplinary  teams that demonstrate a customer centric, can-do and agile attitude.

Despite the spill-overs  and direct attacks, by-and-large the EU has been able to deal with the cyber threats posed  by the Russian aggression through the resilience of its Member States and across Europe,  as well as forging support and cooperation with Ukraine and other allies and partners.  Within this context, ENISA’s challenge is both to keep pace and set the pace in supporting  the Union in achieving a high common level of cybersecurity across Europe. This Single  Programming Document (SPD) for the years 2023-2025 represents another step in  bringing this about.  Firstly, it puts emphasis on strengthening the resilience of Member States and EU  institutions, bodies and agencies. In 2023, approximately half of ENISA’s operational  resources, both budget and human resources, will be dedicated to enhancing operational  cooperation and building capacity. Together with the one-off support of up to 15 million  EUR, which the European Commission allocated to ENISA in Autumn 2022, the Agency  will be able to massively scale up and expand its ex-ante and ex-post services to Member  States in 2023.  Secondly, building on the outcomes of strategic discussions within its Management Board  throughout 2022, the Agency has developed service packages in key areas of its mandate.  They integrate ENISA’s various outputs across different activities, help the agency to  prioritise its actions, build and make use of internal synergies, and ensure that adequate  resources are reserved across the Agency in a transparent manner.  Thirdly, through this work-programme ENISA will endeavour to help Member States to  prepare for the transposition of the reviewed NIS Directive, as well as to prepare the  ground for the roll-out and implementation of the EU cybersecurity certification schemes.  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 5  Finally, recognising the growing need to bring together the EU's activities and resources  across the cybersecurity communities, this SPD establishes a new activity in the area  of research and innovation to structure the Agency’s cooperation and collaboration with  the European Cybersecurity Competence Centre (ECCC) and its emerging networks.  All those areas also accentuate the resource constraints under which the Agency now  operates. The foreseen budget increase for the 2023 work programme has been fully  absorbed by the increase in staff expenditure and inflation. Due to a shortfall of over  3 million EUR, the Agency has had to reduce the scope of some of its operational activities,  limiting the number of exercises and training it rolls-out or postponing its actions in  countering ransomware.  Such reductions mean drawbacks in certain areas and might become a real obstacle if  new tasks should be added to the Agency without a parallel increase in its resources. Thus,  though ENISA welcomes the pioneering set of cybersecurity initiatives being put forward in  2022 and relishes the different and varied roles they imply for the Agency, it needs to have  the right level of human and financial resourcing to match those aims and ambitions.  The EU has been mastering cybersecurity initiatives and structures not least through  a unique general consensus across parties and across Member States as its prime driving  force. This consensus should now also include the resourcing of the Agency. This would give  the Union the ability it needs to steer cybersecurity developments in the years to come.  Juhan Lepassaar Executive Director  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 7  This is the main body of the Work Programme  describing, in terms of its operational and corporate  activities, what the Agency aims to deliver in the year  2023 towards achieving its strategy and the expected  results. Ten operational activities and two corporate  activities in total have been identified to support the  implementation of ENISA’s mandate in 2023.  The activities of the work programme seek to mirror  and align with the tasks set out in chapter two of the  CSA, demonstrating concretely not only the specific  objectives, results and outputs expected for each task  but also the resources assigned.  WORK�PROGRAMME�2023  8  ACTIVITY 1: Providing assistance in policy  development  Overview of activity  This activity delivers assistance and advice to the EU and Member States in developing cybersecurity policy and  sector-specific policy and legislative initiatives on matters related to cybersecurity and on the basis of the 2020  EU Cybersecurity Strategy. Aspects such as privacy and personal data protection are taken into consideration  (including encryption).  The activity seeks to bolster policy initiatives on novel or emerging technology areas by providing technical, fact- driven and tailor-made cybersecurity advice and recommendations. ENISA will support the EC and MSs on new  policy initiatives1 through evidence-based inputs into the process of policy development. ENISA, in coordination  with the EC and Member States will also conduct policy scouting to support them in identifying potential areas  for policy development based on technological, societal and economic trends as well as in developing monitoring  capabilities and tools to regularly and consistently be able to provide advice on the effectiveness of existing  Union policy and law in accordance with the EU’s institutional competencies in the area.  This activity also contributes to the service package INDEX by providing data used in the cybersecurity index  (Activity 8), by providing input that can be used for future certification schemes (CERTI service package ) and by  providing findings and recommendations for the service packages offered to critical NIS sectors (Activity 2).  The added value of this activity is to support decision-makers in a timely manner on developments at the  technological, societal and economic market levels which might affect the cybersecurity policy framework (see  also Activity 8). Given the cross-cutting nature of cybersecurity across the policy landscape, the activity will  provide an up-to-date risk-based analysis of cybersecurity not only in the areas of critical infrastructure and  sectors, but also by providing advice across the field in an integrated and holistic manner. The legal basis for this  activity is Article 5 of the CSA.  •  Foster cybersecurity as an integral part of EU policy (existing and new)  •  Ensure that EU policy makers are regularly informed about the effectiveness of the existing frameworks, and  EU policy makers and stakeholders are provided with timely and tailor-made policy recommendations on  future cybersecurity challenges and opportunities  1 Policy initiatives such as the forthcoming Cyber Resilience Act and initiatives on Artificial Intelligence (AI), 5G, quantum computing,  blockchain, big data, data spaces, digital resilience and response to current and future crises  Objectives  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 9  Work Programme 2023  Stakeholders and levels of engagement3  2 in accordance with Art 20(4) of CSA 3 Stakeholders and levels of engagement stem from the implementation of the ENISA stakeholder strategy  Outputs  1.1.  Assist and advise the EC and Member States  in reviewing the effectiveness of current  cybersecurity policy frameworks  1.2  Assist and advise the EC and MS on new  policy developments, as well as carrying out  preparatory work  1.3  Support policy monitoring of existing  and emerging policy areas and maintain  a catalogue of all relevant cybersecurity  legislations and policies at the EU level  Partners  DG Connect, NIS Cooperation Group, National  Competent Authorities, other formally established  groups, European Commission Directorate  General’s Office and Agencies – depending on  policy area (e.g. DG GROW, European Insurance  and Occupational Pensions Authority)  Involve / Engage  ENISA National Liaison Officers, operators of  essential services, digital service providers and  industry associations or representatives.

ACTIVITY 11: Performance and risk  management  Overview of activity  This activity seeks to achieve the requirements set out in Art 4(1) of the CSA that sets an objective for the Agency  to: 'be a centre of expertise on cybersecurity by virtue of its independence, the scientific and technical quality of  the advice and assistance it delivers, the information it provides, the transparency of its operating procedures,  the methods of operation, and its diligence in carrying out its tasks'. This objective requires an efficient  performance and risk management framework, and the development of single administrative practices. It also  includes building an internal capacity for contribution, e.g. via shared services, to the EU Agencies network and in  key areas of the Agency’s expertise (e.g. cybersecurity risk management).  Under this activity ENISA will confinue to enhance the key objectives of the renewed organisation, as described  in the MB decision No MB/2020/5, including the need to address the gaps in the Agency’s quality assessment  framework, enhance proper and functioning internal controls and compliance checks. In terms of resource  management the budget management committee ensures the Agency adheres to sound financial management.  The legal basis for this activity is Art 4(1) and Art 32 of the CSA, the latter of which focuses strongly on sound  financial management principles with a view to maximising value to stakeholders.

The actions which will be pursued under this activity will focus on making sure that the Agency’s HR resources fit  the needs and objectives of ENISA, by attracting, retaining and developing talent and building ENISA’s reputation  as an agile and knowledge-based organisation where staff can evolve personally and professionaly, where staff  are kept engaged, motivated and have a sense of belonging. Emphasis will be placed on the development of  competency and ways to make ENISA an ‘employer of choice’ in order to support ENISA’s objectives This activity  will seek to build an attractive workspace by establishing an effective framework enabling teleworking outside the  place of assignment, developing and maintaining excellent working conditions (premises, layout of office space)  and implementing modern user-centric IT and teleconferencing tools delivering state-of-the-art corporate services  and supporting ENISA's business owners and stakeholders in line with the Agency’s objectives.  ENISA will strive to maximise the efficiency of its resources by maintaining its focus on developing a flexible,  highly-skilled and fit-for-purpose workforce through strategic workforce planning in order to ensure the effective  functioning of the Agency and to maintain high quality services in the administrative and operational areas.  ENISA will further improve the support given to it in strategic planning and resource management, leading to  a constant optimisation of resources under short- and long-range time-frames. This will enable ENISA to enhance  its capabilities in future-readiness and continue its path towards an agile, knowledge-based and matrix way of  working. The Agency will continue to look into flexible (50/50) working arrangements to better balance work  requirements in a pragmatic manner.  In parallel, ENISA will continue to enhance its secure operational environment to the highest level, and strive  for excellence in its infrastructure services based on best practices and frameworks. It will also explore cloud- enabled services that are fit for purpose and provide services in accordance with recognised standards. Besides  that, ENISA will strive to promote and foster eco-system solutions, explore opportunities for shared services  with other EU agencies, leverage standard technologies where possible and support flexible ways of working.  As ENISA aspires to become a trusted partner it will continue to provide customer-focused multi-disciplinary  teams that demonstrate a customer centric, can-do and agile attitude.

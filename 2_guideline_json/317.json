Since the publication of  the first NCSS-related studies by ENISA in 2012, EU Member States and EFTA countries have  made great progress in developing and implementing their strategies.  This report presents the work performed by ENISA to build a National Capabilities Assessment  Framework (NCAF).  The framework aims at providing Member States with a self-assessment of their level of  maturity by assessing their NCSS objectives, that will help them enhance and build  cybersecurity capabilities both at strategic and at operational level.  It outlines a simple representative view of the Member State’s cybersecurity maturity level. The  NCAF is a tool that helps Member States to:  ▶ Provide useful information to develop a long-term strategy (e.g. good practices,  guidelines);  ▶ Help identify missing elements within the NCSS;  ▶ Help in further building cybersecurity capabilities;  ▶ Support the accountability of political actions;  ▶ Give credibility towards general public and international partners;  ▶ Support outreach and enhance public image as a transparent organisation;  ▶ Help anticipate the issues lying ahead;  ▶ Help identify lessons learnt and best practices;  ▶ Provide a baseline on cybersecurity capacity across the EU to facilitate discussions;  and  ▶ Help evaluate the national capabilities regarding cybersecurity.  This framework was designed with the support of ENISA subject matter experts and  representatives from 19 Member States and EFTA countries1. The target audience of this report  is policymakers, experts and government officials responsible for or involved in designing,  implementing and evaluating an NCSS and, on a broader level, cybersecurity capabilities.  1 Representatives from the following Member States and EFTA countries were interviewed: Belgium, Croatia, Czech  Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lichtenstein, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal,  Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  December 2020  8  The National Capabilities Assessment Framework covers 17 strategic objectives and is  structured around four main clusters:  ▶ Cluster #1: Cybersecurity governance and standards  1. Develop a national cyber contingency plan  2. Establish baseline security measures  3. Secure digital identity and build trust in digital public services  ▶ Cluster #2: Capacity-building and awareness  4. Organise cyber security exercises  5. Establish an incident response capability  6. Raise user awareness  7. Strengthen training and educational programmes  8. Foster R&D  9. Provide incentives for the private sector to invest in security measures  10. Improve the cybersecurity of the supply chain  ▶ Cluster #3: Legal and regulatory  11. Protect critical information infrastructure, OES, and DSP  12. Address cyber crime  13. Establish incident reporting mechanisms  14. Reinforce privacy and data protection  ▶ Cluster #4: Cooperation  15. Establish a public-private partnership  16. Institutionalise cooperation between public agencies  17. Engage in international cooperation  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  December 2020  9  1. INTRODUCTION  The Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive, published in July 2016, requires EU  Member States to adopt a national strategy on the security of network and information systems,  also referred to as an NCSS (National Cyber Security Strategy), as laid down in Articles 1 and  7. In this context, an NCSS is defined as a framework which sets strategic principles, guidelines,  strategic objectives, priorities, appropriate policies and regulatory measures. The foreseen  objective of an NCSS is to reach and maintain a high level of network and systems security,  thus allowing Member States to mitigate potential threats. Moreover, NCSS can also be a  catalizer for industrial development and economic and social progress.  The EU Cybersecurity Act states that ENISA shall promote the dissemination of best practices  in the definition and implementation of an NCSS by supporting Member States in the adoption  of the NIS Directive and by collecting valuable feedback on their experiences. To this end,  ENISA has developed several tools to assist the Member States with developing, implementing  and evaluating their National Cyber Security Strategies (NCSS).  As part of its mandate, ENISA aims to develop a national capabilities self-assessment  framework to measure the level of maturity of the different NCSSs. The objective of this report is  to present the study conducted in the definition of the self-assessment framework.  1.1 STUDY SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES  The main objective of this study is to create a national capabilities self-assessment framework,  later referred to as NCAF, to measure the level of maturity of the cybersecurity capabilities of  the Member States. More specifically, the framework should empower the Member States in:  ▶ Conducting the evaluation of their national cybersecurity capabilities.  ▶ Enhancing awareness of the country maturity level;  ▶ Identifying areas for improvement; and  ▶ Building cybersecurity capabilities.  This framework should help the Member States, and in particular national policymakers, to  perform a self-assessment exercise with the aim to improve national cybersecurity capabilities.  1.2 METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH  The methodological approach used to develop the national capabilities self-assessment  framework relies on four main steps:  1. Desk Research: The first step involved conducting an extensive literature review to  collect best practices regarding developing a maturity assessment framework for  national cybersecurity strategies. The desk research focuses on a systematic analysis  of relevant documents on cybersecurity capacity-building and strategy definition, on  existing Member States’ NCSS’s and on a comparison of existing maturity models on  cybersecurity. A benchmark exercise on existing maturity models was performed  through the adoption of a framework of analysis developed for the purpose of this  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  December 2020  10  study. The framework of analysis builds upon the Becker2 methodology for the  development of maturity models which sets a generic and consolidated procedure  model for the design of maturity models and provides clear requirements for the  development of maturity models. The framework of analysis was further customised to  fulfil the needs of this study.  2. Collection of experts and stakeholders’ point of view: Based on the data gathered  through desk research and the related preliminary findings of the analysis, this phase  involved identifying and inviting identified experts that have experience in the  development and implementation of an NCSS or of maturity models to interview.  ENISA contacted its National Cybersecurity Strategies Experts Group and National  Liaison Officers (NLOs) to find the relevant experts in each Member State. Additionally,  some experts involved in the development of maturity models were interviewed.  Overall, 22 interviews were conducted, 19 of which were conducted with  representatives of cybersecurity agencies within different Member States (and EFTA  countries).  3. Analysis of stocktaking input: The data collected through desk research and the  interviews was subsequently analysed to identify best practices in the design of a self-  assessment framework to measure the maturity of NCSS’s, to understand the needs of  the Member States and to determine which data can feasibly be collected in the  different European countries3. This analysis made it possible to fine-tune the  preliminary model developed in the previous steps and to refine the set of indicators  included in the model, the maturity levels and its dimensions.  4. Finalisation of the model: Thereafter, an updated version of the national capabilities  self-assessment framework was reviewed by the ENISA subject matter experts and  then further validated by experts through a workshop held in October 2020 prior to  publication.  1.3 TARGET AUDIENCE  The target audience of this report is policymakers, experts and government officials responsible  for or involved in designing, implementing and evaluating the NCSS and, on a broader level,  cybersecurity capabilities. Additionally, the findings formalised in this document can be of value  to cybersecurity policy experts and researchers at the national or European level.  2 J. Becker, R. Knackstedt, and J.

NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  December 2020  11  2. BACKGROUND  2.1 PREVIOUS WORK ON NCSS LIFECYCLE  As stated in the EU Cybersecurity Act, one of the main goals of ENISA is to support the Member  States in developing national strategies on the security of network and information systems,  promote the dissemination of those strategies and monitor their implementation. As part of its  mandate, ENISA has produced several documents on this subject in order to foster the sharing  of good practices and support the implementation of NCSS’s across the EU:  ▶ The “Practical guide on the development and execution phase of NCSS”4 published in  2012  ▶ The “Setting the course for national efforts to strengthen security in cyberspace”5  published in 2012  ▶ The first ENISA framework for evaluating a Member State’s NCSS published6 in 2014.  ▶ The “Online NCSS Interactive Map”7 published in 2014.  ▶ The “NCSS Good Practice Guide”8 published in 2016.  ▶ The “National Cybersecurity Strategies Evaluation Tool”9 published in 2018.  ▶ The “Good practices in innovation on Cybersecurity under the NCSS”10 published in  2019.  ANNEX A provides a short summary of ENISA’s main publications on this topic.  The abovementioned guides and documents were studied as part of the desk research. In  particular, the “National Cybersecurity Strategies Evaluation Tool”11 is a foundational element of  the NCAF. The NCAF builds on the objectives covered in the NCSS online evaluation tool.  2.2 COMMON OBJECTIVES IDENTIFIED WITHIN THE EUROPEAN NCSS  The disparity between the different Member States makes it difficult to identify common  activities or action plans among different national contexts, legal frameworks and political  4 NCSS: Practical Guide on Development and Execution (ENISA, 2012)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/national-cyber-security-strategies-an-implementation-guide  5 NCSS: Setting the course for national efforts to strengthen security in cyberspace (ENISA, 2012)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-security-strategies-paper  6 An evaluation framework for NCSS (ENISA, 2014)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/an-evaluation-framework-for-cyber-security-strategies  7 National Cybersecurity Strategies - Interactive Map (ENISA, 2014, updated in 2019)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/national-cyber-security-strategies- interactive-map  8 This document updates the 2012 guide: NCSS Good Practice Guide: Designing and Implementing National Cybersecurity  Strategies (ENISA, 2016)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ncss-good-practice-guide  9 National Cybersecurity Strategies Evaluation Tool (2018)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/national-cyber-security-strategies-guidelines- tools/national-cyber-security-strategies-evaluation-tool  10 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practices-in-innovation-on-cybersecurity-under-the-ncss-1  11 National Cybersecurity Strategies Evaluation Tool (2018)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/national-cyber-security-strategies-guidelines- tools/national-cyber-security-strategies-evaluation-tool  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/national-cyber-security-strategies-an-implementation-guide https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-security-strategies-paper https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/an-evaluation-framework-for-cyber-security-strategies https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/national-cyber-security-strategies-interactive-map https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/national-cyber-security-strategies-interactive-map https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ncss-good-practice-guide https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/national-cyber-security-strategies-guidelines-tools/national-cyber-security-strategies-evaluation-tool https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/national-cyber-security-strategies-guidelines-tools/national-cyber-security-strategies-evaluation-tool https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/national-cyber-security-strategies-guidelines-tools/national-cyber-security-strategies-evaluation-tool https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/national-cyber-security-strategies-guidelines-tools/national-cyber-security-strategies-evaluation-tool  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  December 2020  12  agendas. However, Member States’ NCSS’s often have strategic objectives articulated around  the same topics. Thus, based on ENISA’s previous work and the analysis of Member States’  NCSS’s, 22 strategic objectives were identified. 15 of these strategic objectives were already  identified in ENISA’s previous work, 2 were newly added in this study and 5 objectives were  identified for future considerations.  Common strategic objectives covered by Member States  Based on ENISA’s previous work, namely the National Cybersecurity Strategies Evaluation  Tool12, the following table shows the abovementioned set of 15 strategic objectives that are  commonly covered in the Member States’ NCSS’s. The goals outline the core of the overall  ‘national philosophy’ on the topic. For additional information about the objectives described  below, please refer to the ENISA “NCSS Good Practice Guide” report13.  Table 1: Common strategic objectives covered by Member States in their NCSS  ID NCSS strategic objectives Goals  1  Develop national cyber contingency  plans  ▶ Present and explain the criteria that should be used to define a situation  as a crisis;  ▶ Define key processes and actions for handling the crisis; and  ▶ Clearly define the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders  during a cyber-crisis.  ▶ Present and explain the criteria for a crisis to be over and/or who has  the authority to declare it.  2 Establish baseline security measures  ▶ Harmonise the different practices followed by the organizations in both  the public and the private sector;

NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  December 2020  14  Additional strategic objectives  Based on the desk research performed and the interviews conducted by ENISA, additional  strategic objectives were identified. Member States are increasingly addressing these topics in  their NCSS or defining action plans on the same subject matter. Examples of activities  implemented by Member States are also provided. If an example is from a publicly available  source, a reference is provided. In cases where examples are based on confidential interviews  with EU Member States’ officials, no references are provided.  The following additional strategic objectives were identified:  ▶ Improve the cybersecurity of the supply chain; and  ▶ Secure digital identity and build trust in digital public services.  Improve the cybersecurity of the supply chain  Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of Europe's economy. They  represent 99% of all businesses in the EU14 and in 2015, it was estimated that SMEs have  created around 85% of new jobs and provided two thirds of the total private sector employment  in the EU. Furthermore, as SMEs provide services to large companies and are increasingly  working with public administrations15, it must be noted that in today's interconnected context,  SMEs constitute the weak link for cyber-attacks. Indeed, SMEs are the most exposed to cyber-  attacks, yet they often cannot afford to invest adequately in cybersecurity16. Improving the  cybersecurity of the supply chain should thus be carried out with a focus on SMEs.  In addition to this systemic approach, Member States can also emphasize efforts on the  cybersecurity of specific ICT services and products that are considered essential: ICT  technologies used in critical information infrastructure, security mechanisms enforced in the  telecommunications sector (controls at ISP-level…), trust services as defined in the eIDAS  regulation, and cloud service providers. For example, in its 2019-2024 national cybersecurity  strategy17, Poland committed to develop a national cybersecurity assessment and certification  system as a mechanism for quality assurance in the supply chain. This certification system will  be aligned with the EU certification framework for ICT digital products, services and processes  established by the EU Cybersecurity Act (2019/881).  Improving the cybersecurity of the supply chain is thus of paramount importance. This can be  achieved by establishing strong policies to promote SMEs, providing guidelines for  cybersecurity requirements in public administration procurement procedures, fostering  cooperation within the private sector, building PPPs, promoting coordinated vulnerability  disclosure (CVD) mechanisms18, building product certification scheme, including cybersecurity  components in digital initiatives for SMEs, and funding skills development, among others.  Secure digital identity and build trust in digital public services  In February 2020, the Commission set out its vision for the digital transformation of the EU in  the communication “Shaping Europe’s digital future”19, with the aim of delivering inclusive  technologies that work for people and respect the fundamental values of the EU. In particular,  the communication states that promoting the digital transformation of public administrations  throughout Europe is crucial. In that sense, building trust in government in relation to digital  14 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/  15 https://www.oecd.org/fr/publications/smes-in-public-procurement-9789264307476-en.htm  16https://www.eesc.europa.eu/en/news-media/news/european-companies-especially-smes-face-growing-risk-cyber-attacks- study  17 http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/download.xsp/WMP20190001037/O/M20191037.pdf  18 https://english.ncsc.nl/publications/publications/2019/juni/01/coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure-the-guideline  19 Shaping Europe’s digital future, COM(2020) 67 final:  https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication-shaping-europes-digital-future-feb2020_en_3.pdf  https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/ https://www.oecd.org/fr/publications/smes-in-public-procurement-9789264307476-en.htm https://www.eesc.europa.eu/en/news-media/news/european-companies-especially-smes-face-growing-risk-cyber-attacks-study https://www.eesc.europa.eu/en/news-media/news/european-companies-especially-smes-face-growing-risk-cyber-attacks-study http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/download.xsp/WMP20190001037/O/M20191037.pdf https://english.ncsc.nl/publications/publications/2019/juni/01/coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure-the-guideline https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication-shaping-europes-digital-future-feb2020_en_3.pdf  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  December 2020  15  identity and trust in public services is of paramount importance. This is even more crucial when  considering the fact that public sector transactions and data exchanges are often of sensitive  nature.  Many countries have expressed their intention to address this topic in their NCSS such as:  Denmark, Estonia, France, Luxembourg, Malta, Spain, The Netherlands and The United  Kingdom. Among these countries, some have also expressed that this strategic objective might  be addressed as part of a broader plan:  ▶ Estonia links their associated action plan on “The security of electronic identity and  electronic authentication capability” to the broader Digital Agenda 2020 for Estonia.  ▶ The French NCSS indicates that the Secretary of State responsible for Digital  Technology oversees  the establishment of a roadmap “to protect the digital lives,  privacy and personal data of the French people”.  ▶ The Netherlands NCSS states that cybersecurity in public administrations, as well as  public services provided to citizens and businesses are discussed in greater detail in  The Broad Agenda for Digital Government.  ▶ As the UK Government continues to move more of its services online, it has appointed  the Government Digital Service (GDS) to ensure that all new digital services built or  procured by government are also ‘secure by default’, with the support of the British  National Cybersecurity Centre (NCSC).  Other strategic objectives considered  During the desk research phase and as part of the interviews conducted by ENISA, other strategic  objectives were studied. However, it was decided that these objectives would not form part of the  self-assessment framework. ANNEX C – Other objectives studied  provides definitions for each of these objectives that can be used to nurture future discussions  on possible NCSS improvements.  The following strategic objectives were studied as future considerations:  ▶ Develop sector-specific cybersecurity strategies.  ▶ Fight against disinformation campaigns.  ▶ Secure cutting-edge technologies (5G, AI, quantum computing…);  ▶ Ensure data sovereignty; and  ▶ Provide incentives for the development of the cyber insurance industry.  2.3 KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM THE BENCHMARK EXERCISE  The desktop research on existing maturity models related to cybersecurity was carried out with  the aim of collecting information and evidence to support the design of the national capabilities’  self-assessment framework in the area of NCSS. In this context, an extensive literature review  of existing models was conducted to complement the findings from the initial scoping research  on cybersecurity maturity models and existing NCSS, developed in sections 2.1 and 2.2. This  systematic review supports the selection and justification of the maturity levels of the  assessment framework and the definition of the different dimensions and indicators.  In the scope of the systematic review of maturity models, 10 models were considered and  analysed on the basis of their key features. The global overview of the key features for each  model reviewed in the scope of this study is available in Table 2: Overview of analysed maturity  models and a more detailed analysis can be found in ANNEX A.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  December 2020  16  Table 2: Overview of analysed maturity models  This systematic review made it possible to draw conclusions on best practices adopted in  existing models in order to support the development of the conceptual model for the current  maturity model. In particular, the benchmark exercise supported the definition of the maturity  levels, the creation of dimension clusters and the selection of indicators, as well as an  appropriate visualisation methodology for the results of the model. The most relevant findings  for each of these elements is detailed in Table 3.

Also, it was decided to build upon the ENISA  online interactive tool to develop maturity indicators used for each attribute.  2.4 CHALLENGES OF NCSS EVALUATION  Member States are faced with many challenges when building cybersecurity capabilities and  more specifically, when ensuring that their capabilities are up to date with the latest  developments. Below is a summary of the challenges identified by and discussed with Member  States as part of this study:  ▶ Difficulties in coordination and cooperation: Coordinating cybersecurity efforts at a  national level in order to have an efficient response to cybersecurity issues can prove  to be a challenge due to the high number of stakeholders involved.  ▶ Lack of resources to perform the assessment: Depending on the local context and  cybersecurity national governance structure, evaluating the NCSS and its objectives  can take up to more than 15 person-days.  ▶ Lack of support for developing cybersecurity capabilities: Some Member States  shared that in order to defend a budget and get support to develop cybersecurity  capabilities, they first have to carry out an evaluation phase to identify gaps and  limitations.  ▶ Difficulties in attributing successes or changes to the strategy: As threats evolve  every day and technology improves, action plans constantly need to be adapted in  response. However, evaluating a NCSS and attributing changes to the strategy itself  remains an arduous task. This in turn makes the identification of the limitations and  shortcomings of the NCSS difficult.  Feature Key takeaway  Levels of Maturity  ▶ A five-level maturity scale for assessment frameworks on cybersecurity  capabilities is commonly accepted and able to provide granular  assessment results (see Table 6 Comparison of Maturity Levels for an  exhaustive view of the definition of the levels of maturity for each model);  ▶ All models provide a high-level definition of each maturity level that is then  adapted to the different dimensions or clusters of dimensions;  ▶ Two main aspects are typically assessed when measuring the maturity of  cybersecurity capabilities: the maturity of strategies and the maturity of  processes put in place to implement strategies.  Attributes  ▶ The comparative analysis of the attributes of the existing maturity models  shows heterogeneous results with an average number of attributes per  model between four and five;  ▶ A model relying on around four or five attributes provides countries with the  right level of data granularity by grouping relevant dimensions together and  ensuring the readability of results (see Table 7: Comparison of Attributes/  Dimensions for a description of the attributes for each model);  ▶ The key principle adopted by all models when defining the clusters is  based in the consistency of element grouped within each cluster.  Assessment  method  ▶ The assessment methods used in the different models analysed vary from  one to another;  ▶ The most common assessment method is based on self-evaluation.  Results  representation  ▶ It is important to present the results at different level of granularity;  ▶ The visualisation methodology should be self-explanatory and easy-to- read.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  December 2020  18  ▶ Difficulties to measure the effectiveness of the NCSS: Metrics can be collected to  measure different areas, such as progress, implementation, maturity and effectiveness.  While measuring progress and implementation is relatively easy compared to  measuring effectiveness, the latter remains more meaningful for evaluating the  outcomes and impacts of an NCSS. Based on the interviews conducted by ENISA, a  large number of Member States stated that quantitatively measuring the effectiveness  of an NCSS is important, but it also represents a very demanding task that is quite  impossible in some cases.  ▶ Difficulty to adopt a common framework: EU Member States operate in different  contexts in terms of politics, organizations, culture, society structure and NCSS  maturity. Certain Member States interviewed as part of this study expressed that it  might prove difficult to defend and use a “one-size-fits-all” self-assessment framework.  2.5 BENEFITS OF A NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT  Since 2017, all EU Member States have an NCSS20. While a positive development, it is also  important that Member States are able to properly assess these NCSS’s, thus bringing added  value to their strategic planning and implementation.  One of the goals of the national capabilities assessment framework is to evaluate the  cybersecurity capabilities based on the priorities set forth in the various NCSS’s. Fundamentally,  the framework assesses the level of maturity of the cybersecurity capabilities of the Member  States in the domains defined by the NCSS objectives. Thus, the results of the framework  support the Member States’ policymakers in defining the national strategy on cybersecurity by  providing them with country intelligence on state of play21. The NCAF is ultimately intended to  help Member States identify areas of improvement and build capabilities.  The framework aims at providing Member States with a self-assessment of their level of  maturity by assessing their NCSS objectives that will help them enhance and build  cybersecurity capabilities both at strategic and at operational level.  On a more practical approach, based on the interviews conducted by ENISA with several  agencies responsible of the cybersecurity domain in different Member States, the following  benefits of the national capabilities assessment framework were identified and underlined:  ▶ Provide useful information to develop a long-term strategy (e.g. good practices,  guidelines);  ▶ Help identify missing elements within the NCSS;  ▶ Help in further building cybersecurity capabilities;  ▶ Support the accountability of political actions;  ▶ Give credibility towards general public and international partners;  ▶ Support outreach and enhance public image as a transparent organisation;  ▶ Help anticipate the issues lying ahead;  ▶ Help identify lessons learnt and best practices;  ▶ Provide a baseline on cybersecurity capacity across the EU to facilitate discussions;  and  ▶ Help evaluate the national capabilities regarding cybersecurity.  20 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/national-cyber-security-strategies- interactive-map  21 Weiss, C.H.

METHODOLOGY OF THE  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES  ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  3.1 GENERAL PURPOSE  The main objective of the NCAF is to measure the maturity level of the cybersecurity  capabilities of the Member States to support them in conducting an evaluation of their national  cybersecurity capability, enhancing awareness of the country maturity level, identifying areas for  improvement and building cybersecurity capabilities.  3.2 MATURITY LEVELS  The framework is based on five maturity levels defining the stages that the Member States go  through when building cybersecurity capabilities in the area covered by each NCSS objective.  The levels represent increasing levels of maturity, starting from the initial Level 1, whereby the  Member States do not have a clearly defined approach for cybersecurity capacity-building in the  areas covered by the NCSS objectives and finishing with Level 5, whereby the cybersecurity  capacity-building strategy is dynamic and adaptive to environmental developments. Table 4  shows the maturity level scale with a description of each level of maturity.  Table 4: The ENISA National Capabilities Assessment Framework five-level maturity scale  LEVEL 1 -  INITIAL/AD HOC  LEVEL 2 - EARLY  DEFINITION  LEVEL 3 -  ESTABLISHMENT  LEVEL 4 -  OPTIMISATION  LEVEL 5 -  ADAPTIVENESS  The Member State  does not have a  clearly defined  approach for  cybersecurity  capacity-building in  the areas covered by  the NCSS  objectives.  Nevertheless, the  country might have  some generic goals  in place and have  performed some  studies (technical,  political, policy) to  improve the national  capabilities.  The national  approach for  capacity-building in  the area covered by  the NCSS objectives  has been defined.  The action plans or  activities to reach  the results are in  place but at an early  stage. Additionally,  active stakeholders  might have been  identified and/or  engaged.  The action plan for  capacity-building in  the area covered by  the NCSS objectives  is clearly defined  and supported by  the related  stakeholders. The  practices and  activities are  enforced and  implemented  uniformly at the  national level. The  activities are defined  and documented  with clear resource  allocation and  governance and a  set of deadlines.  The action plan is  assessed on a  regular basis: it is  prioritised,  optimised and  sustainable. The  performance of  cybersecurity  capacity-building  activities is  regularly  measured.  Success factors,  challenges and  gaps in the  implementation of  activities are  identified.  The cybersecurity  capacity-building  strategy is dynamic  and adaptive.  Constant attention to  environmental  developments  (technological  advancements,  global conflict, new  threats…) fosters a  rapid-decision  capability and an  ability to act quickly  for improvement.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  December 2020  20  3.3 CLUSTERS & OVERARCHING STRUCTURE OF THE SELF-  ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  The self-assessment framework is characterised by four clusters: (I) Cybersecurity governance  and standards, (II) Capacity-building and awareness, (III) Legal and regulatory and (IV)  Cooperation. Each of those clusters covers a key thematic area for building cybersecurity  capacity in a country and contains a pool of different objectives that the Member States might  include in their NCSS. In particular:  ▶ (I) Cybersecurity governance and standards: this cluster measures the capacity of  the Member States to establish proper governance, standards and good practices in  the cybersecurity domain. This dimension considers different aspects of cyber-defence  and resilience while supporting the development of the national cybersecurity industry  and building trust in governments;  ▶ (II) Capacity-building and awareness: this cluster assesses the capacity of the  Member States to raise awareness on cybersecurity risks and threats and on how to  tackle them. Additionally, this dimension gauges the ability of the country to  continuously build cybersecurity capabilities and increase the overall level of  knowledge and skills within this domain. It addresses the development of the  cybersecurity market and advancements in cybersecurity R&D. This cluster regroups  all objectives laying the groundwork to foster capacity-building;  ▶ (III) Legal and regulatory: this cluster measures the capacity of the Member States to  put in place the necessary legal and regulatory instruments to address and counter the  rise of cybercrime and related cyber-incidents, and to protect critical information  infrastructure. Additionally, this dimension assess also the capacity of the Member  States to create a legal framework to protect citizens and businesses as for instance in  the case of balancing security with privacy; and  ▶  (IV) Cooperation: this cluster evaluates the cooperation and information sharing  between different stakeholder groups at the national and international level as an  important tool to better understand and respond to a constantly changing threat  environment.  The objectives that have been included in the model are the ones that are commonly adopted  by the Member States, and they have been selected among the objectives listed within section  2.2. In particular, the model assesses the following objectives:  ▶ 1. Develop national cyber contingency plans (I)  ▶ 2. Establish baseline security measures (I)  ▶ 3. Secure digital identity and build trust in digital  public services (I)  ▶ 4. Establish an incident response capability (II)  ▶ 5. Raise user awareness (II)  ▶ 6. Organise cyber security exercises (II)  ▶ 7. Strengthen training and educational  programmes (II)  ▶ 8. Foster R&D (II)  ▶ 9. Provide incentives for the private sector to  invest in security measures (II)  ▶ 10. Improve the cybersecurity of the supply  chain (II)  ▶ 11. Protect critical information infrastructure,  OES, and DSP (III)  ▶ 12. Address cyber crime (III)  ▶ 13. Establish incident reporting mechanisms (III)  ▶ 14. Reinforce privacy and data protection (III)  ▶ 15. Institutionalise cooperation between public  agencies (IV)  ▶ 16. Engage in international cooperation (IV)  ▶ 17. Establish a public-private partnership (IV)  The four clusters and underlying objectives are combined in the model to have a holistic view of  the maturity of the cybersecurity capabilities of the Member States. Figure 1 presents the  overarching structure of the self-assessment framework and shows how these elements,  namely, objectives, clusters and self-assessment framework, are linked to evaluating the  performance of a country.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  21  Figure 1: Self-assessment framework structure  For each objective included within the self-assessment framework, there are a series of  indicators distributed between the five levels of maturity. Every indicator is based on a  dichotomous (yes/no) question. The indicator can be a requisite or a non requisite.  3.4 SCORING MECHANISM  The scoring mechanism of the self-assessment framework takes into consideration the  abovementioned elements and the principles listed in section 3.5. In fact, the model provides a  score based on the value of two parameters, the maturity level and the coverage ratio. Each  of these parameters can be calculated at different levels: (i) per objective, (ii) per cluster of  objectives or (iii) overall.  Scores at objective level  The maturity level score gives an overview of the level of maturity by showing what  capabilities and practices were put in place. The maturity level score is calculated as the highest  level for which the respondent satisfied all the requisites (i.e. YES answer to all requisite  questions), in addition to having fulfilled all requisites of the previous levels of maturity.  The coverage ratio shows the extent of coverage of all the indicators for which the answer is  positive, irrespective of their level. It is a complementary value that takes into account all the  indicators measuring an objective. The coverage ratio is calculated as the proportion between  the total number of questions within the objective and the number of questions for which the  answer is positive.  It is important to clarify that for the rest of the document, the word score is used to refer to both  the values of the maturity level and the coverage ratio.  Figure 2 - Scoring mechanism per objective provides a visualisation of the evaluation  mechanism described in section 3.1 that will be further developed below.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  22  Figure 2: Scoring mechanism per objective  Figure 2 shows an example of how the maturity level is calculated by objective. It is worth noting  that the respondent fulfilled all the requisites of the first three levels of maturity and only partially  fulfilled those of Level 4. Hence, the score indicates that the level of maturity of the  respondent is Level 3 for the “Organise cybersecuritry exercise” objective.  However, in the example depicted in Figure 2, the level of maturity of the objective is not able to  capture the information provided by the indicators that have a positive score and that are above  Level 3 of maturity. In that case, the coverage ratio can provide an overview of all the elements  that the respondent implemented to achieve that objective, despite its actual level of maturity. In  this case, the proportion between the total number of questions within the objective and the  number of questions for which the answer is positive is equal to 19/27 i.e. the coverage ratio  value is 70%.  Additionally, to adapt to the specificities of the Member States whilst also permitting a consistent  overview, the score is calculated from two different samples at cluster level and overall level:  ▶ General scores: one complete sample covering all the objectives included within the  cluster or within the overall framework (from one to 17);  ▶ Specific scores: one specific sample covering only the objectives selected by the  Member State (usually corresponding to the objectives present in the NCSS of the  specific country) within the cluster or within the overall framework.  Scores at cluster level  The general level of maturity of each cluster is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the level  of maturity of all the objectives within that cluster.  The specific level of maturity of each cluster is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the level  of maturity of the objectives within that cluster that the Member State chose to assess (usually  corresponding to the objectives present in the NCSS of the specific country).  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  23  For example, Figure 1 shows that the cluster (I) Cybersecurity governance and standards is  composed of three objectives. Assuming that the respondent chose to assess only the first two  objectives, but not the third, and assuming that the first two objectives present respectively a  level of maturity of 2 and 4, then the level of maturity of the cluster considering all the objectives  is Level 2 (Cluster (I) generic maturity level = (2+4)/3), while the level of maturity of the cluster  considering only the specific objectives selected by the assessor is Level 3 (Cluster (I) specific  maturity level = (2+4)/2).  The general coverage ratio of each cluster is calculated as the proportion between the total  number of questions within the cluster and the number of questions for which the answer is  positive.  The specific coverage ratio of each cluster is calculated as the proportion between the total  number of questions within the cluster pertaining to objectives that the Member State chose to  assess (usually corresponding to the objectives present in the NCSS of the specific country)  and the number of questions for which the answer is positive.  Scores at overall level  The overall general level of maturity of a country is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the  level of maturity of all the objectives within the framework, from one to 17.  The overall specific level of maturity of a country is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the  level of maturity of the objectives within the framework that the Member State chose to assess  (usually corresponding to the objectives present in the NCSS of the specific country)..  The overall general coverage ratio of a country is calculated as the proportion between the  total number of questions within all the objectives included within the framework (from one to  17) and the number of questions for which the answer is positive.  The overall specific coverage ratio of a country is calculated as the proportion between the  total number of questions within the objectives within the framework that the Member State  chose to assess (usually corresponding to the objectives present in the NCSS of the specific  country) and the number of questions for which the answer is positive.  For each indicator, respondents are able to select a third option “don’t know/not applicable” for  their response. In this case, the indicator is excluded from the total calculation of the results.  The maturity levels at cluster level and overall level are computed with an arithmetic mean in  order to show the progress between two assessments. Indeed, the alternative consisting in  computing the cluster and overall maturity levels as the maturity level of the least mature  objective – although relevant from a maturity standpoint – cannot account for the progress  made in areas covered by other objectives.  Since the cluster level and overall level are consolidated for reporting purposes, the choice has  been made to use the arithmetic mean. For more accuracy, please use the scores at objective  level for reporting purposes.  Figure 3 below summarizes the scoring mechanisms throughout the different levels of the model  (objective, cluster, overall).  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  24  Figure 3: Overall scoring mechanism  3.5 REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SELF-ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  The national capabilities assessment framework presented in this section is based on the needs  highlighted by the Member States and it is built around a set of requirements listed hereafter:  ▶ The NCAF is deployed on a voluntary basis by the Member State as a self-assessment  framework;  ▶ The NCAF aims at measuring the Member States’ cybersecurity capabilities with  regards to the 17 objectives. However the Member State can choose the objectives it  wants to assess against and only assess a subset of the 17 objectives;  ▶ The self-assessment framework aims at measuring the level of maturity of the  cybersecurity capabilities of the Member State;  ▶ The results of the assessment are not published unless the Member State decides to  do so on its own initiative;  ▶ The Member State can display the assessment results by presenting the maturity level  of the country’s cybersecurity capabilities, of a cluster of objectives or even of a single  objective;  ▶ All assessed objectives are equally relevant within the assessment framework,  therefore, they have the same importance. The same is applicable to the indicators  deployed within it; and  ▶ The Member State is able to track its progress over time.  The self-assessment framework aims at supporting the Member States in building cybersecurity  capabilities, Hence, it also includes a set of recommendations or guidelines to guide the  European countries in improving their level of maturity.  Note: those recommendations or guidelines are generic and based on ENISA publications and  lessons learnt from other countries and will depend on the result of the self-assessment.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  25  4. NCAF INDICATORS  4.1 FRAMEWORK INDICATORS  This section presents the ENISA National Capabilities Assessment Framework indicators. The  following sections are organised by cluster.  For each cluster, a table presents the comprehensive set of indicators in the form of questions  representative of a given maturity level. The questionnaire is the main instrument for the self-  assessment. For each objective, there are two sets of indicators to be noted:  ▶ A set of generic strategy maturity questions (9 generic questions), marked from ‘a’ to  ‘c’ for each maturity level, repeated for each objective; and  ▶ A set of cybersecurity capacity questions (319 cybersecurity capacity questions),  numbered from ‘1’ to ‘10’ for each maturity level, specific to the area covered by the  objective.  Each question is presented with a tag (0-1) indicating whether the question is a requisite  indicator (1) or a non-requisite indicator (0) for the maturity level.  Each question can be identified by an identification number comprised of:  ▶ The objective number;  ▶ The maturity level; and  ▶ The question number.  For example, question ID 1.2.4 is the fourth question in the maturity level 2 of the strategic  objective (I) \"Develop national cyber contingency plans\".  It must be noted that throughout the questionnaire, the scope of the questions is at national  level unless otherwise stated. In all questions, the \"You\" pronoun refers to the Member State in  a generic manner and does not refer to the individual or government body carrying out the  assessment.  The definition of each objective can be found in chapter 2.2 - Common objectives identified  within the European NCSS.

The recommendations listed below are  mainly deriving from the feedback collected from the interviews with the  Member States’  representatives:  ▶ Anticipate coordination activities to gather data and consolidate data.  Most of  the Member States acknowledge that performing such a self-assessment exercise  should take around 15 person-days. In order to perform the self-assessment, a large  range of different stakeholders will have to be solicited. It is thus recommended to  allocate time for the preparation phase to identify all relevant stakeholders within  government bodies, public agencies and the private sector.  ▶ Identify a central body in charge of completing the self-assessment at national  level. As gathering material for all indicators of the NCAF might involve many  stakeholders, it is recommended to have a central body or agency tasked with  completing the self-assessment by liaising and coordinating with all relevant  stakeholders.  ▶ Use the assessment exercise as a way to share and communicate on  cybersecurity topics. Lessons learnt shared by Member States showed that  discussions (whether taking the format of individual interviews or collective workshops)  are a good opportunity to foster dialogue around cybersecurity topics and to share  common views and areas of improvement. In addition to shining a light on key  achievements, sharing results can also help promote cybersecurity topics.  ▶ Use the NCSS as a scope to select the objectives subjected to the assessment.  The 17 objectives that compose the NCAF were built based on the objectives  commonly covered by Member States in their NCSS. The objectives covered as part of  the NCSS should be used as a mean to scope the assessment. However, the NCSS  should not limit the assessment. As the NCSS naturally focus on priorities, certain  areas are purposely omitted from NCSS. However, it does not imply that a given  capacity is not present. For example, in the case where a specific objective is omitted  from the NCSS, but where the country has cybersecurity capabilities related to that  objective, the assessment of that objective can take place.  ▶ When the NCSS scope evolves, ensure that the score interpretation remains  consistent with the NCSS evolution. The NCSS lifecycle is a multi-year process.  Some Member States’ NCSS are usually enforced with a 3 to 5-year roadmap with  changes in scope between two successive NCSS editions. In that view, special care  must be taken when presenting the self-assessment results between two NCSS  editions: scope changes might indeed impact the final maturity score. It is  recommended to compare the scores on the full scope of strategic objectives from one  year to another (i.e. Overall general score).  Reminder on the scoring mechanism – example on the coverage ratio  The scoring mechanism includes two levels of scores:  (i) an overall general coverage ratio based on the complete list of strategic objectives  present in the self-assessment framework; and  (ii) an overall specific coverage ratio based on strategic objectives selected by the  Member State (usually corresponding to the objectives present in the NCSS of the specific  country).  By design (see section 3.1 on the scoring mechanism), the overall specific coverage ratio  will be equal or higher than the overall general coverage ratio as the later may include  objectives that are not covered by the Member State, thus lowering the overall general  coverage ratio. When a Member State adds a new objective, the overall coverage ratio will  increase (i.e. more maturity indicators covered), whereas the overall specific maturity may  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  53  decrease (in case the newly added objective is at a beginning stage and thus has a low  level of maturity).  ▶ When filling out the self-assessment questionnaire, keep in mind that the  primary goal is to support Member States in cybersecurity capacity-building.  Therefore, when filling in the self-assessment, even if it can be difficult in some  situations to answer the question in a definite manner, it is recommended to choose  the answer that is most generally accepted. If, for example, the answer to a question is  YES on a certain scope but is NO on another scope, Member States should keep in  mind that a NO answer requires an action: either a remediation plan or a plan to act on  an improvement area that must be considered in future developments.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  54  5. NEXT STEPS  5.1 FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS  During interviews with Member States’ representatives and during the desk research phase, the  following recommendations to improve the current National Capabilities Assessment Framework  were also identified as potential future evolutions:  ▶ Develop the scoring system to allow for more accuracy. For example, a  percentage of coverage could be introduced instead of the binary YES/NO answer in  order to better account for the complexity of consolidating the capabilities at national  level. As a first step, a simple approach with YES/NO answers was chosen.  ▶ Introduce quantitative metrics to measure the effectiveness of the Member  States’ NCSS. Indeed, the National Capabilities Assessment Framework focuses on  evaluating the maturity level of the cybersecurity capabilities of the Member States.  This could be complemented by metrics to measure the effectiveness of the activities  and action plans implemented by the Member States to build these capabilities. It did  not seem realistic to build such effectiveness metrics at the current stage given that  there is: little feedback from the field, difficulty finding meaningful indicators that link  output with NCSS implementation, and difficulty building realistic indicators that can be  subsequently gathered. However, this remains a topic for future work.  ▶ Shift from a self-assessment exercise to an assessment approach. A potential  future evolution of the framework might be the shift towards an assessment approach  in order to assess the cybersecurity capabilities maturity of the Member States in a  more consistent manner. Having a third party perform the assessment might indeed  allow to minimize potential bias.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  55  ANNEX A – DESK RESEARCH  RESULTS OVERVIEW  Annex A provides a summary of ENISA previous work on NCSS and a review of relevant  publicly available maturity models on cybersecurity capacity. The following assumptions are  taken into account for the selection and review of the models:  ▶ Not all models are based on a rigorous research methodology;  ▶ The structure and results of the models are not always explained thoroughly with clear links  between the different elements characterising each model;  ▶ Some models do not offer details about the development process, structure and  assessment-methodology;  ▶ Other models and tools we found do not offer any details regarding the structure and the  content and are therefore not listed; and  ▶ The selection of the models for review is based on geographical coverage. The primary  focus will be on maturity models on cybersecurity capacity built to assess the performance  of European countries. However, it is important to expand the geographical coverage to  analyse good practices in building maturity models around the globe.  This systematic review of relevant publicly available maturity models on cybersecurity capacity  was conducted using a customised framework of analysis based on the methodology defined by  Becker for the development of maturity models22. The following elements were analysed for  each existing maturity model:  ▶ Name of the Maturity Model: The name of the maturity model and the main references;  ▶ Institution Source: The institution, whether public or private, in charge of the design of  the model;  ▶ General Purpose and Target: The overall scope of the model and the intended target(s);  ▶ Number and definition of Levels: The number of maturity levels of the model as well as  their general description;  ▶ Number and name of the Attributes: The number and name of attributes that the  maturity model uses. The attributes’ analysis has a three-fold objective:  o Breakdown the maturity model into easily understandable sections;  o Aggregate several attributes into clusters of attributes meeting the same goal; and  o Provide different viewpoints of the maturity level subject.  ▶ Assessment Method: The method of assessment of the maturity model;  ▶ Results’ representation: Define the visualisation method for the results of the maturity  model. The logic behind this step is that maturity models tend to fail if they are too complex  and therefore, the mode of representation must meet practical needs.  22 J. Becker, R. Knackstedt, and J. Pöppelbuß, “Developing Maturity Models for IT Management: A Procedure Model and its  Application,” Business & Information Systems Engineering, vol. 1, no. 3, pp. 213–222, Jun. 2009.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  56  Previous work on NCSS  ENISA published two documents on the topic of NCSS’s in 2012 as part of its early efforts.  Firstly, the “Practical guide on the development and execution phase of NCSS”23 proposed a set  of concrete actions for the efficient implementation of an NCSS and presents the lifecycle of an  NCSS in four phases: strategy development, strategy execution, strategy evaluation and  strategy maintenance. Secondly, a document called “Setting the course for national efforts to  strengthen security in cyberspace”24 outlined the status of cybersecurity strategies within the EU  and beyond in 2012 and proposed that Member States should determine common themes and  differences between their NCSS’s.  In 2014, the first ENISA framework for evaluating a Member State’s NCSS was published25.  This framework contains recommendations and good practices, as well as a set of capacity-  building tools for evaluating an NCSS (e.g. identified objectives, inputs, outputs, key  performance indicators…). Those tools are adapted to the varying needs of countries at  different levels of maturity in their strategic planning. That same year, ENISA published the  “Online NCSS Interactive Map”26, which allows users to quickly consult the NCSS’s of all  Member States and EFTA countries, including their strategic objectives and good examples of  implementation. Developed as first as a NCSS repository (2014), it was updated with examples  of implementation in 2018 and since 2019, the map acts now as an information hub to centralise  data provided by the Member States about their efforts to enhance national cybersecurity.  Published in 2016, the “NCSS Good Practice Guide”27 identifies fifteen strategic objectives. This  guide also analyses the implementation status of each Member State’s NCSS and identifies  various gaps and challenges with regards to this implementation.  In 2018, ENISA then published the “National Cybersecurity Strategies Evaluation Tool”28: an  interactive self-assessment tool to help Member States evaluate their strategic priorities and  objectives related to their NCSS. Through a set of simple questions, this tool provides Member  States with specific recommendations for the implementation of each objective. Finally, the  “Good practices in innovation on Cybersecurity under the NCSS”29 published in 2019 presents  the subject of innovation in cybersecurity under the NCSS. The document sets out challenges  and good practices across the different innovation dimensions, as perceived by subject-matter  experts, in order to help draft future innovative strategic objectives.  A.1 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM)  The Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) has been developed by the  Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre (Capacity Centre), part of the Oxford Martin School  within the University of Oxford. The goal of the Capacity Centre is to increase the scale and  effectiveness of cybersecurity capacity-building, both within the UK and internationally, through  the deployment of the Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model (CMM). The CMM is directly  targeted at countries that wish to increase their national cybersecurity capacity.

Attributes/ Dimensions  The CMM considers cybersecurity capacity to comprise of five dimensions representing the  clusters of cybersecurity capacity. Each cluster represents a different research ‘lens’ through  which cybersecurity capacity can be studied and understood. Within the five dimensions,  factors describe the details of possessing cybersecurity capacity. These details are elements  that contribute to the enhancement of cybersecurity capacity maturity within each dimension.  For each factor, several aspects represent different components of the factor. Aspects  represent an organisational method to divide indicators into smaller clusters that are easier to  comprehend. Each aspect is then evaluated through indicators to describe the steps, actions,  or building blocks that are indicative of a specific stage of maturity (defined in the next section)  within a distinct aspect, factor and dimension.  The terms mentioned above can be layered as shown in the figure below.  Figure 4: Instance of CMM indicators  The five dimensions are detailed below:  i Devising cybersecurity policy and strategy (6 factors);  ii Encouraging responsible cybersecurity culture within society (5 factors);  iii Developing cybersecurity knowledge (3 factors);  iv Creating effective legal and regulatory frameworks (3 factors); and  v Controlling risks through standards, organisations and technologies (7 factors).  Levels of Maturity  The CMM uses 5 levels of maturity to determine to which degree a country has progressed in  relation to a certain factor/aspect of cybersecurity capacity. These levels serve as a snapshot of  the existing cybersecurity capacity:  ▶ Start-up: At this stage, either no cybersecurity maturity exists, or it is very embryonic in  nature. There might be initial discussions about cybersecurity capacity-building, but no  concrete actions have been taken. There is an absence of observable evidence at this  stage;  ▶ Formative: Some features of the aspects have begun to grow and be formulated, but  may be ad-hoc, disorganized, poorly defined – or simply “new”. However, evidence of  this activity can be clearly demonstrated;  ▶ Established: The elements of the aspect are in place and working. There is not,  however, well thought-out consideration of the relative allocation of resources. Little  trade-off decision making has been made concerning the “relative” investment in the  various elements of the aspect. However, the aspect is functional and defined;  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  58  ▶ Strategic: Choices have been made about which parts of the aspect are important,  and which are less important for the particular organisation or nation. The strategic  stage reflects the fact that these choices have been made, conditional on the nation or  organization's particular circumstances; and  ▶ Dynamic: At this stage, there are clear mechanisms in place to alter strategy  depending on the prevailing circumstances such as the technology of the threat  environment, global conflict or a significant change in one area of concern (e.g.  cybercrime or privacy). Dynamic organisations have developed methods for changing  strategies in stride. Rapid decision-making, reallocation of resources, and constant  attention to the changing environment are features of this stage.  Assessment Method  As the Capacity Centre does not have a thorough and in-depth understanding of each domestic  context in which the model is deployed, it works alongside international organisations, host  ministries or organisations within the respective country to review the cybersecurity capacity  maturity. In order to assess the level of maturity of the five dimensions included in the CMM, the  Capacity Centre and the host organisation meets with relevant national stakeholders of the  public and private sectors over the course of 2 or 3 days to conduct focus groups on the  dimensions of the CMM. Each dimension is discussed at least twice by different clusters of  stakeholders. This constitutes the preliminary pool of data for the subsequent assessment.  Mode or representation of the results  The CCM provides an overview of the maturity level of each country through a radar composed  of five sections, one for each dimension. Each dimension represents one fifth of the graphic,  with the five stages of maturity for each factor extending outwards from the centre of the  graphic; as shown below, ‘start-up’ is closest to the centre of the graphic and ‘dynamic’ is at the  perimeter.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  59  Figure 5 CMM: Results overview  Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre Oxford Martin School, University of Oxford, 2017.  A.2 Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model (C2M2)  The Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model (C2M2) has been developed by the U.S.  Department of Energy in collaboration with private and public sector experts. The goal of the  Capacity Centre is to help organizations of all sectors, types, and sizes to evaluate and make  improvements to their cybersecurity programs and strengthen their operational resilience. The  C2M2 focuses on the implementation and management of cybersecurity practices associated  with information, information technology (IT), and operations technology (OT) assets and the  environments in which they operate. The C2M2 defines maturity models as: “a set of  characteristics, attributes, indicators, or patterns that represent capability and progression in a  particular discipline”. Initially deployed in 2014, the C2M2 was revised in 2019.  Attributes/ Dimensions  The C2M2 considers ten domains representing a logical grouping of cybersecurity practices.  Each set of practices represents the activities an organization can perform to establish and  mature capability in the domain. Each domain is then associated with a unique management  objective and several approach objectives. Within both approach and management  objectives, several practices are detailed to describe institutionalized activities.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  60  The relationship between these notions is summed up below:  Figure 6: Instance of C2M2 indicator  The ten domains are detailed below:  i Risk Management (RISK);  ii Asset, Change, and Configuration Management (ASSET);  iii Identity and Access Management (ACCESS);  iv Threat and Vulnerability Management (THREAT);  v Situational Awareness (SITUATION);  vi Event and Incident Response (RESPONSE);  vii Supply Chain and External Dependencies Management (DEPENDENCIES);  viii Workforce Management (WORKFORCE);  ix Cybersecurity Architecture (ARCHITECTURE); and  x Cybersecurity Program Management (PROGRAM).  Levels of Maturity  The C2M2 uses 4 levels of maturity (named Maturity Indicator Levels – MIL) to determine a  dual progression of maturity: an approach progression and a management progression. The  MILs  range from MIL0 to MIL3 and are meant to be applied independently to each domain.  ▶ MIL0: Practices are not performed.  ▶ MIL1: Initial practices are performed but may be ad hoc.  ▶ MIL2: Management characteristics:  o Practices are documented;  o Adequate resources are provided to support the process;  o Personnel performing the practices have adequate skills and knowledge; and  o Responsibility and authority for performing the practices are assigned.  Approach characteristic:  o Practices are more complete or advanced than at MIL1.  ▶ MIL3: Management characteristics:  o Activities are guided by policies (or other organizational directives);  o Performance objectives for domain activities are established and monitored to  track achievement; and  o Documented practices for domain activities are standardized and improved  across the enterprise.  Approach characteristic:  o Practices are more complete or advanced than at MIL2.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  61  Assessment Method  The C2M2 is designed for use with a self-evaluation methodology and toolkit (available by  request) for an organization to measure and improve its cybersecurity program. A self-  evaluation using the toolkit can be completed in one day, but the toolkit could be adapted for a  more rigorous evaluation effort. Additionally, the C2M2 can be used to guide the development of  a new cybersecurity program.  The model content is presented at a high level of abstraction so it can be interpreted by  organizations of various types, structures, sizes, and industries. Broad use of the model by a  sector can support benchmarking of the sector’s cybersecurity capabilities.  Mode or representation of the results  The C2M2 provides an Evaluation Scoring Report generated from the survey results. The report  presents results in two views: the Objective view, which shows practice question responses by  each domain and its objectives, and the Domain view, which shows responses by all domains  and MILs. Both views are based on a representation system characterised by pie charts (or  “doughnuts”), one per response, and a traffic light system scoring mechanism. As shows in  Figure 7, the red sectors in a doughnut chart show a count of the number of questions that  received survey responses of “Not Implemented” (dark red) or “Partially Implemented” (light  red). The green sectors show the number of questions that received responses of “Largely  Implemented” (light green) or “Fully Implemented” (dark green).  Figure 7 below is an example of a scoring card at the end of a maturity assessment. In the X  axis are the 10 domains of the C2M2, and in the Y axis, the levels of maturity (MILs). Looking at  the graph and considering the domain of Risk Management (RM), it is possible to notice three  pie charts, one corresponding to each level of maturity MIL1, MIL2 and MIL3. For the domain  RM, the graph highlights that there are two items to be evaluated for reaching the first level of  maturity, MIL1. In this case, one scoring “largely implemented” and one scoring “Partially  implemented”. For the second level on maturity, MIL2, the model foresees 13 items to be  evaluated. Two of those 13 items belong to the first level, MIL1, and 11 to the second level,  MIL2. The same is applicable for the third level MIL3.

NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  62  A.3 Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity  The Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity was developed within the  National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). It focuses on guiding cybersecurity  activities and managing risks within an organisation. It is aimed at all types of organisations  regardless of size, degree of cybersecurity risk, or cybersecurity sophistication. As this is a  framework and not a model, it is built differently than the models analysed previously.  The Framework consists of three parts: the Framework Core, the Implementation Tiers, and the  Framework Profiles:  ▶ The Framework Core is a set of cybersecurity activities, desired outcomes, and  applicable references that are common across critical infrastructure sectors. These are  similar to the attributes or dimensions found in cybersecurity capacity maturity models.  ▶ Framework Implementation Tiers (“Tiers”) provide context on how an organization  views cybersecurity risk and the processes in place to manage that risk. Ranging from  Partial (Tier 1) to Adaptive (Tier 4), Tiers describe an increasing degree of rigor and  sophistication in cybersecurity risk management practices. Tiers do not represent  maturity levels, rather, they are meant to support organizational decision making about  how to manage cybersecurity risk, as well as which dimensions of the organization are  higher priority and could receive additional resources.  ▶ A Framework Profile (“Profile”) represents the outcomes based on business needs  that an organization has selected from the Framework Categories and Subcategories.  The Profile can be characterized with regards to the alignment of standards,  guidelines, and practices to the Framework Core in a particular implementation  scenario. Profiles can be used to identify opportunities for improving cybersecurity  posture by comparing a “Current” profile (the “as is” state) with a “Target” profile (the  “to be” state).  Framework Core  The Framework Core consists of five Functions. When considered together, these Functions  provide a high-level, strategic view of the lifecycle of an organization’s management of  cybersecurity risk. The Framework Core then identifies underlying key Categories and  Subcategories for each Function and matches them with example Informative References such  as existing standards, guidelines, and practices for each Subcategory.  Functions and Categories are detailed below:  i Identify: Develop an organizational understanding about how to manage cybersecurity  risks for systems, people, assets, data, and capabilities.   Subcategories: Asset Management; Business Environment; Governance; Risk  Assessment; and Risk Management Strategy  ii Protect: Develop and implement appropriate safeguards to ensure delivery of critical  services.   Subcategories: Identity Management and Access Control; Awareness and  Training; Data Security; Information Protection Processes and Procedures;  Maintenance; and Protective Technology  iii Detect: Develop and implement appropriate activities to identify the occurrence of a  cybersecurity event.   Subcategories: Anomalies and Events; Security Continuous Monitoring; and  Detection Processes.  iv Respond: Develop and implement appropriate activities to take action regarding a  detected cybersecurity incident.   Subcategories: Response Planning; Communications; Analysis; Mitigation; and  Improvements.  v Recover: Develop and implement appropriate activities to maintain plans for resilience  and to restore any capabilities or services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity  incident.   Subcategories: Recovery Planning; Improvements; and Communications  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  63  Figure 8: Instance of the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity  Tiers  The Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity relies on 4 Tiers, each of  which is defined along three axes: Risk Management Process, Integrated Risk Management  Program and External Participation. The Tiers are not to be considered as maturity levels but as  a framework to provide organizations with a contextualisation of their views of cybersecurity risk  and the processes in place to manage that risk.  ▶ Tier 1: Partial  o Risk Management Process: organizational cybersecurity risk management  practices are not formalized, and risk is managed in an ad hoc and sometimes  reactive manner;  o Integrated Risk Management Program: there is limited awareness of  cybersecurity risk at the organizational level. The organization implements  cybersecurity risk management on an irregular, case-by-case basis and may not  have processes that enable cybersecurity information to be shared within the  organization;  o External Participation: the organization does not understand its role in the larger  ecosystem with respect to either its dependencies or dependents. The  organization is generally unaware of the cyber supply chain risks of the products  and services it provides and that it uses;  ▶ Tier 2: Risk Informed  o Risk Management Process: risk management practices are approved by  management but may not be established as organizational-wide policy;  o Integrated Risk Management Program: there is an awareness of cybersecurity  risk at the organizational level, but an organization-wide approach to managing  cybersecurity risk has not been established. Cyber risk assessment of  organizational and external assets occurs but is not typically repeatable or  reoccurring;  o External Participation: generally, the organization understands its role in the  larger ecosystem with respect to either its own dependencies or dependents, but  not both. Additionally, the organization is aware of the cyber supply chain risks  associated with the products and services it provides and uses but does not act  consistently or formally upon those risks;  ▶ Tier 3: Repeatable  o Risk Management Process: the organization’s risk management practices are  formally approved and expressed as policy. Organizational cybersecurity practices  are regularly updated based on the application of risk management processes to  changes in business/mission requirements and a changing threat and technology  landscape;  o Integrated Risk Management Program: there is an organization-wide approach  to manage cybersecurity risk. Risk-informed policies, processes, and procedures  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  64  are defined, implemented as intended, and reviewed. Senior executives ensure  consideration of cybersecurity through all lines of operation in the organization;  o External Participation: the organization understands its role, dependencies, and  dependents in the larger ecosystem and may contribute to the community’s  broader understanding of risks. The organization is aware of the cyber supply  chain risks associated with the products and services it provides and that it uses;  ▶ Tier 4: Adaptive  o Risk Management Process: the organization adapts its cybersecurity practices  based on previous and current cybersecurity activities, including lessons learned  and predictive indicators;  o Integrated Risk Management Program: there is an organization-wide approach  to managing cybersecurity risk that uses risk-informed policies, processes, and  procedures to address potential cybersecurity events; and  o External Participation: the organization understands its role, dependencies, and  dependents in the larger ecosystem and contributes to the community’s broader  understanding of risks.  Assessment Method  The Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity is meant for organisations to  self-assess their risk in order to make their cybersecurity approach and investments more  rational, effective and valuable. To examine the effectiveness of investments, an organization  must first have a clear understanding of its organizational objectives, the relationship between  those objectives and supportive cybersecurity outcomes. The cybersecurity outcomes of the  Framework Core support self-assessment of investment effectiveness and cybersecurity  activities.  A.4 Qatar Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model (Q-C2M2)  The Qatar Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model (Q-C2M2) was developed by the Qatar  University’s College of Law in 2018. The Q-C2M2 is based on various existing models to build a  comprehensive assessment methodology to enhance Qatar’s cybersecurity framework.  Attributes/ Dimensions  The Q-C2M2 adopts the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Framework’s  approach of using five core functions as the main domains of the model. The five core functions  are applicable in the Qatari context because they are common across critical infrastructure  sectors, an important element in the Qatari cybersecurity framework. The Q-C2M2 is based on  five domains, each domain is then divided in several subdomains to cover the whole range of  cybersecurity capability maturity.  The five domains are detailed below:  i The Understand domain includes four subdomains: Cyber governance, Assets,  Risks, and Training;  ii Subdomains under the Secure domain include Data Security, Technology Security,  Access Control Security, Communications Security, and Personnel Security;  iii The Expose domain includes the subdomains of Monitoring, Incident Management,  Detection, Analysis, and Exposure;  iv The Respond domain includes Response Planning, Mitigation, and Response  Communication; and  v The Sustain domain includes Recovery Planning, Continuity Management,  Improvement, and External Dependencies.  Levels of Maturity  The Q-C2M2 uses 5 levels of maturity measuring the capability maturity of a state entity or  non-state organization at the core function level. These levels are aimed at assessing maturity  in the five domains detailed in the previous section.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  65  ▶ Initiating: Employs ad-hoc cybersecurity practices and processes under some of the  domains;  ▶ Implementing: Adopted policies to implement all of the cybersecurity activities under  the domains with the aim of completing the implementation at a certain time;  ▶ Developing: Implemented policies and practices to develop and improve cybersecurity  activities under the domains with the aim of suggesting new activities to implement;  ▶ Adaptive: Revisits and reviews cybersecurity activities and adopts practices based on  predictive indicators derived from previous experiences and measures; and  ▶ Agile: Continues to practice the adaptive stage with an added emphasis on agility and  speed when implementing activities in the domains.  Assessment Method  The Q-C2M2 is at an early stage of research and is not yet built for implementation. It is a  framework that could be used to deploy a detailed assessment model for Qatari organisations in  the future.  A.5 Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC)  The Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) was developed by the U.S. Department  of Defense (DoD) in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University and Johns Hopkins University  Applied Physics Laboratory. The main objective of the DoD in the design of this model is to  protect information from the Defense Industrial Base sector (DIB). The information targeted by  the CMMC is classified as either “Federal Contract Information”, information provided by or  generated for the Government under contract not intended for public release, or “Controlled  Unclassified Information”, information that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls  pursuant to and consistent with laws, regulations and government-wide policies. The CMMC  measures cybersecurity maturity and provides best practices along with a certification element  to ensure the implementation of practices associated with each maturity level. The latest version  of the CMMC was released in 2020.  Attributes/ Dimensions  The CMMC considers seventeen domains representing clusters of cybersecurity processes  and capabilities. Each domain is then broken down into multiple processes that are similar  across domains; and one to many capabilities spanning over five levels of maturity. The  capabilities (or capability) are then detailed into practices for each relevant maturity level.  The relationship between these notions is as follows:  Figure 9: Instance of CMMC indicators  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  66  The seventeen domains are detailed below:  i Access Control (AC);  ii Asset Management (AM);  iii Audit and Accountability (AU);  iv Awareness and Training (AT);  v Configuration Management (CM);  vi Identification and Authentication (IA);  vii Incident Response (IR);  viii Maintenance (MA);  ix Media Protection (MP);  x Personnel Security (PS);  xi Physical Protection (PE);  xii Recovery (RE);  xiii Risk Management (RM);  xiv Security Assessment (CA);  xv Situational Awareness (SA);  xvi System and Communications Protection (SC); and  xvii System and Information Integrity (SI).  Levels of Maturity  The CMMC uses 5 levels of maturity defined based on processes and practices. In order to  reach a certain level of maturity in the CMMC, an organization needs to fulfil the prerequisites  for the processes and the practices for that level itself. This also implies the fulfillment of the  prerequisites of all the level below that one.  Figure 10: CMMC Maturity Levels  ▶ Level 1  o Processes – Performed: because the organization may only be able to perform  these practices in an ad-hoc manner and may or may not rely on documentation.  Process maturity is not assessed for Level 1;  o Practices – Basic Cyber Hygiene: level 1 focuses on the protection of FCI  (Federal Contract Information) and consists only of practices that correspond to  the basic safeguarding requirements;  ▶ Level 2  o Processes – Documented: level 2 requires that an organization establish and  document practices and policies to guide the implementation of their CMMC  efforts. The documentation of practices enables individuals to perform them in a  repeatable manner. Organizations develop mature capabilities by documenting  their processes and then practicing them as documented;  o Practices – Intermediate Cyber Hygiene: level 2 serves as a progression from  Level 1 to Level 3 and consists of a subset of the security requirements specified  in NIST SP 800-171 as well as practices from other standards and references;  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  67  ▶ Level 3  o Processes – Managed: level 3 requires that an organization establish, maintain,  and resource a plan demonstrating the management of activities for practice  implementation. The plan may include information on missions, goals, project  plans, resourcing, required training, and involvement of relevant stakeholders;  o Practices – Good Cyber Hygiene: level 3 focuses on the protection of CUI and  encompasses all of the security requirements specified in NIST SP 800-171 as  well as additional practices from other standards and references to mitigate  threats;  ▶ Level 4  o Processes – Reviewed: level 4 requires that an organization review and measure  practices for effectiveness. In addition to measuring practices for effectiveness,  organizations at this level are able to take corrective action when necessary and  inform higher level management of status or issues on a recurring basis;  o Practices – Proactive: level 4 focuses on the protection of CUI (Controlled  Unclassified Information) and encompasses a subset of the enhanced security  requirements. These practices enhance the detection and response capabilities of  an organization to address and adapt to the changing tactics, techniques, and  procedures;  ▶ Level 5  o Processes – Optimizing: level 5 requires an organization to standardize and  optimize process implementation across the organization; and  o Practices – Advanced/Proactive: level 5 focuses on the protection of CUI. The  additional practices increase the depth and sophistication of cybersecurity  capabilities.  Assessment Method  The CMMC is a relatively young model, finalised in the first quarter of 2020. Thus far, it has not  been deployed within any organisations. Nevertheless, the DoD contractors expect to reach out  to certified third party examiners to conduct audits. The DoD is expecting its contractors to  implement best practices to foster cybersecurity and the protection of sensitive information.  A.6 The Community Cyber Security Maturity Model (CCSMM)  The Community Cyber Security Maturity Model (CCSMM) was developed by the Centre for  Infrastructure Assurance and Security within The University of Texas. The goal of the CCSMM  is to better define methods to determine the current status of a community in its cyber-  preparedness and provide a roadmap for communities to follow in their preparation efforts. The  communities targeted by the CCSMM are mainly local or state governments. The CCSMM was  designed in 2007.  Attributes/ Dimensions  Levels of maturity are defined following 6 main dimensions that cover the different aspects of  cybersecurity within communities and organisations. These dimensions are clearly defined for  each level of maturity (detailed in the Figure 31: Summary of the CCSMM) The 6 dimensions  are:  i Threats Addressed;  ii Metrics;  iii Information Sharing;  iv Technology;  v Training; and  vi Test.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  68  Levels of Maturity  The CCSMM relies on 5 levels of maturity based on the main types of threats and activities  addressed at the level:  ▶ Level 1: Security Aware  The major theme of activities at this level is to make individuals and organizations  aware of the threats, problems, and issues related to cybersecurity;  ▶ Level 2: Process Development  Level designed to help communities establish and improve security processes required  to effectively address cybersecurity issues;  ▶ Level 3: Information Enabled  Designed to improve information sharing mechanisms within the community to enable  the community to effectively correlate seemingly disparate pieces of information.  ▶ Level 4: Tactics Development  This level elements are designed to develop better and more proactive methods to  detect and respond to attacks. By this level, most prevention methods should be in  place.  ▶ Level 5: Full Security Operational Capability  This level represents those elements that should be in place for any organization to  consider itself fully operationally ready to address any type of cyber threat.  Figure 31: Summary of the CCSMM dimensions per level  Assessment Method  The CCSMM as an assessment methodology is meant to be deployed by communities with input  from state and federal law enforcement agencies. It aims to help the community to define what is  most important, what are the most likely targets, and what needs to be protected (and to which  extent). With these objectives in mind, plans can be developed to bring each aspect of the  community to their required level of cybersecurity maturity. The specific intelligence generated by  the CCSMM helps to define the goals of various tests and exercises that can be used to measure  the effectiveness of established programs.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  69  A.7 Information Security Maturity Model for NIST Cyber Security  Framework (ISMM)  The Information Security Maturity Model (ISMM) has been developed within the College of  Computer Sciences and Engineering of the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals in  Saudi Arabia. It proposes a new capability maturity model to measure the implementation of  cybersecurity measures. The goal of the ISMM is to enable organisations to measure their  implementation progress over time by using the same measuring tool on a regular basis to  ensure that the desired security posture is maintained. The ISMM was developed in 2017.  Attributes/ Dimensions  The ISMM builds on the existing assessed areas of the NIST framework and adds a dimension  on compliance assessment. This brings the model to 23 assessed areas to for an  organisation’s security posture. The 23 assessed areas are:  i Asset Management;  ii Business Environment;  iii Governance;  iv Risk Assessment;  v Risk Management Strategy;  vi Compliance Assessment;  vii Access Control;  viii Awareness and Training;  ix Data Security;  x Information Protection Processes and Procedures;  xi Maintenance;  xii Protective Technology;  xiii Anomalies and Events;  xiv Security Continuous Monitoring;  xv Detection Processes;  xvi Response Planning;  xvii Response Communications;  xviii Response Analysis;  xix Response Mitigation;  xx Response Improvements;  xxi Recovery Planning;  xxii Recovery Improvements; and  xxiii Recovery Communications.  Levels of Maturity  The ISMM relies on 5 levels of maturity, which, unfortunately are not detailed in the available  documentation.  ▶ Level 1: Performed Process;  ▶ Level 2: Managed Process;  ▶ Level 3: Established Process;  ▶ Level 4: Predictable Process; and  ▶ Level 5: Optimizing Process.  Assessment Method  The ISMM does not propose any specific methodology to conduct the assessment for  organisations.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  70  A.8 Internal Audit Capability Model (IA-CM) for the Public Sector  The Internal Audit Capability Model (IA-CM) was developed by the Institute of Internal auditors  Research Foundation with the intention to build capacity and advocacy through self-assessment  in the public sector. Aimed at audit professionals, the IA-CM provides an overview of the model  itself along with an Application Guide to assist in the use of the model as a self-assessment tool.  Despite the IA-CM being focused on Internal Audit capability, rather than cybersecurity capacity-  building, the model is built as a maturity self-assessment tool for public sector entities that can be  applied globally to improve processes and effectiveness. As the scope is not focused on  cybersecurity, the attributes will not be analysed. The IA-CM was finalised in 2009.  Levels of Maturity  The Internal Audit Capability Model (IA-CM) includes 5 levels of maturity, each of which  describe the characteristics and capabilities of an Internal Audit activity at that level. The  capability levels in the model provide a road map for continuous improvement.  ▶ Level 1: Initial  No sustainable, repeatable capabilities – dependent upon individual efforts  o Ad hoc or unstructured.  o Isolated single audits or reviews of documents and transactions for accuracy and  compliance.  o Outputs dependent upon the skills of the specific person holding the position.  o No professional practices established other than those provided by professional  associations.  o Funding approval by management, as needed.  o Absence of infrastructure.  o Auditors likely part of a larger organizational unit.  o Institutional capability is not developed.  ▶ Level 2: Infrastructure  Sustainable and repeatable practices and procedures  o Key question or challenge for Level 2 is how to establish and maintain  repeatability of processes and thus a repeatable capability.  o internal audit reporting relationships, management and administrative  infrastructures, and professional practices and processes are being established  (internal audit guidance, processes, and procedures).  o Audit planning based principally on management priorities.  o Continued reliance essentially on the skills and competencies of specific persons.  o Partial conformance with the standards.  ▶ Level 3: Integrated  Management and professional practices uniformly applied  o Internal audit policies, processes, and procedures are defined, documented, and  integrated into each other and the organization’s infrastructure.  o Internal audit management and professional practices are well established and  uniformly applied across the internal audit activity.  o Internal audit is starting to align with the organization’s business and the risks it  faces.  o internal audit evolves from conducting only traditional internal audit to integrating  as a team player and providing advice on performance and management of risks.  o Focus is on team building and capacity of the internal audit activity and its  independence and objectivity.  o Generally conforms with the standards.  ▶ Level 4: Managed  Integrates information from across the organization to improve governance and risk  management  o Internal audit and key stakeholders’ expectations are in alignment.  o Performance metrics are in place to measure and monitor internal audit processes  and results.  o Internal audit is recognized as delivering significant contributions to the  organization.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  71  o Internal audit functions as an integral part of the organization’s governance and  risk management.  o Internal audit is a well-managed business unit.  o Risks are measured and managed quantitatively.  o Requisite skills and competencies are in place with a capacity for renewal and  knowledge sharing (within internal audit and across the organization).  ▶ Level 5: Optimizing  Learning from inside and outside the organization for continuous improvement  o Internal audit is a learning organization with continuous process improvements  and innovation.  o Internal audit uses information from inside and outside the organization to  contribute to achieving strategic objectives.  o World-class/recommended/best practice performance.  o Internal audit is a critical part of the organization’s governance structure.  o Top-level professional and specialized skills.  o Individual, unit, and organizational performance measures are fully integrated to  o drive performance improvements.  Assessment Method  The Internal Audit Capability Model is clearly built for self-assessment. It provides detailed steps  to follow for using the IA-CM and a sample slides deck to customize. Prior to the start of the  self-assessment, a specific team is to be identified, including, at minimum, one person skilled in  conducting internal or external assessments of internal audits and one person who is involved in  making improvements in this area.  Figure 12: IC-AM Self-Assessment Steps  A.9 The Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI)  The Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) is an initiative of the International Telecommunication  Union (ITU) aimed at reviewing the cybersecurity commitment and situation in all the ITU  regions: Africa, Americas, Arab States, Asia-Pacific, CIS, and Europe, and puts countries with  high commitment and recommendable practices in the spotlight. The goal of the GCI is to help  countries identify areas for improvement in the field of cybersecurity, as well as motivate them to  take action to improve their ranking, thus helping raise the overall level of cybersecurity  worldwide.  As the GCI is an index and not a maturity model, it doesn’t use levels of maturity but rather a  score to rank and compare the global cybersecurity commitment of nations and regions.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  72  Attributes/ Dimensions  The Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) is based on the five pillars of the Global Cybersecurity  Agenda (GCA). These pillars form the five sub-indices of the GCI and each includes a set of  indicators. The five pillars and indicators are as follows:  i Legal: measures based on the existence of legal institutions and frameworks dealing  with cybersecurity and cybercrime.   Cybercrime legislation;   Cybersecurity regulation; and   Containment/curbing of spam legislation.  ii Technical: Measures based on the existence of technical institutions and frameworks  dealing with cybersecurity.   CERT/CIRT/CSRIT;   Standards Implementation Framework;   Standardization Body;   Technical mechanisms and capabilities deployed to address Spam;   Use of cloud for cybersecurity purposes; and   Child Online Protection mechanisms.  iii Organizational: Measures based on the existence of policy coordination institutions  and strategies for cybersecurity development at the national level.   National Cybersecurity Strategy;   Responsible Agency; and   Cybersecurity.  iv Capacity-building: Measures based on the existence of research and development,  education and training programmes, certified professionals and public sector agencies  fostering capacity-building.   Public awareness campaigns;   Framework for the certification and accreditation of cybersecurity  professionals;   Professional training courses in cybersecurity;   Educational programs or academic curricular in cybersecurity;   Cybersecurity R&D programs; and   Incentive mechanisms.  v Cooperation: Measures based on the existence of partnerships, cooperative  frameworks and information sharing networks.   Bilateral agreements;   Multilateral agreements;   Participation in international fora/associations;   Public-Private Partnerships;   Inter-agency/intra-agency partnerships; and   Best Practices.  Assessment Method  The GCI is a self-assessment tool built through a survey30 of binary, pre-coded, and open-  ended questions. The use of binary answers eliminates opinion-based evaluation and any  possible bias towards certain types of answers. The pre-coded answers save time and allow a  more accurate data analysis. Moreover, a simple dichotomous scale allows for a quicker and  more complex evaluation as it does not require lengthy answers, which accelerates and  streamlines the process of providing answers and further evaluation. The respondent should  only confirm presence of, or lack of, certain pre-identified cybersecurity solutions. An online  survey mechanism, which is used for gathering answers and uploading relevant material,  enables the extraction of good practices and a set of thematic qualitative evaluations by a panel  of experts.  30 https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Cybersecurity/Documents/GCIv4/GCIv4_English.pdf  https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Cybersecurity/Documents/GCIv4/GCIv4_English.pdf  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  73  The overall GCI process is implemented as follows:  ▶ A letter of invitation is sent to all participants, informing them of the initiative and  requesting a focal point responsible for collecting all relevant data and for completing  the online GCI questionnaire. During the online survey, the approved focal point is  officially invited by ITU to answer the questionnaire;  ▶ Primary data collection (for countries that do not respond to the questionnaire):   ITU elaborates an initial draft response to the questionnaire using publicly  available data and online research;   The draft questionnaire is sent to focal points for review;   Focal points improve the accuracy and then return the draft questionnaire;   The corrected draft questionnaire is sent to each focal point for final approval;  and   The validated questionnaire is used for analysis, scoring, and ranking.  ▶ Secondary data collection (for countries that respond to the questionnaire):   ITU identifies any missing responses, supporting documents, links, etc;   The focal point improves the accuracy of the responses where necessary;   The corrected draft questionnaire is sent to each focal point for final approval;  and   The validated questionnaire is used for analysis, scoring and ranking.  A.10 The Cyber Power Index (CPI)  The Cyber Power Index (CPI) was created by the Economist Intelligence Unit research program  sponsored by Booz Allen Hamilton in 2011. The CPI is a “dynamic quantitative and qualitative  model, […] that measures specific attributes of the cyber environment across four drivers of  cyber power: legal and regulatory framework; economic and social context; technology  infrastructure; and industry application, which examines digital progress across key  industries”31. The objective of the Cyber Power Index is to benchmark the capability of the G20  countries to withstand cyber-attacks and deploy the required digital infrastructure for a thriving  and secure economy. The benchmark provided by the CPI focuses on 19 countries of the G20  (excluding the EU). The index then provides a ranking of countries for each indicator.  Attributes/ Dimensions  The Cyber Power Index (CPI) is based on four drivers of cyber power. Each category is then  measured through multiple indicators to give each country a specific score. The categories and  pillars are as follows:  i Legal and Regulatory Framework   Government commitment to cyber development   Cyber protection policies   Cyber censorship (or lack thereof)   Political efficacy   Intellectual property protection  ii Economic and Social Context   Educational levels   Technical skills   Openness of trade   Degree of innovation in the business environment  iii Technology Infrastructure   Access to information and communications technology   Quality of information and communications technology   Affordability of information and communications technology   Spending on information technology   Number of secure servers  31 www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/cybersecurity-capacity/system/files/EIU%20- %20Cyber%20Power%20Index%20Findings%20and%20Methodology.pdf  http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/cybersecurity-capacity/system/files/EIU%20-%20Cyber%20Power%20Index%20Findings%20and%20Methodology.pdf http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/cybersecurity-capacity/system/files/EIU%20-%20Cyber%20Power%20Index%20Findings%20and%20Methodology.pdf  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  74  iv Industry Application   Smart grids   E-Health   E-Commerce   Intelligent transportation   E-Government  Assessment Method  The CPI is a quantitative and qualitative scoring model. The assessment was conducted by The  Economist Intelligence Unit using quantitative indicators from available statistical sources and  making estimates when data was lacking. The main sources used are the Economist  Intelligence Unit; the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO); the  International Telecommunications Union (ITU); and the World Bank.

There might be initial  discussions about cybersecurity  capacity-building, but no concrete  actions have been taken. There is  an absence of observable  evidence at this stage.  Formative  Some features of the aspects  have begun to grow and be  formulated, but may be ad-hoc,  disorganized, poorly defined – or  simply “new”. However, evidence  of this activity can be clearly  demonstrated.  Established  The elements of the aspect are in  place and working. There is not,  however, well thought-out  consideration of the relative  allocation of resources. Little  trade-off decision making has  been made concerning the  “relative” investment in the  various elements of the aspect.  However, the aspect is functional  and defined.  Strategic  Choices have been made about  which parts of the aspect are  important, and which are less  important for the particular  organisation or nation. The  strategic stage reflects the fact  that these choices have been  made, conditional upon the nation  or organization's circumstances.  Dynamic  There are clear mechanisms in  place to alter strategy depending  on the prevailing circumstances  such as the technology of the  threat environment, global conflict  or a significant change in one  area of concern (e.g. cybercrime  or privacy). Dynamic  organisations have developed  methods for changing strategies  in stride. Rapid decision-making,  reallocation of resources, and  constant attention to the changing  environment are feature of this  stage.

NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  77  Cybersecurity  Maturity Model  Certification  (CMMC)  Processes: Performed  Because the organization may  only be able to perform these  practices in an ad-hoc manner  and may or may not rely on  documentation process maturity  is not assessed for Level 1.  Practices: Basic Cyber Hygiene  Level 1 focuses on the protection  of FCI (Federal Contract  Information) and consists only of  practices that correspond to the  basic safeguarding requirements.  Processes: Documented  Level 2 requires that an  organization establish and  document practices and policies  to guide the implementation of  their CMMC efforts. The  documentation of practices  enables individuals to perform  them in a repeatable manner.  Organizations develop mature  capabilities by documenting their  processes and then practicing  them as documented.  Practices: Intermediate Cyber  Hygiene  Level 2 serves as a progression  from Level 1 to Level 3 and  consists of a subset of the  security requirements specified in  NIST SP 800-171 as well as  practices from other standards  and references.  Processes: Managed  Level 3 requires that an  organization establish, maintain,  and resource a plan  demonstrating the management  of activities for practice  implementation. The plan may  include information on missions,  goals, project plans, resourcing,  required training, and involvement  of relevant stakeholders.  Practices: Good Cyber  Hygiene. Level 3 focuses on the  protection of CUI (Controlled  Unclassified Information) and  encompasses all of the security  requirements specified in NIST  SP 800-171 as well as additional  practices from other standards  and references to mitigate  threats.  Processes: Reviewed.  Level 4 requires that an  organization reviews and  measures practices for  effectiveness. In addition to  measuring practices for  effectiveness, organizations at  this level are able to take  corrective action when necessary  and inform higher level  management of status or issues  on a recurring basis.  Practices: Proactive  Level 4 focuses on the protection  of CUI (Controlled Unclassified  Information) and encompasses a  subset of the enhanced security  requirements. These practices  enhance the detection and  response capabilities of an  organization to address and  adapt to the changing tactics,  techniques, and procedures.  Processes: Optimizing  Level 5 requires an organization  to standardize and optimize  process implementation across  the organization.  Practices: Advanced/Proactive  Level 5 focuses on the protection  of CUI (Controlled Unclassified  Information). The additional  practices increase the depth and  sophistication of cybersecurity  capabilities.  The Community  Cyber Security  Maturity Model  (CCSMM)  Security Aware  The major theme of activities at  this level is to make individuals  and organizations aware of the  threats, problems, and issues  related to cyber security  Process Development  Level designed to help  communities establish and  improve upon the security  processes required to effectively  address cyber security issues.  Information Enabled  Designed to improve upon the  information sharing mechanisms  within the community to enable  the community to effectively  correlate seemingly disparate  pieces of information.  Tactics Development  This level elements are designed  to develop better and more  proactive methods to detect and  respond to attacks. By this level  most prevention methods should  be in place.  Full Security Operational  Capability  This level represents those  elements that should be in place  for any organization to consider  itself fully operationally read y to  address any type of cyber threat.

The following objectives are not part of the National  Capabilities Assessment Framework, but they shine a light on topics that are worth discussing.  Each of the following sub-chapters will provide an explanation as to why the objective was  discarded.  ▶ Develop sector-specific cybersecurity strategies;  ▶ Fight against disinformation campaigns;  ▶ Secure cutting-edge technologies (5G, AI, quantum computing…);  ▶ Ensure data sovereignty; and  ▶ Provide incentives for the development of the cyber insurance industry.  Develop sector-specific cybersecurity strategies  The adoption of sector-specific strategies that target sector interventions and incentives  certainly introduces a stronger decentralised capability. It is particularly fitting for Member States  whose OES’s must deal with different frameworks and regulations and where there are many  dependencies due to the transversal nature of cybersecurity. Indeed, in several Member States,  it is common to count dozens of national authorities and regulatory bodies with knowledge of  each sector’s specificities that hold a mandate to enforce specific regulation for each sector.  Denmark, for example, launched six targeted strategies addressing the most critical sectors’  cyber and information security efforts to develop a stronger decentralised capability in cyber and  information security. Each ‘sectoral unit’ will contribute to threat assessments at sectoral level,  monitoring, preparedness exercises, establishment of security systems, knowledge-sharing and  instructions, among others. The sector-specific strategies cover the following sectors:  ▶ Energy;  ▶  Healthcare;  ▶  Transport;  ▶  Telecommunication;  ▶  Finance; and  ▶  Maritime.  Other Member States have expressed interest in considering sector-specific cybersecurity  strategies to reflect all regulatory requirements. However, it must be noted that such an  objective might not fit all Member States depending on their size, national policies and maturity.  The great difficulty to ensure that the framework can account for all specificities led ENISA to  not include this objective in the framework.  Fight against disinformation campaigns  Member States integrate the protection of fundamental principles such as human rights,  transparency and public trust into their national cybersecurity strategies. This is very important  especially when it comes to disinformation that is disseminated via traditional news media or  social media platforms. In addition, cybersecurity is currently one of the greatest electoral  challenges. Indeed, activities such as spreading false information or negative propaganda have  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  86  been observed in various countries in the run-up to important elections. This threat has the  potential to undermine the EU democratic process. At the European level, the Commission has  outlined an Action Plan32 to step up efforts to counter disinformation in Europe: this plan focuses  on 4 key areas (detection, cooperation, collaboration with online platforms and awareness) and  serves to build the EU's capabilities and strengthen cooperation between Member States.  4 out of 19 interviewed countries have expressed their intent to tackle the issue of  disinformation and propaganda in their NCSS.  For example, the French NCSS33 notes that: “it is the State’s responsibility to inform citizens of  the risks of manipulation and propaganda techniques used by malicious players on the Internet.  For example, after the terrorist attacks against France in January 2015, the Government  established an information platform on the risks related to Islamic radicalisation via electronic  communication networks: « Stop-djihadisme.gouv.fr ».” This approach could be extended to  respond to other phenomena of propaganda or destabilisation.  In another example, Poland’s 2019-2024 NCSS34 states that: “against manipulative activities  such as disinformation campaigns, systemic actions are needed to develop citizens' awareness  in the context of verifying the authenticity of information and responding to attempts to distort it.”  However, during interviews conducted by ENISA, several Member States shared that they do  not address the issue as part of their NCSS as a cybersecurity threat but rather tackle the issue  at a broader societal level, for example, via policy initiatives.  Secure cutting-edge technologies (5G, AI, quantum computing…)  As the current cyber threat landscape continues to expand, the development of new  technologies will most probably result in an increase in the intensity and number of cyber-  attacks and the diversification of methods, means and targets employed by threat actors. In the  meantime, these new technological solutions in the form of cutting-edge technologies have the  potential to become the building blocks of the European Digital Market. In order to safeguard  Member States' growing digital dependency and the emergence of new technologies, incentives  and fully-fledged policies should be established to support the secure and trustworthy  development and deployment of these technologies in the EU.  During the desk research phase performed on Member States' NCSS’s, the following cutting-  edge technologies were put forward as being of interest to the Member States: 5G, AI, quantum  computing, cryptography, edge computing, connected and autonomous vehicles, big and smart  data, blockchain, robotics and IoT.  More particularly, in early 2020, the European Commission published a communication calling  on Member States to take steps to implement the set of measures recommended in the 5G  toolbox conclusions35. This 5G toolbox comes in the wake of Recommendation (EU) 2019/534  on the cybersecurity of 5G networks adopted by the Commission in 2019, which called for a  unified European approach to the security of 5G networks36.  During interviews conducted by ENISA, it was highlighted that this topic is more of a transversal  topic which is addressed across the NCSS rather than as a specific objective per se.  32 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/action-plan-against-disinformation  33 https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2015/10/strategie_nationale_securite_numerique_en.pdf  34 http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/download.xsp/WMP20190001037/O/M20191037.pdf  35https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/secure-5g-deployment-eu-implementing-eu-toolbox-communication- commission  36 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019H0534  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/action-plan-against-disinformation https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2015/10/strategie_nationale_securite_numerique_en.pdf http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/download.xsp/WMP20190001037/O/M20191037.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/secure-5g-deployment-eu-implementing-eu-toolbox-communication-commission https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/secure-5g-deployment-eu-implementing-eu-toolbox-communication-commission https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019H0534  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  87  Ensure data sovereignty  On the one hand, cyberspace can be seen as a formidable global common space, which is  easily accessible, providing a high degree of connectivity and able to yield great opportunities  for socio-economic growth. On the other hand, cyberspace is also characterized by its weak  jurisdiction, difficulty to attribute actions, lack of frontiers, and interconnected systems which can  be porous and whose data can be stolen or even accessed by foreign governments. In addition  to these two perspectives, the digital ecosystem is marked by the concentration of online  service platforms and infrastructure in the hands of very few stakeholders. All aspects  aforementioned lead Member States to promote digital sovereignty. Achieving digital  sovereignty means that citizens and businesses are able to fully thrive by using digital services  and ICT products that are trustworthy without any fear for one’s personal data, or digital assets,  one’s economic autonomy or one’s political influence.  Data sovereignty or digital sovereignty is championed by Member States at the national level  and at the European level. While Member States do not seem to address the issue directly in  their NCSS as a specific objective, they either address it as a transversal principle or they  outline their intention to ensure digital sovereignty at national level outline in ad hoc publications  by focusing on key technologies. For example, in the 2018 French strategic review of cyber  defence, it is stated that “controlling the following technologies are of paramount importance to  ensure digital sovereignty: communication encryption, cyber-attack detection, professional  mobile radio, cloud computing and artificial intelligence”37.  At the European level, Member States are actively participating in defining the European  strategy for Data (COM/2020/66 final) and building the EU certification framework for ICT digital  products, services and processes established by the EU Cybersecurity Act (2019/881) to ensure  strategic digital autonomy at European level.  The interview phase with Member States showed that the topic of digital sovereignty is often  considered as a broader issue than one which is restricted to cybersecurity. Therefore, Member  States do not cover the topic in their NCSS’s and for the few who do, they do not cover it as a  specific objective per se.  Provide incentive to the development of the cyber insurance industry  The current state of play of the cyber insurance industry shows that the global market has  undisputedly grown. However, it is still in its early days as data must be collected and many  precedents must still be set (e.g. silent coverage, systemic cyber risks…). Furthermore, the  estimated losses aggregated from cyber-attacks around the globe are several orders of  magnitude higher than the current cyber insurance industry coverage capacity (IMF Working  Paper - Cyber Risk for the Financial Sector: A Framework for Quantitative Assessment  WP/18/143). However, developing the cyber insurance industry can certainly yield benefits and  lay the foundation for virtuous mechanisms. Indeed, cyber insurance mechanisms can help in:  ▶ Raising awareness about cybersecurity risks in companies;  ▶ Evaluating the exposure to cyber risks in quantitative manner;  ▶ Improving cybersecurity risk management;  ▶ Providing support to organisations that are victims of cyber-attacks; and  ▶ Covering the damage (material or not) induced by a cyber-attack.  37 http://www.sgdsn.gouv.fr/uploads/2018/03/revue-cyber-resume-in-english.pdf  http://www.sgdsn.gouv.fr/uploads/2018/03/revue-cyber-resume-in-english.pdf  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  88  Certain Member States started to work on this topic. For example:  ▶ Estonia adopted a \"wait and see\" approach in their NCSS: \"To mitigate cyber risks in  the private sector in general, demand and supply of cyber insurance service in Estonia  will be analysed and on that basis, cooperative principles for related parties will be  agreed upon, including information sharing, preparation of risk assessment, etc.  Today, suppliers of cyber insurance service are few on the Estonian market and it is  necessary to first map who offers what. The complexity of insurance protection is often  considered a hindrance to the development of the cyber insurance market.\"  ▶ Luxembourg specifically supports the development of the cyber insurance industry in  its NCSS: ”Objective 1: Creating new products and services. To pool risks and  encourage victims of digital cyber incidents to seek help from experts to manage the  incident and restore a system affected by a malicious act, insurance companies will be  encouraged to create specific products for the area of cyber insurance.\"  Feedbacks from interviewees were quite diverse on this topic: some Member States stated that  the cyber insurance topic has recently become a topic of discussion, while others shared that  although the topic is promising, the industry is not mature enough yet. However, a great number  of interviewees declared that the topic is not tackled as part of the NCSS, either because it was  deemed to be too specific or not within the scope of the NCSS.

Since the publication of  the first NCSS-related studies by ENISA in 2012, EU Member States and EFTA countries have  made great progress in developing and implementing their strategies.  This report presents the work performed by ENISA to build a National Capabilities Assessment  Framework (NCAF).  The framework aims at providing Member States with a self-assessment of their level of  maturity by assessing their NCSS objectives, that will help them enhance and build  cybersecurity capabilities both at strategic and at operational level.  It outlines a simple representative view of the Member State’s cybersecurity maturity level. The  NCAF is a tool that helps Member States to:  ▶ Provide useful information to develop a long-term strategy (e.g. good practices,  guidelines);  ▶ Help identify missing elements within the NCSS;  ▶ Help in further building cybersecurity capabilities;  ▶ Support the accountability of political actions;  ▶ Give credibility towards general public and international partners;  ▶ Support outreach and enhance public image as a transparent organisation;  ▶ Help anticipate the issues lying ahead;  ▶ Help identify lessons learnt and best practices;  ▶ Provide a baseline on cybersecurity capacity across the EU to facilitate discussions;  and  ▶ Help evaluate the national capabilities regarding cybersecurity.  This framework was designed with the support of ENISA subject matter experts and  representatives from 19 Member States and EFTA countries1. The target audience of this report  is policymakers, experts and government officials responsible for or involved in designing,  implementing and evaluating an NCSS and, on a broader level, cybersecurity capabilities.  1 Representatives from the following Member States and EFTA countries were interviewed: Belgium, Croatia, Czech  Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lichtenstein, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal,  Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  December 2020  8  The National Capabilities Assessment Framework covers 17 strategic objectives and is  structured around four main clusters:  ▶ Cluster #1: Cybersecurity governance and standards  1. Develop a national cyber contingency plan  2. Establish baseline security measures  3. Secure digital identity and build trust in digital public services  ▶ Cluster #2: Capacity-building and awareness  4. Organise cyber security exercises  5. Establish an incident response capability  6. Raise user awareness  7. Strengthen training and educational programmes  8. Foster R&D  9. Provide incentives for the private sector to invest in security measures  10. Improve the cybersecurity of the supply chain  ▶ Cluster #3: Legal and regulatory  11. Protect critical information infrastructure, OES, and DSP  12. Address cyber crime  13. Establish incident reporting mechanisms  14. Reinforce privacy and data protection  ▶ Cluster #4: Cooperation  15. Establish a public-private partnership  16. Institutionalise cooperation between public agencies  17. Engage in international cooperation  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  December 2020  9  1. INTRODUCTION  The Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive, published in July 2016, requires EU  Member States to adopt a national strategy on the security of network and information systems,  also referred to as an NCSS (National Cyber Security Strategy), as laid down in Articles 1 and  7. In this context, an NCSS is defined as a framework which sets strategic principles, guidelines,  strategic objectives, priorities, appropriate policies and regulatory measures. The foreseen  objective of an NCSS is to reach and maintain a high level of network and systems security,  thus allowing Member States to mitigate potential threats. Moreover, NCSS can also be a  catalizer for industrial development and economic and social progress.  The EU Cybersecurity Act states that ENISA shall promote the dissemination of best practices  in the definition and implementation of an NCSS by supporting Member States in the adoption  of the NIS Directive and by collecting valuable feedback on their experiences. To this end,  ENISA has developed several tools to assist the Member States with developing, implementing  and evaluating their National Cyber Security Strategies (NCSS).  As part of its mandate, ENISA aims to develop a national capabilities self-assessment  framework to measure the level of maturity of the different NCSSs. The objective of this report is  to present the study conducted in the definition of the self-assessment framework.  1.1 STUDY SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES  The main objective of this study is to create a national capabilities self-assessment framework,  later referred to as NCAF, to measure the level of maturity of the cybersecurity capabilities of  the Member States. More specifically, the framework should empower the Member States in:  ▶ Conducting the evaluation of their national cybersecurity capabilities.  ▶ Enhancing awareness of the country maturity level;  ▶ Identifying areas for improvement; and  ▶ Building cybersecurity capabilities.  This framework should help the Member States, and in particular national policymakers, to  perform a self-assessment exercise with the aim to improve national cybersecurity capabilities.  1.2 METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH  The methodological approach used to develop the national capabilities self-assessment  framework relies on four main steps:  1. Desk Research: The first step involved conducting an extensive literature review to  collect best practices regarding developing a maturity assessment framework for  national cybersecurity strategies. The desk research focuses on a systematic analysis  of relevant documents on cybersecurity capacity-building and strategy definition, on  existing Member States’ NCSS’s and on a comparison of existing maturity models on  cybersecurity. A benchmark exercise on existing maturity models was performed  through the adoption of a framework of analysis developed for the purpose of this  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  December 2020  10  study. The framework of analysis builds upon the Becker2 methodology for the  development of maturity models which sets a generic and consolidated procedure  model for the design of maturity models and provides clear requirements for the  development of maturity models. The framework of analysis was further customised to  fulfil the needs of this study.  2. Collection of experts and stakeholders’ point of view: Based on the data gathered  through desk research and the related preliminary findings of the analysis, this phase  involved identifying and inviting identified experts that have experience in the  development and implementation of an NCSS or of maturity models to interview.  ENISA contacted its National Cybersecurity Strategies Experts Group and National  Liaison Officers (NLOs) to find the relevant experts in each Member State. Additionally,  some experts involved in the development of maturity models were interviewed.  Overall, 22 interviews were conducted, 19 of which were conducted with  representatives of cybersecurity agencies within different Member States (and EFTA  countries).  3. Analysis of stocktaking input: The data collected through desk research and the  interviews was subsequently analysed to identify best practices in the design of a self-  assessment framework to measure the maturity of NCSS’s, to understand the needs of  the Member States and to determine which data can feasibly be collected in the  different European countries3. This analysis made it possible to fine-tune the  preliminary model developed in the previous steps and to refine the set of indicators  included in the model, the maturity levels and its dimensions.  4. Finalisation of the model: Thereafter, an updated version of the national capabilities  self-assessment framework was reviewed by the ENISA subject matter experts and  then further validated by experts through a workshop held in October 2020 prior to  publication.  1.3 TARGET AUDIENCE  The target audience of this report is policymakers, experts and government officials responsible  for or involved in designing, implementing and evaluating the NCSS and, on a broader level,  cybersecurity capabilities. Additionally, the findings formalised in this document can be of value  to cybersecurity policy experts and researchers at the national or European level.  2 J. Becker, R. Knackstedt, and J.

NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  December 2020  11  2. BACKGROUND  2.1 PREVIOUS WORK ON NCSS LIFECYCLE  As stated in the EU Cybersecurity Act, one of the main goals of ENISA is to support the Member  States in developing national strategies on the security of network and information systems,  promote the dissemination of those strategies and monitor their implementation. As part of its  mandate, ENISA has produced several documents on this subject in order to foster the sharing  of good practices and support the implementation of NCSS’s across the EU:  ▶ The “Practical guide on the development and execution phase of NCSS”4 published in  2012  ▶ The “Setting the course for national efforts to strengthen security in cyberspace”5  published in 2012  ▶ The first ENISA framework for evaluating a Member State’s NCSS published6 in 2014.  ▶ The “Online NCSS Interactive Map”7 published in 2014.  ▶ The “NCSS Good Practice Guide”8 published in 2016.  ▶ The “National Cybersecurity Strategies Evaluation Tool”9 published in 2018.  ▶ The “Good practices in innovation on Cybersecurity under the NCSS”10 published in  2019.  ANNEX A provides a short summary of ENISA’s main publications on this topic.  The abovementioned guides and documents were studied as part of the desk research. In  particular, the “National Cybersecurity Strategies Evaluation Tool”11 is a foundational element of  the NCAF. The NCAF builds on the objectives covered in the NCSS online evaluation tool.  2.2 COMMON OBJECTIVES IDENTIFIED WITHIN THE EUROPEAN NCSS  The disparity between the different Member States makes it difficult to identify common  activities or action plans among different national contexts, legal frameworks and political  4 NCSS: Practical Guide on Development and Execution (ENISA, 2012)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/national-cyber-security-strategies-an-implementation-guide  5 NCSS: Setting the course for national efforts to strengthen security in cyberspace (ENISA, 2012)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-security-strategies-paper  6 An evaluation framework for NCSS (ENISA, 2014)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/an-evaluation-framework-for-cyber-security-strategies  7 National Cybersecurity Strategies - Interactive Map (ENISA, 2014, updated in 2019)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/national-cyber-security-strategies- interactive-map  8 This document updates the 2012 guide: NCSS Good Practice Guide: Designing and Implementing National Cybersecurity  Strategies (ENISA, 2016)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ncss-good-practice-guide  9 National Cybersecurity Strategies Evaluation Tool (2018)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/national-cyber-security-strategies-guidelines- tools/national-cyber-security-strategies-evaluation-tool  10 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practices-in-innovation-on-cybersecurity-under-the-ncss-1  11 National Cybersecurity Strategies Evaluation Tool (2018)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/national-cyber-security-strategies-guidelines- tools/national-cyber-security-strategies-evaluation-tool  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/national-cyber-security-strategies-an-implementation-guide https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-security-strategies-paper https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/an-evaluation-framework-for-cyber-security-strategies https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/national-cyber-security-strategies-interactive-map https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/national-cyber-security-strategies-interactive-map https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ncss-good-practice-guide https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/national-cyber-security-strategies-guidelines-tools/national-cyber-security-strategies-evaluation-tool https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/national-cyber-security-strategies-guidelines-tools/national-cyber-security-strategies-evaluation-tool https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/national-cyber-security-strategies-guidelines-tools/national-cyber-security-strategies-evaluation-tool https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/national-cyber-security-strategies-guidelines-tools/national-cyber-security-strategies-evaluation-tool  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  December 2020  12  agendas. However, Member States’ NCSS’s often have strategic objectives articulated around  the same topics. Thus, based on ENISA’s previous work and the analysis of Member States’  NCSS’s, 22 strategic objectives were identified. 15 of these strategic objectives were already  identified in ENISA’s previous work, 2 were newly added in this study and 5 objectives were  identified for future considerations.  Common strategic objectives covered by Member States  Based on ENISA’s previous work, namely the National Cybersecurity Strategies Evaluation  Tool12, the following table shows the abovementioned set of 15 strategic objectives that are  commonly covered in the Member States’ NCSS’s. The goals outline the core of the overall  ‘national philosophy’ on the topic. For additional information about the objectives described  below, please refer to the ENISA “NCSS Good Practice Guide” report13.  Table 1: Common strategic objectives covered by Member States in their NCSS  ID NCSS strategic objectives Goals  1  Develop national cyber contingency  plans  ▶ Present and explain the criteria that should be used to define a situation  as a crisis;  ▶ Define key processes and actions for handling the crisis; and  ▶ Clearly define the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders  during a cyber-crisis.  ▶ Present and explain the criteria for a crisis to be over and/or who has  the authority to declare it.  2 Establish baseline security measures  ▶ Harmonise the different practices followed by the organizations in both  the public and the private sector;

NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  December 2020  14  Additional strategic objectives  Based on the desk research performed and the interviews conducted by ENISA, additional  strategic objectives were identified. Member States are increasingly addressing these topics in  their NCSS or defining action plans on the same subject matter. Examples of activities  implemented by Member States are also provided. If an example is from a publicly available  source, a reference is provided. In cases where examples are based on confidential interviews  with EU Member States’ officials, no references are provided.  The following additional strategic objectives were identified:  ▶ Improve the cybersecurity of the supply chain; and  ▶ Secure digital identity and build trust in digital public services.  Improve the cybersecurity of the supply chain  Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of Europe's economy. They  represent 99% of all businesses in the EU14 and in 2015, it was estimated that SMEs have  created around 85% of new jobs and provided two thirds of the total private sector employment  in the EU. Furthermore, as SMEs provide services to large companies and are increasingly  working with public administrations15, it must be noted that in today's interconnected context,  SMEs constitute the weak link for cyber-attacks. Indeed, SMEs are the most exposed to cyber-  attacks, yet they often cannot afford to invest adequately in cybersecurity16. Improving the  cybersecurity of the supply chain should thus be carried out with a focus on SMEs.  In addition to this systemic approach, Member States can also emphasize efforts on the  cybersecurity of specific ICT services and products that are considered essential: ICT  technologies used in critical information infrastructure, security mechanisms enforced in the  telecommunications sector (controls at ISP-level…), trust services as defined in the eIDAS  regulation, and cloud service providers. For example, in its 2019-2024 national cybersecurity  strategy17, Poland committed to develop a national cybersecurity assessment and certification  system as a mechanism for quality assurance in the supply chain. This certification system will  be aligned with the EU certification framework for ICT digital products, services and processes  established by the EU Cybersecurity Act (2019/881).  Improving the cybersecurity of the supply chain is thus of paramount importance. This can be  achieved by establishing strong policies to promote SMEs, providing guidelines for  cybersecurity requirements in public administration procurement procedures, fostering  cooperation within the private sector, building PPPs, promoting coordinated vulnerability  disclosure (CVD) mechanisms18, building product certification scheme, including cybersecurity  components in digital initiatives for SMEs, and funding skills development, among others.  Secure digital identity and build trust in digital public services  In February 2020, the Commission set out its vision for the digital transformation of the EU in  the communication “Shaping Europe’s digital future”19, with the aim of delivering inclusive  technologies that work for people and respect the fundamental values of the EU. In particular,  the communication states that promoting the digital transformation of public administrations  throughout Europe is crucial. In that sense, building trust in government in relation to digital  14 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/  15 https://www.oecd.org/fr/publications/smes-in-public-procurement-9789264307476-en.htm  16https://www.eesc.europa.eu/en/news-media/news/european-companies-especially-smes-face-growing-risk-cyber-attacks- study  17 http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/download.xsp/WMP20190001037/O/M20191037.pdf  18 https://english.ncsc.nl/publications/publications/2019/juni/01/coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure-the-guideline  19 Shaping Europe’s digital future, COM(2020) 67 final:  https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication-shaping-europes-digital-future-feb2020_en_3.pdf  https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/ https://www.oecd.org/fr/publications/smes-in-public-procurement-9789264307476-en.htm https://www.eesc.europa.eu/en/news-media/news/european-companies-especially-smes-face-growing-risk-cyber-attacks-study https://www.eesc.europa.eu/en/news-media/news/european-companies-especially-smes-face-growing-risk-cyber-attacks-study http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/download.xsp/WMP20190001037/O/M20191037.pdf https://english.ncsc.nl/publications/publications/2019/juni/01/coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure-the-guideline https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication-shaping-europes-digital-future-feb2020_en_3.pdf  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  December 2020  15  identity and trust in public services is of paramount importance. This is even more crucial when  considering the fact that public sector transactions and data exchanges are often of sensitive  nature.  Many countries have expressed their intention to address this topic in their NCSS such as:  Denmark, Estonia, France, Luxembourg, Malta, Spain, The Netherlands and The United  Kingdom. Among these countries, some have also expressed that this strategic objective might  be addressed as part of a broader plan:  ▶ Estonia links their associated action plan on “The security of electronic identity and  electronic authentication capability” to the broader Digital Agenda 2020 for Estonia.  ▶ The French NCSS indicates that the Secretary of State responsible for Digital  Technology oversees  the establishment of a roadmap “to protect the digital lives,  privacy and personal data of the French people”.  ▶ The Netherlands NCSS states that cybersecurity in public administrations, as well as  public services provided to citizens and businesses are discussed in greater detail in  The Broad Agenda for Digital Government.  ▶ As the UK Government continues to move more of its services online, it has appointed  the Government Digital Service (GDS) to ensure that all new digital services built or  procured by government are also ‘secure by default’, with the support of the British  National Cybersecurity Centre (NCSC).  Other strategic objectives considered  During the desk research phase and as part of the interviews conducted by ENISA, other strategic  objectives were studied. However, it was decided that these objectives would not form part of the  self-assessment framework. ANNEX C – Other objectives studied  provides definitions for each of these objectives that can be used to nurture future discussions  on possible NCSS improvements.  The following strategic objectives were studied as future considerations:  ▶ Develop sector-specific cybersecurity strategies.  ▶ Fight against disinformation campaigns.  ▶ Secure cutting-edge technologies (5G, AI, quantum computing…);  ▶ Ensure data sovereignty; and  ▶ Provide incentives for the development of the cyber insurance industry.  2.3 KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM THE BENCHMARK EXERCISE  The desktop research on existing maturity models related to cybersecurity was carried out with  the aim of collecting information and evidence to support the design of the national capabilities’  self-assessment framework in the area of NCSS. In this context, an extensive literature review  of existing models was conducted to complement the findings from the initial scoping research  on cybersecurity maturity models and existing NCSS, developed in sections 2.1 and 2.2. This  systematic review supports the selection and justification of the maturity levels of the  assessment framework and the definition of the different dimensions and indicators.  In the scope of the systematic review of maturity models, 10 models were considered and  analysed on the basis of their key features. The global overview of the key features for each  model reviewed in the scope of this study is available in Table 2: Overview of analysed maturity  models and a more detailed analysis can be found in ANNEX A.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  December 2020  16  Table 2: Overview of analysed maturity models  This systematic review made it possible to draw conclusions on best practices adopted in  existing models in order to support the development of the conceptual model for the current  maturity model. In particular, the benchmark exercise supported the definition of the maturity  levels, the creation of dimension clusters and the selection of indicators, as well as an  appropriate visualisation methodology for the results of the model. The most relevant findings  for each of these elements is detailed in Table 3.

Also, it was decided to build upon the ENISA  online interactive tool to develop maturity indicators used for each attribute.  2.4 CHALLENGES OF NCSS EVALUATION  Member States are faced with many challenges when building cybersecurity capabilities and  more specifically, when ensuring that their capabilities are up to date with the latest  developments. Below is a summary of the challenges identified by and discussed with Member  States as part of this study:  ▶ Difficulties in coordination and cooperation: Coordinating cybersecurity efforts at a  national level in order to have an efficient response to cybersecurity issues can prove  to be a challenge due to the high number of stakeholders involved.  ▶ Lack of resources to perform the assessment: Depending on the local context and  cybersecurity national governance structure, evaluating the NCSS and its objectives  can take up to more than 15 person-days.  ▶ Lack of support for developing cybersecurity capabilities: Some Member States  shared that in order to defend a budget and get support to develop cybersecurity  capabilities, they first have to carry out an evaluation phase to identify gaps and  limitations.  ▶ Difficulties in attributing successes or changes to the strategy: As threats evolve  every day and technology improves, action plans constantly need to be adapted in  response. However, evaluating a NCSS and attributing changes to the strategy itself  remains an arduous task. This in turn makes the identification of the limitations and  shortcomings of the NCSS difficult.  Feature Key takeaway  Levels of Maturity  ▶ A five-level maturity scale for assessment frameworks on cybersecurity  capabilities is commonly accepted and able to provide granular  assessment results (see Table 6 Comparison of Maturity Levels for an  exhaustive view of the definition of the levels of maturity for each model);  ▶ All models provide a high-level definition of each maturity level that is then  adapted to the different dimensions or clusters of dimensions;  ▶ Two main aspects are typically assessed when measuring the maturity of  cybersecurity capabilities: the maturity of strategies and the maturity of  processes put in place to implement strategies.  Attributes  ▶ The comparative analysis of the attributes of the existing maturity models  shows heterogeneous results with an average number of attributes per  model between four and five;  ▶ A model relying on around four or five attributes provides countries with the  right level of data granularity by grouping relevant dimensions together and  ensuring the readability of results (see Table 7: Comparison of Attributes/  Dimensions for a description of the attributes for each model);  ▶ The key principle adopted by all models when defining the clusters is  based in the consistency of element grouped within each cluster.  Assessment  method  ▶ The assessment methods used in the different models analysed vary from  one to another;  ▶ The most common assessment method is based on self-evaluation.  Results  representation  ▶ It is important to present the results at different level of granularity;  ▶ The visualisation methodology should be self-explanatory and easy-to- read.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  December 2020  18  ▶ Difficulties to measure the effectiveness of the NCSS: Metrics can be collected to  measure different areas, such as progress, implementation, maturity and effectiveness.  While measuring progress and implementation is relatively easy compared to  measuring effectiveness, the latter remains more meaningful for evaluating the  outcomes and impacts of an NCSS. Based on the interviews conducted by ENISA, a  large number of Member States stated that quantitatively measuring the effectiveness  of an NCSS is important, but it also represents a very demanding task that is quite  impossible in some cases.  ▶ Difficulty to adopt a common framework: EU Member States operate in different  contexts in terms of politics, organizations, culture, society structure and NCSS  maturity. Certain Member States interviewed as part of this study expressed that it  might prove difficult to defend and use a “one-size-fits-all” self-assessment framework.  2.5 BENEFITS OF A NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT  Since 2017, all EU Member States have an NCSS20. While a positive development, it is also  important that Member States are able to properly assess these NCSS’s, thus bringing added  value to their strategic planning and implementation.  One of the goals of the national capabilities assessment framework is to evaluate the  cybersecurity capabilities based on the priorities set forth in the various NCSS’s. Fundamentally,  the framework assesses the level of maturity of the cybersecurity capabilities of the Member  States in the domains defined by the NCSS objectives. Thus, the results of the framework  support the Member States’ policymakers in defining the national strategy on cybersecurity by  providing them with country intelligence on state of play21. The NCAF is ultimately intended to  help Member States identify areas of improvement and build capabilities.  The framework aims at providing Member States with a self-assessment of their level of  maturity by assessing their NCSS objectives that will help them enhance and build  cybersecurity capabilities both at strategic and at operational level.  On a more practical approach, based on the interviews conducted by ENISA with several  agencies responsible of the cybersecurity domain in different Member States, the following  benefits of the national capabilities assessment framework were identified and underlined:  ▶ Provide useful information to develop a long-term strategy (e.g. good practices,  guidelines);  ▶ Help identify missing elements within the NCSS;  ▶ Help in further building cybersecurity capabilities;  ▶ Support the accountability of political actions;  ▶ Give credibility towards general public and international partners;  ▶ Support outreach and enhance public image as a transparent organisation;  ▶ Help anticipate the issues lying ahead;  ▶ Help identify lessons learnt and best practices;  ▶ Provide a baseline on cybersecurity capacity across the EU to facilitate discussions;  and  ▶ Help evaluate the national capabilities regarding cybersecurity.  20 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/national-cyber-security-strategies- interactive-map  21 Weiss, C.H.

METHODOLOGY OF THE  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES  ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  3.1 GENERAL PURPOSE  The main objective of the NCAF is to measure the maturity level of the cybersecurity  capabilities of the Member States to support them in conducting an evaluation of their national  cybersecurity capability, enhancing awareness of the country maturity level, identifying areas for  improvement and building cybersecurity capabilities.  3.2 MATURITY LEVELS  The framework is based on five maturity levels defining the stages that the Member States go  through when building cybersecurity capabilities in the area covered by each NCSS objective.  The levels represent increasing levels of maturity, starting from the initial Level 1, whereby the  Member States do not have a clearly defined approach for cybersecurity capacity-building in the  areas covered by the NCSS objectives and finishing with Level 5, whereby the cybersecurity  capacity-building strategy is dynamic and adaptive to environmental developments. Table 4  shows the maturity level scale with a description of each level of maturity.  Table 4: The ENISA National Capabilities Assessment Framework five-level maturity scale  LEVEL 1 -  INITIAL/AD HOC  LEVEL 2 - EARLY  DEFINITION  LEVEL 3 -  ESTABLISHMENT  LEVEL 4 -  OPTIMISATION  LEVEL 5 -  ADAPTIVENESS  The Member State  does not have a  clearly defined  approach for  cybersecurity  capacity-building in  the areas covered by  the NCSS  objectives.  Nevertheless, the  country might have  some generic goals  in place and have  performed some  studies (technical,  political, policy) to  improve the national  capabilities.  The national  approach for  capacity-building in  the area covered by  the NCSS objectives  has been defined.  The action plans or  activities to reach  the results are in  place but at an early  stage. Additionally,  active stakeholders  might have been  identified and/or  engaged.  The action plan for  capacity-building in  the area covered by  the NCSS objectives  is clearly defined  and supported by  the related  stakeholders. The  practices and  activities are  enforced and  implemented  uniformly at the  national level. The  activities are defined  and documented  with clear resource  allocation and  governance and a  set of deadlines.  The action plan is  assessed on a  regular basis: it is  prioritised,  optimised and  sustainable. The  performance of  cybersecurity  capacity-building  activities is  regularly  measured.  Success factors,  challenges and  gaps in the  implementation of  activities are  identified.  The cybersecurity  capacity-building  strategy is dynamic  and adaptive.  Constant attention to  environmental  developments  (technological  advancements,  global conflict, new  threats…) fosters a  rapid-decision  capability and an  ability to act quickly  for improvement.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  December 2020  20  3.3 CLUSTERS & OVERARCHING STRUCTURE OF THE SELF-  ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  The self-assessment framework is characterised by four clusters: (I) Cybersecurity governance  and standards, (II) Capacity-building and awareness, (III) Legal and regulatory and (IV)  Cooperation. Each of those clusters covers a key thematic area for building cybersecurity  capacity in a country and contains a pool of different objectives that the Member States might  include in their NCSS. In particular:  ▶ (I) Cybersecurity governance and standards: this cluster measures the capacity of  the Member States to establish proper governance, standards and good practices in  the cybersecurity domain. This dimension considers different aspects of cyber-defence  and resilience while supporting the development of the national cybersecurity industry  and building trust in governments;  ▶ (II) Capacity-building and awareness: this cluster assesses the capacity of the  Member States to raise awareness on cybersecurity risks and threats and on how to  tackle them. Additionally, this dimension gauges the ability of the country to  continuously build cybersecurity capabilities and increase the overall level of  knowledge and skills within this domain. It addresses the development of the  cybersecurity market and advancements in cybersecurity R&D. This cluster regroups  all objectives laying the groundwork to foster capacity-building;  ▶ (III) Legal and regulatory: this cluster measures the capacity of the Member States to  put in place the necessary legal and regulatory instruments to address and counter the  rise of cybercrime and related cyber-incidents, and to protect critical information  infrastructure. Additionally, this dimension assess also the capacity of the Member  States to create a legal framework to protect citizens and businesses as for instance in  the case of balancing security with privacy; and  ▶  (IV) Cooperation: this cluster evaluates the cooperation and information sharing  between different stakeholder groups at the national and international level as an  important tool to better understand and respond to a constantly changing threat  environment.  The objectives that have been included in the model are the ones that are commonly adopted  by the Member States, and they have been selected among the objectives listed within section  2.2. In particular, the model assesses the following objectives:  ▶ 1. Develop national cyber contingency plans (I)  ▶ 2. Establish baseline security measures (I)  ▶ 3. Secure digital identity and build trust in digital  public services (I)  ▶ 4. Establish an incident response capability (II)  ▶ 5. Raise user awareness (II)  ▶ 6. Organise cyber security exercises (II)  ▶ 7. Strengthen training and educational  programmes (II)  ▶ 8. Foster R&D (II)  ▶ 9. Provide incentives for the private sector to  invest in security measures (II)  ▶ 10. Improve the cybersecurity of the supply  chain (II)  ▶ 11. Protect critical information infrastructure,  OES, and DSP (III)  ▶ 12. Address cyber crime (III)  ▶ 13. Establish incident reporting mechanisms (III)  ▶ 14. Reinforce privacy and data protection (III)  ▶ 15. Institutionalise cooperation between public  agencies (IV)  ▶ 16. Engage in international cooperation (IV)  ▶ 17. Establish a public-private partnership (IV)  The four clusters and underlying objectives are combined in the model to have a holistic view of  the maturity of the cybersecurity capabilities of the Member States. Figure 1 presents the  overarching structure of the self-assessment framework and shows how these elements,  namely, objectives, clusters and self-assessment framework, are linked to evaluating the  performance of a country.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  21  Figure 1: Self-assessment framework structure  For each objective included within the self-assessment framework, there are a series of  indicators distributed between the five levels of maturity. Every indicator is based on a  dichotomous (yes/no) question. The indicator can be a requisite or a non requisite.  3.4 SCORING MECHANISM  The scoring mechanism of the self-assessment framework takes into consideration the  abovementioned elements and the principles listed in section 3.5. In fact, the model provides a  score based on the value of two parameters, the maturity level and the coverage ratio. Each  of these parameters can be calculated at different levels: (i) per objective, (ii) per cluster of  objectives or (iii) overall.  Scores at objective level  The maturity level score gives an overview of the level of maturity by showing what  capabilities and practices were put in place. The maturity level score is calculated as the highest  level for which the respondent satisfied all the requisites (i.e. YES answer to all requisite  questions), in addition to having fulfilled all requisites of the previous levels of maturity.  The coverage ratio shows the extent of coverage of all the indicators for which the answer is  positive, irrespective of their level. It is a complementary value that takes into account all the  indicators measuring an objective. The coverage ratio is calculated as the proportion between  the total number of questions within the objective and the number of questions for which the  answer is positive.  It is important to clarify that for the rest of the document, the word score is used to refer to both  the values of the maturity level and the coverage ratio.  Figure 2 - Scoring mechanism per objective provides a visualisation of the evaluation  mechanism described in section 3.1 that will be further developed below.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  22  Figure 2: Scoring mechanism per objective  Figure 2 shows an example of how the maturity level is calculated by objective. It is worth noting  that the respondent fulfilled all the requisites of the first three levels of maturity and only partially  fulfilled those of Level 4. Hence, the score indicates that the level of maturity of the  respondent is Level 3 for the “Organise cybersecuritry exercise” objective.  However, in the example depicted in Figure 2, the level of maturity of the objective is not able to  capture the information provided by the indicators that have a positive score and that are above  Level 3 of maturity. In that case, the coverage ratio can provide an overview of all the elements  that the respondent implemented to achieve that objective, despite its actual level of maturity. In  this case, the proportion between the total number of questions within the objective and the  number of questions for which the answer is positive is equal to 19/27 i.e. the coverage ratio  value is 70%.  Additionally, to adapt to the specificities of the Member States whilst also permitting a consistent  overview, the score is calculated from two different samples at cluster level and overall level:  ▶ General scores: one complete sample covering all the objectives included within the  cluster or within the overall framework (from one to 17);  ▶ Specific scores: one specific sample covering only the objectives selected by the  Member State (usually corresponding to the objectives present in the NCSS of the  specific country) within the cluster or within the overall framework.  Scores at cluster level  The general level of maturity of each cluster is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the level  of maturity of all the objectives within that cluster.  The specific level of maturity of each cluster is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the level  of maturity of the objectives within that cluster that the Member State chose to assess (usually  corresponding to the objectives present in the NCSS of the specific country).  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  23  For example, Figure 1 shows that the cluster (I) Cybersecurity governance and standards is  composed of three objectives. Assuming that the respondent chose to assess only the first two  objectives, but not the third, and assuming that the first two objectives present respectively a  level of maturity of 2 and 4, then the level of maturity of the cluster considering all the objectives  is Level 2 (Cluster (I) generic maturity level = (2+4)/3), while the level of maturity of the cluster  considering only the specific objectives selected by the assessor is Level 3 (Cluster (I) specific  maturity level = (2+4)/2).  The general coverage ratio of each cluster is calculated as the proportion between the total  number of questions within the cluster and the number of questions for which the answer is  positive.  The specific coverage ratio of each cluster is calculated as the proportion between the total  number of questions within the cluster pertaining to objectives that the Member State chose to  assess (usually corresponding to the objectives present in the NCSS of the specific country)  and the number of questions for which the answer is positive.  Scores at overall level  The overall general level of maturity of a country is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the  level of maturity of all the objectives within the framework, from one to 17.  The overall specific level of maturity of a country is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the  level of maturity of the objectives within the framework that the Member State chose to assess  (usually corresponding to the objectives present in the NCSS of the specific country)..  The overall general coverage ratio of a country is calculated as the proportion between the  total number of questions within all the objectives included within the framework (from one to  17) and the number of questions for which the answer is positive.  The overall specific coverage ratio of a country is calculated as the proportion between the  total number of questions within the objectives within the framework that the Member State  chose to assess (usually corresponding to the objectives present in the NCSS of the specific  country) and the number of questions for which the answer is positive.  For each indicator, respondents are able to select a third option “don’t know/not applicable” for  their response. In this case, the indicator is excluded from the total calculation of the results.  The maturity levels at cluster level and overall level are computed with an arithmetic mean in  order to show the progress between two assessments. Indeed, the alternative consisting in  computing the cluster and overall maturity levels as the maturity level of the least mature  objective – although relevant from a maturity standpoint – cannot account for the progress  made in areas covered by other objectives.  Since the cluster level and overall level are consolidated for reporting purposes, the choice has  been made to use the arithmetic mean. For more accuracy, please use the scores at objective  level for reporting purposes.  Figure 3 below summarizes the scoring mechanisms throughout the different levels of the model  (objective, cluster, overall).  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  24  Figure 3: Overall scoring mechanism  3.5 REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SELF-ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  The national capabilities assessment framework presented in this section is based on the needs  highlighted by the Member States and it is built around a set of requirements listed hereafter:  ▶ The NCAF is deployed on a voluntary basis by the Member State as a self-assessment  framework;  ▶ The NCAF aims at measuring the Member States’ cybersecurity capabilities with  regards to the 17 objectives. However the Member State can choose the objectives it  wants to assess against and only assess a subset of the 17 objectives;  ▶ The self-assessment framework aims at measuring the level of maturity of the  cybersecurity capabilities of the Member State;  ▶ The results of the assessment are not published unless the Member State decides to  do so on its own initiative;  ▶ The Member State can display the assessment results by presenting the maturity level  of the country’s cybersecurity capabilities, of a cluster of objectives or even of a single  objective;  ▶ All assessed objectives are equally relevant within the assessment framework,  therefore, they have the same importance. The same is applicable to the indicators  deployed within it; and  ▶ The Member State is able to track its progress over time.  The self-assessment framework aims at supporting the Member States in building cybersecurity  capabilities, Hence, it also includes a set of recommendations or guidelines to guide the  European countries in improving their level of maturity.  Note: those recommendations or guidelines are generic and based on ENISA publications and  lessons learnt from other countries and will depend on the result of the self-assessment.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  25  4. NCAF INDICATORS  4.1 FRAMEWORK INDICATORS  This section presents the ENISA National Capabilities Assessment Framework indicators. The  following sections are organised by cluster.  For each cluster, a table presents the comprehensive set of indicators in the form of questions  representative of a given maturity level. The questionnaire is the main instrument for the self-  assessment. For each objective, there are two sets of indicators to be noted:  ▶ A set of generic strategy maturity questions (9 generic questions), marked from ‘a’ to  ‘c’ for each maturity level, repeated for each objective; and  ▶ A set of cybersecurity capacity questions (319 cybersecurity capacity questions),  numbered from ‘1’ to ‘10’ for each maturity level, specific to the area covered by the  objective.  Each question is presented with a tag (0-1) indicating whether the question is a requisite  indicator (1) or a non-requisite indicator (0) for the maturity level.  Each question can be identified by an identification number comprised of:  ▶ The objective number;  ▶ The maturity level; and  ▶ The question number.  For example, question ID 1.2.4 is the fourth question in the maturity level 2 of the strategic  objective (I) \"Develop national cyber contingency plans\".  It must be noted that throughout the questionnaire, the scope of the questions is at national  level unless otherwise stated. In all questions, the \"You\" pronoun refers to the Member State in  a generic manner and does not refer to the individual or government body carrying out the  assessment.  The definition of each objective can be found in chapter 2.2 - Common objectives identified  within the European NCSS.

The recommendations listed below are  mainly deriving from the feedback collected from the interviews with the  Member States’  representatives:  ▶ Anticipate coordination activities to gather data and consolidate data.  Most of  the Member States acknowledge that performing such a self-assessment exercise  should take around 15 person-days. In order to perform the self-assessment, a large  range of different stakeholders will have to be solicited. It is thus recommended to  allocate time for the preparation phase to identify all relevant stakeholders within  government bodies, public agencies and the private sector.  ▶ Identify a central body in charge of completing the self-assessment at national  level. As gathering material for all indicators of the NCAF might involve many  stakeholders, it is recommended to have a central body or agency tasked with  completing the self-assessment by liaising and coordinating with all relevant  stakeholders.  ▶ Use the assessment exercise as a way to share and communicate on  cybersecurity topics. Lessons learnt shared by Member States showed that  discussions (whether taking the format of individual interviews or collective workshops)  are a good opportunity to foster dialogue around cybersecurity topics and to share  common views and areas of improvement. In addition to shining a light on key  achievements, sharing results can also help promote cybersecurity topics.  ▶ Use the NCSS as a scope to select the objectives subjected to the assessment.  The 17 objectives that compose the NCAF were built based on the objectives  commonly covered by Member States in their NCSS. The objectives covered as part of  the NCSS should be used as a mean to scope the assessment. However, the NCSS  should not limit the assessment. As the NCSS naturally focus on priorities, certain  areas are purposely omitted from NCSS. However, it does not imply that a given  capacity is not present. For example, in the case where a specific objective is omitted  from the NCSS, but where the country has cybersecurity capabilities related to that  objective, the assessment of that objective can take place.  ▶ When the NCSS scope evolves, ensure that the score interpretation remains  consistent with the NCSS evolution. The NCSS lifecycle is a multi-year process.  Some Member States’ NCSS are usually enforced with a 3 to 5-year roadmap with  changes in scope between two successive NCSS editions. In that view, special care  must be taken when presenting the self-assessment results between two NCSS  editions: scope changes might indeed impact the final maturity score. It is  recommended to compare the scores on the full scope of strategic objectives from one  year to another (i.e. Overall general score).  Reminder on the scoring mechanism – example on the coverage ratio  The scoring mechanism includes two levels of scores:  (i) an overall general coverage ratio based on the complete list of strategic objectives  present in the self-assessment framework; and  (ii) an overall specific coverage ratio based on strategic objectives selected by the  Member State (usually corresponding to the objectives present in the NCSS of the specific  country).  By design (see section 3.1 on the scoring mechanism), the overall specific coverage ratio  will be equal or higher than the overall general coverage ratio as the later may include  objectives that are not covered by the Member State, thus lowering the overall general  coverage ratio. When a Member State adds a new objective, the overall coverage ratio will  increase (i.e. more maturity indicators covered), whereas the overall specific maturity may  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  53  decrease (in case the newly added objective is at a beginning stage and thus has a low  level of maturity).  ▶ When filling out the self-assessment questionnaire, keep in mind that the  primary goal is to support Member States in cybersecurity capacity-building.  Therefore, when filling in the self-assessment, even if it can be difficult in some  situations to answer the question in a definite manner, it is recommended to choose  the answer that is most generally accepted. If, for example, the answer to a question is  YES on a certain scope but is NO on another scope, Member States should keep in  mind that a NO answer requires an action: either a remediation plan or a plan to act on  an improvement area that must be considered in future developments.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  54  5. NEXT STEPS  5.1 FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS  During interviews with Member States’ representatives and during the desk research phase, the  following recommendations to improve the current National Capabilities Assessment Framework  were also identified as potential future evolutions:  ▶ Develop the scoring system to allow for more accuracy. For example, a  percentage of coverage could be introduced instead of the binary YES/NO answer in  order to better account for the complexity of consolidating the capabilities at national  level. As a first step, a simple approach with YES/NO answers was chosen.  ▶ Introduce quantitative metrics to measure the effectiveness of the Member  States’ NCSS. Indeed, the National Capabilities Assessment Framework focuses on  evaluating the maturity level of the cybersecurity capabilities of the Member States.  This could be complemented by metrics to measure the effectiveness of the activities  and action plans implemented by the Member States to build these capabilities. It did  not seem realistic to build such effectiveness metrics at the current stage given that  there is: little feedback from the field, difficulty finding meaningful indicators that link  output with NCSS implementation, and difficulty building realistic indicators that can be  subsequently gathered. However, this remains a topic for future work.  ▶ Shift from a self-assessment exercise to an assessment approach. A potential  future evolution of the framework might be the shift towards an assessment approach  in order to assess the cybersecurity capabilities maturity of the Member States in a  more consistent manner. Having a third party perform the assessment might indeed  allow to minimize potential bias.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  55  ANNEX A – DESK RESEARCH  RESULTS OVERVIEW  Annex A provides a summary of ENISA previous work on NCSS and a review of relevant  publicly available maturity models on cybersecurity capacity. The following assumptions are  taken into account for the selection and review of the models:  ▶ Not all models are based on a rigorous research methodology;  ▶ The structure and results of the models are not always explained thoroughly with clear links  between the different elements characterising each model;  ▶ Some models do not offer details about the development process, structure and  assessment-methodology;  ▶ Other models and tools we found do not offer any details regarding the structure and the  content and are therefore not listed; and  ▶ The selection of the models for review is based on geographical coverage. The primary  focus will be on maturity models on cybersecurity capacity built to assess the performance  of European countries. However, it is important to expand the geographical coverage to  analyse good practices in building maturity models around the globe.  This systematic review of relevant publicly available maturity models on cybersecurity capacity  was conducted using a customised framework of analysis based on the methodology defined by  Becker for the development of maturity models22. The following elements were analysed for  each existing maturity model:  ▶ Name of the Maturity Model: The name of the maturity model and the main references;  ▶ Institution Source: The institution, whether public or private, in charge of the design of  the model;  ▶ General Purpose and Target: The overall scope of the model and the intended target(s);  ▶ Number and definition of Levels: The number of maturity levels of the model as well as  their general description;  ▶ Number and name of the Attributes: The number and name of attributes that the  maturity model uses. The attributes’ analysis has a three-fold objective:  o Breakdown the maturity model into easily understandable sections;  o Aggregate several attributes into clusters of attributes meeting the same goal; and  o Provide different viewpoints of the maturity level subject.  ▶ Assessment Method: The method of assessment of the maturity model;  ▶ Results’ representation: Define the visualisation method for the results of the maturity  model. The logic behind this step is that maturity models tend to fail if they are too complex  and therefore, the mode of representation must meet practical needs.  22 J. Becker, R. Knackstedt, and J. Pöppelbuß, “Developing Maturity Models for IT Management: A Procedure Model and its  Application,” Business & Information Systems Engineering, vol. 1, no. 3, pp. 213–222, Jun. 2009.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  56  Previous work on NCSS  ENISA published two documents on the topic of NCSS’s in 2012 as part of its early efforts.  Firstly, the “Practical guide on the development and execution phase of NCSS”23 proposed a set  of concrete actions for the efficient implementation of an NCSS and presents the lifecycle of an  NCSS in four phases: strategy development, strategy execution, strategy evaluation and  strategy maintenance. Secondly, a document called “Setting the course for national efforts to  strengthen security in cyberspace”24 outlined the status of cybersecurity strategies within the EU  and beyond in 2012 and proposed that Member States should determine common themes and  differences between their NCSS’s.  In 2014, the first ENISA framework for evaluating a Member State’s NCSS was published25.  This framework contains recommendations and good practices, as well as a set of capacity-  building tools for evaluating an NCSS (e.g. identified objectives, inputs, outputs, key  performance indicators…). Those tools are adapted to the varying needs of countries at  different levels of maturity in their strategic planning. That same year, ENISA published the  “Online NCSS Interactive Map”26, which allows users to quickly consult the NCSS’s of all  Member States and EFTA countries, including their strategic objectives and good examples of  implementation. Developed as first as a NCSS repository (2014), it was updated with examples  of implementation in 2018 and since 2019, the map acts now as an information hub to centralise  data provided by the Member States about their efforts to enhance national cybersecurity.  Published in 2016, the “NCSS Good Practice Guide”27 identifies fifteen strategic objectives. This  guide also analyses the implementation status of each Member State’s NCSS and identifies  various gaps and challenges with regards to this implementation.  In 2018, ENISA then published the “National Cybersecurity Strategies Evaluation Tool”28: an  interactive self-assessment tool to help Member States evaluate their strategic priorities and  objectives related to their NCSS. Through a set of simple questions, this tool provides Member  States with specific recommendations for the implementation of each objective. Finally, the  “Good practices in innovation on Cybersecurity under the NCSS”29 published in 2019 presents  the subject of innovation in cybersecurity under the NCSS. The document sets out challenges  and good practices across the different innovation dimensions, as perceived by subject-matter  experts, in order to help draft future innovative strategic objectives.  A.1 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM)  The Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) has been developed by the  Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre (Capacity Centre), part of the Oxford Martin School  within the University of Oxford. The goal of the Capacity Centre is to increase the scale and  effectiveness of cybersecurity capacity-building, both within the UK and internationally, through  the deployment of the Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model (CMM). The CMM is directly  targeted at countries that wish to increase their national cybersecurity capacity.

Attributes/ Dimensions  The CMM considers cybersecurity capacity to comprise of five dimensions representing the  clusters of cybersecurity capacity. Each cluster represents a different research ‘lens’ through  which cybersecurity capacity can be studied and understood. Within the five dimensions,  factors describe the details of possessing cybersecurity capacity. These details are elements  that contribute to the enhancement of cybersecurity capacity maturity within each dimension.  For each factor, several aspects represent different components of the factor. Aspects  represent an organisational method to divide indicators into smaller clusters that are easier to  comprehend. Each aspect is then evaluated through indicators to describe the steps, actions,  or building blocks that are indicative of a specific stage of maturity (defined in the next section)  within a distinct aspect, factor and dimension.  The terms mentioned above can be layered as shown in the figure below.  Figure 4: Instance of CMM indicators  The five dimensions are detailed below:  i Devising cybersecurity policy and strategy (6 factors);  ii Encouraging responsible cybersecurity culture within society (5 factors);  iii Developing cybersecurity knowledge (3 factors);  iv Creating effective legal and regulatory frameworks (3 factors); and  v Controlling risks through standards, organisations and technologies (7 factors).  Levels of Maturity  The CMM uses 5 levels of maturity to determine to which degree a country has progressed in  relation to a certain factor/aspect of cybersecurity capacity. These levels serve as a snapshot of  the existing cybersecurity capacity:  ▶ Start-up: At this stage, either no cybersecurity maturity exists, or it is very embryonic in  nature. There might be initial discussions about cybersecurity capacity-building, but no  concrete actions have been taken. There is an absence of observable evidence at this  stage;  ▶ Formative: Some features of the aspects have begun to grow and be formulated, but  may be ad-hoc, disorganized, poorly defined – or simply “new”. However, evidence of  this activity can be clearly demonstrated;  ▶ Established: The elements of the aspect are in place and working. There is not,  however, well thought-out consideration of the relative allocation of resources. Little  trade-off decision making has been made concerning the “relative” investment in the  various elements of the aspect. However, the aspect is functional and defined;  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  58  ▶ Strategic: Choices have been made about which parts of the aspect are important,  and which are less important for the particular organisation or nation. The strategic  stage reflects the fact that these choices have been made, conditional on the nation or  organization's particular circumstances; and  ▶ Dynamic: At this stage, there are clear mechanisms in place to alter strategy  depending on the prevailing circumstances such as the technology of the threat  environment, global conflict or a significant change in one area of concern (e.g.  cybercrime or privacy). Dynamic organisations have developed methods for changing  strategies in stride. Rapid decision-making, reallocation of resources, and constant  attention to the changing environment are features of this stage.  Assessment Method  As the Capacity Centre does not have a thorough and in-depth understanding of each domestic  context in which the model is deployed, it works alongside international organisations, host  ministries or organisations within the respective country to review the cybersecurity capacity  maturity. In order to assess the level of maturity of the five dimensions included in the CMM, the  Capacity Centre and the host organisation meets with relevant national stakeholders of the  public and private sectors over the course of 2 or 3 days to conduct focus groups on the  dimensions of the CMM. Each dimension is discussed at least twice by different clusters of  stakeholders. This constitutes the preliminary pool of data for the subsequent assessment.  Mode or representation of the results  The CCM provides an overview of the maturity level of each country through a radar composed  of five sections, one for each dimension. Each dimension represents one fifth of the graphic,  with the five stages of maturity for each factor extending outwards from the centre of the  graphic; as shown below, ‘start-up’ is closest to the centre of the graphic and ‘dynamic’ is at the  perimeter.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  59  Figure 5 CMM: Results overview  Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre Oxford Martin School, University of Oxford, 2017.  A.2 Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model (C2M2)  The Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model (C2M2) has been developed by the U.S.  Department of Energy in collaboration with private and public sector experts. The goal of the  Capacity Centre is to help organizations of all sectors, types, and sizes to evaluate and make  improvements to their cybersecurity programs and strengthen their operational resilience. The  C2M2 focuses on the implementation and management of cybersecurity practices associated  with information, information technology (IT), and operations technology (OT) assets and the  environments in which they operate. The C2M2 defines maturity models as: “a set of  characteristics, attributes, indicators, or patterns that represent capability and progression in a  particular discipline”. Initially deployed in 2014, the C2M2 was revised in 2019.  Attributes/ Dimensions  The C2M2 considers ten domains representing a logical grouping of cybersecurity practices.  Each set of practices represents the activities an organization can perform to establish and  mature capability in the domain. Each domain is then associated with a unique management  objective and several approach objectives. Within both approach and management  objectives, several practices are detailed to describe institutionalized activities.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  60  The relationship between these notions is summed up below:  Figure 6: Instance of C2M2 indicator  The ten domains are detailed below:  i Risk Management (RISK);  ii Asset, Change, and Configuration Management (ASSET);  iii Identity and Access Management (ACCESS);  iv Threat and Vulnerability Management (THREAT);  v Situational Awareness (SITUATION);  vi Event and Incident Response (RESPONSE);  vii Supply Chain and External Dependencies Management (DEPENDENCIES);  viii Workforce Management (WORKFORCE);  ix Cybersecurity Architecture (ARCHITECTURE); and  x Cybersecurity Program Management (PROGRAM).  Levels of Maturity  The C2M2 uses 4 levels of maturity (named Maturity Indicator Levels – MIL) to determine a  dual progression of maturity: an approach progression and a management progression. The  MILs  range from MIL0 to MIL3 and are meant to be applied independently to each domain.  ▶ MIL0: Practices are not performed.  ▶ MIL1: Initial practices are performed but may be ad hoc.  ▶ MIL2: Management characteristics:  o Practices are documented;  o Adequate resources are provided to support the process;  o Personnel performing the practices have adequate skills and knowledge; and  o Responsibility and authority for performing the practices are assigned.  Approach characteristic:  o Practices are more complete or advanced than at MIL1.  ▶ MIL3: Management characteristics:  o Activities are guided by policies (or other organizational directives);  o Performance objectives for domain activities are established and monitored to  track achievement; and  o Documented practices for domain activities are standardized and improved  across the enterprise.  Approach characteristic:  o Practices are more complete or advanced than at MIL2.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  61  Assessment Method  The C2M2 is designed for use with a self-evaluation methodology and toolkit (available by  request) for an organization to measure and improve its cybersecurity program. A self-  evaluation using the toolkit can be completed in one day, but the toolkit could be adapted for a  more rigorous evaluation effort. Additionally, the C2M2 can be used to guide the development of  a new cybersecurity program.  The model content is presented at a high level of abstraction so it can be interpreted by  organizations of various types, structures, sizes, and industries. Broad use of the model by a  sector can support benchmarking of the sector’s cybersecurity capabilities.  Mode or representation of the results  The C2M2 provides an Evaluation Scoring Report generated from the survey results. The report  presents results in two views: the Objective view, which shows practice question responses by  each domain and its objectives, and the Domain view, which shows responses by all domains  and MILs. Both views are based on a representation system characterised by pie charts (or  “doughnuts”), one per response, and a traffic light system scoring mechanism. As shows in  Figure 7, the red sectors in a doughnut chart show a count of the number of questions that  received survey responses of “Not Implemented” (dark red) or “Partially Implemented” (light  red). The green sectors show the number of questions that received responses of “Largely  Implemented” (light green) or “Fully Implemented” (dark green).  Figure 7 below is an example of a scoring card at the end of a maturity assessment. In the X  axis are the 10 domains of the C2M2, and in the Y axis, the levels of maturity (MILs). Looking at  the graph and considering the domain of Risk Management (RM), it is possible to notice three  pie charts, one corresponding to each level of maturity MIL1, MIL2 and MIL3. For the domain  RM, the graph highlights that there are two items to be evaluated for reaching the first level of  maturity, MIL1. In this case, one scoring “largely implemented” and one scoring “Partially  implemented”. For the second level on maturity, MIL2, the model foresees 13 items to be  evaluated. Two of those 13 items belong to the first level, MIL1, and 11 to the second level,  MIL2. The same is applicable for the third level MIL3.

NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  62  A.3 Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity  The Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity was developed within the  National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). It focuses on guiding cybersecurity  activities and managing risks within an organisation. It is aimed at all types of organisations  regardless of size, degree of cybersecurity risk, or cybersecurity sophistication. As this is a  framework and not a model, it is built differently than the models analysed previously.  The Framework consists of three parts: the Framework Core, the Implementation Tiers, and the  Framework Profiles:  ▶ The Framework Core is a set of cybersecurity activities, desired outcomes, and  applicable references that are common across critical infrastructure sectors. These are  similar to the attributes or dimensions found in cybersecurity capacity maturity models.  ▶ Framework Implementation Tiers (“Tiers”) provide context on how an organization  views cybersecurity risk and the processes in place to manage that risk. Ranging from  Partial (Tier 1) to Adaptive (Tier 4), Tiers describe an increasing degree of rigor and  sophistication in cybersecurity risk management practices. Tiers do not represent  maturity levels, rather, they are meant to support organizational decision making about  how to manage cybersecurity risk, as well as which dimensions of the organization are  higher priority and could receive additional resources.  ▶ A Framework Profile (“Profile”) represents the outcomes based on business needs  that an organization has selected from the Framework Categories and Subcategories.  The Profile can be characterized with regards to the alignment of standards,  guidelines, and practices to the Framework Core in a particular implementation  scenario. Profiles can be used to identify opportunities for improving cybersecurity  posture by comparing a “Current” profile (the “as is” state) with a “Target” profile (the  “to be” state).  Framework Core  The Framework Core consists of five Functions. When considered together, these Functions  provide a high-level, strategic view of the lifecycle of an organization’s management of  cybersecurity risk. The Framework Core then identifies underlying key Categories and  Subcategories for each Function and matches them with example Informative References such  as existing standards, guidelines, and practices for each Subcategory.  Functions and Categories are detailed below:  i Identify: Develop an organizational understanding about how to manage cybersecurity  risks for systems, people, assets, data, and capabilities.   Subcategories: Asset Management; Business Environment; Governance; Risk  Assessment; and Risk Management Strategy  ii Protect: Develop and implement appropriate safeguards to ensure delivery of critical  services.   Subcategories: Identity Management and Access Control; Awareness and  Training; Data Security; Information Protection Processes and Procedures;  Maintenance; and Protective Technology  iii Detect: Develop and implement appropriate activities to identify the occurrence of a  cybersecurity event.   Subcategories: Anomalies and Events; Security Continuous Monitoring; and  Detection Processes.  iv Respond: Develop and implement appropriate activities to take action regarding a  detected cybersecurity incident.   Subcategories: Response Planning; Communications; Analysis; Mitigation; and  Improvements.  v Recover: Develop and implement appropriate activities to maintain plans for resilience  and to restore any capabilities or services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity  incident.   Subcategories: Recovery Planning; Improvements; and Communications  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  63  Figure 8: Instance of the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity  Tiers  The Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity relies on 4 Tiers, each of  which is defined along three axes: Risk Management Process, Integrated Risk Management  Program and External Participation. The Tiers are not to be considered as maturity levels but as  a framework to provide organizations with a contextualisation of their views of cybersecurity risk  and the processes in place to manage that risk.  ▶ Tier 1: Partial  o Risk Management Process: organizational cybersecurity risk management  practices are not formalized, and risk is managed in an ad hoc and sometimes  reactive manner;  o Integrated Risk Management Program: there is limited awareness of  cybersecurity risk at the organizational level. The organization implements  cybersecurity risk management on an irregular, case-by-case basis and may not  have processes that enable cybersecurity information to be shared within the  organization;  o External Participation: the organization does not understand its role in the larger  ecosystem with respect to either its dependencies or dependents. The  organization is generally unaware of the cyber supply chain risks of the products  and services it provides and that it uses;  ▶ Tier 2: Risk Informed  o Risk Management Process: risk management practices are approved by  management but may not be established as organizational-wide policy;  o Integrated Risk Management Program: there is an awareness of cybersecurity  risk at the organizational level, but an organization-wide approach to managing  cybersecurity risk has not been established. Cyber risk assessment of  organizational and external assets occurs but is not typically repeatable or  reoccurring;  o External Participation: generally, the organization understands its role in the  larger ecosystem with respect to either its own dependencies or dependents, but  not both. Additionally, the organization is aware of the cyber supply chain risks  associated with the products and services it provides and uses but does not act  consistently or formally upon those risks;  ▶ Tier 3: Repeatable  o Risk Management Process: the organization’s risk management practices are  formally approved and expressed as policy. Organizational cybersecurity practices  are regularly updated based on the application of risk management processes to  changes in business/mission requirements and a changing threat and technology  landscape;  o Integrated Risk Management Program: there is an organization-wide approach  to manage cybersecurity risk. Risk-informed policies, processes, and procedures  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  64  are defined, implemented as intended, and reviewed. Senior executives ensure  consideration of cybersecurity through all lines of operation in the organization;  o External Participation: the organization understands its role, dependencies, and  dependents in the larger ecosystem and may contribute to the community’s  broader understanding of risks. The organization is aware of the cyber supply  chain risks associated with the products and services it provides and that it uses;  ▶ Tier 4: Adaptive  o Risk Management Process: the organization adapts its cybersecurity practices  based on previous and current cybersecurity activities, including lessons learned  and predictive indicators;  o Integrated Risk Management Program: there is an organization-wide approach  to managing cybersecurity risk that uses risk-informed policies, processes, and  procedures to address potential cybersecurity events; and  o External Participation: the organization understands its role, dependencies, and  dependents in the larger ecosystem and contributes to the community’s broader  understanding of risks.  Assessment Method  The Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity is meant for organisations to  self-assess their risk in order to make their cybersecurity approach and investments more  rational, effective and valuable. To examine the effectiveness of investments, an organization  must first have a clear understanding of its organizational objectives, the relationship between  those objectives and supportive cybersecurity outcomes. The cybersecurity outcomes of the  Framework Core support self-assessment of investment effectiveness and cybersecurity  activities.  A.4 Qatar Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model (Q-C2M2)  The Qatar Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model (Q-C2M2) was developed by the Qatar  University’s College of Law in 2018. The Q-C2M2 is based on various existing models to build a  comprehensive assessment methodology to enhance Qatar’s cybersecurity framework.  Attributes/ Dimensions  The Q-C2M2 adopts the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Framework’s  approach of using five core functions as the main domains of the model. The five core functions  are applicable in the Qatari context because they are common across critical infrastructure  sectors, an important element in the Qatari cybersecurity framework. The Q-C2M2 is based on  five domains, each domain is then divided in several subdomains to cover the whole range of  cybersecurity capability maturity.  The five domains are detailed below:  i The Understand domain includes four subdomains: Cyber governance, Assets,  Risks, and Training;  ii Subdomains under the Secure domain include Data Security, Technology Security,  Access Control Security, Communications Security, and Personnel Security;  iii The Expose domain includes the subdomains of Monitoring, Incident Management,  Detection, Analysis, and Exposure;  iv The Respond domain includes Response Planning, Mitigation, and Response  Communication; and  v The Sustain domain includes Recovery Planning, Continuity Management,  Improvement, and External Dependencies.  Levels of Maturity  The Q-C2M2 uses 5 levels of maturity measuring the capability maturity of a state entity or  non-state organization at the core function level. These levels are aimed at assessing maturity  in the five domains detailed in the previous section.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  65  ▶ Initiating: Employs ad-hoc cybersecurity practices and processes under some of the  domains;  ▶ Implementing: Adopted policies to implement all of the cybersecurity activities under  the domains with the aim of completing the implementation at a certain time;  ▶ Developing: Implemented policies and practices to develop and improve cybersecurity  activities under the domains with the aim of suggesting new activities to implement;  ▶ Adaptive: Revisits and reviews cybersecurity activities and adopts practices based on  predictive indicators derived from previous experiences and measures; and  ▶ Agile: Continues to practice the adaptive stage with an added emphasis on agility and  speed when implementing activities in the domains.  Assessment Method  The Q-C2M2 is at an early stage of research and is not yet built for implementation. It is a  framework that could be used to deploy a detailed assessment model for Qatari organisations in  the future.  A.5 Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC)  The Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) was developed by the U.S. Department  of Defense (DoD) in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University and Johns Hopkins University  Applied Physics Laboratory. The main objective of the DoD in the design of this model is to  protect information from the Defense Industrial Base sector (DIB). The information targeted by  the CMMC is classified as either “Federal Contract Information”, information provided by or  generated for the Government under contract not intended for public release, or “Controlled  Unclassified Information”, information that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls  pursuant to and consistent with laws, regulations and government-wide policies. The CMMC  measures cybersecurity maturity and provides best practices along with a certification element  to ensure the implementation of practices associated with each maturity level. The latest version  of the CMMC was released in 2020.  Attributes/ Dimensions  The CMMC considers seventeen domains representing clusters of cybersecurity processes  and capabilities. Each domain is then broken down into multiple processes that are similar  across domains; and one to many capabilities spanning over five levels of maturity. The  capabilities (or capability) are then detailed into practices for each relevant maturity level.  The relationship between these notions is as follows:  Figure 9: Instance of CMMC indicators  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  66  The seventeen domains are detailed below:  i Access Control (AC);  ii Asset Management (AM);  iii Audit and Accountability (AU);  iv Awareness and Training (AT);  v Configuration Management (CM);  vi Identification and Authentication (IA);  vii Incident Response (IR);  viii Maintenance (MA);  ix Media Protection (MP);  x Personnel Security (PS);  xi Physical Protection (PE);  xii Recovery (RE);  xiii Risk Management (RM);  xiv Security Assessment (CA);  xv Situational Awareness (SA);  xvi System and Communications Protection (SC); and  xvii System and Information Integrity (SI).  Levels of Maturity  The CMMC uses 5 levels of maturity defined based on processes and practices. In order to  reach a certain level of maturity in the CMMC, an organization needs to fulfil the prerequisites  for the processes and the practices for that level itself. This also implies the fulfillment of the  prerequisites of all the level below that one.  Figure 10: CMMC Maturity Levels  ▶ Level 1  o Processes – Performed: because the organization may only be able to perform  these practices in an ad-hoc manner and may or may not rely on documentation.  Process maturity is not assessed for Level 1;  o Practices – Basic Cyber Hygiene: level 1 focuses on the protection of FCI  (Federal Contract Information) and consists only of practices that correspond to  the basic safeguarding requirements;  ▶ Level 2  o Processes – Documented: level 2 requires that an organization establish and  document practices and policies to guide the implementation of their CMMC  efforts. The documentation of practices enables individuals to perform them in a  repeatable manner. Organizations develop mature capabilities by documenting  their processes and then practicing them as documented;  o Practices – Intermediate Cyber Hygiene: level 2 serves as a progression from  Level 1 to Level 3 and consists of a subset of the security requirements specified  in NIST SP 800-171 as well as practices from other standards and references;  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  67  ▶ Level 3  o Processes – Managed: level 3 requires that an organization establish, maintain,  and resource a plan demonstrating the management of activities for practice  implementation. The plan may include information on missions, goals, project  plans, resourcing, required training, and involvement of relevant stakeholders;  o Practices – Good Cyber Hygiene: level 3 focuses on the protection of CUI and  encompasses all of the security requirements specified in NIST SP 800-171 as  well as additional practices from other standards and references to mitigate  threats;  ▶ Level 4  o Processes – Reviewed: level 4 requires that an organization review and measure  practices for effectiveness. In addition to measuring practices for effectiveness,  organizations at this level are able to take corrective action when necessary and  inform higher level management of status or issues on a recurring basis;  o Practices – Proactive: level 4 focuses on the protection of CUI (Controlled  Unclassified Information) and encompasses a subset of the enhanced security  requirements. These practices enhance the detection and response capabilities of  an organization to address and adapt to the changing tactics, techniques, and  procedures;  ▶ Level 5  o Processes – Optimizing: level 5 requires an organization to standardize and  optimize process implementation across the organization; and  o Practices – Advanced/Proactive: level 5 focuses on the protection of CUI. The  additional practices increase the depth and sophistication of cybersecurity  capabilities.  Assessment Method  The CMMC is a relatively young model, finalised in the first quarter of 2020. Thus far, it has not  been deployed within any organisations. Nevertheless, the DoD contractors expect to reach out  to certified third party examiners to conduct audits. The DoD is expecting its contractors to  implement best practices to foster cybersecurity and the protection of sensitive information.  A.6 The Community Cyber Security Maturity Model (CCSMM)  The Community Cyber Security Maturity Model (CCSMM) was developed by the Centre for  Infrastructure Assurance and Security within The University of Texas. The goal of the CCSMM  is to better define methods to determine the current status of a community in its cyber-  preparedness and provide a roadmap for communities to follow in their preparation efforts. The  communities targeted by the CCSMM are mainly local or state governments. The CCSMM was  designed in 2007.  Attributes/ Dimensions  Levels of maturity are defined following 6 main dimensions that cover the different aspects of  cybersecurity within communities and organisations. These dimensions are clearly defined for  each level of maturity (detailed in the Figure 31: Summary of the CCSMM) The 6 dimensions  are:  i Threats Addressed;  ii Metrics;  iii Information Sharing;  iv Technology;  v Training; and  vi Test.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  68  Levels of Maturity  The CCSMM relies on 5 levels of maturity based on the main types of threats and activities  addressed at the level:  ▶ Level 1: Security Aware  The major theme of activities at this level is to make individuals and organizations  aware of the threats, problems, and issues related to cybersecurity;  ▶ Level 2: Process Development  Level designed to help communities establish and improve security processes required  to effectively address cybersecurity issues;  ▶ Level 3: Information Enabled  Designed to improve information sharing mechanisms within the community to enable  the community to effectively correlate seemingly disparate pieces of information.  ▶ Level 4: Tactics Development  This level elements are designed to develop better and more proactive methods to  detect and respond to attacks. By this level, most prevention methods should be in  place.  ▶ Level 5: Full Security Operational Capability  This level represents those elements that should be in place for any organization to  consider itself fully operationally ready to address any type of cyber threat.  Figure 31: Summary of the CCSMM dimensions per level  Assessment Method  The CCSMM as an assessment methodology is meant to be deployed by communities with input  from state and federal law enforcement agencies. It aims to help the community to define what is  most important, what are the most likely targets, and what needs to be protected (and to which  extent). With these objectives in mind, plans can be developed to bring each aspect of the  community to their required level of cybersecurity maturity. The specific intelligence generated by  the CCSMM helps to define the goals of various tests and exercises that can be used to measure  the effectiveness of established programs.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  69  A.7 Information Security Maturity Model for NIST Cyber Security  Framework (ISMM)  The Information Security Maturity Model (ISMM) has been developed within the College of  Computer Sciences and Engineering of the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals in  Saudi Arabia. It proposes a new capability maturity model to measure the implementation of  cybersecurity measures. The goal of the ISMM is to enable organisations to measure their  implementation progress over time by using the same measuring tool on a regular basis to  ensure that the desired security posture is maintained. The ISMM was developed in 2017.  Attributes/ Dimensions  The ISMM builds on the existing assessed areas of the NIST framework and adds a dimension  on compliance assessment. This brings the model to 23 assessed areas to for an  organisation’s security posture. The 23 assessed areas are:  i Asset Management;  ii Business Environment;  iii Governance;  iv Risk Assessment;  v Risk Management Strategy;  vi Compliance Assessment;  vii Access Control;  viii Awareness and Training;  ix Data Security;  x Information Protection Processes and Procedures;  xi Maintenance;  xii Protective Technology;  xiii Anomalies and Events;  xiv Security Continuous Monitoring;  xv Detection Processes;  xvi Response Planning;  xvii Response Communications;  xviii Response Analysis;  xix Response Mitigation;  xx Response Improvements;  xxi Recovery Planning;  xxii Recovery Improvements; and  xxiii Recovery Communications.  Levels of Maturity  The ISMM relies on 5 levels of maturity, which, unfortunately are not detailed in the available  documentation.  ▶ Level 1: Performed Process;  ▶ Level 2: Managed Process;  ▶ Level 3: Established Process;  ▶ Level 4: Predictable Process; and  ▶ Level 5: Optimizing Process.  Assessment Method  The ISMM does not propose any specific methodology to conduct the assessment for  organisations.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  70  A.8 Internal Audit Capability Model (IA-CM) for the Public Sector  The Internal Audit Capability Model (IA-CM) was developed by the Institute of Internal auditors  Research Foundation with the intention to build capacity and advocacy through self-assessment  in the public sector. Aimed at audit professionals, the IA-CM provides an overview of the model  itself along with an Application Guide to assist in the use of the model as a self-assessment tool.  Despite the IA-CM being focused on Internal Audit capability, rather than cybersecurity capacity-  building, the model is built as a maturity self-assessment tool for public sector entities that can be  applied globally to improve processes and effectiveness. As the scope is not focused on  cybersecurity, the attributes will not be analysed. The IA-CM was finalised in 2009.  Levels of Maturity  The Internal Audit Capability Model (IA-CM) includes 5 levels of maturity, each of which  describe the characteristics and capabilities of an Internal Audit activity at that level. The  capability levels in the model provide a road map for continuous improvement.  ▶ Level 1: Initial  No sustainable, repeatable capabilities – dependent upon individual efforts  o Ad hoc or unstructured.  o Isolated single audits or reviews of documents and transactions for accuracy and  compliance.  o Outputs dependent upon the skills of the specific person holding the position.  o No professional practices established other than those provided by professional  associations.  o Funding approval by management, as needed.  o Absence of infrastructure.  o Auditors likely part of a larger organizational unit.  o Institutional capability is not developed.  ▶ Level 2: Infrastructure  Sustainable and repeatable practices and procedures  o Key question or challenge for Level 2 is how to establish and maintain  repeatability of processes and thus a repeatable capability.  o internal audit reporting relationships, management and administrative  infrastructures, and professional practices and processes are being established  (internal audit guidance, processes, and procedures).  o Audit planning based principally on management priorities.  o Continued reliance essentially on the skills and competencies of specific persons.  o Partial conformance with the standards.  ▶ Level 3: Integrated  Management and professional practices uniformly applied  o Internal audit policies, processes, and procedures are defined, documented, and  integrated into each other and the organization’s infrastructure.  o Internal audit management and professional practices are well established and  uniformly applied across the internal audit activity.  o Internal audit is starting to align with the organization’s business and the risks it  faces.  o internal audit evolves from conducting only traditional internal audit to integrating  as a team player and providing advice on performance and management of risks.  o Focus is on team building and capacity of the internal audit activity and its  independence and objectivity.  o Generally conforms with the standards.  ▶ Level 4: Managed  Integrates information from across the organization to improve governance and risk  management  o Internal audit and key stakeholders’ expectations are in alignment.  o Performance metrics are in place to measure and monitor internal audit processes  and results.  o Internal audit is recognized as delivering significant contributions to the  organization.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  71  o Internal audit functions as an integral part of the organization’s governance and  risk management.  o Internal audit is a well-managed business unit.  o Risks are measured and managed quantitatively.  o Requisite skills and competencies are in place with a capacity for renewal and  knowledge sharing (within internal audit and across the organization).  ▶ Level 5: Optimizing  Learning from inside and outside the organization for continuous improvement  o Internal audit is a learning organization with continuous process improvements  and innovation.  o Internal audit uses information from inside and outside the organization to  contribute to achieving strategic objectives.  o World-class/recommended/best practice performance.  o Internal audit is a critical part of the organization’s governance structure.  o Top-level professional and specialized skills.  o Individual, unit, and organizational performance measures are fully integrated to  o drive performance improvements.  Assessment Method  The Internal Audit Capability Model is clearly built for self-assessment. It provides detailed steps  to follow for using the IA-CM and a sample slides deck to customize. Prior to the start of the  self-assessment, a specific team is to be identified, including, at minimum, one person skilled in  conducting internal or external assessments of internal audits and one person who is involved in  making improvements in this area.  Figure 12: IC-AM Self-Assessment Steps  A.9 The Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI)  The Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) is an initiative of the International Telecommunication  Union (ITU) aimed at reviewing the cybersecurity commitment and situation in all the ITU  regions: Africa, Americas, Arab States, Asia-Pacific, CIS, and Europe, and puts countries with  high commitment and recommendable practices in the spotlight. The goal of the GCI is to help  countries identify areas for improvement in the field of cybersecurity, as well as motivate them to  take action to improve their ranking, thus helping raise the overall level of cybersecurity  worldwide.  As the GCI is an index and not a maturity model, it doesn’t use levels of maturity but rather a  score to rank and compare the global cybersecurity commitment of nations and regions.  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  72  Attributes/ Dimensions  The Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) is based on the five pillars of the Global Cybersecurity  Agenda (GCA). These pillars form the five sub-indices of the GCI and each includes a set of  indicators. The five pillars and indicators are as follows:  i Legal: measures based on the existence of legal institutions and frameworks dealing  with cybersecurity and cybercrime.   Cybercrime legislation;   Cybersecurity regulation; and   Containment/curbing of spam legislation.  ii Technical: Measures based on the existence of technical institutions and frameworks  dealing with cybersecurity.   CERT/CIRT/CSRIT;   Standards Implementation Framework;   Standardization Body;   Technical mechanisms and capabilities deployed to address Spam;   Use of cloud for cybersecurity purposes; and   Child Online Protection mechanisms.  iii Organizational: Measures based on the existence of policy coordination institutions  and strategies for cybersecurity development at the national level.   National Cybersecurity Strategy;   Responsible Agency; and   Cybersecurity.  iv Capacity-building: Measures based on the existence of research and development,  education and training programmes, certified professionals and public sector agencies  fostering capacity-building.   Public awareness campaigns;   Framework for the certification and accreditation of cybersecurity  professionals;   Professional training courses in cybersecurity;   Educational programs or academic curricular in cybersecurity;   Cybersecurity R&D programs; and   Incentive mechanisms.  v Cooperation: Measures based on the existence of partnerships, cooperative  frameworks and information sharing networks.   Bilateral agreements;   Multilateral agreements;   Participation in international fora/associations;   Public-Private Partnerships;   Inter-agency/intra-agency partnerships; and   Best Practices.  Assessment Method  The GCI is a self-assessment tool built through a survey30 of binary, pre-coded, and open-  ended questions. The use of binary answers eliminates opinion-based evaluation and any  possible bias towards certain types of answers. The pre-coded answers save time and allow a  more accurate data analysis. Moreover, a simple dichotomous scale allows for a quicker and  more complex evaluation as it does not require lengthy answers, which accelerates and  streamlines the process of providing answers and further evaluation. The respondent should  only confirm presence of, or lack of, certain pre-identified cybersecurity solutions. An online  survey mechanism, which is used for gathering answers and uploading relevant material,  enables the extraction of good practices and a set of thematic qualitative evaluations by a panel  of experts.  30 https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Cybersecurity/Documents/GCIv4/GCIv4_English.pdf  https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Cybersecurity/Documents/GCIv4/GCIv4_English.pdf  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  73  The overall GCI process is implemented as follows:  ▶ A letter of invitation is sent to all participants, informing them of the initiative and  requesting a focal point responsible for collecting all relevant data and for completing  the online GCI questionnaire. During the online survey, the approved focal point is  officially invited by ITU to answer the questionnaire;  ▶ Primary data collection (for countries that do not respond to the questionnaire):   ITU elaborates an initial draft response to the questionnaire using publicly  available data and online research;   The draft questionnaire is sent to focal points for review;   Focal points improve the accuracy and then return the draft questionnaire;   The corrected draft questionnaire is sent to each focal point for final approval;  and   The validated questionnaire is used for analysis, scoring, and ranking.  ▶ Secondary data collection (for countries that respond to the questionnaire):   ITU identifies any missing responses, supporting documents, links, etc;   The focal point improves the accuracy of the responses where necessary;   The corrected draft questionnaire is sent to each focal point for final approval;  and   The validated questionnaire is used for analysis, scoring and ranking.  A.10 The Cyber Power Index (CPI)  The Cyber Power Index (CPI) was created by the Economist Intelligence Unit research program  sponsored by Booz Allen Hamilton in 2011. The CPI is a “dynamic quantitative and qualitative  model, […] that measures specific attributes of the cyber environment across four drivers of  cyber power: legal and regulatory framework; economic and social context; technology  infrastructure; and industry application, which examines digital progress across key  industries”31. The objective of the Cyber Power Index is to benchmark the capability of the G20  countries to withstand cyber-attacks and deploy the required digital infrastructure for a thriving  and secure economy. The benchmark provided by the CPI focuses on 19 countries of the G20  (excluding the EU). The index then provides a ranking of countries for each indicator.  Attributes/ Dimensions  The Cyber Power Index (CPI) is based on four drivers of cyber power. Each category is then  measured through multiple indicators to give each country a specific score. The categories and  pillars are as follows:  i Legal and Regulatory Framework   Government commitment to cyber development   Cyber protection policies   Cyber censorship (or lack thereof)   Political efficacy   Intellectual property protection  ii Economic and Social Context   Educational levels   Technical skills   Openness of trade   Degree of innovation in the business environment  iii Technology Infrastructure   Access to information and communications technology   Quality of information and communications technology   Affordability of information and communications technology   Spending on information technology   Number of secure servers  31 www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/cybersecurity-capacity/system/files/EIU%20- %20Cyber%20Power%20Index%20Findings%20and%20Methodology.pdf  http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/cybersecurity-capacity/system/files/EIU%20-%20Cyber%20Power%20Index%20Findings%20and%20Methodology.pdf http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/cybersecurity-capacity/system/files/EIU%20-%20Cyber%20Power%20Index%20Findings%20and%20Methodology.pdf  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  74  iv Industry Application   Smart grids   E-Health   E-Commerce   Intelligent transportation   E-Government  Assessment Method  The CPI is a quantitative and qualitative scoring model. The assessment was conducted by The  Economist Intelligence Unit using quantitative indicators from available statistical sources and  making estimates when data was lacking. The main sources used are the Economist  Intelligence Unit; the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO); the  International Telecommunications Union (ITU); and the World Bank.  A.11 The Cyber Power Index (CPI)  This section summarises the main findings of the analysis of the existing maturity models.  Table 5: Overview of analysed maturity models provides an overview of the main  characteristics of each model according to the modified Becker’s model.

There might be initial  discussions about cybersecurity  capacity-building, but no concrete  actions have been taken. There is  an absence of observable  evidence at this stage.  Formative  Some features of the aspects  have begun to grow and be  formulated, but may be ad-hoc,  disorganized, poorly defined – or  simply “new”. However, evidence  of this activity can be clearly  demonstrated.  Established  The elements of the aspect are in  place and working. There is not,  however, well thought-out  consideration of the relative  allocation of resources. Little  trade-off decision making has  been made concerning the  “relative” investment in the  various elements of the aspect.  However, the aspect is functional  and defined.  Strategic  Choices have been made about  which parts of the aspect are  important, and which are less  important for the particular  organisation or nation. The  strategic stage reflects the fact  that these choices have been  made, conditional upon the nation  or organization's circumstances.  Dynamic  There are clear mechanisms in  place to alter strategy depending  on the prevailing circumstances  such as the technology of the  threat environment, global conflict  or a significant change in one  area of concern (e.g. cybercrime  or privacy). Dynamic  organisations have developed  methods for changing strategies  in stride. Rapid decision-making,  reallocation of resources, and  constant attention to the changing  environment are feature of this  stage.

Practices: Basic Cyber Hygiene  Level 1 focuses on the protection  of FCI (Federal Contract  Information) and consists only of  practices that correspond to the  basic safeguarding requirements.  Processes: Documented  Level 2 requires that an  organization establish and  document practices and policies  to guide the implementation of  their CMMC efforts. The  documentation of practices  enables individuals to perform  them in a repeatable manner.  Organizations develop mature  capabilities by documenting their  processes and then practicing  them as documented.  Practices: Intermediate Cyber  Hygiene  Level 2 serves as a progression  from Level 1 to Level 3 and  consists of a subset of the  security requirements specified in  NIST SP 800-171 as well as  practices from other standards  and references.  Processes: Managed  Level 3 requires that an  organization establish, maintain,  and resource a plan  demonstrating the management  of activities for practice  implementation. The plan may  include information on missions,  goals, project plans, resourcing,  required training, and involvement  of relevant stakeholders.  Practices: Good Cyber  Hygiene. Level 3 focuses on the  protection of CUI (Controlled  Unclassified Information) and  encompasses all of the security  requirements specified in NIST  SP 800-171 as well as additional  practices from other standards  and references to mitigate  threats.  Processes: Reviewed.  Level 4 requires that an  organization reviews and  measures practices for  effectiveness. In addition to  measuring practices for  effectiveness, organizations at  this level are able to take  corrective action when necessary  and inform higher level  management of status or issues  on a recurring basis.  Practices: Proactive  Level 4 focuses on the protection  of CUI (Controlled Unclassified  Information) and encompasses a  subset of the enhanced security  requirements. These practices  enhance the detection and  response capabilities of an  organization to address and  adapt to the changing tactics,  techniques, and procedures.  Processes: Optimizing  Level 5 requires an organization  to standardize and optimize  process implementation across  the organization.  Practices: Advanced/Proactive  Level 5 focuses on the protection  of CUI (Controlled Unclassified  Information). The additional  practices increase the depth and  sophistication of cybersecurity  capabilities.

The following objectives are not part of the National  Capabilities Assessment Framework, but they shine a light on topics that are worth discussing.  Each of the following sub-chapters will provide an explanation as to why the objective was  discarded.  ▶ Develop sector-specific cybersecurity strategies;  ▶ Fight against disinformation campaigns;  ▶ Secure cutting-edge technologies (5G, AI, quantum computing…);  ▶ Ensure data sovereignty; and  ▶ Provide incentives for the development of the cyber insurance industry.  Develop sector-specific cybersecurity strategies  The adoption of sector-specific strategies that target sector interventions and incentives  certainly introduces a stronger decentralised capability. It is particularly fitting for Member States  whose OES’s must deal with different frameworks and regulations and where there are many  dependencies due to the transversal nature of cybersecurity. Indeed, in several Member States,  it is common to count dozens of national authorities and regulatory bodies with knowledge of  each sector’s specificities that hold a mandate to enforce specific regulation for each sector.  Denmark, for example, launched six targeted strategies addressing the most critical sectors’  cyber and information security efforts to develop a stronger decentralised capability in cyber and  information security. Each ‘sectoral unit’ will contribute to threat assessments at sectoral level,  monitoring, preparedness exercises, establishment of security systems, knowledge-sharing and  instructions, among others. The sector-specific strategies cover the following sectors:  ▶ Energy;  ▶  Healthcare;  ▶  Transport;  ▶  Telecommunication;  ▶  Finance; and  ▶  Maritime.  Other Member States have expressed interest in considering sector-specific cybersecurity  strategies to reflect all regulatory requirements. However, it must be noted that such an  objective might not fit all Member States depending on their size, national policies and maturity.  The great difficulty to ensure that the framework can account for all specificities led ENISA to  not include this objective in the framework.  Fight against disinformation campaigns  Member States integrate the protection of fundamental principles such as human rights,  transparency and public trust into their national cybersecurity strategies. This is very important  especially when it comes to disinformation that is disseminated via traditional news media or  social media platforms. In addition, cybersecurity is currently one of the greatest electoral  challenges. Indeed, activities such as spreading false information or negative propaganda have  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  86  been observed in various countries in the run-up to important elections. This threat has the  potential to undermine the EU democratic process. At the European level, the Commission has  outlined an Action Plan32 to step up efforts to counter disinformation in Europe: this plan focuses  on 4 key areas (detection, cooperation, collaboration with online platforms and awareness) and  serves to build the EU's capabilities and strengthen cooperation between Member States.  4 out of 19 interviewed countries have expressed their intent to tackle the issue of  disinformation and propaganda in their NCSS.  For example, the French NCSS33 notes that: “it is the State’s responsibility to inform citizens of  the risks of manipulation and propaganda techniques used by malicious players on the Internet.  For example, after the terrorist attacks against France in January 2015, the Government  established an information platform on the risks related to Islamic radicalisation via electronic  communication networks: « Stop-djihadisme.gouv.fr ».” This approach could be extended to  respond to other phenomena of propaganda or destabilisation.  In another example, Poland’s 2019-2024 NCSS34 states that: “against manipulative activities  such as disinformation campaigns, systemic actions are needed to develop citizens' awareness  in the context of verifying the authenticity of information and responding to attempts to distort it.”  However, during interviews conducted by ENISA, several Member States shared that they do  not address the issue as part of their NCSS as a cybersecurity threat but rather tackle the issue  at a broader societal level, for example, via policy initiatives.  Secure cutting-edge technologies (5G, AI, quantum computing…)  As the current cyber threat landscape continues to expand, the development of new  technologies will most probably result in an increase in the intensity and number of cyber-  attacks and the diversification of methods, means and targets employed by threat actors. In the  meantime, these new technological solutions in the form of cutting-edge technologies have the  potential to become the building blocks of the European Digital Market. In order to safeguard  Member States' growing digital dependency and the emergence of new technologies, incentives  and fully-fledged policies should be established to support the secure and trustworthy  development and deployment of these technologies in the EU.  During the desk research phase performed on Member States' NCSS’s, the following cutting-  edge technologies were put forward as being of interest to the Member States: 5G, AI, quantum  computing, cryptography, edge computing, connected and autonomous vehicles, big and smart  data, blockchain, robotics and IoT.  More particularly, in early 2020, the European Commission published a communication calling  on Member States to take steps to implement the set of measures recommended in the 5G  toolbox conclusions35. This 5G toolbox comes in the wake of Recommendation (EU) 2019/534  on the cybersecurity of 5G networks adopted by the Commission in 2019, which called for a  unified European approach to the security of 5G networks36.  During interviews conducted by ENISA, it was highlighted that this topic is more of a transversal  topic which is addressed across the NCSS rather than as a specific objective per se.  32 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/action-plan-against-disinformation  33 https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2015/10/strategie_nationale_securite_numerique_en.pdf  34 http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/download.xsp/WMP20190001037/O/M20191037.pdf  35https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/secure-5g-deployment-eu-implementing-eu-toolbox-communication- commission  36 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019H0534  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/action-plan-against-disinformation https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2015/10/strategie_nationale_securite_numerique_en.pdf http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/download.xsp/WMP20190001037/O/M20191037.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/secure-5g-deployment-eu-implementing-eu-toolbox-communication-commission https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/secure-5g-deployment-eu-implementing-eu-toolbox-communication-commission https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019H0534  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  87  Ensure data sovereignty  On the one hand, cyberspace can be seen as a formidable global common space, which is  easily accessible, providing a high degree of connectivity and able to yield great opportunities  for socio-economic growth. On the other hand, cyberspace is also characterized by its weak  jurisdiction, difficulty to attribute actions, lack of frontiers, and interconnected systems which can  be porous and whose data can be stolen or even accessed by foreign governments. In addition  to these two perspectives, the digital ecosystem is marked by the concentration of online  service platforms and infrastructure in the hands of very few stakeholders. All aspects  aforementioned lead Member States to promote digital sovereignty. Achieving digital  sovereignty means that citizens and businesses are able to fully thrive by using digital services  and ICT products that are trustworthy without any fear for one’s personal data, or digital assets,  one’s economic autonomy or one’s political influence.  Data sovereignty or digital sovereignty is championed by Member States at the national level  and at the European level. While Member States do not seem to address the issue directly in  their NCSS as a specific objective, they either address it as a transversal principle or they  outline their intention to ensure digital sovereignty at national level outline in ad hoc publications  by focusing on key technologies. For example, in the 2018 French strategic review of cyber  defence, it is stated that “controlling the following technologies are of paramount importance to  ensure digital sovereignty: communication encryption, cyber-attack detection, professional  mobile radio, cloud computing and artificial intelligence”37.  At the European level, Member States are actively participating in defining the European  strategy for Data (COM/2020/66 final) and building the EU certification framework for ICT digital  products, services and processes established by the EU Cybersecurity Act (2019/881) to ensure  strategic digital autonomy at European level.  The interview phase with Member States showed that the topic of digital sovereignty is often  considered as a broader issue than one which is restricted to cybersecurity. Therefore, Member  States do not cover the topic in their NCSS’s and for the few who do, they do not cover it as a  specific objective per se.  Provide incentive to the development of the cyber insurance industry  The current state of play of the cyber insurance industry shows that the global market has  undisputedly grown. However, it is still in its early days as data must be collected and many  precedents must still be set (e.g. silent coverage, systemic cyber risks…). Furthermore, the  estimated losses aggregated from cyber-attacks around the globe are several orders of  magnitude higher than the current cyber insurance industry coverage capacity (IMF Working  Paper - Cyber Risk for the Financial Sector: A Framework for Quantitative Assessment  WP/18/143). However, developing the cyber insurance industry can certainly yield benefits and  lay the foundation for virtuous mechanisms. Indeed, cyber insurance mechanisms can help in:  ▶ Raising awareness about cybersecurity risks in companies;  ▶ Evaluating the exposure to cyber risks in quantitative manner;  ▶ Improving cybersecurity risk management;  ▶ Providing support to organisations that are victims of cyber-attacks; and  ▶ Covering the damage (material or not) induced by a cyber-attack.  37 http://www.sgdsn.gouv.fr/uploads/2018/03/revue-cyber-resume-in-english.pdf  http://www.sgdsn.gouv.fr/uploads/2018/03/revue-cyber-resume-in-english.pdf  NATIONAL CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  88  Certain Member States started to work on this topic. For example:  ▶ Estonia adopted a \"wait and see\" approach in their NCSS: \"To mitigate cyber risks in  the private sector in general, demand and supply of cyber insurance service in Estonia  will be analysed and on that basis, cooperative principles for related parties will be  agreed upon, including information sharing, preparation of risk assessment, etc.  Today, suppliers of cyber insurance service are few on the Estonian market and it is  necessary to first map who offers what. The complexity of insurance protection is often  considered a hindrance to the development of the cyber insurance market.\"  ▶ Luxembourg specifically supports the development of the cyber insurance industry in  its NCSS: ”Objective 1: Creating new products and services. To pool risks and  encourage victims of digital cyber incidents to seek help from experts to manage the  incident and restore a system affected by a malicious act, insurance companies will be  encouraged to create specific products for the area of cyber insurance.\"  Feedbacks from interviewees were quite diverse on this topic: some Member States stated that  the cyber insurance topic has recently become a topic of discussion, while others shared that  although the topic is promising, the industry is not mature enough yet. However, a great number  of interviewees declared that the topic is not tackled as part of the NCSS, either because it was  deemed to be too specific or not within the scope of the NCSS.  About the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity  The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA, is the Union’s agency dedicated to  achieving a high common level of cybersecurity across Europe. Established in 2004 and  strengthened by the EU Cybersecurity Act, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity  contributes to EU cyber policy, enhances the trustworthiness of ICT products, services and  processes with cybersecurity certification schemes, cooperates with Member States and  EU bodies, and helps Europe prepare for the cyber challenges of tomorrow. Through  knowledge sharing, capacity building and awareness raising, the Agency works together  with its key stakeholders to strengthen trust in the connected economy, to boost resilience  of the Union’s infrastructure, and, ultimately, to keep Europe’s society and citizens digitally  secure.

Understanding and managing cyber security risks within your organisation, as with any other business risk, is a key  responsibility in protecting your organisation and shareholders.  Why should we be worried about cyber security?  If realised, cyber security risks have the potential to significantly disrupt your business operations. This can result in  significant incident response costs, damage to your organisation’s brand and reputation, and depending on your  response, shareholder or regulatory action.  Managing cyber security risks requires strong leadership with the board working in concert with executives and  technical teams to understand the organisation’s risk exposure. Encouraging an organisational culture that supports  cyber security is important, as is supporting technical experts and information technology (IT) departments in their  cyber security efforts.  What is our threat environment?  Do we understand our threat environment?  Understanding what systems are critical to core business operations, and their security posture, is integral to managing  cyber security risks. Furthermore, in order to determine cyber security risks, you need to have an understanding of the  threat environment in which your business operates.  How can we stay informed of the threat environment?  It is crucial that you seek out the most accurate and timely information on cyber threats from reputable sources, such  as the ACSC. Also, look within your organisation to your experts, such as your Chief Information Security Officer (CISO),  Chief Security Officer (CSO) or Chief Information Officer (CIO).  You should ask your CISO, CSO or CIO whether your organisation has joined the ACSC Partnership Program. Being a  partner ensures that you have the most up-to-date cyber threat reporting from the ACSC.  Questions for Boards to Ask  About Cyber Security  First published: October 2022  Last updated: December 2022  https://www.cyber.gov.au/partner-hub/acsc-partnership-program  2  How can we protect our organisation and  shareholders?  Do we know what data we hold and where it is stored?  Data is valuable. There are many adversaries who would benefit from having access to your organisation’s data. Have  you identified critical data of which the confidentiality, integrity and availability is essential to the function of your  organisation? Consider not only the value of individual pieces of data but also the aggregated value of your data  holdings. Understanding where this data is stored within your organisation is critical to being able to both protect it and  respond to a cyber security incident when it arises.  Do we know our regulatory obligations?  In the event of a cyber security incident, you may have regulatory obligations, such as those under the Notifiable Data  Breach Scheme, which require you notify the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner and affected  individuals when an eligible data breach has occurred. As such, in the event of an eligible data breach, it is important  that you communicate this in a transparent, honest and timely manner.  Do we know if there are cyber security risks in our cyber supply chain?  Does your organisation depend on key business partners, such as vendors that supply software and hardware that  supports your critical business operations, or a third party with remote access to your systems? Cyber security risks in  your supply chain could impact your organisation. As such, you should engage with your CISO, CSO or CIO to make sure  cyber supply chain risks are being identified and managed.  Do we know what cyber security framework we use?  Understanding strategies your organisation can use to mitigate cyber security risks is important. The Strategies to  Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents is a prioritised list of mitigation strategies designed to assist organisations in  protecting their systems and data against a range of cyber threats. The mitigation strategies can be customised based  on your organisation’s security risk profile and the cyber threats that you are most concerned about.  While no set of mitigation strategies are guaranteed to protect against all cyber threats, organisations are  recommended to implement eight essential mitigation strategies as a baseline. This baseline, known as the ‘Essential  Eight’, makes it much harder for adversaries to compromise your systems and data.  Do we know how mature our cyber security is?  Understanding your organisation’s cyber security maturity will help you to identify areas that require further  investment. The Essential Eight Maturity Model is a valuable resource in this regard as it can be used to identify priority  areas for cyber security.  Do we know how security researchers and customers disclose security  vulnerabilities?  If your organisation has an internet presence or produces software for your customers, such as mobile apps, you should  consider how security researchers and customers are able to report any security vulnerabilities in your services or  products that they find. This can be achieved through the establishment of a vulnerability disclosure program.  https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/notifiable-data-breaches https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/notifiable-data-breaches https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight  3  How should we respond to a cyber security  incident?  Are we prepared to respond to a cyber security incident?  When responding to a cyber security incident, there are often significant time pressures placed on decision making. As  such, you should be prepared to make critical decisions that exceed the delegated authority of your executives, such as  your CISO, CSO or CIO. To prepare yourself, consider discussing the questions this publication raises as a board, with  your executive team and with any outsourced service providers beforehand.  To further assist in preparing to respond to a cyber security incident, it is important that you have appropriate response  measures in place, such as an incident response plan. To be effective, an incident response plan should align with your  organisation’s emergency, crisis and business continuity arrangements, as well as jurisdictional and national cyber and  emergency arrangements. In doing so, it should support personnel to fulfil their roles by outlining their responsibilities  and all legal and regulatory obligations. Such incident response plans should be regularly reviewed and tested alongside  activities that target strategic decision making, operational responses and communication strategies.  Finally, in the event of a cyber security incident, it is important to have one person in charge as the incident response  coordinator, such as a CISO or CSO, to ensure clarity of direction and timely operational decisions can be made. Ideally,  this person should be supported by a board member with relevant cyber security or risk management skills in order to  act as the interface between the incident response coordinator and the board to ensure board-level decisions can be  made and communicated quickly.

The advice in the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents, along with its Essential  Eight, complements this framework.

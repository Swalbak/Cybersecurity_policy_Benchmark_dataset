CONCLUSIONS 17  ANNUAL REPORT TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  May 2019  3  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  In the EU, electronic communication providers notify significant security incidents to the National  Regulatory authority (NRA) in their country. At the start of every calendar year the NRAs send a  summary about these incidents to ENISA. This document, the Annual Report Telecom Security  Incidents 2018, covers the incidents reported by NRAs for 2018 and gives an anonymised,  aggregated EU-wide overview of telecom security incidents.  Security breach reporting has been part of the EU’s telecom regulatory framework since the  2009 reform of the telecom package: Article 13a of the Framework directive (2009/140/EC)  came into force in 2011. The breach reporting in Article 13a focuses on security incidents with  significant impact on the operation of services, i.e. outages of the electronic communication  networks and/or services.  Statistics annual summary reporting 2008  The 2018 annual summary reporting contains reports about 157 incidents submitted by NRAs  from the 28 EU Member States and 2 EFTA countries. The total user hours lost, multiplying for  each incident the number of users and the number of hours, was 969 Million User Hours, i.e.  roughly 0,02% of the total user hours in a year1.  Here are the key takeaways from about the 2018 incidents:   Natural phenomena dominate in terms of impact: In 2018, half of the total user  hours lost (482 million user hours) were due to natural phenomena. It is the first year  that natural phenomena are the main root cause category in this respect, accounting  for more user hours lost than the category of system failures.   System failures are the most frequent root cause of incidents: Most incidents  (67%) are caused by system failures, a percentage which is consistent with previous  years. Often these system failures are hardware failures and software bugs.  1 Using a basis of 500M (EU citizens) times 365 (days) times 24 (hours). User hours is a metric we use throughout this  report to quantify the impact of an incident, multiplying the number of subscribers/connections affected, with the duration in  hours. For example 1M User Hours means 1M users were affected for one hour, or 2M users for half an hour, etc.  In 2018, half of  the total user  hours lost (482  million user  hours) were  due to natural  phenomena. It  is the first year  that natural  phenomena are  the main root  cause category  in this respect,  accounting for  more user  hours lost than  the category of  system failures.  ANNUAL REPORT TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  May 2019  4   Power cuts are a major factor: Although only a small number of incidents was  caused by power cuts (15%) they had a huge impact in terms of user hours with 50%  of the total, i.e. 496 million user hours lost.   Faulty software changes/updates are the second most common cause: In 2018  faulty software changes/updates were the second most common cause of incident,  accounting for a fifth of the incidents.  ENISA offers an online visual tool for analysing the incidents. It can be used to dive into other  aspects and detailed causes. See: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/for-  telcos/visual-tool For example, by selecting (top left) years 2018, 2017, 2016, then natural  phenomena (top left), then mobile telephony and internet (top right), the charts at the bottom  show detailed causes, assets affected.  Multiannual trends over 7 years of reporting  Looking back at the last 7 years of annual incident reporting we can observe a number of multi-  annual trends.   Total number of incidents reported is stabilizing at around 160: Over the period  2014-2018, there is a consistent number of incidents reported which is stabilizing at  around 160 incidents per year.   Sharp drop of the average impact of incidents: Until 2017 there was a gradual  increase of total user hours lost per year. But in 2018 we see a sharp drop in the total  user hours lost compared to previous years, to just 960 Million user hours. It remains to  be seen if this is part of a larger trend or if this year was an exception.   Impact of natural phenomena trending up: Natural phenomena have been trending  up rapidly since 2016, and now account for more than half of the user hours lost. For  the first time, this year natural phenomena account for more user hours lost than  system failures, which used to be the leading root cause in this specific field.   System failures continue to be the most frequent but their average size is  trending down: Every year system failures have been the most common root cause  category between 60% and 80% of the total number of incidents. Since 2016 the  average size of these incidents is decreasing.   Frequency and impact of human errors and malicious actions stable: Over the  reporting period the frequency of human errors and malicious actions is stable  (approximately accounting for 17% and 5% of incidents per year). Their impact in  terms of user hours is stable also.

Since 2016 security breach reporting is also mandatory for trust  service providers in the EU, under Article 19 of the EIDAS regulation. In 2018, under the NIS  Directive (NISD), security breach reporting became mandatory for Operators of Essential  Services in the EU and for Digital Service Providers, under Article 14 and Article 16 of the NIS  directive.  Soon, by the end of 2020, the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC) will come  into effect across the EU. Under Article 40 of the EECC the breach reporting requirements have  a broader scope, including not only outages, but also breaches of confidentiality, for instance.  Also there are more services in scope of the EECC, including not only traditional telecom  operators, but also for example over-the-top providers of communications services.  ENISA is now working with NRAs and experts from the private sector to prepare the ground for  these changes and at the same time trying to find and exploit synergies between the different  pieces of EU legislation, particularly when it comes to breach reporting and cross-border  supervision.  We look forward to continuing our close collaboration with the EU member states, the national  telecom authorities and experts from the telecom sector from across Europe.  ANNUAL REPORT TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  May 2019  6  1. INTRODUCTION  Electronic communication providers in the EU have to notify security incidents with a significant  impact on the continuity of electronic communication services, to the national telecom regulatory  authorities (NRAs) in each EU member state. Every year the NRAs report a summary to ENISA,  covering a selection of these incidents, i.e. the most significant incidents, based on a set of  agreed EU-wide thresholds. This document, the Annual Security Incidents Report 2018,  aggregates the incident reports reported in 2018 and gives a single EU-wide overview of  telecom security incidents in the EU.  This is the 8th time ENISA publishes an annual incident report for the telecom sector. ENISA  started publishing such annual reports in 2012. Mandatory breach reporting has been part of the  EU’s telecom regulatory framework since the 2009 reform of the telecom package: Article 13a of  the Framework directive (2009/140/EC) came into force in 2011.  Note that although Article 13a itself is fairly broad, the mandatory breach reporting in Article 13a  has specific focus on security incidents with a significant impact on the functioning of the  service. There is some divergence and discussion about what is in scope here, but generally  speaking, in most countries, this was understood to mean that there has to be a service outage.  Now consider for example an attack in which attackers wiretap major undersea cables; if the  attack causes no outages, then the incident does not fall under the breach reporting  requirements of Article 13a. Recently the Council and Parliament agreed with an update of the  EU telecom rules called the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC). The breach  reporting requirements in (Article 40 of) the EECC have a broader scope, including not only  incidents causing outages, but also, for example, breaches of confidentiality. An incident like the  one just mentioned would be reportable under (Article 40 of) the EECC.  This document is structured as follows: In section 2 we briefly summarize the reporting  procedure and to give an idea about the kind of incidents that are reported we give some  specific but anonymized examples of incidents that occurred in 2018. In Section 3 we provide  some key facts and statistics about the 2018 incidents. In Section 4 we take a closer look at  power cuts. In section 5 we look at multiannual trends over the years 2012-2018. Conclusions  about trends and comparisons with previous years have to be made with care, because national  reporting has improved over the years, reporting thresholds have been lowered in most  countries, etc.  This is the 8th  time ENISA  publishes an  annual incident  report for the  telecom sector.  ENISA started  publishing such  annual reports in  2012. Mandatory  breach reporting  has been part of  the EU’s telecom  regulatory  framework since  the 2009 reform of  the telecom  package: Article  13a of the  Framework  directive  (2009/140/EC)  came into force in  2011.  ANNUAL REPORT TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  May 2019  7  2. INCIDENT REPORTING FRAMEWORK  AND EXAMPLES OF INCIDENTS  We briefly explain the main features of the incident reporting procedure, as described in the  Article 13a Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting2, which was developed in collaboration  with the NRAs.  2.1 INCIDENT REPORTING FRAMEWORK  Article 13a introduces  three  types  of  incident  reporting: 1) National  incident  reporting  from  providers to NRAs, 2) Ad-hoc incident reporting between NRAs and ENISA, and  3) Annual  summary reporting from NRAs to the EC and ENISA. The different types of reporting are shown  in the diagram below.  Note that in this setup ENISA acts as a collection point, anonymizing aggregating and analysing  the incident reports. In the current setup NRAs can search incidents in the reporting tool  (CIRAS) but the incident reports themselves do not refer to countries or providers, making the  overall summary reporting process less sensitive.  2.2 EXAMPLES OF INCIDENTS REPORTED  We give some specific examples of incidents to give an idea of the kind of incidents that are  notified to NRAs and then included in the annual summary reporting to ENISA:   A system failure caused a mobile internet, telephony and SMS outage for  thousands of users (duration: hours, connections: thousands, cause: software  bug): A software bug occurred in the SPR (Subscriber Profile Repository) server.  Following the repeated instability of the equipment, the signalling traffic increased and  2 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting  ANNUAL REPORT TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  May 2019  8  the STP (Signalling Transfer Point) platforms became overloaded. As a result, end  users had difficulties to access mobile internet services as well as voice and SMS  services. The vendor responded by fully restoring the functionality of the SPR  equipment. In order to stop the avalanche of signalling messages, the 3G and 4G  networks were partially shut off and all subscribers were located on the 2G network.   A power cut caused by a heavy storm affected mobile, fixed services and Cable  TV for hundreds of users (duration: hours, connections: thousands, cause:  heavy wind/storm): A heavy storm combining with heavy winds strongly affected  assets in a defined area causing outages to mobile and fixed services. The operator  emergency team was activated. A number of emergency generators was used and a  number of VSAT antennas was installed on affected sites.   A malicious action caused a mobile internet outage for a million of users  (duration: hours, connections: a million, cause: Denial of Service attack):  The  network was subject to a cyber-attack (Denial of Service attack) which caused  congestion and degraded service. Mobile switches and routers were affected by this  attack. The network had self-recovered after the attack had ceased.   A human error caused a mobile internet outage for millions of users (duration:  hours, connections: millions, cause: faulty software change/update): Due to a  human error (wrong software configuration) during the migration of the packet  gateway, clients of one operator were not able to use mobile data. Mobile switches  were affected by this incident. A rollback was successfully executed to resolve the  issue.   Fixed telephony, broadband internet, cable TV service lost due to cable cuts  (duration: hours - days, connections: thousands, cause: human errors): A  number of network outages were suffered due to cable cuts during construction and  road excavation work.  Networks were restored following manual repair intervention on  damaged cables.  Note that the experts from NRAs have access to the CIRAS incident reporting tool where they  can search for and study specific incidents. This tool anonymizes which country was involved.  For externals ENISA runs an online visual tool which can be used for custom analysis of the  data: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/for-telcos/visual-tool  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/for-telcos/visual-tool  ANNUAL REPORT TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  May 2019  9  3. ANALYSIS OF THE INCIDENTS  In total, all 28 EU Member States and 2 EFTA countries participated in this process. Of these,  19 Member States and 2 EFTA countries reported in total 157 significant incidents and 5  countries reported there were no significant incidents. In this section, the 157 reported incidents  are aggregated and analysed. First, the impact per root cause category is analysed (in section  3.1), in section 3.2 we focus on the user hours that have been lost per root cause category, then  detailed causes are examined (Section 3.3), and in Section 3.4 the impact per service is  analysed.  3.1 ROOT CAUSE CATEGORIES  In 2018 roughly two thirds of the telecom security incidents were system failures. This is  consistent with previous years. Often they are hardware failures and software bugs. Also human  errors are stable at around 18%. Most often these are accidental cable cuts and faulty software  changes/updates. 10% of the incidents are caused by natural phenomena, two times less than  the previous year. Only 5% of incidents were due to malicious actions. Typically these cases are  denial of service attacks and cable theft.  There is a fifth category called Third-party failures, which can be selected (only) in conjunction  with another root cause category. Typically third party failures are incidents which happen at a  utility company or supplier and then affect the telecom providers, for example a power cut. In  total over 2018, 9% of incidents were flagged as third-party failures. The division is shown in the  chart below.  67%  18%  10%  5%  Root cause categories Telecom security incidents - 2018  System failures  Human errors  Natural phenomena  Malicious actions  65%  2%  15%  3%  6% 4%  5%  0%  Third party failures - 2018  System failures  System failures - Third party failures  Human errors  Human errors - Third party failures  Natural phenomena  Natural phenomena - Third party failures  Malicious actions  Malicious actions - Third party failures  ANNUAL REPORT TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  May 2019  10  3.2 USER HOURS LOST FOR EACH ROOT CAUSE CATEGORY  Adding up the total user hours lost for each root cause category we find that than half of the  total user hours lost were due to natural phenomena (50%, 482 million user hours). All system  failures combined account for two fifths of user hours lost (39%, 380 million user hours).  So although system failures are the most common (see section 3.1), they are having less  impact than natural phenomena. In 2018 the natural phenomena are the dominant root cause  category in terms of user hours lost. The multi annual trends graph for user hours lost per root  cause category (see section 5.3) shows this is the first year that natural phenomena account for  more user hours lost than system failures.  3.3 DETAILED CAUSES  An incident is often not only triggered by one cause but often by multiple causes and a chain of  causes. For instance, detailed causes could be:  1. Heavy snow  2. Power cut  In this case, the root cause of the incident could be natural phenomena, and the description of a  possible event could be as follows: an incident may initially be triggered by heavy snow, which  tears down power supply infrastructure causing a power cut, which in turn leads to a telecom  outage. For this example, both heavy snow and power cut are detailed causes. These detailed  causes are equally represented in the statistics, because both causes may be addressed by the  provider in terms of security measures.  28%  19% 16% 15%  12% 9%  7% 7% 6% 3%  0%  5%  10%  15%  20%  25%  30%  Detailed cause  ANNUAL REPORT TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  May 2019  11  In 2018, the most common cause of incidents was hardware failures, which confirms the multi-  annual trend in which hardware failure is always either the first or the second most common  cause.  Also, faulty software changes/updates became the second most common “detailed  cause” as just under a fifth of the incidents reported were caused by them. Both with software  bugs and power cuts remained at the top four causes of the last three years. Many detailed  causes of incidents reports do not fall under a specific category and form the category of “Other”  which has a minor position in this year’s overall chart.  ENISA runs an online visual tool which can be used by externals to do custom analysis over the  full dataset. See: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/for-telcos/visual-tool For  example, by selecting system failures (top left), then fixed internet and telephony (top right), the  charts at the bottom show the detailed causes for this subset.  3.4 SERVICES AFFECTED  For fourth year in a row, most of the reported incidents affected mobile services. This year,  almost the half of the incidents reported had an impact on mobile telephony and internet in the  EU. This confirms the shift of the last years. Fixed telephony was the most affected service only  in the early years of reporting.  Note that for most reported incidents there is impact on more than one service, which explains  why the percentages in the chart here add up to more than 100%.  29%  35%  45%  52%  28%  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  Fixed internet Fixed telephony Mobile internet Mobile telephony Other services  Services affected  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/for-telcos/visual-tool  ANNUAL REPORT TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  May 2019  12  4. DETAILED ANALYSIS: POWER CUTS  In 2018 15% of the incidents involved a power cut, as a detailed cause, but these incidents  accounted for half of the total user hours lost (50%, 496 million user hours). In this section, we  take a closer look at the power cuts. In many countries NRAs are currently analysing and  mitigating the dependencies of the telecom sector on the electricity subsector. In some  countries NRAs have issued specific rules on battery-life of base stations for example. In other  countries the NRA is taking stock of possible contingency measures in case of long lasting  outages, such as increasing the output power of large sites.  We look at the user hours lost for the main detailed causes. The graph below shows millions of  user hours lost for each detailed cause. Clearly power cuts have a major impact.  For all incidents involving power cuts we show the root cause categories of these incidents in  the graph below. Most incidents involving a power cut were categorized as either natural  phenomena (52%) or system failures (42%).  496  407  346  126 97 96 80 62 38  5 0  100  200  300  400  500  600  User hours lost per detailed cause  54%42%  4%  Root causes for power cuts  Natural phenomena  System failures  Human errors  ANNUAL REPORT TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  May 2019  13  Power cuts had a large impact on mobile services as 79% of the reported incidents affected  mobile telephony while 70% of them had an impact on mobile internet. This is not surprising  because the mobile network infrastructure, the mobile base stations, relies on power and it is  not easy to mitigate power cuts: Batteries last only a short time, and they are vulnerable to theft.  Note that by using the ENISA visual tool at https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-  reporting/for-telcos/visual-tool one can study also other detailed causes. For example by  selecting all years (top) and denial of service attacks (bottom right) we see that over the years  denial of service affect mostly addressing servers.  37%  50%  70%  79%  45%  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  Fixed internet Fixed telephony Mobile internet Mobile telephony Other services  Services affected by power cuts  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/for-telcos/visual-tool https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/for-telcos/visual-tool  ANNUAL REPORT TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  May 2019  14  5. MULTI-ANNUAL TRENDS ON PERIOD  2012-2018  ENISA has been collecting and aggregating incident reports since 2012. In this section we look  at the multiannual trends over the last 7 years, covering from 2012 to 2018. This dataset  contains 940 reported incidents in total.  5.1 MULTIANNUAL TREND ROOT CAUSE CATEGORIES  Every year from 2012 to 2018, system failures are the most common root cause, roughly two  thirds every year. In total system failures account for 636 of incident reports (68% of the total).  For this root cause category, over the last 7 years, the most common causes were hardware  failures (36%) and software bugs (29%). The second most common root cause over the 7 years  of reporting is human errors with nearly a fifth of total incidents (17%, 162 incidents in total).  Natural phenomena come third at just under a tenth of total incidents (9%, 89 incidents in total).  Only 4% of the incidents are categorized as malicious actions. In the period 2012-2018 two  thirds of the malicious actions consist of Denial of Service attacks, and the rest are mainly  damage to physical infrastructure.  5.2 MULTIANNUAL TREND IMPACT PER SERVICE  In 2018 mobile networks and services were the most impacted by incidents. This is part of a  multiannual trend. Only in 2014 the fixed networks and services was where the most affected.  Looking back at the 7 years of annual incident reporting, a total of 940 incidents, almost half had  an impact on mobile internet or mobile telephony. The chart below shows the multiannual trends  over the 2012-2018 period.  0%  20%  40%  60%  80%  100%  2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018  Root cause categories Telecom security incidents  in the EU - reported over 2012-2018  System failures  Human errors  Natural phenomena  Malicious actions  ANNUAL REPORT TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  May 2019  15  5.3 MULTIANNUAL TREND USER HOURS PER ROOT CAUSE  CATEGORY  Adding up the total user hours lost per root cause category, we observe that natural phenomena  have been increasing since 2016. In 2018, for the first time, natural phenomena are the  dominant root cause category. Last year natural phenomena accounted for more than half of  the total user hours lost. We observe a downward trend in the user hours lost due to system  failures which started in 2016. The other root cause categories are relatively stable over the  years.  5.4 MULTI-YEAR TREND NUMBER OF INCIDENTS AND USER HOURS  In the chart below we show the total number of incidents reported over the year. Over the years,  the number of incidents included in annual summary reporting to ENISA has increased slowly  and it seems to stabilize at around 160 per year. This is probably due to more reporting by  providers, better awareness about the reporting obligations, and partly due to lower national  thresholds for annual summary reporting.  In the chart below we also show total numbers of incidents reported and total user hours lost  per year over the period 2014-2018. There was an upward trend in user hours lost reaching a  peak in 2017 with 1942 million user hours lost. Interestingly there was a sharp drop in the  average user hours lost per incident reported over 2018.

ENISA started publishing annual reports about telecom  security incidents in 2012. Mandatory breach reporting has been part of the EU’s telecom  regulatory framework since the 2009 reform of the telecom package: Article 13a of the  Framework directive (2009/140/EC) came into force in 2011.  We refer to the executive summary for some of the key findings and statistics facts about the  incidents that occurred in 2018 and the multiannual trends over 2012-2018. We would like to  conclude with some more general observations about this process and the broader policy  context.   Security breach reporting under Article 13a has been implemented pragmatically and  efficiently by the NRAs. Although the incidents in scope of this reporting are only a very  small part of the cybersecurity universe, as near misses, risks, threats, etc. are for  example not included, NRAs have said that this cross-EU process was extremely  helpful3. The process of mandatory notification by operators yielded interesting data  and facts for policy makers both at EU and national level, for NRAs, and other  competent authorities.   Security breach reporting has become a hallmark of EU cybersecurity legislation and  the security breach reporting under Article 13a was the basis for the breach reporting  requirements in eIDAS (Article 19) and the NIS Directive (Article 14, Article 16). All  three laws take an all-hazard approach to cybersecurity incidents and they have  comparable notification thresholds. This means that competent authorities can build on  each other’s experience when implementing such legislation.   With the adoption of the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC), due to  be transposed in national law by the Member States by the end of 2020, the telecom  security breach reporting will be further aligned with the breach reporting under the NIS  Directive. In particular, the definition of what is a security incident and the definition of  notification thresholds are now fully aligned. This means there is a clear opportunity to  synergize and harmonize taxonomy, processes and tools. ENISA is supporting the  process of finding and exploiting these synergies for example by using the same  taxonomy of root causes.   Two years ago the NIS Directive (NISD) established a cooperation group (the NIS  Cooperation group, or NIS CG) for strategic collaboration between EU Member States  on cybersecurity issues. Specific sectoral work is now happening in subgroups, for  example there is a NIS CG work stream for the Energy sector (very important for the  telecom sector, see Section 4), there is a working group for NISD Competent  authorities who supervise the Digital Service providers and recently a work stream on  5G security issues was started.. This means there is a clear benefit for the NRAs in the  Article 13a expert group to have a good liaison with the NIS Cooperation group and we  look forward to exchanging experience and doing joint work.   When the EECC comes into effect by the end of 2020, the telecom regulators will be  dealing with a new type of provider, the so-called over-the-top communication services  3 In 2015 ENISA commissioned an independent evaluation3 of Article 13a and found that incident reporting has greatly  supported policy making and supervision in the EU Member States. See: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/impact- evaluation-article13a  With the adoption  of the European  Electronic  Communications  Code (EECC),  due to be  transposed in  national law by  the Member  States by the end  of 2020, the  telecom security  breach reporting  will be further  aligned with the  breach reporting  under the NIS  Directive.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/impact-evaluation-article13a https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/impact-evaluation-article13a  ANNUAL REPORT TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  May 2019  18  like Whatsapp. This means coordination and collaboration between NRAs across the  EU will become even more important.  We look forward to continue our close collaboration with the telecom regulators in the future and  we look forward to develop a new reporting process for breach reporting and security  supervision under the EECC, building on our joint experience and lessons learned with Article  13a.

CONCLUSIONS 17  ANNUAL REPORT TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  May 2019  3  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  In the EU, electronic communication providers notify significant security incidents to the National  Regulatory authority (NRA) in their country. At the start of every calendar year the NRAs send a  summary about these incidents to ENISA. This document, the Annual Report Telecom Security  Incidents 2018, covers the incidents reported by NRAs for 2018 and gives an anonymised,  aggregated EU-wide overview of telecom security incidents.  Security breach reporting has been part of the EU’s telecom regulatory framework since the  2009 reform of the telecom package: Article 13a of the Framework directive (2009/140/EC)  came into force in 2011. The breach reporting in Article 13a focuses on security incidents with  significant impact on the operation of services, i.e. outages of the electronic communication  networks and/or services.  Statistics annual summary reporting 2008  The 2018 annual summary reporting contains reports about 157 incidents submitted by NRAs  from the 28 EU Member States and 2 EFTA countries. The total user hours lost, multiplying for  each incident the number of users and the number of hours, was 969 Million User Hours, i.e.  roughly 0,02% of the total user hours in a year1.  Here are the key takeaways from about the 2018 incidents:   Natural phenomena dominate in terms of impact: In 2018, half of the total user  hours lost (482 million user hours) were due to natural phenomena. It is the first year  that natural phenomena are the main root cause category in this respect, accounting  for more user hours lost than the category of system failures.   System failures are the most frequent root cause of incidents: Most incidents  (67%) are caused by system failures, a percentage which is consistent with previous  years. Often these system failures are hardware failures and software bugs.  1 Using a basis of 500M (EU citizens) times 365 (days) times 24 (hours). User hours is a metric we use throughout this  report to quantify the impact of an incident, multiplying the number of subscribers/connections affected, with the duration in  hours. For example 1M User Hours means 1M users were affected for one hour, or 2M users for half an hour, etc.  In 2018, half of  the total user  hours lost (482  million user  hours) were  due to natural  phenomena. It  is the first year  that natural  phenomena are  the main root  cause category  in this respect,  accounting for  more user  hours lost than  the category of  system failures.  ANNUAL REPORT TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  May 2019  4   Power cuts are a major factor: Although only a small number of incidents was  caused by power cuts (15%) they had a huge impact in terms of user hours with 50%  of the total, i.e. 496 million user hours lost.   Faulty software changes/updates are the second most common cause: In 2018  faulty software changes/updates were the second most common cause of incident,  accounting for a fifth of the incidents.  ENISA offers an online visual tool for analysing the incidents. It can be used to dive into other  aspects and detailed causes. See: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/for-  telcos/visual-tool For example, by selecting (top left) years 2018, 2017, 2016, then natural  phenomena (top left), then mobile telephony and internet (top right), the charts at the bottom  show detailed causes, assets affected.  Multiannual trends over 7 years of reporting  Looking back at the last 7 years of annual incident reporting we can observe a number of multi-  annual trends.   Total number of incidents reported is stabilizing at around 160: Over the period  2014-2018, there is a consistent number of incidents reported which is stabilizing at  around 160 incidents per year.   Sharp drop of the average impact of incidents: Until 2017 there was a gradual  increase of total user hours lost per year. But in 2018 we see a sharp drop in the total  user hours lost compared to previous years, to just 960 Million user hours. It remains to  be seen if this is part of a larger trend or if this year was an exception.   Impact of natural phenomena trending up: Natural phenomena have been trending  up rapidly since 2016, and now account for more than half of the user hours lost. For  the first time, this year natural phenomena account for more user hours lost than  system failures, which used to be the leading root cause in this specific field.   System failures continue to be the most frequent but their average size is  trending down: Every year system failures have been the most common root cause  category between 60% and 80% of the total number of incidents. Since 2016 the  average size of these incidents is decreasing.   Frequency and impact of human errors and malicious actions stable: Over the  reporting period the frequency of human errors and malicious actions is stable  (approximately accounting for 17% and 5% of incidents per year). Their impact in  terms of user hours is stable also.

Since 2016 security breach reporting is also mandatory for trust  service providers in the EU, under Article 19 of the EIDAS regulation. In 2018, under the NIS  Directive (NISD), security breach reporting became mandatory for Operators of Essential  Services in the EU and for Digital Service Providers, under Article 14 and Article 16 of the NIS  directive.  Soon, by the end of 2020, the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC) will come  into effect across the EU. Under Article 40 of the EECC the breach reporting requirements have  a broader scope, including not only outages, but also breaches of confidentiality, for instance.  Also there are more services in scope of the EECC, including not only traditional telecom  operators, but also for example over-the-top providers of communications services.  ENISA is now working with NRAs and experts from the private sector to prepare the ground for  these changes and at the same time trying to find and exploit synergies between the different  pieces of EU legislation, particularly when it comes to breach reporting and cross-border  supervision.  We look forward to continuing our close collaboration with the EU member states, the national  telecom authorities and experts from the telecom sector from across Europe.  ANNUAL REPORT TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  May 2019  6  1. INTRODUCTION  Electronic communication providers in the EU have to notify security incidents with a significant  impact on the continuity of electronic communication services, to the national telecom regulatory  authorities (NRAs) in each EU member state. Every year the NRAs report a summary to ENISA,  covering a selection of these incidents, i.e. the most significant incidents, based on a set of  agreed EU-wide thresholds. This document, the Annual Security Incidents Report 2018,  aggregates the incident reports reported in 2018 and gives a single EU-wide overview of  telecom security incidents in the EU.  This is the 8th time ENISA publishes an annual incident report for the telecom sector. ENISA  started publishing such annual reports in 2012. Mandatory breach reporting has been part of the  EU’s telecom regulatory framework since the 2009 reform of the telecom package: Article 13a of  the Framework directive (2009/140/EC) came into force in 2011.  Note that although Article 13a itself is fairly broad, the mandatory breach reporting in Article 13a  has specific focus on security incidents with a significant impact on the functioning of the  service. There is some divergence and discussion about what is in scope here, but generally  speaking, in most countries, this was understood to mean that there has to be a service outage.  Now consider for example an attack in which attackers wiretap major undersea cables; if the  attack causes no outages, then the incident does not fall under the breach reporting  requirements of Article 13a. Recently the Council and Parliament agreed with an update of the  EU telecom rules called the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC). The breach  reporting requirements in (Article 40 of) the EECC have a broader scope, including not only  incidents causing outages, but also, for example, breaches of confidentiality. An incident like the  one just mentioned would be reportable under (Article 40 of) the EECC.  This document is structured as follows: In section 2 we briefly summarize the reporting  procedure and to give an idea about the kind of incidents that are reported we give some  specific but anonymized examples of incidents that occurred in 2018. In Section 3 we provide  some key facts and statistics about the 2018 incidents. In Section 4 we take a closer look at  power cuts. In section 5 we look at multiannual trends over the years 2012-2018. Conclusions  about trends and comparisons with previous years have to be made with care, because national  reporting has improved over the years, reporting thresholds have been lowered in most  countries, etc.  This is the 8th  time ENISA  publishes an  annual incident  report for the  telecom sector.  ENISA started  publishing such  annual reports in  2012. Mandatory  breach reporting  has been part of  the EU’s telecom  regulatory  framework since  the 2009 reform of  the telecom  package: Article  13a of the  Framework  directive  (2009/140/EC)  came into force in  2011.  ANNUAL REPORT TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  May 2019  7  2. INCIDENT REPORTING FRAMEWORK  AND EXAMPLES OF INCIDENTS  We briefly explain the main features of the incident reporting procedure, as described in the  Article 13a Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting2, which was developed in collaboration  with the NRAs.  2.1 INCIDENT REPORTING FRAMEWORK  Article 13a introduces  three  types  of  incident  reporting: 1) National  incident  reporting  from  providers to NRAs, 2) Ad-hoc incident reporting between NRAs and ENISA, and  3) Annual  summary reporting from NRAs to the EC and ENISA. The different types of reporting are shown  in the diagram below.  Note that in this setup ENISA acts as a collection point, anonymizing aggregating and analysing  the incident reports. In the current setup NRAs can search incidents in the reporting tool  (CIRAS) but the incident reports themselves do not refer to countries or providers, making the  overall summary reporting process less sensitive.  2.2 EXAMPLES OF INCIDENTS REPORTED  We give some specific examples of incidents to give an idea of the kind of incidents that are  notified to NRAs and then included in the annual summary reporting to ENISA:   A system failure caused a mobile internet, telephony and SMS outage for  thousands of users (duration: hours, connections: thousands, cause: software  bug): A software bug occurred in the SPR (Subscriber Profile Repository) server.  Following the repeated instability of the equipment, the signalling traffic increased and  2 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting  ANNUAL REPORT TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  May 2019  8  the STP (Signalling Transfer Point) platforms became overloaded. As a result, end  users had difficulties to access mobile internet services as well as voice and SMS  services. The vendor responded by fully restoring the functionality of the SPR  equipment. In order to stop the avalanche of signalling messages, the 3G and 4G  networks were partially shut off and all subscribers were located on the 2G network.   A power cut caused by a heavy storm affected mobile, fixed services and Cable  TV for hundreds of users (duration: hours, connections: thousands, cause:  heavy wind/storm): A heavy storm combining with heavy winds strongly affected  assets in a defined area causing outages to mobile and fixed services. The operator  emergency team was activated. A number of emergency generators was used and a  number of VSAT antennas was installed on affected sites.   A malicious action caused a mobile internet outage for a million of users  (duration: hours, connections: a million, cause: Denial of Service attack):  The  network was subject to a cyber-attack (Denial of Service attack) which caused  congestion and degraded service. Mobile switches and routers were affected by this  attack. The network had self-recovered after the attack had ceased.   A human error caused a mobile internet outage for millions of users (duration:  hours, connections: millions, cause: faulty software change/update): Due to a  human error (wrong software configuration) during the migration of the packet  gateway, clients of one operator were not able to use mobile data. Mobile switches  were affected by this incident. A rollback was successfully executed to resolve the  issue.   Fixed telephony, broadband internet, cable TV service lost due to cable cuts  (duration: hours - days, connections: thousands, cause: human errors): A  number of network outages were suffered due to cable cuts during construction and  road excavation work.  Networks were restored following manual repair intervention on  damaged cables.  Note that the experts from NRAs have access to the CIRAS incident reporting tool where they  can search for and study specific incidents. This tool anonymizes which country was involved.  For externals ENISA runs an online visual tool which can be used for custom analysis of the  data: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/for-telcos/visual-tool  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/for-telcos/visual-tool  ANNUAL REPORT TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  May 2019  9  3. ANALYSIS OF THE INCIDENTS  In total, all 28 EU Member States and 2 EFTA countries participated in this process. Of these,  19 Member States and 2 EFTA countries reported in total 157 significant incidents and 5  countries reported there were no significant incidents. In this section, the 157 reported incidents  are aggregated and analysed. First, the impact per root cause category is analysed (in section  3.1), in section 3.2 we focus on the user hours that have been lost per root cause category, then  detailed causes are examined (Section 3.3), and in Section 3.4 the impact per service is  analysed.  3.1 ROOT CAUSE CATEGORIES  In 2018 roughly two thirds of the telecom security incidents were system failures. This is  consistent with previous years. Often they are hardware failures and software bugs. Also human  errors are stable at around 18%. Most often these are accidental cable cuts and faulty software  changes/updates. 10% of the incidents are caused by natural phenomena, two times less than  the previous year. Only 5% of incidents were due to malicious actions. Typically these cases are  denial of service attacks and cable theft.  There is a fifth category called Third-party failures, which can be selected (only) in conjunction  with another root cause category. Typically third party failures are incidents which happen at a  utility company or supplier and then affect the telecom providers, for example a power cut. In  total over 2018, 9% of incidents were flagged as third-party failures. The division is shown in the  chart below.  67%  18%  10%  5%  Root cause categories Telecom security incidents - 2018  System failures  Human errors  Natural phenomena  Malicious actions  65%  2%  15%  3%  6% 4%  5%  0%  Third party failures - 2018  System failures  System failures - Third party failures  Human errors  Human errors - Third party failures  Natural phenomena  Natural phenomena - Third party failures  Malicious actions  Malicious actions - Third party failures  ANNUAL REPORT TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  May 2019  10  3.2 USER HOURS LOST FOR EACH ROOT CAUSE CATEGORY  Adding up the total user hours lost for each root cause category we find that than half of the  total user hours lost were due to natural phenomena (50%, 482 million user hours). All system  failures combined account for two fifths of user hours lost (39%, 380 million user hours).  So although system failures are the most common (see section 3.1), they are having less  impact than natural phenomena. In 2018 the natural phenomena are the dominant root cause  category in terms of user hours lost. The multi annual trends graph for user hours lost per root  cause category (see section 5.3) shows this is the first year that natural phenomena account for  more user hours lost than system failures.  3.3 DETAILED CAUSES  An incident is often not only triggered by one cause but often by multiple causes and a chain of  causes. For instance, detailed causes could be:  1. Heavy snow  2. Power cut  In this case, the root cause of the incident could be natural phenomena, and the description of a  possible event could be as follows: an incident may initially be triggered by heavy snow, which  tears down power supply infrastructure causing a power cut, which in turn leads to a telecom  outage. For this example, both heavy snow and power cut are detailed causes. These detailed  causes are equally represented in the statistics, because both causes may be addressed by the  provider in terms of security measures.  28%  19% 16% 15%  12% 9%  7% 7% 6% 3%  0%  5%  10%  15%  20%  25%  30%  Detailed cause  ANNUAL REPORT TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  May 2019  11  In 2018, the most common cause of incidents was hardware failures, which confirms the multi-  annual trend in which hardware failure is always either the first or the second most common  cause.  Also, faulty software changes/updates became the second most common “detailed  cause” as just under a fifth of the incidents reported were caused by them. Both with software  bugs and power cuts remained at the top four causes of the last three years. Many detailed  causes of incidents reports do not fall under a specific category and form the category of “Other”  which has a minor position in this year’s overall chart.  ENISA runs an online visual tool which can be used by externals to do custom analysis over the  full dataset. See: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/for-telcos/visual-tool For  example, by selecting system failures (top left), then fixed internet and telephony (top right), the  charts at the bottom show the detailed causes for this subset.  3.4 SERVICES AFFECTED  For fourth year in a row, most of the reported incidents affected mobile services. This year,  almost the half of the incidents reported had an impact on mobile telephony and internet in the  EU. This confirms the shift of the last years. Fixed telephony was the most affected service only  in the early years of reporting.  Note that for most reported incidents there is impact on more than one service, which explains  why the percentages in the chart here add up to more than 100%.  29%  35%  45%  52%  28%  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  Fixed internet Fixed telephony Mobile internet Mobile telephony Other services  Services affected  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/for-telcos/visual-tool  ANNUAL REPORT TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  May 2019  12  4. DETAILED ANALYSIS: POWER CUTS  In 2018 15% of the incidents involved a power cut, as a detailed cause, but these incidents  accounted for half of the total user hours lost (50%, 496 million user hours). In this section, we  take a closer look at the power cuts. In many countries NRAs are currently analysing and  mitigating the dependencies of the telecom sector on the electricity subsector. In some  countries NRAs have issued specific rules on battery-life of base stations for example. In other  countries the NRA is taking stock of possible contingency measures in case of long lasting  outages, such as increasing the output power of large sites.  We look at the user hours lost for the main detailed causes. The graph below shows millions of  user hours lost for each detailed cause. Clearly power cuts have a major impact.  For all incidents involving power cuts we show the root cause categories of these incidents in  the graph below. Most incidents involving a power cut were categorized as either natural  phenomena (52%) or system failures (42%).  496  407  346  126 97 96 80 62 38  5 0  100  200  300  400  500  600  User hours lost per detailed cause  54%42%  4%  Root causes for power cuts  Natural phenomena  System failures  Human errors  ANNUAL REPORT TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  May 2019  13  Power cuts had a large impact on mobile services as 79% of the reported incidents affected  mobile telephony while 70% of them had an impact on mobile internet. This is not surprising  because the mobile network infrastructure, the mobile base stations, relies on power and it is  not easy to mitigate power cuts: Batteries last only a short time, and they are vulnerable to theft.  Note that by using the ENISA visual tool at https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-  reporting/for-telcos/visual-tool one can study also other detailed causes.

MULTI-ANNUAL TRENDS ON PERIOD  2012-2018  ENISA has been collecting and aggregating incident reports since 2012. In this section we look  at the multiannual trends over the last 7 years, covering from 2012 to 2018. This dataset  contains 940 reported incidents in total.  5.1 MULTIANNUAL TREND ROOT CAUSE CATEGORIES  Every year from 2012 to 2018, system failures are the most common root cause, roughly two  thirds every year. In total system failures account for 636 of incident reports (68% of the total).  For this root cause category, over the last 7 years, the most common causes were hardware  failures (36%) and software bugs (29%). The second most common root cause over the 7 years  of reporting is human errors with nearly a fifth of total incidents (17%, 162 incidents in total).  Natural phenomena come third at just under a tenth of total incidents (9%, 89 incidents in total).  Only 4% of the incidents are categorized as malicious actions. In the period 2012-2018 two  thirds of the malicious actions consist of Denial of Service attacks, and the rest are mainly  damage to physical infrastructure.  5.2 MULTIANNUAL TREND IMPACT PER SERVICE  In 2018 mobile networks and services were the most impacted by incidents. This is part of a  multiannual trend. Only in 2014 the fixed networks and services was where the most affected.  Looking back at the 7 years of annual incident reporting, a total of 940 incidents, almost half had  an impact on mobile internet or mobile telephony. The chart below shows the multiannual trends  over the 2012-2018 period.  0%  20%  40%  60%  80%  100%  2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018  Root cause categories Telecom security incidents  in the EU - reported over 2012-2018  System failures  Human errors  Natural phenomena  Malicious actions  ANNUAL REPORT TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  May 2019  15  5.3 MULTIANNUAL TREND USER HOURS PER ROOT CAUSE  CATEGORY  Adding up the total user hours lost per root cause category, we observe that natural phenomena  have been increasing since 2016. In 2018, for the first time, natural phenomena are the  dominant root cause category. Last year natural phenomena accounted for more than half of  the total user hours lost. We observe a downward trend in the user hours lost due to system  failures which started in 2016. The other root cause categories are relatively stable over the  years.  5.4 MULTI-YEAR TREND NUMBER OF INCIDENTS AND USER HOURS  In the chart below we show the total number of incidents reported over the year. Over the years,  the number of incidents included in annual summary reporting to ENISA has increased slowly  and it seems to stabilize at around 160 per year. This is probably due to more reporting by  providers, better awareness about the reporting obligations, and partly due to lower national  thresholds for annual summary reporting.  In the chart below we also show total numbers of incidents reported and total user hours lost  per year over the period 2014-2018. There was an upward trend in user hours lost reaching a  peak in 2017 with 1942 million user hours lost. Interestingly there was a sharp drop in the  average user hours lost per incident reported over 2018. It remains to be seen if this decrease  2017, 52%  2014, 45%  2013, 21%  2014, 32% 2015, 34%  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018  Trend on impact per service  Mobile telephony Mobile internet Fixed telephony Fixed internet  0  20  40  60  80  100  2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018  User hours lost per root cause category - multiannual 2012- 2018  (percentage of total user hours lost)  system failures human errors natural phenomena malicious actions  ANNUAL REPORT TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  May 2019  16  is structural and sustained in the future, i.e. whether 2018 is the exception or the start of a  longer trend.

CONCLUSIONS  This annual report telecom security incidents 2018 marks the 8th time ENISA publishes an  annual report for the telecom sector. ENISA started publishing annual reports about telecom  security incidents in 2012. Mandatory breach reporting has been part of the EU’s telecom  regulatory framework since the 2009 reform of the telecom package: Article 13a of the  Framework directive (2009/140/EC) came into force in 2011.  We refer to the executive summary for some of the key findings and statistics facts about the  incidents that occurred in 2018 and the multiannual trends over 2012-2018. We would like to  conclude with some more general observations about this process and the broader policy  context.   Security breach reporting under Article 13a has been implemented pragmatically and  efficiently by the NRAs. Although the incidents in scope of this reporting are only a very  small part of the cybersecurity universe, as near misses, risks, threats, etc. are for  example not included, NRAs have said that this cross-EU process was extremely  helpful3. The process of mandatory notification by operators yielded interesting data  and facts for policy makers both at EU and national level, for NRAs, and other  competent authorities.   Security breach reporting has become a hallmark of EU cybersecurity legislation and  the security breach reporting under Article 13a was the basis for the breach reporting  requirements in eIDAS (Article 19) and the NIS Directive (Article 14, Article 16). All  three laws take an all-hazard approach to cybersecurity incidents and they have  comparable notification thresholds. This means that competent authorities can build on  each other’s experience when implementing such legislation.   With the adoption of the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC), due to  be transposed in national law by the Member States by the end of 2020, the telecom  security breach reporting will be further aligned with the breach reporting under the NIS  Directive. In particular, the definition of what is a security incident and the definition of  notification thresholds are now fully aligned. This means there is a clear opportunity to  synergize and harmonize taxonomy, processes and tools. ENISA is supporting the  process of finding and exploiting these synergies for example by using the same  taxonomy of root causes.   Two years ago the NIS Directive (NISD) established a cooperation group (the NIS  Cooperation group, or NIS CG) for strategic collaboration between EU Member States  on cybersecurity issues. Specific sectoral work is now happening in subgroups, for  example there is a NIS CG work stream for the Energy sector (very important for the  telecom sector, see Section 4), there is a working group for NISD Competent  authorities who supervise the Digital Service providers and recently a work stream on  5G security issues was started.. This means there is a clear benefit for the NRAs in the  Article 13a expert group to have a good liaison with the NIS Cooperation group and we  look forward to exchanging experience and doing joint work.   When the EECC comes into effect by the end of 2020, the telecom regulators will be  dealing with a new type of provider, the so-called over-the-top communication services  3 In 2015 ENISA commissioned an independent evaluation3 of Article 13a and found that incident reporting has greatly  supported policy making and supervision in the EU Member States.

We look forward to continue our close collaboration with the telecom regulators in the future and  we look forward to develop a new reporting process for breach reporting and security  supervision under the EECC, building on our joint experience and lessons learned with Article  13a.

    "abstract": "This is the 8th time ENISA publishes an annual incident report for the telecom sector. In 2018, half of the total user hours lost (482 million user hours) were due to natural phenomena. It is the first year that natural phenomena are the main root cause category in this respect, accounting for more user hours lost than the category of system failures."

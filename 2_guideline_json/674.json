Following the finalization  of the legislative procedure and the publication of the  Regulation’s text in the Official Journal, ENISA is prepared  to engage and support all involved stakeholders and  fulfil all assigned tasks and roles.  ENISA is prepared to  engage and support all  involved stakeholders  and fulfil all assigned  tasks and roles.  INTRODUCTION  In an effort to harmonise the current cybersecurity  certification activities and policies across the Member  States, the Proposal for a Regulation of the European  Parliament and of the Council on ENISA, the “EU  Cybersecurity Agency”, and repealing Regulation (EU)  526/2013, and on Information and Communication  Technology cybersecurity certification (“Cybersecurity  Act”), COM(2017) 4771, (hereinafter, the Proposal)  establishes, the European Cybersecurity Certification  Framework for ICT products and services. This proposed  framework seeks to lower financial and administrative  barriers for the industry by pursuing the setting up  of an EU cybersecurity certification framework for ICT  products and services.  OPINION PAPERS 1  OPINION PAPERS 2  THE EU CYBERSECURITY AGENCY  LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS  With a view to pursue the policy goal of a common  framework across the EU, the proposal for the  EU Cybersecurity Certification Framework in the draft  Cybersecurity Act makes the following provisions  for ENISA:    Lays down an overall framework of rules governing  European cybersecurity certification schemes.    Does not introduce directly operational certification  schemes.    Seeks to create a system (framework) for the  establishment of specific certification schemes  for specific ICT products/services (the \"European  cybersecurity certification schemes\").    Provides that certification schemes created  in accordance with the Framework will allow  certificates issued under those schemes to be valid  and recognised across all Member States and to  address the current market fragmentation.    Provides what the minimum content of such  schemes should be.  Certification schemes will have to define specific  elements setting out the scope and object of the  cybersecurity certification such as the identification  of the categories of products and services covered. In  addition, it is necessary to provide in detail specifications  of the cybersecurity requirements (for example by  reference to the relevant standards or technical  specifications), the specific evaluation criteria and  methods and the level of assurance they are intended  to ensure (i.e. basic, substantial or high) as they will  eventually be specified in legislation.  Certification schemes  will have to define  specific elements setting  out the scope and object  of the cybersecurity  certification such as  the identification of the  categories of products  and services covered.  OPINION PAPERS 3  THE EU CYBERSECURITY AGENCY  GOALS OF ENISA  IN THE LEGISLATIVE PERIOD The primary goal of ENISA throughout the period until  the Proposal comes into force is identifying the types of  certification schemes that possibly fall within its scope  and mandate as per the Proposal. Furthermore, ENISA,  as ever, engages with stakeholders with a view to involve  them in discussions on the EU cybersecurity certification  mandate of the Proposal.  ENISA has been active in analysing prospective schemes  based on existing and new application areas (e.g.  consumer), classes of products (e.g. IoT) and types  of services (e.g. Cloud) in a way that when needed it  can quickly respond to requests to draw up candidate  certification schemes. Clearly, it is essential for ENISA  to continue collecting and validating stakeholder  requirements in the area of the EU certification  framework as well as make available the necessary  organisational conditions required to fulfil its role in a  timely manner.  MISSION  The mission of ENISA in the area of the EU cybersecurity  certification framework is expected to be defined along  the following lines: “To pro-actively contribute to the  emerging EU cybersecurity certification framework  and carry out the drawing up of candidate certification  schemes in line with the Cybersecurity Act, providing  stakeholders with a sound service that leads to  efficiencies and value in the EU”.  Throughout its lifespan ENISA has received due  recognition for its outputs. In a shift towards a role  that adds more value to the EU policy on network and  information security, ENISA has been singled out as the  appropriate organisation to deliver on the promise of  drawing up candidate certification schemes in an EU  cybersecurity certification framework. ENISA with its  pivotal role as an interlocutor with both public services  as well as the industry and standardisation organisations  provides a sound reference point to draw up candidate  certification schemes.  The expected output of ENISA pursuant to its envisaged  role in the EU cybersecurity certification framework  includes draft and finalised candidate schemes for the  certification of ICT products and services, in the meaning  of the Proposal.  STAKEHOLDERS  Clearly, the success of the role of ENISA depends on  support from and cooperation with key stakeholders  that include but are not limited to the following  ones: the members of the European Cybersecurity  Certification Group, including the Commission  and competent authorities in the Member States  represented thereto. Additionally National  Accreditation Bodies, Certification Supervisory  Authorities, Conformity Assessment Bodies, European  standardisation organisations (CEN/CENELEC and ETSI)  as well as international and industry standardisation  organisations, product manufacturers and service  providers who have an interest in EU schemes for the  certification of ICT products and services.  OPINION PAPERS 4  THE EU CYBERSECURITY AGENCY  THE ROLE OF ENISA  The role of ENISA at this stage can be determined  along the two new competences described in the  Proposal, being:    A role in support of the Commission in relation to  the European Cybersecurity Certification Group.    A role in the drawing up of candidate cybersecurity  schemes within the emerging EU framework.  Certification related activities of ENISA is a new policy  area for the Agency that aims at making available high  quality technical and policy services to its stakeholders.  As they will be an integral activity of the Agency, it is  expected that relevant operations begin as soon as  the Proposal is approved. On the outset, ENISA aims at  targeting the drawing up of candidate schemes for the  cybersecurity certification of ICT products and services.  ENISA seeks to draw up candidate schemes in an array  of application areas (e.g. consumer), classes of products  (e.g. IoT) and types of services (e.g. Cloud). These  candidate schemes are likely to be drawn up with the  support of stakeholders, which can be public entities in  the Member States and private companies alike, as well  as professional groups/associations and individuals.  This approach is likely to give ENISA the flexibility it  needs to successfully secure and complete candidate  certification schemes integrating various elements and  ranges of stakeholders’ requirements. By relying on  existing schemes, ENISA is likely to tackle the transition  into an EU cybersecurity certification framework  more rapidly, thus supporting the quick up take of the  framework across the EU.  Concurrently, ENISA is also likely to take up initiatives  in other areas in need of cybersecurity certification  schemes. Clearly, any activation of the capacity that  ENISA is likely to build in certification requires a formal  Commission request. In the same vein, the Commission  is the final recipient of ENISA-churned out candidate  certification schemes.  The needs for certification schemes across select  Member States has continued to proliferate by means of  initiatives of select Member States that have recognised  over time the high demand prevailing. It is reasonable  to suggest that most Member States do not have the  capacity to carry out such activities and as such, do not  necessarily nurture the ambition to offer or contribute  to this sort of service. Therefore, ENISA seeks to set the  stage as a possible reference point for all cybersecurity  certification scheme-drawing activities across the EU;  this of course includes support for the ambition of  Member States that do not currently have this capacity,  which however may want to get to this point. This is a  role in support of the ambition to bring the value of the  EU framework across the Member States but also to  support the industry, in their efforts within the Internal  Market and beyond.  WORKING PRINCIPLES FOR DRAWING  UP SCHEMES A candidate European cybersecurity certification  scheme prepared by ENISA needs to be based on sound  principles, encouraging stakeholders to contribute to  its development and allowing industry and the Member  States to benefit from it once approved. The envisaged  principles for ENISA drawing up candidate schemes  include the following:    Open: a candidate scheme is drawn up by means  of open consultations accessible to all parties  interested in the technology, products or services  affected by the said scheme. For instance, ENISA can  invite area Experts to express their interest in the  drawing up of a certification scheme, for example by  being involved in a consultation process.    Consensus driven: The consultation process is  collaborative and consensus based.    Transparent: Any new scheme activity is publicised  broadly through means available to ENISA.  Information concerning technical discussions and  consultations is recorded. Feedback received during  the consultation process is treated in an equitable  manner and responses are provided for.  OPINION PAPERS 5  THE EU CYBERSECURITY AGENCY  CONCLUSION  With the addition of a competence in the cybersecurity  certification of ICT products and services, ENISA seeks  to step up its contribution to policy on network and  information security in the EU. Clearly, stakeholder  involvement is key, much as guidance from EU  institutions and EU Member States is. At the end of the  day, ENISA has been established as a support measure  in the internal market and as such, it underpins EU  policy in its remit to the benefit of the Member States.  Key outputs of ENISA in relation to certification are likely  to enhance market conditions and help consumers and  citizens alike enjoy fully the new opportunities presented  by emerging technologies. The EU framework on  cybersecurity certification is also an opportunity for the  EU to broaden its influence far beyond its borders in a  highly competitive and lucrative market where European  industry can play a leading role. To this end, ENISA is  able to support and enhance this European capability to  the benefit of the Member States.

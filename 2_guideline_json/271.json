INTRODUCTION  Foresight2 is a complex, multi-stage, ideally ongoing process, the ultimate aim of which  is informed decision-making with regard to securing strategic plans for possibly diverse  future developments. It enables reflection on various possible futures and strategic  preparation for plausible scenarios.3 Since the mid-1950s and early 1960s, foresight as a  discipline has grown to become a major strategic planning tool for private corporations as well  as the public sector.4 .  Foresight is still evolving and changing today. That is largely because it is action-oriented, and  therefore has tangible results; it is open, meaning there is freedom within foresight to think  outside of the box or to reshape previous notions; lastly it is participatory and  multidisciplinary – foresight brings together diverse groups that have expertise in a wide range  of topics, thus providing more realistic and thoughtful possible futures.5  Figure 1: Foresight Overview6  “Foresight is neither prophecy nor prediction. It does not aim to predict the future – to  unveil it as if it were predetermined – but to help us build it.” – EU Foresight Platform7  2 Please note that foresight is often referred to as “strategic foresight” and “futures studies.”  3 See GCPSE, Foresight – The Manual, UNDP Global Centre for Public Service Excellence, Singapore, 2014.  4 Schwartz, P.

Knowledge helps individual stakeholders best position themselves for future developments;  with knowledge, they can see beyond the fallacy that the future will look much like the present  and imagine leading-edge futures (Wilkinson, 2013). The process of developing this knowledge  and insight increases connections between stakeholders, thus strengthening related  networks – in this case the cybersecurity community. Finally, foresight can contribute to  capability enhancement, during which organizational and stakeholder capabilities may be  prioritized based on the findings of the foresight activity. This information is critical for identifying  and enabling the development and acquisition of key skills, policies, and technologies.  The application of foresight in the field of cybersecurity is not currently widespread.9 However,  we strongly believe that embedding these methods into the cybersecurity industry will lead to an  even more nuanced, clear, and multidisciplinary understanding of risk, as well as the strategic  ramifications of security measures.  Foresight is already a key element of ENISA’s strategy; it increases knowledge and  understanding of emerging and future challenges, thus providing a path to find solutions that  address those challenges and bolster EU resilience to cybersecurity threats.10  As an additional resource for integrating foresight into the field of cybersecurity, this report  provides an overview of key aspects of foresight, a selection of key methods and tools, best  practices for applying foresight, and finally, an exemplary guide to putting this knowledge into  practice, and running a foresight activity. We provide recommendations tailored specifically to  ENISA’s wide range of functional needs – executive strategy, policy support, capacity building,  operational cooperation, and certification activities. As these functional needs are likely shared  by many readers of this report, the recommendations are formulated as to be easily adapted to  fit other organizations and contexts.  With this initiative we hope to inspire and support Member States and other partners to use  foresight to address their own cybersecurity challenges. ENISA is taking the first step by  beginning to use these methods internally to provide more accurate and prescient information to  our stakeholders.  1.1 OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE  To adequately address future cybersecurity threats and to shape a more secure society, ENISA  aims to draw upon findings and research from the futures and foresight community to develop a  process to apply foresight to cybersecurity. By fostering the ability to understand potential  futures, ENISA will be able to better shape both itself and the European cybersecurity  ecosystem to address and manage emerging and future challenges.  This project aims to deliver an exemplary structured foresight framework (comprised of a  selected set of foresight methods applied to representative use cases) for generating trend  8 Haegeman, K., Spiesberger, M., Könnölä, T., Evaluating foresight in transitional research programming,  Technological Forecasting and Social Change 115, 2017, pp. 313 – 326.  9 Althonayan, Abraham, and Alina Andronache. \"Resiliency under strategic foresight: The effects of cybersecurity management and  enterprise risk management alignment.\" 2019 International Conference on Cyber Situational Awareness, Data Analytics and Assessment  (Cyber SA).

The framework or sets of methods recommended must be suitable for the range of ENISA  activities including strategic long-term planning, research agenda setting, threat landscape  evaluation, and formation of future policy priorities. It is therefore required that the framework be  flexible and easily adapted to each context and environment.  This report is not intended to be a comprehensive overview of all foresight methods available, but  rather aims to highlight the most relevant methods – based on ubiquity or suitability to ENISA’s  core foresight needs.  1.2 TARGET AUDIENCE  This report is targeted at stakeholders within the cybersecurity community (specifically ENISA  internal and external stakeholders) but can very well be applied more broadly, as foresight  methods are generally applicable across industries or topics. This report may be especially  relevant for:   Policymakers and national authorities with cybersecurity responsibilities   ENISA stakeholders, decision- and policymakers in the areas of ENISA’s portfolio   Cybersecurity researchers, practitioners, and educators   Relevant experts within European Institutions, Bodies and Agencies and their partners   Futurists or foresight consultants   Organizational leaders and corporate strategists   Forecasters and prediction market developers  1.3 STRUCTURE OF THE REPORT  The report reflects the progression and outcomes of the research study and is structured as  follows.

STOCKTAKING  2.1 OVERVIEW  To develop this framework, ENISA conducted a thorough literature review to explore a broad  range of information on foresight, with a focus on methods, tools and applications that could be  relevant for ENISA.11  These findings were augmented by interviews with experts in the fields of foresight and  cybersecurity, members of the ENISA’s Ad-Hoc Working Group on Foresight on Emerging and  Future Cybersecurity Challenges.12 The output of the research phase was the collection of  definitions, key characteristics, and best practices for a select representative set of methods  (relevant to ENISA’s specific operating environment).  2.2 STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS  Experts interviewed for this project were primarily individuals in ENISA’s Ad-Hoc Working Group  on Foresight (one additional academic foresight expert and practitioner was interviewed). All  experts brought unique perspectives that shed light on the characteristics of various foresight  methods and best practices for planning and conducting foresight exercises.  The experts interviewed as a part of this project represent a diverse group of individuals. We  interviewed 16 people, who represent (in nationality) nine different Member States,  geographically distributed across the EU. The expert group consisted of approximately 60%  women and 40% men.  Figure 3: Geographical Distribution of Experts  11 Due to the practical application of the recommendations in this report, our research focused primarily on frameworks, methods, and  tools and did not target the breadth of the foresight literature that focuses on principles, ethics, attitudes, learning factors, and other more  intangible factors.  12 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/artificial_intelligence/ad-hoc-working-group-on-emerging-and- future-cybersecurity-challenges  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/artificial_intelligence/ad-hoc-working-group-on-emerging-and-future-cybersecurity-challenges https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/artificial_intelligence/ad-hoc-working-group-on-emerging-and-future-cybersecurity-challenges  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  November 2021  10  The expert group also contains a mixture of foresight experts and cybersecurity experts. The  graph below illustrates how experts rated themselves on a slide scale when asked: “Does your  expertise lie more in cybersecurity or foresight?”  Figure 4: Expert Group Areas of Expertise  The experts work within a wide range of industries, but primarily in academia and consulting.

METHODS AND FRAMEWORKS  APPLICABLE TO FORESIGHT FOR  CYBERSECURITY  3.1 INTRODUCTION  Each foresight activity begins with the identification of scope, objectives, and stakeholders – this  step is a critical success factor. The scoping and initiation process is described in more detail in  later sections of the report.  Depending on the aim of the foresight project, (and factors such as the point in time to be  analysed (time horizon), field of application, scope of the project, available resources (human,  time, financial), ability to shape future evolutions), a specific set of methods is selected to best fit  the specified project.  A foresight exercise requires thoughtful preparation, involvement of the stakeholders and  participants, constant monitoring, skilful management, and continuous adaptation. This  chapter categorizes methods based on their “intention,” future-handling approach, and overall  aim.  For a comprehensive description of the entire foresight process and overview of foresight  methods, we refer the interested reader to the European Foresight Platform,13 a very useful  resource and reference.  Foresight Intentions14  Foresight activities usually involve three mutually dependent and essential intentions: diagnosis,  prognosis, and prescription. Foresight activities usually include all three of these intentions at  different points in the project.  This categorization helps to better identify the goal of each use of a method and supports the  method selection process. It was created by the EU Foresight Platform.15  13 “The European Foresight Platform is a global network building program supported by the European Commission. It aims at building a  global network that brings together different communities and individual professionals to share their knowledge about foresight,  forecasting and other methods of future studies.” – EFP http://www.foresight-platform.eu/  14 “Intention” is not a word used in the foresight industry, it is rather used in this report to distinguish between lower-level objectives within  a project and the primary objectives and desired outcomes.  15 http://www.foresight-platform.eu/community/forlearn/how-to-do-foresight/process/methodology/Smith  http://www.foresight-platform.eu/ http://www.foresight-platform.eu/community/forlearn/how-to-do-foresight/process/methodology/Smith  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  November 2021  12  Table 1: Foresight Intentions  Foresight  Intention  Description  Diagnosis  The aim is to evaluate the current context or state of affairs or subject of  study, to recognize early signs of possible future changes.  Prognosis  The aim is to create or envision probable, possible and plausible future  states of a subject of study.  Prescription  This component involves participants inventing possible strategies,  roadmaps or policies that aim to either respond to possible futures, or  actively shape the future towards a desired direction.  Future Handling  Based on the primary objectives of the foresight activity, the project or method’s approach can  be either “responsive”, meaning to devise strategies to react to possible events, or  “normative”, to design a future (that can be desirable or undesirable) and then take steps  to impact that chosen future. This topic is a subcategorization of the prescriptive intention.  3.2 OVERVIEW OF SELECTED METHODS AND FRAMEWORKS  Both cybersecurity and foresight benefit from a diverse and interdisciplinary environment. For  this reason, it is often wise to integrate frameworks from other fields. We believe that the  guidelines, practices, approaches, methods and tools of both systems thinking and user-  centred design can be key to establishing the right mindset when approaching foresighting in  the field of cybersecurity.  User-centred design offers a set of guidelines and tools that focus on the human factor in  business and technological implementations, helping to better define and design interactive  systems and organizations 16. The framework makes extensive use of immersive analysis and  empathy exercises, providing a window into the thoughts, aspirations, desires, needs and  actions of the human actors.  The framework of systems thinking, on the other hand, allows us to “see the forest through the  trees.”17 82 This phrase distils the essence and objective of the framework: to enable its  practitioners to identify, observe, analyse and shape systems, as well as the relationship  dynamics between its elements.  Both frameworks may provide a foundational aspect of a foresight project and support the  development of a point of view or mindset. Because the scope of these frameworks is so broad,  we have not included them in the categorizations in section 3.2.1, nor going forward in this  report. Nevertheless, they remain highly relevant aspects for any foresight practitioner seeking  to implement the tools, methods and processes outlined in this report.  16 https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/user-centered-design  17 Senge, Peter M. (1990). The fifth discipline: the art and practice of the learning organization. New York: Doubleday/Currency,  https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/user-centered-design  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  November 2021  13  3.2.1 Method Categorisation  To better illustrate the range of methods, the relevant methods, frameworks, and tools have  been grouped into six categories driven by the stocktaking phase of this project.18 Not all  methods listed can be considered explicit to foresight – we have also included strategic  planning methods and problem-solving techniques that are often integrated into foresight  activities.  Likewise, cybersecurity analysis methods are also included here to provide an overview of  relevant approaches for foresight in cybersecurity. These methods and techniques are not used  in traditional foresight but may be applied if they support the objectives of the foresight activity.  For that reason, a selection of methods is included in this report for future reference.  Figure 6: Selection of methods used in foresight19  3.2.2 Environmental Scanning / Analysis Frameworks  Environmental analysis frameworks enable the user to systematically explore a chosen  environment,20 with the goal of detecting weak signals21 of incoming change that could  significantly impact the future. These methods provide a structured and analytical view of the  current situation in order to create common understanding. This category of methods usually  draws upon the diagnostic intention.  There are different techniques to scan the environment including, for example:   STEEP – framework to analyse Socio-cultural, Technological, Economic,  Environmental and Political factors of a particular arena.   PESTLE – framework to analyse Political, Economic, Socio-cultural, Technological,  Legal and Environmental factors of a particular arena.   SWOT – framework to identify and analyse the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities,  and Threats for a particular topic or entity.  18 For other ways of categorising methods, see: Jack & Saritas, Ozcan. (2011). Science and technology foresight baker's dozen: A pocket  primer of comparative and combined foresight methods. foresight. 13. 79-96.  19 The methods used in foresight are difficult to classify into mutually exclusive categories. The categories oftentimes overlap content-wise  and tend to be divided differently in various publications.  20 Here “environment” refers to circumstances and context - not an ecological environment.  21 Weak signals are the initial indications of a significant trend or change.  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  November 2021  14  Each of the above frameworks enables the systematic evaluation of the characteristics,  developments, and influences in the listed domains to get an understanding of the environment.  There are also other variations of these frameworks that take other domains into account – the  choice of method or domain should be based on an initial analysis of the given subject.  3.2.3 Trend Analysis  A trend is defined as a tendency of a development over time, or an emerging pattern of change  that commonly influences large social groups.22 Trend analysis methods usually serve  prognostic or diagnostic intentions.  Trends can be analysed in many ways – for instance, by means of literature reviews,  bibliometrics, text-mining, patent analyses, and trend impact analyses, among others. These  methods identify current or emerging trends and typically explore the cause, potential impact,  probability, and speed of occurrence of those trends.23  Further methods used to analyse trends include:   Causal Layered Analysis – Supports the identification of driving forces by gaining  insight into participants’ perceptions such as world views, values, and cultural norms   Trend Radars – provides a cross-industry view of emerging and already existing  trends within the target environment   Trend Impact Analysis – analysis of the impact of one or more possible events on the  extrapolation of a trend into the future.   Horizon Scanning – Systematic monitoring of current trends as well as the  identification of new, relevant developments in a particular area through a creative  process of collective sense-making.  3.2.4 Expert Group Foresight  Expert group foresight covers a variety of methods, where a group (or a crowd) of participants  provides input on the issue under study. The best-known members of the expert group foresight  family are the Delphi method and expert panels. In both, experts share their insights about the  future. The Delphi method however involves a more structured communication method to elicit  answers from experts. Experts are usually involved to support a foresight project with its  prognostic or prescriptive intentions.  Delphi is an explorative method based on a structured and iterative group communication  between subject matter experts expressing judgements on the chosen topic. In the first  sequence, various experts in a particular field are surveyed separately about a specific topic or  question. Afterwards, their anonymized contributions are collected, and experts are asked to  provide feedback to the collected insights. To reach a consensus, this process would be  repeated multiple times. This approach helps to avoid groupthink and therefore tends to  generate more creative ideas from a variety of perspectives. The entire process can be  conducted remotely, which makes it easier to engage a more diverse expert group from all over  the world. This method can be time-consuming, especially when there are multiple iterations.  Japan’s National Institute of Science and Technology Policy (NISTEP) conducts foresight  exercises approximately every five years, most of which rely on a large Delphi study with  approximately 2000 participants.24  22 See efp, Megatrend / Trend / Driver / Issue, 2010, http://www.foresight-platform.eu/community/forlearn/how-to-do- foresight/methods/analysis/megatrend-trend-driver-issue/  23 See GCPSE, Foresight – The Manual, UNDP Global Centre for Public Service Excellence, Singapore, 2014.  24 Please see https://www.nistep.go.jp/en/?page_id=56  http://www.foresight-platform.eu/community/forlearn/how-to-do-foresight/methods/analysis/megatrend-trend-driver-issue/ http://www.foresight-platform.eu/community/forlearn/how-to-do-foresight/methods/analysis/megatrend-trend-driver-issue/ https://www.nistep.go.jp/en/?page_id=56  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  November 2021  15  Other examples of expert group-based methods include:   Aggregated Judgements / Group-based Forecast – logically combines multiple  individual judgements into consistent and collective judgements.   Key Technology Study (Technology Forecasting) – applies sets of criteria to critical  technological developments in order to enable informed assessments  Note that there are also crowd or participatory foresight methods, in which inputs are solicited  from non-experts.  3.2.5 Scenario Methods  Scenario methods are some of the most used and well-known prognostic methods in foresight.  They are used as exploratory tools to think about possible, desired or undesired futures rather  than to predict a single future in detail. These methods can also be used to simulate and test  various solutions prior to determining an optimal strategy. Usually, more than one possible  future is explored to support decision-making that avoids potential challenges and pitfalls.  Scenario generation is typically preceded by a diagnostic phase that allows for the informed  consideration of key factors that can impact the future of the issue at hand. Thinking about  multiple possible futures raises awareness of various factors that may affect the future; this  knowledge enables the development of more flexible, future-proof, adaptive strategies.  Scenarios can be approached with various methods, for example:   Gaming – devising games or roleplay scenarios to test possible strategies or solutions  by identifying possible reactions to and consequences of their implementation.   Visioning – looking to the ideal future to create a strategy to achieve specific goals.   Cross Impact Analysis – evaluates the likelihood of specific future events occurring  by assessing probability of other events occurring and then exploring their mutual  relationship.  3.2.6 Morphological Analysis and Backcasting  This category covers methods that are not typically associated but share the same two  characteristics - a prescriptive foresight intention and focus on event regression and system  decomposition. Regression analysis in foresight follows a similar approach to statistical  regression analysis. However, regression analysis in foresight works with qualitative data and  subjective opinion, as opposed to quantitative methods to identify events and event triggers that  may lead to a predicted future event.25 Decomposition, on the other hand, seeks to break down  complex systems into smaller parts to facilitate analysis of its components, the dynamics  governing the interaction of components and the effect they have on the system.  Morphological Analysis is a creative, heuristic, normative method that supports the  exploration of complex problems and possible solutions using a multi-dimensional matrix. It is a  time-consuming group exercise that requires facilitation.26  Backcasting is another normative method that centres a selected scenario of a desirable (or  undesirable) future. The participants then move backwards in time to identify the decisions or  events that need to take place to transform that selected scenario into reality. Through  25 https://hbr.org/2015/11/a-refresher-on-regression-analysis  26 Jackson, M., Practical Foresight Guide, 2013.  https://hbr.org/2015/11/a-refresher-on-regression-analysis  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  November 2021  16  backcasting, organizations can plan which actions they should take and evaluate potential  consequences. It raises awareness of the fact that the future is determined by many factors and  that different actions lead to various alternative outcomes.27  Threatcasting is a multi-stage method that involves envisioning an unwanted future, then  reconstructing steps and decisions that need to be taken to prevent that future from occurring. It  was designed primarily for analysing military futures. Threatcasting combines many foresight  methods including Delphi, science fiction prototyping, backcasting, and scenario modelling. This  method has a defined time horizon – each activity is designed to look forward 10 years into the  future.28  Other methods included in this category are:   Technology Sequence Analysis – generates probable timelines for technology  releases by analysing estimates of the time required for intermediate technical steps   Roadmapping – produces a document that defines the steps and milestones  necessary to obtain a desired future   Multi-criteria Analysis – compares possible identified solutions against a weighted  set of assessment criteria.   Synectics – promotes new and creative ways of thinking by, for example, imagining a  chosen problem in an unusual, unconnected environment  3.2.7 Cybersecurity Analysis Methods  As a discipline, cybersecurity often assesses risk and potential future threats, incidents and  crisis scenarios. These methods are all variations of risk assessment techniques. Each is  slightly different in terms of focus (e.g., on the threat actor or on visualization) but all aim  towards identifying and prioritizing risk and subsequently responding to that risk. The methods  in this category can be used for diagnosis, prognosis, or prescription.  Below are a few well-established methods for risk analysis and threat modelling.   Threat Agent Risk Assessment (TARA)29 – a threat-based risk assessment method  used to identify, assess, and prioritise risks. It takes threat actors, their motivations,  and possible methods into account.   Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation (OCTAVE)30 – a  comprehensive evaluation method to identify, rank, and manage cybersecurity risks.   Threat Modelling31 – a conceptual analysis technique used for identifying potential  vulnerabilities and developing measures in the early stages of application or service  development. There are many frameworks and methods for threat modelling,32 one  such method is Attack Trees.33 Attack Trees support the formulation of trees of  possible techniques that may help an attacker achieve their objectives.  27 Jackson, M., Practical Foresight Guide, 2013.  28 Vanatta, N., Johnson, B.

SELECTION CRITERIA  The first step of any foresight activity is scoping; during this phase the person or group  responsible for the activity defines key objectives and reviews the context of the activity. Once  completed, they may consider the following key criteria to narrow down the choice of foresight  methods, tools, and/or frameworks.   Target outcomes and deliverables – which methods, tools, and/or frameworks will  most likely produce the required effects on stakeholders? Which will most likely  produce the deliverables expected from the foresight activity?   Foresight intention – Consider the foresight intentions described in 3.1 for each step  of the planned activity. Is the objective to diagnose a current state, or to prognose or  prescribe a future state? The selection of methods must be based on suitability to the  underlying objectives of the foresight activity.   Future handling approach – Should your activity be more responsive or normative?  Is the objective to prepare to respond to events or shape futures?   Time horizon – The time horizon is the point in the future that targeted by the foresight  activity. Which methods, tools, and/or frameworks can be implemented to diagnose or  prognose events, or prescribe handling options, for the fixed point in time which will be  evaluated during the activity?   Activity timeframe – Which methods can be completed within the timeline set for the  execution of the foresight activity? Are there tools or frameworks that could support the  on-track and timely execution of the activity?   Required resources/skills – What access does the project have to administrative  support, data available on the subject, expert participants, financial resources, etc.?  Multiple experts emphasized that the choice of method highly depends on the context of the  exercise, including the following more abstract criteria:   Clarity of desired outcomes – Any ambiguity towards desired outcomes must be  clearly addressed before method selection. The methods that are applied must help  produce outcomes that are useful and usable for the project’s key stakeholders.   Participant Group – All methods must consider the unique characteristics of the  participant group; they should enable maximum engagement, capacity for creative  thinking, and transparent communication. If the participants are already known to the  organizer, key factors to analyse include existing or expected group dynamics,  personalities, roles, and areas of interest.   Publicity – If one goal of the foresight activity is to generate publicity, scenario  modelling techniques are usually favoured because they are the most attention-  grabbing and easiest to describe. However, the findings of the activity may be  misrepresented by the press, which may undermine the diplomatic process or other  relationships with stakeholders.  These facets should be evaluated for each foresight  activity.  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  November 2021  18   Experience – Experts from the Working Group stated that when they use methods  they are familiar with (as opposed to methods unfamiliar to them), the activities  progress more smoothly and tend to generate more dynamism and interaction.  Nonetheless, the benefits that the facilitator may gain from familiarity should be  secondary to selecting methods that support the objectives of the exercise.  4.1 FORESIGHT METHOD COMPARISON  The following table presents a selection of methods, along with their selection criteria and core  characteristics. The selection includes methods that are either commonly used, innovative,  and/or especially useful to address ENISA’s foresight needs.  In this table, we have categorized  methods by the overarching categories described in the previous chapter, the foresight  “intention” that the method would support, and a categorization of each method’s usual future-  handling approach (responsive or normative). Other factors included in the table are estimated  time needed for each method, special resources required, and overall aim of the method.

This section provides a non-exhaustive overview of the types of  tools available. While some are efforts to “digitalise” foresight, others simply enhance the in-  person foresight experience. When selecting tools for a specific foresight activity, we recommend  reviewing other possible sources as there are some tools designed for a specific audience or  context.  Workshop Facilitation Tools  These tools and techniques are often used by workshop facilitators to ease communication in  workshops or to elicit creative ideas from participants. Some well-known examples are:   Brainstorming, where participants are encouraged to generate large amount of raw,  spontaneous ideas, while getting inspired by the ideas of other participants, without  being subjected to immediate judgement.   World Café, where a large group of participants can discuss various questions in a  structured way, in rounds, within smaller groups, and note down their ideas on large  sheet of paper for the remaining groups to see and serve as reference.   Mind mapping, a technique of graphic facilitation to help visually organize collected  information.  There are now a few digital databases that provide information on foresight-relevant tools. One  source for identifying additional foresight-relevant tools is the website Service Design Tools64  which describes and organizes tools based on the stage of the design process, stakeholders and  participants, the aim of the activity, and desired visualization methods. Other resources include  the Futures Platform,65 the Governance Futures Toolkit,66 and Teach the Future67 (which aims to  provide educators tools to integrate foresight into their curricula.)  Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Based Tools  AI-based tools may assist foresight activities like assessment of the current environment, trend  analysis, or trend extrapolation. While not ubiquitous, these tools are now often integrated into  the foresight process.68 AI software can be especially helpful for text-mining and analysing large  datasets, for instance to identify terms and phrases possibly indicative of emerging or future  trends or to support a literature review. Natural Language Processing is typically used for these  activities. AI-based tools may also support the selection of scenarios.  Collaboration Tools & Foresight / Trend Databases  To better facilitate foresight exercises, many experts recommend the use of collaboration tools  (such as digital whiteboards and note-taking apps), as well as research databases for desktop  research and trend recognition. It is important to note that within the expert community existing  radar databases and foresight information sources are not always trusted. These sources rarely  publish details on the information gathering and preparation process, therefore the experts  interviewed typically rely on their own research or primary sources to determine trend-related  information.  64 POLI.design and Oblo, Service Design Tools, Tools, https://servicedesigntools.org/tools  65 https://www.futuresplatform.com/product  66 https://www.iftf.org/uploads/media/GovFuturesLab_Toolkit.pdf  67 https://www.teachthefuture.org/  68 Kayser, Victoria, and Knut Blind. \"Extending the knowledge base of foresight: The contribution of text mining.\" Technological Forecasting  and Social Change 116 (2017): 208-215.  https://servicedesigntools.org/tools https://www.futuresplatform.com/product https://www.iftf.org/uploads/media/GovFuturesLab_Toolkit.pdf https://www.teachthefuture.org/  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  Draft | Version 0.3 | November 2021  25  Conferencing Tools  Conferencing tools are often used to involve participants from various geographic regions. They  are extremely helpful for bringing together a diverse group of participants. However, we  hypothesize that there is also a downside to using these tools. Participants may be less able to  fully devote their attention to online meetings (as opposed to in-person workshops) due to the  reduced interactivity of remote workshops and the fact that some individuals may be tempted to  multitask or to join other meetings. Additionally, there may be varying levels of digital literacy  within a group – due to a lack of technical skills and familiarity, some participants may not be able  to fully and confidently participate while using a conferencing tool.  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  Draft | Version 0.3 | November 2021  26  5. BEST PRACTICES  This chapter lays out best practices for planning and conducting foresight activities. The findings  are primarily drawn from interviews but also include salient points from the literature review.  5.1 SUMMARY OF BEST PRACTICES  Scoping & Administration  Scoping is a critical step in the foresight process 69. Whenever possible, it is recommended to  identify a foresight organizer that has experience running foresight workshops and projects. In the  initial scoping phase, the organizer begins to define objectives, foresight intention, time horizon,  future handling approach, timeframe, required resources, etc. It is important to ensure that the  objectives can be reached with the provided budget and resources.  In this stage of the project, the objectives of the activity should be well-defined (e.g., desired  outcome, target audience, time horizon, stakeholders, key deliverables, communication and  dissemination, etc.). It is also helpful to define objectives for each method or workshop - e.g.,  define a question for each STEEP factor.  In order to ensure maximum engagement, consider participant availability and key organizational  or environmental milestones. For example, it is best to not plan events around times when  participants are likely to be away on holiday. Furthermore, if the results of the foresight activity  need to be provided to a key decision-maker, ensure that the findings can be delivered prior to  major strategic meetings or events.  Finally, given that many foresight activities are regularly repeated, it is important to review results  throughout the foresight project and at its conclusion. This provides an opportunity to learn how to  improve future foresight activities.  Method selection  Since foresight activities rarely have straightforward goals or standardised outcomes, methods  cannot be applied “out-of-the-box”. Often, the methods to be used for an activity must be adapted  to the goal and the scope of the activity, the context of the challenge, and even the participants  involved. Foresight experts often see methods more as a frame of reference, which helps them to  structure the activities.  Experts noted that creating a logical flow or frame for each foresight exercise, such as Design  Thinking,70 helps to focus on outcomes and to deliver a clear and concise plan. The frame may  take the form of a modular building block approach, in which a variety of smaller blocks, each with  a different focus (and method) are selected.  The methods mentioned in the example frame below demonstrate the range of possible methods  - from foresight-specific (threatcasting) to more generic (role play). Frames can be grounded in  existing frameworks or be simple process flows, like this illustrative one:  69 A detailed description of the scoping process is provided by the EU Foresight Platform: http://www.foresight- platform.eu/community/forlearn/how-to-do-foresight/process/outcomes/  70 Design Thinking is a user-centric problem-solving approach. For more information see: https://www.interaction- design.org/literature/topics/design-thinking  http://www.foresight-platform.eu/community/forlearn/how-to-do-foresight/process/outcomes/ http://www.foresight-platform.eu/community/forlearn/how-to-do-foresight/process/outcomes/ https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/design-thinking https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/design-thinking  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  Draft | Version 0.3 | November 2021  27   understanding today (e.g., stakeholder or agent mapping/analysis, PESTLE71),   detecting and defining changes (e.g., weak signals, trend analysis),   articulating visions and futures into a coherent scenario (e.g., through scenario modelling:  stories, visuals, roleplays) and   analysing this future (e.g., threatcasting, scenario analysis, SWOT) to prepare  recommendations.  In a well-designed foresight project, methods are carefully selected to form a diverse composition  that best serves the objectives of the particular project and its participants.  By using a frame, the  objectives are well-defined, but the methods can be easily switched out as needed. The use of  several methods allows for a range of topics to be addressed and increases the likelihood that each  participant will provide pertinent input, thus eliciting the best outcomes for a foresight project.  Duration of foresight projects  The length of foresight activities is very versatile. They tend to span from four weeks up to one year  and in some cases longer than a year. These longer-term activities are often used for continuous  strategic planning but are less active and intense than shorter exercises. Long-term foresight is  often assigned to a specific organizational role that is tasked with staying on top of new trends and  deriving useful conclusions from that research. In these cases, work would also likely be divided  into smaller, time-bound exercises.  For scenario modelling enthusiasts, there is a clear correlation between time invested and  granularity (level of detail) of the scenarios. The main driver of this increase in granularity or quality  of scenarios over time is introspective activity. Typically, a participant’s capacity to understand the  underlying systemic structure and possible evolutions or emergences increases over time;  therefore, participants must be given sufficient time for introspection in order to ensure high-quality  results.  A high level of granularity is often difficult to achieve in foresight activities, particularly for public  sector actors, as scoping is particularly challenging at a national or regional level.72 It is however  possible to create valuable foresight results in a shorter time period. For example, in a crisis  preparedness or response scenario, foresight can support a quick turnaround of actionable  information; it will just not be as detailed as projects with more time and resources.  Participant Selection and Engagement  If possible, it is critical to ensure the involvement of the project’s key stakeholders (e.g., the Head  of Strategy) throughout the entire foresight process, including in smaller workshops. Delivering  reports and outcomes at the end of the exercise is not as impactful for the readers as direct  participation. In such a case, the findings of the exercise are less likely to be acted upon.  To ensure high-quality, well-rounded outcomes, a diverse group of individuals should be selected  for participation. Diversity in this context will depend on the topic being analysed but may cover  expertise, political affiliation, national origin or nationality, race, social class, gender, organizational  role, age, etc. Ideally, all affected populations should be involved and represented in a foresight  exercise.  Beyond the diversity of the group, it is also recommended to evaluate group dynamics when  selecting participants. Characteristics that may be important to consider are shyness, ability to  tolerate imperfection or lack of clarity, ability to express oneself in a group, power dynamics, etc.  71 Note that there is the risk of investing too much time in this “understanding today” step of the process as participants may be more likely  to believe that future outcomes will be analogous to the past. While information about past and current events or evolutions can be  beneficial, they do not provide any indication that the future will follow similar patterns.  72 Glod, F., Duprel, C., & Keenan, M. (2009). Foresight for science and technology priority setting in a small country: The case of  Luxembourg. Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 21(8), 933-951.  Selecting a  diverse  participant group  for foresight  activities actively  improves the  group’s capacity  for creativity and  ability to observe  all facets of a  topic.  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  Draft | Version 0.3 | November 2021  28  Consideration of this factor helps to ensure that the exercise remains productive and maximizes  the engagement of all participants.  It may furthermore be beneficial to include generalists with a broad range of expertise as  participants, as they can more easily provide a variety of perspectives. Likewise, it is often very  important to include a participant with a strong legal background that can support the group in  understanding the present, and likely future, legal constraints.  Communication & Engagement  Prior to the exercise, participants should be provided information such as: the goals of the exercise,  the purpose of foresight (both in general and for the specific situation), the major components of  the chosen method(s), and background on the specific topic, including any commonly used  terminology that is crucial to the project (e.g., cybersecurity terms). If possible, the participants  should be involved at the beginning of the activity in order to actively participate in shaping the  project.  When communicating with a group of participants with varying areas of expertise, it has proven  helpful to focus on outcomes over approach. Foresight is very rarely a person’s full-time  occupation, hence the need to provide the essential information without going into any unnecessary  detail.  By giving participants a clear understanding of their role in the overall project, the exercise leaders  are better able to manage any false assumptions and encourage a more unified participant group.  Time Horizon  Time horizon, the time frame a foresight activity aims to analyse, may be classified as short-term  or emerging (0-5 years), mid-term (5-10 years), or long-term (10+ years). Definitions for time  horizons do not always break down into these neat categories; we have adopted this categorization  for the sake of clarity.  The choice of time horizon depends primarily on:   the specific use case (e.g., climate change vs new technology)   target objective (e.g., create a strategic plan, prepare response options)   industry (fast moving (tech) vs long-term thinking (infrastructure))   external factors (e.g., what is commonly reported on at your organization)   and organizational or regional culture (are the participants accustomed to future-oriented  thinking?).  The choice of time horizon should be tailored to each individual activity; nonetheless there are  some notable characteristics for each time horizon to take into consideration.  While working with short-term time horizons, exercise participants tend to envision the future much  like a simple linear extension of the present, and often have a hard time stepping outside of their  own cognitive biases to envision futures different from the present (or commonly held expectations  of the future.)  Long-term horizons allow people to free up their minds, but the plausible futures are very complex  and speculative, as many factors need to be evaluated and weighed against one another. There is  also often a lack of reliable data sources to support the participants’ understanding of the distant  future. Long-term time horizons are often used to move towards specific objectives – defining short-  term responses that are likely to result in the intended consequence.  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  Draft | Version 0.3 | November 2021  29  Mid-term perspectives seem to allow enough flexibility for participants to envision alternative  futures that differ from the present, thus enabling the creation of creative strategies and near-term  action plans.  5.2 SUMMARY OF CHALLENGES AND PITFALLS  Data Quality and Quantity  Accurate data may facilitate more reliable foresight results. Nonetheless, data is always  backward-looking; any conclusions drawn from historical data should be evaluated for  applicability to the future. In many cases there is a surplus of data, an analysis of which would  overextend available resources and overwhelm the participants with data that is still, after all, from  the past. Too much data may also restrict participants in their ability to participate creatively in the  foresight workshops. Other times, the data is either insufficient, or what is available is  unstructured, or potentially unreliable. In some technology-focused foresight activities, the  participants’ ability to consider ongoing innovations is limited due to lack of available information  (often driven by concerns of intellectual property theft.) While this is to be expected, it can also  negatively impact the outcomes of an activity. Moreover, one expert in the Working Group outlined  four types of counterfactual information that may affect data reliability: gossip or rumours, fake  news, rewriting of historical events, and frozen conflicts. These in turn often affect foresight  exercises by warping the quality of the information and render fact-based consensus unlikely.  Participant Engagement  Regardless of how carefully participant groups are selected, there are often cases when chosen  individuals do not fully participate in exercises or questionnaires. It is also difficult to get some  participants to open up, think outside of the box, and embrace imperfection – all of which are critical  for successful foresight activities. As mentioned above, however, these challenges may be  minimized by clear presentation of the ultimate objectives and context of the exercise.  Cybersecurity-specific Challenges  Cybersecurity-specific foresight tends to focus heavily on specific technology and operational  measures, limiting the ability to see strategically across the environment. Likewise, “game-  changing innovations” are rarely easy to predict, but pivotal for assessing emerging and future  cybersecurity threats. This is further complicated by the often confidential nature of the  cybersecurity industry; experts may face a conflict of interest when supporting foresight activities.  The current shortage of cybersecurity professionals may also be a challenge when planning and  performing a foresight activity.  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  Draft | Version 0.3 | November 2021  30  6. APPLICATION USE CASES  This section presents optional roadmaps for seven use cases identified by ENISA. The use cases  represent a sample of how ENISA may apply foresight in the future. As mentioned in previous  sections, the design of a foresight activity must reflect the reality of the contextual situation,  resources, participants, etc. The processes proposed in this chapter are intended as a guide – in  practice, the methods may need to be switched out or workshops added, for example.  The use cases approaches described in the following chapter include:  1. Identification of future and emerging  challenges  2. Strategic decision-making development  3. Evolution of threat landscape  4. Needs and priorities for cybersecurity R&D  5. Evolution of operational cooperation  6. Identification of future policy  priorities  7. Disruptive events  6.1 OPERATIONAL CONTEXT  To better understand how foresight would be applied within ENISA, we held a workshop to identify  major functions that would benefit from foresight. As a result, we mapped out a high-level structure  of how foresight findings would flow between key functions within ENISA. This helped to identify  dependencies between the use cases.  Figure 7: Understanding of ENISA’s Operational Context  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  Draft | Version 0.3 | November 2021  31  While ENISA’s work is more of a continuous cycle, this depiction shows how the identification of  emerging challenges and threats supports many activities such as strategy development,  prioritizing research topics, and preparing recommendations for stakeholders. The use cases  defined for each phase build upon one another, to maintain a continuous and sustainable  information flow between organizational units and functions.  The use cases defined under each phase of the process are indicative - the activities and the  deliverables are subject to ENISA’s standard operating model and procedures, as well as the  CSA (Cybersecurity Act), the main regulation that defines the mandate of ENISA.  6.2 OVERARCHING COMPONENTS AND CONSIDERATIONS  We have highlighted here some components common to all use cases.  Inception Phase & Scoping: Each activity must begin with the identification of scope, objectives,  and stakeholders – it is critical to the success of the activity.   Define the scope of the exercise (including contextual information such as the pertinent  industry or EU scope).   Identify and involve all stakeholders as early in the process as is possible. Expert  Working Groups take time to put together (estimated min. 2 months), and many internal  stakeholders may need to participate in multiple foresight activities.  Engaging with Participants: As these use cases often take place over a year, there is a chance  that the participants will lose focus and interest in the activity.   We recommend either maintaining frequent and regular contact with the participants or,   Present an overview of the project’s objectives and current findings before each part of  the activity.  Tools: Some tools are needed for all use cases, such as:   Video conferencing software   Collaborative documentation tools (Confluence73, Saga.so74, Notion.so75, etc.)  Resources: Where possible, the process recommended for each use case should build upon and  make use of other foresight activities and reports.  73 Please see https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence  74 Please see https://saga.so/  75 Please see https://www.notion.so/  https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence https://saga.so/ https://www.notion.so/  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  Draft | Version 0.3 | November 2021  32  6.3 IDENTIFICATION OF FUTURE AND EMERGING CHALLENGES (1)  Each year ENISA works on reports identifying the future and emerging challenges relevant to their  stakeholders. The reports themselves are used in many other aspects of ENISA’s operations,  therefore they must be both credible and actionable.  Category Description  Objective  Produce an overview of emerging trends and challenges  that will impact security (report)  Time Horizon 3 -5 years  Collaborating  Stakeholders  ENISA Working Group & Broader Public  Target Audience  General public, policymakers, cybersecurity professionals  Impact on Target  Audience  Stay up to date on future and emerging challenges; think  critically about the future  Level of Granularity General trends, directions, and topics.  Time to Conduct  Exercise  1 year  Dependencies Other ENISA activities rely on this study  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  Draft | Version 0.3 | November 2021  33  6.3.1 Foresight Approach  # Process Step Detailed Description  Recommended  Methods & Tools  1  Analyse current relevant  social, technological,  economic, environmental  and political events.  Collect information on emerging trends and challenges from a variety of sources including, for example,  market research firms, think tanks, academic publications, foresight research, etc. The STEEP method  should be applied to ensure the comprehensiveness of the research itself. Research and findings are to  be shared amongst participants and experts for feedback. If ENISA is conducting its own data analysis,  Trend Intra- & Extrapolation may be used to project future outcomes based on historical data. This will be  the most time-intensive step.  STEEP  PESTLE  Literature Review  Trend Interpolation &  Extrapolation  Desk Research  2  Identify and document  possible change events and  future states.  Gather internal and external (expert) stakeholders to conduct a brainstorming workshop. In the workshop,  all participants will write down change events and systemic emergences that they have noticed or have  studied for each category (STEEP). The group discusses the results, adds findings from the desk  research, and together creates a shortlist of trends to investigate further. The trends are divided amongst  participants to collect further information.  Brainstorming  3  Identify and document  driving forces of change for  the predicted events in  each PESTLE category.  To identify a driving force of change, analyse all the events which have been brainstormed in the previous  phase and locate causal dependencies amongst them. Relationships or dependencies between events  should not only have a cause-and-effect nature. The analysis should include the technologies, social  attitudes, political positions and actors or interest groups acting as facilitators or perpetrators of the events.  The workshop(s) should rely on an expert group composed of a diverse range of participants (e.g.,  cybersecurity professionals, economists, psychologists, sociologists, etc.).  Causal Layered  Analysis (CLA)  4  Identify cybersecurity topics  related to drivers and  change events in each  PESTLE category.  Based on the information generated during previous steps, experts participating in the workshop must  identify cybersecurity related topics. This is performed by looking at the current environment, the predicted  evolutions or change events, driving forces for the changes, and possible end states through the lens of  cybersecurity.  Brainstorming  5  Categorize and prioritize  topics and drivers based on  speed of evolution and  impact on cybersecurity.  After gathering relevant cybersecurity topics in step 4, an internal working group of ENISA experts should  review, complement and categorize the topics. The categorization narrows the focus of the ENISA team to  only relevant topics. From there, the team may derive future activities such as further exploration, training  exercises, policy recommendations, etc.  Participatory Design  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  Draft | Version 0.3 | November 2021  34  6.4 STRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING DEVELOPMENT (2)  ENISA relies on solid, fact-based strategic decision-making to decide how to allocate resources,  plan future activities, and identify areas of development. Foresight activities enable the leadership  to design a strategy that can manage future challenges.  Category Description  Objective  Guide the strategic planning process to validate the  assumptions and the level of ambition; review principles,  priorities and requirements for the Agency to realise its  vision and fulfil its mission.

Using the Future & Emerging Challenges and Threat Landscape reports as a basis, initiate a focused desk  research phase structured by the STEEP analysis. During this phase, the emphasis would be identifying  any developments that have emerged since the workshops conducted as part of other use cases.  Research and findings are to be shared amongst participants and experts for feedback.  STEEP  PESTLE  Literature Review  2  Review the documentation  and explore additional  scenarios which may be  desired, disruptive and/or  likely to happen.  Scenario Planning: Based on the information collected in Step 1, identify possible futures that ENISA  would be a part of. The focus should be on very disruptive or probable futures; this ensures that the  resulting strategy is flexible enough to accommodate many possible outcomes. In this step, the  participants would create a rather long list of potential scenarios that would be shortlisted in the next step.  Expert Workshop: Scenarios produced in the previous step should be reviewed with the expert group to  identify clusters which warrant further exploration, based on their potential for disruption or likeliness of  emergence. Within an internal ENISA group, a desired future should be selected that can guide strategic  initiatives.  Scenario Method  Brainstorming  3  Model relevant scenarios of  the future.  It is recommended that relevant scenarios or clusters be modelled at this point, exploring different aspects  such as PESTLE or STEEP context and situation, day-to-day experience for actors living in the future  scenario, group or individual motivations, desires and needs, consumption habits, etc. The scenarios can  be further explored with the expert group by engaging in iterative design practices through a series of  workshops, improving the level of granularity of the descriptions and the understanding the experts  develop on the future state.  Scenario Method  4  Define a normative vision of  ENISA for these futures.  Create a normative vision: Hold a workshop to identify ENISA’s ideal role in shaping the desired future(s).  Using the modelled scenarios, identify the role that ENISA wants to play in each of the chosen futures.  How does that look and how does it reflect to ENISA’s core values and mandate? What are ENISA’s  responsibilities in this alternate future?  Scenario Method  Visioning  Backcasting  5  Backcast initiatives required  to reach the normative  vision.  In a workshop with internal stakeholders (and external consultants as needed), brainstorm possible  initiatives to reach the normative vision. For example, how would ENISA fulfil its mandate in such a future?  What steps would ENISA need to take now to help shape the situation towards the desired future? It is  important to remember that the identified tasks and initiatives need to allow for the possibility that another,  more disruptive, future may arrive.  Backcasting  6  Define an evolution  roadmap and complete the  strategy with guidelines and  principles.  Prioritize and organize the initiatives needed to achieve and accommodate alternate futures. Based on the  roadmap identify common themes and guiding principles to support the strategy. Incorporate both  overarching themes and specific initiatives into the strategic document.  Roadmapping  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  Draft | Version 0.3 | November 2021  36  6.5 EVOLUTION OF THREAT LANDSCAPE (3)  Each year, ENISA publishes their analyses on the European threat landscape. 77  This is an  important aspect of much of ENISA’s work as the most prevalent threats may also drive the  Agency’s priorities and strategy.  Category Description  Objective  Produce an overview and analysis on emerging threats and  drivers, to inform the general public and cybersecurity  professionals.

Environmental Scanning: Initiate a short desk research phase focused on security event and incident  reports, as well as cybersecurity threat analyses from the previous year. Research and findings are to be  shared amongst participants and experts for feedback. Other tools such as data mining may be used to  identify threat methods or attack vectors that are on the rise.  Expert Panel: Alongside the Context Gathering step, gather a diverse group of experts to provide input on  potential threats. The Expert Panel (typically 12-20 people) may be divided into groups based on areas of  expertise or focused on a particular threat category (e.g., ransomware attacks). This could be a longer  phase (>3 months) or shorter, depending on the timeline of the project and resources available.  Desk Research  PESTLE  Expert Panel  2  Identify drivers for actors  and threats.  Expert Workshop: For the identification of the underlying causes of threats and motivations of threat  actors, a diverse group of participants should be assembled, including profiles such as psychologists,  sociologists, economists, technology experts, cybersecurity enthusiasts, etc. The participants should use  tools such as personas and empathy maps to understand the motivations of the threat actors, as well as  their ultimate goals.  Stakeholder Mapping  Personas  Empathy Map  Causal Layered  Analysis  3  Trend Analysis: Identify and  document possible change  events and future states.  Combining desk research and workshop format (Trend Mapping), the participants would identify change  events that are impacting the major threats and threat actors. These should be distinct from threat events  (i.e., the rise of insider threat would not be a change event, rather that the COVID-19 pandemic weakened  social ties within organizations).  Trend Mapping  Brainstorming  Mind maps  4  Identify and document  future threats.  Threat Identification and Comparison: This activity may then be extended by the Threat Agent Risk  Assessment (TARA) method.78 The participants will compare their research and structure it into lists of  threat actors, attacker objectives, and attack methods. This method offers a way of getting an overview of  threat actors, their objectives, and attack methods and narrowing it down to the most high-risk or novel  threats. The TARA method is typically used to assess the major risks to an organization, country, etc. but it  may also be used to identify how new methods or change events may lead to novel threats.  TARA  Thought  Experimenting  Desk Research  5  Propose and document  recommendations.  In a workshop with cybersecurity professionals, categorize and prioritize threats. Obtain feedback in  iterative rounds.  Participatory Design  78 Threatcasting was not recommended purely because it is designed for a time horizon of 10 years. For more information on TARA, see Rosenquist, M., Prioritizing Information Security Risks with Threat  Agent Risk Assessment, Intel Information Technology, USA, 2009.  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  Draft | Version 0.3 | November 2021  38  6.6 NEEDS AND PRIORITIES FOR CYBERSECURITY R&D (4)  ENISA provides a valuable service by identifying areas within the field of cybersecurity in need of  development. This use case builds on the previous three to reach a greater degree of granularity.  Research and development may also inform future strategic decision-making or may serve as  inputs for environmental scanning.

During this phase the emphasis would be identifying any trends, threat  actors, or technologies that were not covered in the Challenges Report. Research and findings are to be  shared amongst participants and experts for feedback. If ENISA is conducting its own data analysis, Trend  Interpolation & Extrapolation may be used to project future outcomes based on historical data.  STEEP  Trend Interpolation &  Extrapolation  Bibliometrics  Text Mining  Literature Review  2  Identify and document  possible change events and  systemic emergences.  Gather internal and external (expert) stakeholders. In a workshop, all participants will write down change  events and systemic emergences that they have noticed or have studied for each category (STEEP).  Afterwards they should: discuss results of the workshop, incorporate desk research findings, shortlist  trends to investigate, and delegate trend research to participants.  Scenario Method  Expert Panel  Brainstorming  Desk Research  3  Identify driving forces for  possible change events and  emergences.  To identify a driving force of change, analyse the events brainstormed in the previous phase with a diverse  expert group and locate causal dependencies amongst them.  Personas  Causal Layered  Analysis  4  Transform driving forces  into bipolar factors and  combine to identify  alternate futures.  Once the driving forces have been identified, the project team should define bipolar factors for each driver  (desk research or internal workshop.) A bipolar factor is a construct based on a driving force, stating an  “either/or” outcome in the future. For example, if the driving force is “general social desire to optimize the  ownership of assets”, then the bipolar factor should focus on attitudes towards possession, with full or  partial ownership or full usership (full transformation of social paradigm) as possible outcomes.  By defining a series of bipolar factors and using a combinatorial approach, a scenario modelling team can  create a set of scenarios, based on the “either/or” outcomes defined for each bipolar factor. For example, if  an exercise has defined two bipolar factors, a total of 4 scenarios would be created.  Scenario Method  Bipolar Factors  5  Identify, explore and model  highly relevant scenarios.  The scenarios should then be reviewed with the expert group to identify clusters that warrant further  exploration based on their potential for disruption or likeliness of emergence. Model the relevant scenarios  or clusters, exploring different aspects the environmental context and situation, day-to-day experience for  actors living in the future scenario, group or individual motivations, desires and needs, consumption habits,  etc. The scenarios can be further explored through iterative design workshops that increase the level of  granularity of the descriptions and experts’ understandings of the future.  Scenario Method  6  Identify relevant  cybersecurity topics and  drivers in most relevant  scenarios.  Part of the scenario modelling exercise should also focus on the cybersecurity aspects governing the  future state. Topics such as technologies, threats, threat actors, etc. should be regularly explored. Existing  threat landscapes (see Use Case 3) can be used as input.  Threat Modelling  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  Draft | Version 0.3 | November 2021  40  7  Prioritize topics and drivers  based on cross-scenario  frequency.  ENISA stakeholders should then review the modelled scenarios to canvas for relevant topics from a  cybersecurity point of view. The analysis can be performed by identifying topics which have a high  frequency and impact across several scenarios.  Scenario (2x2) Matrix  8  Review current research  and identify gaps.  Review ENISA strategy and research topics currently in focus.

The evolution of operational cooperation must consider a variety  of factors that are constantly shifting. Integrating foresight into this process will help to understand  the possible futures of operational cooperation.

In those cases, it is prudent to have a structured process with  which to generate possible outcomes. This supports decision-makers and brings additional clarity  to entities that may need to support in such a crisis situation.

CONCLUSIONS & NEXT STEPS  7.1 CONCLUSIONS  Foresight can be an asset to the cybersecurity community  Cybersecurity often looks towards future short-term threats, yet there is a need for cybersecurity  professionals and policymakers to maintain pace with attackers. Foresight is a good tool for supporting  longer term strategic thinking on how to improve the state of cybersecurity and overall resilience.  ENISA is taking an important strategic step to better integrate foresight into cybersecurity practices.  Foresight is flexible and must be adapted for each activity  At the beginning of each foresight project, the methods and tools used should be thoughtfully chosen  and/or augmented to best suit each unique context and group. Even ongoing activities may be  updated with lessons learned. For example, if after one workshop the objectives were not achieved  the format of the following workshop should be adapted to suit the context and participants. The  recommendations in this report are not prescriptive and should be adapted as needed.  Where possible, engage one or more foresight experts for critical activities  Experts have the experience to select methods that best fit the group, but they also have more  knowledge of the more indefinite aspects of foresight – attitudes, framing, ethics, etc.  Foresight is an opportunity to improve understanding and communication  When stakeholders are involved in a foresight process, they obtain a wealth of information and  also face the challenge of how to transport ideas and possibilities in an easily comprehensible  way. This is an excellent exercise to develop staff members and leadership alike.  7.2 NEXT STEPS FOR ENISA  Design and Resource Allocation  The most pivotal step will be to design the foresight activities themselves – including participants,  timelines, etc. The more aligned the activities are to the organization in the design phase, the less  likely that significant changes will be needed after testing the foresight activity approaches. It is also  notable that resource allocation is critical for determining basic elements of planned activities - the  number of participants, timeline, and if a foresight professional can be brought in to lead the activity.  Test and Adapt  To fully utilize the potential of foresight at ENISA, it needs to be tested in a variety of teams,  settings, and contexts. Testing enables ENISA to align the foresight approach to our specific needs,  thus easing the process of integrating foresight into operational work. Foresight needs to be  integrated integrated into processes in order to figure out the best set up and timeline for the  organization. In doing so, ENISA may create a culture of foresight which in turn increases the  quality of foresight outputs.  Collaborate with Key Stakeholders  ENISA’s foresight activities may be enhanced by drawing upon the expertise of and collaborating  with other European (or MS) agencies and institutions that conduct foresight.  Support Build Up of Foresight Capability  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  Draft | Version 0.3 | November 2021  48  Foresight can be useful in many contexts and would be an asset for strategic cybersecurity  planning for EU Member States. ENISA’s lessons learnt and new expertise could be useful to get  national foresight programs off the ground.

INTRODUCTION  Foresight2 is a complex, multi-stage, ideally ongoing process, the ultimate aim of which  is informed decision-making with regard to securing strategic plans for possibly diverse  future developments. It enables reflection on various possible futures and strategic  preparation for plausible scenarios.3 Since the mid-1950s and early 1960s, foresight as a  discipline has grown to become a major strategic planning tool for private corporations as well  as the public sector.4 .  Foresight is still evolving and changing today. That is largely because it is action-oriented, and  therefore has tangible results; it is open, meaning there is freedom within foresight to think  outside of the box or to reshape previous notions; lastly it is participatory and  multidisciplinary – foresight brings together diverse groups that have expertise in a wide range  of topics, thus providing more realistic and thoughtful possible futures.5  Figure 1: Foresight Overview6  “Foresight is neither prophecy nor prediction. It does not aim to predict the future – to  unveil it as if it were predetermined – but to help us build it.” – EU Foresight Platform7  2 Please note that foresight is often referred to as “strategic foresight” and “futures studies.”  3 See GCPSE, Foresight – The Manual, UNDP Global Centre for Public Service Excellence, Singapore, 2014.  4 Schwartz, P.

Knowledge helps individual stakeholders best position themselves for future developments;  with knowledge, they can see beyond the fallacy that the future will look much like the present  and imagine leading-edge futures (Wilkinson, 2013). The process of developing this knowledge  and insight increases connections between stakeholders, thus strengthening related  networks – in this case the cybersecurity community. Finally, foresight can contribute to  capability enhancement, during which organizational and stakeholder capabilities may be  prioritized based on the findings of the foresight activity. This information is critical for identifying  and enabling the development and acquisition of key skills, policies, and technologies.  The application of foresight in the field of cybersecurity is not currently widespread.9 However,  we strongly believe that embedding these methods into the cybersecurity industry will lead to an  even more nuanced, clear, and multidisciplinary understanding of risk, as well as the strategic  ramifications of security measures.  Foresight is already a key element of ENISA’s strategy; it increases knowledge and  understanding of emerging and future challenges, thus providing a path to find solutions that  address those challenges and bolster EU resilience to cybersecurity threats.10  As an additional resource for integrating foresight into the field of cybersecurity, this report  provides an overview of key aspects of foresight, a selection of key methods and tools, best  practices for applying foresight, and finally, an exemplary guide to putting this knowledge into  practice, and running a foresight activity. We provide recommendations tailored specifically to  ENISA’s wide range of functional needs – executive strategy, policy support, capacity building,  operational cooperation, and certification activities. As these functional needs are likely shared  by many readers of this report, the recommendations are formulated as to be easily adapted to  fit other organizations and contexts.  With this initiative we hope to inspire and support Member States and other partners to use  foresight to address their own cybersecurity challenges. ENISA is taking the first step by  beginning to use these methods internally to provide more accurate and prescient information to  our stakeholders.  1.1 OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE  To adequately address future cybersecurity threats and to shape a more secure society, ENISA  aims to draw upon findings and research from the futures and foresight community to develop a  process to apply foresight to cybersecurity. By fostering the ability to understand potential  futures, ENISA will be able to better shape both itself and the European cybersecurity  ecosystem to address and manage emerging and future challenges.  This project aims to deliver an exemplary structured foresight framework (comprised of a  selected set of foresight methods applied to representative use cases) for generating trend  8 Haegeman, K., Spiesberger, M., Könnölä, T., Evaluating foresight in transitional research programming,  Technological Forecasting and Social Change 115, 2017, pp. 313 – 326.  9 Althonayan, Abraham, and Alina Andronache. \"Resiliency under strategic foresight: The effects of cybersecurity management and  enterprise risk management alignment.\" 2019 International Conference on Cyber Situational Awareness, Data Analytics and Assessment  (Cyber SA).

The framework or sets of methods recommended must be suitable for the range of ENISA  activities including strategic long-term planning, research agenda setting, threat landscape  evaluation, and formation of future policy priorities. It is therefore required that the framework be  flexible and easily adapted to each context and environment.  This report is not intended to be a comprehensive overview of all foresight methods available, but  rather aims to highlight the most relevant methods – based on ubiquity or suitability to ENISA’s  core foresight needs.  1.2 TARGET AUDIENCE  This report is targeted at stakeholders within the cybersecurity community (specifically ENISA  internal and external stakeholders) but can very well be applied more broadly, as foresight  methods are generally applicable across industries or topics. This report may be especially  relevant for:   Policymakers and national authorities with cybersecurity responsibilities   ENISA stakeholders, decision- and policymakers in the areas of ENISA’s portfolio   Cybersecurity researchers, practitioners, and educators   Relevant experts within European Institutions, Bodies and Agencies and their partners   Futurists or foresight consultants   Organizational leaders and corporate strategists   Forecasters and prediction market developers  1.3 STRUCTURE OF THE REPORT  The report reflects the progression and outcomes of the research study and is structured as  follows.

STOCKTAKING  2.1 OVERVIEW  To develop this framework, ENISA conducted a thorough literature review to explore a broad  range of information on foresight, with a focus on methods, tools and applications that could be  relevant for ENISA.11  These findings were augmented by interviews with experts in the fields of foresight and  cybersecurity, members of the ENISA’s Ad-Hoc Working Group on Foresight on Emerging and  Future Cybersecurity Challenges.12 The output of the research phase was the collection of  definitions, key characteristics, and best practices for a select representative set of methods  (relevant to ENISA’s specific operating environment).  2.2 STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS  Experts interviewed for this project were primarily individuals in ENISA’s Ad-Hoc Working Group  on Foresight (one additional academic foresight expert and practitioner was interviewed). All  experts brought unique perspectives that shed light on the characteristics of various foresight  methods and best practices for planning and conducting foresight exercises.  The experts interviewed as a part of this project represent a diverse group of individuals. We  interviewed 16 people, who represent (in nationality) nine different Member States,  geographically distributed across the EU. The expert group consisted of approximately 60%  women and 40% men.  Figure 3: Geographical Distribution of Experts  11 Due to the practical application of the recommendations in this report, our research focused primarily on frameworks, methods, and  tools and did not target the breadth of the foresight literature that focuses on principles, ethics, attitudes, learning factors, and other more  intangible factors.  12 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/artificial_intelligence/ad-hoc-working-group-on-emerging-and- future-cybersecurity-challenges  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/artificial_intelligence/ad-hoc-working-group-on-emerging-and-future-cybersecurity-challenges https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/artificial_intelligence/ad-hoc-working-group-on-emerging-and-future-cybersecurity-challenges  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  November 2021  10  The expert group also contains a mixture of foresight experts and cybersecurity experts. The  graph below illustrates how experts rated themselves on a slide scale when asked: “Does your  expertise lie more in cybersecurity or foresight?”  Figure 4: Expert Group Areas of Expertise  The experts work within a wide range of industries, but primarily in academia and consulting.

METHODS AND FRAMEWORKS  APPLICABLE TO FORESIGHT FOR  CYBERSECURITY  3.1 INTRODUCTION  Each foresight activity begins with the identification of scope, objectives, and stakeholders – this  step is a critical success factor. The scoping and initiation process is described in more detail in  later sections of the report.  Depending on the aim of the foresight project, (and factors such as the point in time to be  analysed (time horizon), field of application, scope of the project, available resources (human,  time, financial), ability to shape future evolutions), a specific set of methods is selected to best fit  the specified project.  A foresight exercise requires thoughtful preparation, involvement of the stakeholders and  participants, constant monitoring, skilful management, and continuous adaptation. This  chapter categorizes methods based on their “intention,” future-handling approach, and overall  aim.  For a comprehensive description of the entire foresight process and overview of foresight  methods, we refer the interested reader to the European Foresight Platform,13 a very useful  resource and reference.  Foresight Intentions14  Foresight activities usually involve three mutually dependent and essential intentions: diagnosis,  prognosis, and prescription. Foresight activities usually include all three of these intentions at  different points in the project.  This categorization helps to better identify the goal of each use of a method and supports the  method selection process. It was created by the EU Foresight Platform.15  13 “The European Foresight Platform is a global network building program supported by the European Commission. It aims at building a  global network that brings together different communities and individual professionals to share their knowledge about foresight,  forecasting and other methods of future studies.” – EFP http://www.foresight-platform.eu/  14 “Intention” is not a word used in the foresight industry, it is rather used in this report to distinguish between lower-level objectives within  a project and the primary objectives and desired outcomes.  15 http://www.foresight-platform.eu/community/forlearn/how-to-do-foresight/process/methodology/Smith  http://www.foresight-platform.eu/ http://www.foresight-platform.eu/community/forlearn/how-to-do-foresight/process/methodology/Smith  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  November 2021  12  Table 1: Foresight Intentions  Foresight  Intention  Description  Diagnosis  The aim is to evaluate the current context or state of affairs or subject of  study, to recognize early signs of possible future changes.  Prognosis  The aim is to create or envision probable, possible and plausible future  states of a subject of study.  Prescription  This component involves participants inventing possible strategies,  roadmaps or policies that aim to either respond to possible futures, or  actively shape the future towards a desired direction.  Future Handling  Based on the primary objectives of the foresight activity, the project or method’s approach can  be either “responsive”, meaning to devise strategies to react to possible events, or  “normative”, to design a future (that can be desirable or undesirable) and then take steps  to impact that chosen future. This topic is a subcategorization of the prescriptive intention.  3.2 OVERVIEW OF SELECTED METHODS AND FRAMEWORKS  Both cybersecurity and foresight benefit from a diverse and interdisciplinary environment. For  this reason, it is often wise to integrate frameworks from other fields. We believe that the  guidelines, practices, approaches, methods and tools of both systems thinking and user-  centred design can be key to establishing the right mindset when approaching foresighting in  the field of cybersecurity.  User-centred design offers a set of guidelines and tools that focus on the human factor in  business and technological implementations, helping to better define and design interactive  systems and organizations 16. The framework makes extensive use of immersive analysis and  empathy exercises, providing a window into the thoughts, aspirations, desires, needs and  actions of the human actors.  The framework of systems thinking, on the other hand, allows us to “see the forest through the  trees.”17 82 This phrase distils the essence and objective of the framework: to enable its  practitioners to identify, observe, analyse and shape systems, as well as the relationship  dynamics between its elements.  Both frameworks may provide a foundational aspect of a foresight project and support the  development of a point of view or mindset. Because the scope of these frameworks is so broad,  we have not included them in the categorizations in section 3.2.1, nor going forward in this  report. Nevertheless, they remain highly relevant aspects for any foresight practitioner seeking  to implement the tools, methods and processes outlined in this report.  16 https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/user-centered-design  17 Senge, Peter M. (1990). The fifth discipline: the art and practice of the learning organization. New York: Doubleday/Currency,  https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/user-centered-design  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  November 2021  13  3.2.1 Method Categorisation  To better illustrate the range of methods, the relevant methods, frameworks, and tools have  been grouped into six categories driven by the stocktaking phase of this project.18 Not all  methods listed can be considered explicit to foresight – we have also included strategic  planning methods and problem-solving techniques that are often integrated into foresight  activities.  Likewise, cybersecurity analysis methods are also included here to provide an overview of  relevant approaches for foresight in cybersecurity. These methods and techniques are not used  in traditional foresight but may be applied if they support the objectives of the foresight activity.  For that reason, a selection of methods is included in this report for future reference.  Figure 6: Selection of methods used in foresight19  3.2.2 Environmental Scanning / Analysis Frameworks  Environmental analysis frameworks enable the user to systematically explore a chosen  environment,20 with the goal of detecting weak signals21 of incoming change that could  significantly impact the future. These methods provide a structured and analytical view of the  current situation in order to create common understanding. This category of methods usually  draws upon the diagnostic intention.  There are different techniques to scan the environment including, for example:   STEEP – framework to analyse Socio-cultural, Technological, Economic,  Environmental and Political factors of a particular arena.   PESTLE – framework to analyse Political, Economic, Socio-cultural, Technological,  Legal and Environmental factors of a particular arena.   SWOT – framework to identify and analyse the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities,  and Threats for a particular topic or entity.  18 For other ways of categorising methods, see: Jack & Saritas, Ozcan. (2011). Science and technology foresight baker's dozen: A pocket  primer of comparative and combined foresight methods. foresight. 13. 79-96.  19 The methods used in foresight are difficult to classify into mutually exclusive categories. The categories oftentimes overlap content-wise  and tend to be divided differently in various publications.  20 Here “environment” refers to circumstances and context - not an ecological environment.  21 Weak signals are the initial indications of a significant trend or change.  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  November 2021  14  Each of the above frameworks enables the systematic evaluation of the characteristics,  developments, and influences in the listed domains to get an understanding of the environment.  There are also other variations of these frameworks that take other domains into account – the  choice of method or domain should be based on an initial analysis of the given subject.  3.2.3 Trend Analysis  A trend is defined as a tendency of a development over time, or an emerging pattern of change  that commonly influences large social groups.22 Trend analysis methods usually serve  prognostic or diagnostic intentions.  Trends can be analysed in many ways – for instance, by means of literature reviews,  bibliometrics, text-mining, patent analyses, and trend impact analyses, among others. These  methods identify current or emerging trends and typically explore the cause, potential impact,  probability, and speed of occurrence of those trends.23  Further methods used to analyse trends include:   Causal Layered Analysis – Supports the identification of driving forces by gaining  insight into participants’ perceptions such as world views, values, and cultural norms   Trend Radars – provides a cross-industry view of emerging and already existing  trends within the target environment   Trend Impact Analysis – analysis of the impact of one or more possible events on the  extrapolation of a trend into the future.   Horizon Scanning – Systematic monitoring of current trends as well as the  identification of new, relevant developments in a particular area through a creative  process of collective sense-making.  3.2.4 Expert Group Foresight  Expert group foresight covers a variety of methods, where a group (or a crowd) of participants  provides input on the issue under study. The best-known members of the expert group foresight  family are the Delphi method and expert panels. In both, experts share their insights about the  future. The Delphi method however involves a more structured communication method to elicit  answers from experts. Experts are usually involved to support a foresight project with its  prognostic or prescriptive intentions.  Delphi is an explorative method based on a structured and iterative group communication  between subject matter experts expressing judgements on the chosen topic. In the first  sequence, various experts in a particular field are surveyed separately about a specific topic or  question. Afterwards, their anonymized contributions are collected, and experts are asked to  provide feedback to the collected insights. To reach a consensus, this process would be  repeated multiple times. This approach helps to avoid groupthink and therefore tends to  generate more creative ideas from a variety of perspectives. The entire process can be  conducted remotely, which makes it easier to engage a more diverse expert group from all over  the world. This method can be time-consuming, especially when there are multiple iterations.  Japan’s National Institute of Science and Technology Policy (NISTEP) conducts foresight  exercises approximately every five years, most of which rely on a large Delphi study with  approximately 2000 participants.24  22 See efp, Megatrend / Trend / Driver / Issue, 2010, http://www.foresight-platform.eu/community/forlearn/how-to-do- foresight/methods/analysis/megatrend-trend-driver-issue/  23 See GCPSE, Foresight – The Manual, UNDP Global Centre for Public Service Excellence, Singapore, 2014.  24 Please see https://www.nistep.go.jp/en/?page_id=56  http://www.foresight-platform.eu/community/forlearn/how-to-do-foresight/methods/analysis/megatrend-trend-driver-issue/ http://www.foresight-platform.eu/community/forlearn/how-to-do-foresight/methods/analysis/megatrend-trend-driver-issue/ https://www.nistep.go.jp/en/?page_id=56  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  November 2021  15  Other examples of expert group-based methods include:   Aggregated Judgements / Group-based Forecast – logically combines multiple  individual judgements into consistent and collective judgements.   Key Technology Study (Technology Forecasting) – applies sets of criteria to critical  technological developments in order to enable informed assessments  Note that there are also crowd or participatory foresight methods, in which inputs are solicited  from non-experts.  3.2.5 Scenario Methods  Scenario methods are some of the most used and well-known prognostic methods in foresight.  They are used as exploratory tools to think about possible, desired or undesired futures rather  than to predict a single future in detail. These methods can also be used to simulate and test  various solutions prior to determining an optimal strategy. Usually, more than one possible  future is explored to support decision-making that avoids potential challenges and pitfalls.  Scenario generation is typically preceded by a diagnostic phase that allows for the informed  consideration of key factors that can impact the future of the issue at hand. Thinking about  multiple possible futures raises awareness of various factors that may affect the future; this  knowledge enables the development of more flexible, future-proof, adaptive strategies.  Scenarios can be approached with various methods, for example:   Gaming – devising games or roleplay scenarios to test possible strategies or solutions  by identifying possible reactions to and consequences of their implementation.   Visioning – looking to the ideal future to create a strategy to achieve specific goals.   Cross Impact Analysis – evaluates the likelihood of specific future events occurring  by assessing probability of other events occurring and then exploring their mutual  relationship.  3.2.6 Morphological Analysis and Backcasting  This category covers methods that are not typically associated but share the same two  characteristics - a prescriptive foresight intention and focus on event regression and system  decomposition. Regression analysis in foresight follows a similar approach to statistical  regression analysis. However, regression analysis in foresight works with qualitative data and  subjective opinion, as opposed to quantitative methods to identify events and event triggers that  may lead to a predicted future event.25 Decomposition, on the other hand, seeks to break down  complex systems into smaller parts to facilitate analysis of its components, the dynamics  governing the interaction of components and the effect they have on the system.  Morphological Analysis is a creative, heuristic, normative method that supports the  exploration of complex problems and possible solutions using a multi-dimensional matrix. It is a  time-consuming group exercise that requires facilitation.26  Backcasting is another normative method that centres a selected scenario of a desirable (or  undesirable) future. The participants then move backwards in time to identify the decisions or  events that need to take place to transform that selected scenario into reality. Through  25 https://hbr.org/2015/11/a-refresher-on-regression-analysis  26 Jackson, M., Practical Foresight Guide, 2013.  https://hbr.org/2015/11/a-refresher-on-regression-analysis  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  November 2021  16  backcasting, organizations can plan which actions they should take and evaluate potential  consequences. It raises awareness of the fact that the future is determined by many factors and  that different actions lead to various alternative outcomes.27  Threatcasting is a multi-stage method that involves envisioning an unwanted future, then  reconstructing steps and decisions that need to be taken to prevent that future from occurring. It  was designed primarily for analysing military futures. Threatcasting combines many foresight  methods including Delphi, science fiction prototyping, backcasting, and scenario modelling. This  method has a defined time horizon – each activity is designed to look forward 10 years into the  future.28  Other methods included in this category are:   Technology Sequence Analysis – generates probable timelines for technology  releases by analysing estimates of the time required for intermediate technical steps   Roadmapping – produces a document that defines the steps and milestones  necessary to obtain a desired future   Multi-criteria Analysis – compares possible identified solutions against a weighted  set of assessment criteria.   Synectics – promotes new and creative ways of thinking by, for example, imagining a  chosen problem in an unusual, unconnected environment  3.2.7 Cybersecurity Analysis Methods  As a discipline, cybersecurity often assesses risk and potential future threats, incidents and  crisis scenarios. These methods are all variations of risk assessment techniques. Each is  slightly different in terms of focus (e.g., on the threat actor or on visualization) but all aim  towards identifying and prioritizing risk and subsequently responding to that risk. The methods  in this category can be used for diagnosis, prognosis, or prescription.  Below are a few well-established methods for risk analysis and threat modelling.   Threat Agent Risk Assessment (TARA)29 – a threat-based risk assessment method  used to identify, assess, and prioritise risks. It takes threat actors, their motivations,  and possible methods into account.   Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation (OCTAVE)30 – a  comprehensive evaluation method to identify, rank, and manage cybersecurity risks.   Threat Modelling31 – a conceptual analysis technique used for identifying potential  vulnerabilities and developing measures in the early stages of application or service  development. There are many frameworks and methods for threat modelling,32 one  such method is Attack Trees.33 Attack Trees support the formulation of trees of  possible techniques that may help an attacker achieve their objectives.  27 Jackson, M., Practical Foresight Guide, 2013.  28 Vanatta, N., Johnson, B.

SELECTION CRITERIA  The first step of any foresight activity is scoping; during this phase the person or group  responsible for the activity defines key objectives and reviews the context of the activity. Once  completed, they may consider the following key criteria to narrow down the choice of foresight  methods, tools, and/or frameworks.   Target outcomes and deliverables – which methods, tools, and/or frameworks will  most likely produce the required effects on stakeholders? Which will most likely  produce the deliverables expected from the foresight activity?   Foresight intention – Consider the foresight intentions described in 3.1 for each step  of the planned activity. Is the objective to diagnose a current state, or to prognose or  prescribe a future state? The selection of methods must be based on suitability to the  underlying objectives of the foresight activity.   Future handling approach – Should your activity be more responsive or normative?  Is the objective to prepare to respond to events or shape futures?   Time horizon – The time horizon is the point in the future that targeted by the foresight  activity. Which methods, tools, and/or frameworks can be implemented to diagnose or  prognose events, or prescribe handling options, for the fixed point in time which will be  evaluated during the activity?   Activity timeframe – Which methods can be completed within the timeline set for the  execution of the foresight activity? Are there tools or frameworks that could support the  on-track and timely execution of the activity?   Required resources/skills – What access does the project have to administrative  support, data available on the subject, expert participants, financial resources, etc.?  Multiple experts emphasized that the choice of method highly depends on the context of the  exercise, including the following more abstract criteria:   Clarity of desired outcomes – Any ambiguity towards desired outcomes must be  clearly addressed before method selection. The methods that are applied must help  produce outcomes that are useful and usable for the project’s key stakeholders.   Participant Group – All methods must consider the unique characteristics of the  participant group; they should enable maximum engagement, capacity for creative  thinking, and transparent communication. If the participants are already known to the  organizer, key factors to analyse include existing or expected group dynamics,  personalities, roles, and areas of interest.   Publicity – If one goal of the foresight activity is to generate publicity, scenario  modelling techniques are usually favoured because they are the most attention-  grabbing and easiest to describe. However, the findings of the activity may be  misrepresented by the press, which may undermine the diplomatic process or other  relationships with stakeholders.  These facets should be evaluated for each foresight  activity.  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  November 2021  18   Experience – Experts from the Working Group stated that when they use methods  they are familiar with (as opposed to methods unfamiliar to them), the activities  progress more smoothly and tend to generate more dynamism and interaction.  Nonetheless, the benefits that the facilitator may gain from familiarity should be  secondary to selecting methods that support the objectives of the exercise.  4.1 FORESIGHT METHOD COMPARISON  The following table presents a selection of methods, along with their selection criteria and core  characteristics. The selection includes methods that are either commonly used, innovative,  and/or especially useful to address ENISA’s foresight needs.  In this table, we have categorized  methods by the overarching categories described in the previous chapter, the foresight  “intention” that the method would support, and a categorization of each method’s usual future-  handling approach (responsive or normative). Other factors included in the table are estimated  time needed for each method, special resources required, and overall aim of the method.

This section provides a non-exhaustive overview of the types of  tools available. While some are efforts to “digitalise” foresight, others simply enhance the in-  person foresight experience. When selecting tools for a specific foresight activity, we recommend  reviewing other possible sources as there are some tools designed for a specific audience or  context.  Workshop Facilitation Tools  These tools and techniques are often used by workshop facilitators to ease communication in  workshops or to elicit creative ideas from participants. Some well-known examples are:   Brainstorming, where participants are encouraged to generate large amount of raw,  spontaneous ideas, while getting inspired by the ideas of other participants, without  being subjected to immediate judgement.   World Café, where a large group of participants can discuss various questions in a  structured way, in rounds, within smaller groups, and note down their ideas on large  sheet of paper for the remaining groups to see and serve as reference.   Mind mapping, a technique of graphic facilitation to help visually organize collected  information.  There are now a few digital databases that provide information on foresight-relevant tools. One  source for identifying additional foresight-relevant tools is the website Service Design Tools64  which describes and organizes tools based on the stage of the design process, stakeholders and  participants, the aim of the activity, and desired visualization methods. Other resources include  the Futures Platform,65 the Governance Futures Toolkit,66 and Teach the Future67 (which aims to  provide educators tools to integrate foresight into their curricula.)  Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Based Tools  AI-based tools may assist foresight activities like assessment of the current environment, trend  analysis, or trend extrapolation. While not ubiquitous, these tools are now often integrated into  the foresight process.68 AI software can be especially helpful for text-mining and analysing large  datasets, for instance to identify terms and phrases possibly indicative of emerging or future  trends or to support a literature review. Natural Language Processing is typically used for these  activities. AI-based tools may also support the selection of scenarios.  Collaboration Tools & Foresight / Trend Databases  To better facilitate foresight exercises, many experts recommend the use of collaboration tools  (such as digital whiteboards and note-taking apps), as well as research databases for desktop  research and trend recognition. It is important to note that within the expert community existing  radar databases and foresight information sources are not always trusted. These sources rarely  publish details on the information gathering and preparation process, therefore the experts  interviewed typically rely on their own research or primary sources to determine trend-related  information.  64 POLI.design and Oblo, Service Design Tools, Tools, https://servicedesigntools.org/tools  65 https://www.futuresplatform.com/product  66 https://www.iftf.org/uploads/media/GovFuturesLab_Toolkit.pdf  67 https://www.teachthefuture.org/  68 Kayser, Victoria, and Knut Blind. \"Extending the knowledge base of foresight: The contribution of text mining.\" Technological Forecasting  and Social Change 116 (2017): 208-215.  https://servicedesigntools.org/tools https://www.futuresplatform.com/product https://www.iftf.org/uploads/media/GovFuturesLab_Toolkit.pdf https://www.teachthefuture.org/  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  Draft | Version 0.3 | November 2021  25  Conferencing Tools  Conferencing tools are often used to involve participants from various geographic regions. They  are extremely helpful for bringing together a diverse group of participants. However, we  hypothesize that there is also a downside to using these tools. Participants may be less able to  fully devote their attention to online meetings (as opposed to in-person workshops) due to the  reduced interactivity of remote workshops and the fact that some individuals may be tempted to  multitask or to join other meetings. Additionally, there may be varying levels of digital literacy  within a group – due to a lack of technical skills and familiarity, some participants may not be able  to fully and confidently participate while using a conferencing tool.  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  Draft | Version 0.3 | November 2021  26  5. BEST PRACTICES  This chapter lays out best practices for planning and conducting foresight activities. The findings  are primarily drawn from interviews but also include salient points from the literature review.  5.1 SUMMARY OF BEST PRACTICES  Scoping & Administration  Scoping is a critical step in the foresight process 69. Whenever possible, it is recommended to  identify a foresight organizer that has experience running foresight workshops and projects. In the  initial scoping phase, the organizer begins to define objectives, foresight intention, time horizon,  future handling approach, timeframe, required resources, etc. It is important to ensure that the  objectives can be reached with the provided budget and resources.  In this stage of the project, the objectives of the activity should be well-defined (e.g., desired  outcome, target audience, time horizon, stakeholders, key deliverables, communication and  dissemination, etc.). It is also helpful to define objectives for each method or workshop - e.g.,  define a question for each STEEP factor.  In order to ensure maximum engagement, consider participant availability and key organizational  or environmental milestones. For example, it is best to not plan events around times when  participants are likely to be away on holiday. Furthermore, if the results of the foresight activity  need to be provided to a key decision-maker, ensure that the findings can be delivered prior to  major strategic meetings or events.  Finally, given that many foresight activities are regularly repeated, it is important to review results  throughout the foresight project and at its conclusion. This provides an opportunity to learn how to  improve future foresight activities.  Method selection  Since foresight activities rarely have straightforward goals or standardised outcomes, methods  cannot be applied “out-of-the-box”. Often, the methods to be used for an activity must be adapted  to the goal and the scope of the activity, the context of the challenge, and even the participants  involved. Foresight experts often see methods more as a frame of reference, which helps them to  structure the activities.  Experts noted that creating a logical flow or frame for each foresight exercise, such as Design  Thinking,70 helps to focus on outcomes and to deliver a clear and concise plan. The frame may  take the form of a modular building block approach, in which a variety of smaller blocks, each with  a different focus (and method) are selected.  The methods mentioned in the example frame below demonstrate the range of possible methods  - from foresight-specific (threatcasting) to more generic (role play). Frames can be grounded in  existing frameworks or be simple process flows, like this illustrative one:  69 A detailed description of the scoping process is provided by the EU Foresight Platform: http://www.foresight- platform.eu/community/forlearn/how-to-do-foresight/process/outcomes/  70 Design Thinking is a user-centric problem-solving approach. For more information see: https://www.interaction- design.org/literature/topics/design-thinking  http://www.foresight-platform.eu/community/forlearn/how-to-do-foresight/process/outcomes/ http://www.foresight-platform.eu/community/forlearn/how-to-do-foresight/process/outcomes/ https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/design-thinking https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/design-thinking  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  Draft | Version 0.3 | November 2021  27   understanding today (e.g., stakeholder or agent mapping/analysis, PESTLE71),   detecting and defining changes (e.g., weak signals, trend analysis),   articulating visions and futures into a coherent scenario (e.g., through scenario modelling:  stories, visuals, roleplays) and   analysing this future (e.g., threatcasting, scenario analysis, SWOT) to prepare  recommendations.  In a well-designed foresight project, methods are carefully selected to form a diverse composition  that best serves the objectives of the particular project and its participants.  By using a frame, the  objectives are well-defined, but the methods can be easily switched out as needed. The use of  several methods allows for a range of topics to be addressed and increases the likelihood that each  participant will provide pertinent input, thus eliciting the best outcomes for a foresight project.  Duration of foresight projects  The length of foresight activities is very versatile. They tend to span from four weeks up to one year  and in some cases longer than a year. These longer-term activities are often used for continuous  strategic planning but are less active and intense than shorter exercises. Long-term foresight is  often assigned to a specific organizational role that is tasked with staying on top of new trends and  deriving useful conclusions from that research. In these cases, work would also likely be divided  into smaller, time-bound exercises.  For scenario modelling enthusiasts, there is a clear correlation between time invested and  granularity (level of detail) of the scenarios. The main driver of this increase in granularity or quality  of scenarios over time is introspective activity. Typically, a participant’s capacity to understand the  underlying systemic structure and possible evolutions or emergences increases over time;  therefore, participants must be given sufficient time for introspection in order to ensure high-quality  results.  A high level of granularity is often difficult to achieve in foresight activities, particularly for public  sector actors, as scoping is particularly challenging at a national or regional level.72 It is however  possible to create valuable foresight results in a shorter time period. For example, in a crisis  preparedness or response scenario, foresight can support a quick turnaround of actionable  information; it will just not be as detailed as projects with more time and resources.  Participant Selection and Engagement  If possible, it is critical to ensure the involvement of the project’s key stakeholders (e.g., the Head  of Strategy) throughout the entire foresight process, including in smaller workshops. Delivering  reports and outcomes at the end of the exercise is not as impactful for the readers as direct  participation. In such a case, the findings of the exercise are less likely to be acted upon.  To ensure high-quality, well-rounded outcomes, a diverse group of individuals should be selected  for participation. Diversity in this context will depend on the topic being analysed but may cover  expertise, political affiliation, national origin or nationality, race, social class, gender, organizational  role, age, etc. Ideally, all affected populations should be involved and represented in a foresight  exercise.  Beyond the diversity of the group, it is also recommended to evaluate group dynamics when  selecting participants. Characteristics that may be important to consider are shyness, ability to  tolerate imperfection or lack of clarity, ability to express oneself in a group, power dynamics, etc.  71 Note that there is the risk of investing too much time in this “understanding today” step of the process as participants may be more likely  to believe that future outcomes will be analogous to the past. While information about past and current events or evolutions can be  beneficial, they do not provide any indication that the future will follow similar patterns.  72 Glod, F., Duprel, C., & Keenan, M. (2009). Foresight for science and technology priority setting in a small country: The case of  Luxembourg. Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 21(8), 933-951.  Selecting a  diverse  participant group  for foresight  activities actively  improves the  group’s capacity  for creativity and  ability to observe  all facets of a  topic.  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  Draft | Version 0.3 | November 2021  28  Consideration of this factor helps to ensure that the exercise remains productive and maximizes  the engagement of all participants.  It may furthermore be beneficial to include generalists with a broad range of expertise as  participants, as they can more easily provide a variety of perspectives. Likewise, it is often very  important to include a participant with a strong legal background that can support the group in  understanding the present, and likely future, legal constraints.  Communication & Engagement  Prior to the exercise, participants should be provided information such as: the goals of the exercise,  the purpose of foresight (both in general and for the specific situation), the major components of  the chosen method(s), and background on the specific topic, including any commonly used  terminology that is crucial to the project (e.g., cybersecurity terms). If possible, the participants  should be involved at the beginning of the activity in order to actively participate in shaping the  project.  When communicating with a group of participants with varying areas of expertise, it has proven  helpful to focus on outcomes over approach. Foresight is very rarely a person’s full-time  occupation, hence the need to provide the essential information without going into any unnecessary  detail.  By giving participants a clear understanding of their role in the overall project, the exercise leaders  are better able to manage any false assumptions and encourage a more unified participant group.  Time Horizon  Time horizon, the time frame a foresight activity aims to analyse, may be classified as short-term  or emerging (0-5 years), mid-term (5-10 years), or long-term (10+ years). Definitions for time  horizons do not always break down into these neat categories; we have adopted this categorization  for the sake of clarity.  The choice of time horizon depends primarily on:   the specific use case (e.g., climate change vs new technology)   target objective (e.g., create a strategic plan, prepare response options)   industry (fast moving (tech) vs long-term thinking (infrastructure))   external factors (e.g., what is commonly reported on at your organization)   and organizational or regional culture (are the participants accustomed to future-oriented  thinking?).  The choice of time horizon should be tailored to each individual activity; nonetheless there are  some notable characteristics for each time horizon to take into consideration.  While working with short-term time horizons, exercise participants tend to envision the future much  like a simple linear extension of the present, and often have a hard time stepping outside of their  own cognitive biases to envision futures different from the present (or commonly held expectations  of the future.)  Long-term horizons allow people to free up their minds, but the plausible futures are very complex  and speculative, as many factors need to be evaluated and weighed against one another. There is  also often a lack of reliable data sources to support the participants’ understanding of the distant  future. Long-term time horizons are often used to move towards specific objectives – defining short-  term responses that are likely to result in the intended consequence.  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  Draft | Version 0.3 | November 2021  29  Mid-term perspectives seem to allow enough flexibility for participants to envision alternative  futures that differ from the present, thus enabling the creation of creative strategies and near-term  action plans.  5.2 SUMMARY OF CHALLENGES AND PITFALLS  Data Quality and Quantity  Accurate data may facilitate more reliable foresight results. Nonetheless, data is always  backward-looking; any conclusions drawn from historical data should be evaluated for  applicability to the future. In many cases there is a surplus of data, an analysis of which would  overextend available resources and overwhelm the participants with data that is still, after all, from  the past. Too much data may also restrict participants in their ability to participate creatively in the  foresight workshops. Other times, the data is either insufficient, or what is available is  unstructured, or potentially unreliable. In some technology-focused foresight activities, the  participants’ ability to consider ongoing innovations is limited due to lack of available information  (often driven by concerns of intellectual property theft.) While this is to be expected, it can also  negatively impact the outcomes of an activity. Moreover, one expert in the Working Group outlined  four types of counterfactual information that may affect data reliability: gossip or rumours, fake  news, rewriting of historical events, and frozen conflicts. These in turn often affect foresight  exercises by warping the quality of the information and render fact-based consensus unlikely.  Participant Engagement  Regardless of how carefully participant groups are selected, there are often cases when chosen  individuals do not fully participate in exercises or questionnaires. It is also difficult to get some  participants to open up, think outside of the box, and embrace imperfection – all of which are critical  for successful foresight activities. As mentioned above, however, these challenges may be  minimized by clear presentation of the ultimate objectives and context of the exercise.  Cybersecurity-specific Challenges  Cybersecurity-specific foresight tends to focus heavily on specific technology and operational  measures, limiting the ability to see strategically across the environment. Likewise, “game-  changing innovations” are rarely easy to predict, but pivotal for assessing emerging and future  cybersecurity threats. This is further complicated by the often confidential nature of the  cybersecurity industry; experts may face a conflict of interest when supporting foresight activities.  The current shortage of cybersecurity professionals may also be a challenge when planning and  performing a foresight activity.  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  Draft | Version 0.3 | November 2021  30  6. APPLICATION USE CASES  This section presents optional roadmaps for seven use cases identified by ENISA. The use cases  represent a sample of how ENISA may apply foresight in the future. As mentioned in previous  sections, the design of a foresight activity must reflect the reality of the contextual situation,  resources, participants, etc. The processes proposed in this chapter are intended as a guide – in  practice, the methods may need to be switched out or workshops added, for example.  The use cases approaches described in the following chapter include:  1. Identification of future and emerging  challenges  2. Strategic decision-making development  3. Evolution of threat landscape  4. Needs and priorities for cybersecurity R&D  5. Evolution of operational cooperation  6. Identification of future policy  priorities  7. Disruptive events  6.1 OPERATIONAL CONTEXT  To better understand how foresight would be applied within ENISA, we held a workshop to identify  major functions that would benefit from foresight. As a result, we mapped out a high-level structure  of how foresight findings would flow between key functions within ENISA. This helped to identify  dependencies between the use cases.  Figure 7: Understanding of ENISA’s Operational Context  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  Draft | Version 0.3 | November 2021  31  While ENISA’s work is more of a continuous cycle, this depiction shows how the identification of  emerging challenges and threats supports many activities such as strategy development,  prioritizing research topics, and preparing recommendations for stakeholders. The use cases  defined for each phase build upon one another, to maintain a continuous and sustainable  information flow between organizational units and functions.  The use cases defined under each phase of the process are indicative - the activities and the  deliverables are subject to ENISA’s standard operating model and procedures, as well as the  CSA (Cybersecurity Act), the main regulation that defines the mandate of ENISA.  6.2 OVERARCHING COMPONENTS AND CONSIDERATIONS  We have highlighted here some components common to all use cases.  Inception Phase & Scoping: Each activity must begin with the identification of scope, objectives,  and stakeholders – it is critical to the success of the activity.   Define the scope of the exercise (including contextual information such as the pertinent  industry or EU scope).   Identify and involve all stakeholders as early in the process as is possible. Expert  Working Groups take time to put together (estimated min. 2 months), and many internal  stakeholders may need to participate in multiple foresight activities.  Engaging with Participants: As these use cases often take place over a year, there is a chance  that the participants will lose focus and interest in the activity.   We recommend either maintaining frequent and regular contact with the participants or,   Present an overview of the project’s objectives and current findings before each part of  the activity.  Tools: Some tools are needed for all use cases, such as:   Video conferencing software   Collaborative documentation tools (Confluence73, Saga.so74, Notion.so75, etc.)  Resources: Where possible, the process recommended for each use case should build upon and  make use of other foresight activities and reports.  73 Please see https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence  74 Please see https://saga.so/  75 Please see https://www.notion.so/  https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence https://saga.so/ https://www.notion.so/  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  Draft | Version 0.3 | November 2021  32  6.3 IDENTIFICATION OF FUTURE AND EMERGING CHALLENGES (1)  Each year ENISA works on reports identifying the future and emerging challenges relevant to their  stakeholders. The reports themselves are used in many other aspects of ENISA’s operations,  therefore they must be both credible and actionable.  Category Description  Objective  Produce an overview of emerging trends and challenges  that will impact security (report)  Time Horizon 3 -5 years  Collaborating  Stakeholders  ENISA Working Group & Broader Public  Target Audience  General public, policymakers, cybersecurity professionals  Impact on Target  Audience  Stay up to date on future and emerging challenges; think  critically about the future  Level of Granularity General trends, directions, and topics.  Time to Conduct  Exercise  1 year  Dependencies Other ENISA activities rely on this study  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  Draft | Version 0.3 | November 2021  33  6.3.1 Foresight Approach  # Process Step Detailed Description  Recommended  Methods & Tools  1  Analyse current relevant  social, technological,  economic, environmental  and political events.  Collect information on emerging trends and challenges from a variety of sources including, for example,  market research firms, think tanks, academic publications, foresight research, etc. The STEEP method  should be applied to ensure the comprehensiveness of the research itself. Research and findings are to  be shared amongst participants and experts for feedback. If ENISA is conducting its own data analysis,  Trend Intra- & Extrapolation may be used to project future outcomes based on historical data. This will be  the most time-intensive step.  STEEP  PESTLE  Literature Review  Trend Interpolation &  Extrapolation  Desk Research  2  Identify and document  possible change events and  future states.  Gather internal and external (expert) stakeholders to conduct a brainstorming workshop. In the workshop,  all participants will write down change events and systemic emergences that they have noticed or have  studied for each category (STEEP). The group discusses the results, adds findings from the desk  research, and together creates a shortlist of trends to investigate further. The trends are divided amongst  participants to collect further information.  Brainstorming  3  Identify and document  driving forces of change for  the predicted events in  each PESTLE category.  To identify a driving force of change, analyse all the events which have been brainstormed in the previous  phase and locate causal dependencies amongst them. Relationships or dependencies between events  should not only have a cause-and-effect nature. The analysis should include the technologies, social  attitudes, political positions and actors or interest groups acting as facilitators or perpetrators of the events.  The workshop(s) should rely on an expert group composed of a diverse range of participants (e.g.,  cybersecurity professionals, economists, psychologists, sociologists, etc.).  Causal Layered  Analysis (CLA)  4  Identify cybersecurity topics  related to drivers and  change events in each  PESTLE category.  Based on the information generated during previous steps, experts participating in the workshop must  identify cybersecurity related topics. This is performed by looking at the current environment, the predicted  evolutions or change events, driving forces for the changes, and possible end states through the lens of  cybersecurity.  Brainstorming  5  Categorize and prioritize  topics and drivers based on  speed of evolution and  impact on cybersecurity.  After gathering relevant cybersecurity topics in step 4, an internal working group of ENISA experts should  review, complement and categorize the topics. The categorization narrows the focus of the ENISA team to  only relevant topics. From there, the team may derive future activities such as further exploration, training  exercises, policy recommendations, etc.  Participatory Design  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  Draft | Version 0.3 | November 2021  34  6.4 STRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING DEVELOPMENT (2)  ENISA relies on solid, fact-based strategic decision-making to decide how to allocate resources,  plan future activities, and identify areas of development. Foresight activities enable the leadership  to design a strategy that can manage future challenges.  Category Description  Objective  Guide the strategic planning process to validate the  assumptions and the level of ambition; review principles,  priorities and requirements for the Agency to realise its  vision and fulfil its mission.

Using the Future & Emerging Challenges and Threat Landscape reports as a basis, initiate a focused desk  research phase structured by the STEEP analysis. During this phase, the emphasis would be identifying  any developments that have emerged since the workshops conducted as part of other use cases.  Research and findings are to be shared amongst participants and experts for feedback.  STEEP  PESTLE  Literature Review  2  Review the documentation  and explore additional  scenarios which may be  desired, disruptive and/or  likely to happen.  Scenario Planning: Based on the information collected in Step 1, identify possible futures that ENISA  would be a part of. The focus should be on very disruptive or probable futures; this ensures that the  resulting strategy is flexible enough to accommodate many possible outcomes. In this step, the  participants would create a rather long list of potential scenarios that would be shortlisted in the next step.  Expert Workshop: Scenarios produced in the previous step should be reviewed with the expert group to  identify clusters which warrant further exploration, based on their potential for disruption or likeliness of  emergence. Within an internal ENISA group, a desired future should be selected that can guide strategic  initiatives.  Scenario Method  Brainstorming  3  Model relevant scenarios of  the future.  It is recommended that relevant scenarios or clusters be modelled at this point, exploring different aspects  such as PESTLE or STEEP context and situation, day-to-day experience for actors living in the future  scenario, group or individual motivations, desires and needs, consumption habits, etc. The scenarios can  be further explored with the expert group by engaging in iterative design practices through a series of  workshops, improving the level of granularity of the descriptions and the understanding the experts  develop on the future state.  Scenario Method  4  Define a normative vision of  ENISA for these futures.  Create a normative vision: Hold a workshop to identify ENISA’s ideal role in shaping the desired future(s).  Using the modelled scenarios, identify the role that ENISA wants to play in each of the chosen futures.  How does that look and how does it reflect to ENISA’s core values and mandate? What are ENISA’s  responsibilities in this alternate future?  Scenario Method  Visioning  Backcasting  5  Backcast initiatives required  to reach the normative  vision.  In a workshop with internal stakeholders (and external consultants as needed), brainstorm possible  initiatives to reach the normative vision. For example, how would ENISA fulfil its mandate in such a future?  What steps would ENISA need to take now to help shape the situation towards the desired future? It is  important to remember that the identified tasks and initiatives need to allow for the possibility that another,  more disruptive, future may arrive.  Backcasting  6  Define an evolution  roadmap and complete the  strategy with guidelines and  principles.  Prioritize and organize the initiatives needed to achieve and accommodate alternate futures. Based on the  roadmap identify common themes and guiding principles to support the strategy. Incorporate both  overarching themes and specific initiatives into the strategic document.  Roadmapping  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  Draft | Version 0.3 | November 2021  36  6.5 EVOLUTION OF THREAT LANDSCAPE (3)  Each year, ENISA publishes their analyses on the European threat landscape. 77  This is an  important aspect of much of ENISA’s work as the most prevalent threats may also drive the  Agency’s priorities and strategy.  Category Description  Objective  Produce an overview and analysis on emerging threats and  drivers, to inform the general public and cybersecurity  professionals.

Environmental Scanning: Initiate a short desk research phase focused on security event and incident  reports, as well as cybersecurity threat analyses from the previous year. Research and findings are to be  shared amongst participants and experts for feedback. Other tools such as data mining may be used to  identify threat methods or attack vectors that are on the rise.  Expert Panel: Alongside the Context Gathering step, gather a diverse group of experts to provide input on  potential threats. The Expert Panel (typically 12-20 people) may be divided into groups based on areas of  expertise or focused on a particular threat category (e.g., ransomware attacks). This could be a longer  phase (>3 months) or shorter, depending on the timeline of the project and resources available.  Desk Research  PESTLE  Expert Panel  2  Identify drivers for actors  and threats.  Expert Workshop: For the identification of the underlying causes of threats and motivations of threat  actors, a diverse group of participants should be assembled, including profiles such as psychologists,  sociologists, economists, technology experts, cybersecurity enthusiasts, etc. The participants should use  tools such as personas and empathy maps to understand the motivations of the threat actors, as well as  their ultimate goals.  Stakeholder Mapping  Personas  Empathy Map  Causal Layered  Analysis  3  Trend Analysis: Identify and  document possible change  events and future states.  Combining desk research and workshop format (Trend Mapping), the participants would identify change  events that are impacting the major threats and threat actors. These should be distinct from threat events  (i.e., the rise of insider threat would not be a change event, rather that the COVID-19 pandemic weakened  social ties within organizations).  Trend Mapping  Brainstorming  Mind maps  4  Identify and document  future threats.  Threat Identification and Comparison: This activity may then be extended by the Threat Agent Risk  Assessment (TARA) method.78 The participants will compare their research and structure it into lists of  threat actors, attacker objectives, and attack methods. This method offers a way of getting an overview of  threat actors, their objectives, and attack methods and narrowing it down to the most high-risk or novel  threats. The TARA method is typically used to assess the major risks to an organization, country, etc. but it  may also be used to identify how new methods or change events may lead to novel threats.  TARA  Thought  Experimenting  Desk Research  5  Propose and document  recommendations.  In a workshop with cybersecurity professionals, categorize and prioritize threats. Obtain feedback in  iterative rounds.  Participatory Design  78 Threatcasting was not recommended purely because it is designed for a time horizon of 10 years. For more information on TARA, see Rosenquist, M., Prioritizing Information Security Risks with Threat  Agent Risk Assessment, Intel Information Technology, USA, 2009.  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  Draft | Version 0.3 | November 2021  38  6.6 NEEDS AND PRIORITIES FOR CYBERSECURITY R&D (4)  ENISA provides a valuable service by identifying areas within the field of cybersecurity in need of  development. This use case builds on the previous three to reach a greater degree of granularity.  Research and development may also inform future strategic decision-making or may serve as  inputs for environmental scanning.

During this phase the emphasis would be identifying any trends, threat  actors, or technologies that were not covered in the Challenges Report. Research and findings are to be  shared amongst participants and experts for feedback. If ENISA is conducting its own data analysis, Trend  Interpolation & Extrapolation may be used to project future outcomes based on historical data.  STEEP  Trend Interpolation &  Extrapolation  Bibliometrics  Text Mining  Literature Review  2  Identify and document  possible change events and  systemic emergences.  Gather internal and external (expert) stakeholders. In a workshop, all participants will write down change  events and systemic emergences that they have noticed or have studied for each category (STEEP).  Afterwards they should: discuss results of the workshop, incorporate desk research findings, shortlist  trends to investigate, and delegate trend research to participants.  Scenario Method  Expert Panel  Brainstorming  Desk Research  3  Identify driving forces for  possible change events and  emergences.  To identify a driving force of change, analyse the events brainstormed in the previous phase with a diverse  expert group and locate causal dependencies amongst them.  Personas  Causal Layered  Analysis  4  Transform driving forces  into bipolar factors and  combine to identify  alternate futures.  Once the driving forces have been identified, the project team should define bipolar factors for each driver  (desk research or internal workshop.) A bipolar factor is a construct based on a driving force, stating an  “either/or” outcome in the future. For example, if the driving force is “general social desire to optimize the  ownership of assets”, then the bipolar factor should focus on attitudes towards possession, with full or  partial ownership or full usership (full transformation of social paradigm) as possible outcomes.  By defining a series of bipolar factors and using a combinatorial approach, a scenario modelling team can  create a set of scenarios, based on the “either/or” outcomes defined for each bipolar factor. For example, if  an exercise has defined two bipolar factors, a total of 4 scenarios would be created.  Scenario Method  Bipolar Factors  5  Identify, explore and model  highly relevant scenarios.  The scenarios should then be reviewed with the expert group to identify clusters that warrant further  exploration based on their potential for disruption or likeliness of emergence. Model the relevant scenarios  or clusters, exploring different aspects the environmental context and situation, day-to-day experience for  actors living in the future scenario, group or individual motivations, desires and needs, consumption habits,  etc. The scenarios can be further explored through iterative design workshops that increase the level of  granularity of the descriptions and experts’ understandings of the future.  Scenario Method  6  Identify relevant  cybersecurity topics and  drivers in most relevant  scenarios.  Part of the scenario modelling exercise should also focus on the cybersecurity aspects governing the  future state. Topics such as technologies, threats, threat actors, etc. should be regularly explored. Existing  threat landscapes (see Use Case 3) can be used as input.

In those cases, it is prudent to have a structured process with  which to generate possible outcomes. This supports decision-makers and brings additional clarity  to entities that may need to support in such a crisis situation. Examples of these events could  include, for example, mass ransomware incidents (like NotPetya) or wide-reaching APTs  (advanced persistent threats).

CONCLUSIONS & NEXT STEPS  7.1 CONCLUSIONS  Foresight can be an asset to the cybersecurity community  Cybersecurity often looks towards future short-term threats, yet there is a need for cybersecurity  professionals and policymakers to maintain pace with attackers. Foresight is a good tool for supporting  longer term strategic thinking on how to improve the state of cybersecurity and overall resilience.  ENISA is taking an important strategic step to better integrate foresight into cybersecurity practices.  Foresight is flexible and must be adapted for each activity  At the beginning of each foresight project, the methods and tools used should be thoughtfully chosen  and/or augmented to best suit each unique context and group. Even ongoing activities may be  updated with lessons learned. For example, if after one workshop the objectives were not achieved  the format of the following workshop should be adapted to suit the context and participants. The  recommendations in this report are not prescriptive and should be adapted as needed.  Where possible, engage one or more foresight experts for critical activities  Experts have the experience to select methods that best fit the group, but they also have more  knowledge of the more indefinite aspects of foresight – attitudes, framing, ethics, etc.  Foresight is an opportunity to improve understanding and communication  When stakeholders are involved in a foresight process, they obtain a wealth of information and  also face the challenge of how to transport ideas and possibilities in an easily comprehensible  way. This is an excellent exercise to develop staff members and leadership alike.  7.2 NEXT STEPS FOR ENISA  Design and Resource Allocation  The most pivotal step will be to design the foresight activities themselves – including participants,  timelines, etc. The more aligned the activities are to the organization in the design phase, the less  likely that significant changes will be needed after testing the foresight activity approaches. It is also  notable that resource allocation is critical for determining basic elements of planned activities - the  number of participants, timeline, and if a foresight professional can be brought in to lead the activity.  Test and Adapt  To fully utilize the potential of foresight at ENISA, it needs to be tested in a variety of teams,  settings, and contexts. Testing enables ENISA to align the foresight approach to our specific needs,  thus easing the process of integrating foresight into operational work. Foresight needs to be  integrated integrated into processes in order to figure out the best set up and timeline for the  organization. In doing so, ENISA may create a culture of foresight which in turn increases the  quality of foresight outputs.  Collaborate with Key Stakeholders  ENISA’s foresight activities may be enhanced by drawing upon the expertise of and collaborating  with other European (or MS) agencies and institutions that conduct foresight.  Support Build Up of Foresight Capability  FORESIGHT CHALLENGES  Draft | Version 0.3 | November 2021  48  Foresight can be useful in many contexts and would be an asset for strategic cybersecurity  planning for EU Member States. ENISA’s lessons learnt and new expertise could be useful to get  national foresight programs off the ground.

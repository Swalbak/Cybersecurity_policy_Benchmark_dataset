The eIDAS Regulation allows  Member States to notify their electronic identification scheme and since September 29th, 2018,  the provisions for mandatory mutual recognition of notified eID schemes have come into force.  The eIDAS Regulation also introduces 3 levels of assurance, Low, Substantial and High, for the  eID means issued under an eID scheme. Finally, it lays down the interoperability framework  supporting cross-border electronic identification.  This report provides an overview of the legislative framework under eIDAS for electronic  identification, presents the landscape of notified and pre-notified eID schemes and identifies key  trends in the electronic identification field. Moreover, it discusses preliminary security  considerations and recommendations related to the underlying technologies used for eID  means and makes a proposal on the role that ENISA could play in the eIDAS compliant eID  ecosystem. Since Germany notified in September 2017 the first European eID scheme under  the eIDAS Regulation, an increasing number of countries have started an eID scheme  notification process. Other schemes are pre-notified and more will undoubtedly follow, thus  demonstrating the success of eID across the European Union.  From historical card-based eID schemes requiring card-readers, Member States and identity  providers are moving towards mobile-based solutions, which are more convenient for the end-  users. This shift is clearly depicted on the latest notified schemes for which more eID means  include the use of smartphone. These eID means can use software applications but can also  leverage hardware embedded components such as SIM cards, Secure Element and Trusted  Execution Environment for an increased protection against attacks. In the future, it is expected  to have more mobile-based eID means relying on such embedded devices. Nevertheless, the  security of such an embedded device strongly depends on technology and the actual mobile  phone used.  Besides the move to mobile devices, other key trends in the electronic identification field include  the increasing use of biometrics and the need to take into consideration users’ privacy  (protection of the identity data as well as usage of eID means) while building eID schemes.  Today, distributed ledger technologies and blockchain for digital identities have also gained  momentum, although there are no cases of real world deployements yet.  Security considerations and recommendations  A significant number of published documents already provide relevant and useful guidance on  the security of electronic identification means; for instance: ISO standards, NIST Special  Publications and European focused documents (including a Guidance Document on Levels of  Assurance published by the Cooperation Network, which provides security considerations and  examples for a better understanding of the Commission Implementing Regulation 2015/1502).  The reports of the peer reviews performed during eID schemes notification processes (some of  them being public) and public opinions of the Cooperation Network on notified eID schemes  also provide very relevant feedback and key points to be considered while assessing the  security of electronic identification means and their compliance with a given level of assurance.  It should be highlighted that each peer review report should be considered holistically and  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  7  judgement on security components can not be drawn in isolation. These reviews and opinions  highlight some key security considerations:   Security of remote identification processes and solutions, as for trust services (e.g.  issuance of qualified certificates), is a major concern. There are currently no standards or  detailed requirements available to help identify how providers assess their process’s  compliance with a given Level of Assurance (LoA)  based on the classification scale of  Regulation CIR (EU) 2015/1502. However, remote identification requirements for each  LoA are currently examined and expected to be formalized in future updates of the  document “Guidance for the application of the Levels of Assurance which support the  eIDAS Regulation”, as additional guidance and standardization is needed in this area.   A rising number of mobile-based eID solutions require more detailed guidance (especially  on cryptographic modules used within the mobile) on their compliance with a given LoA,  especially for levels Substantial and High.   The use of SMS OTP in some eID schemes raises many discussion points regarding the  protection it can provide against a potential attack. Specific guidance on this technology  may be useful for identity providers.   As the eIDAS Regulation and CIR 2015/1502 do not require a specific certification scheme  for devices used within eID means for LoA High, the security assessment of such devices  and the consistency between these assessments may vary. Guidance and further  requirements (e.g. from ENISA and the eIDAS Cooperation Network) would be helpful in  order to ensure the security level of such devices, and explain how they maintain their  security level over time.  It is worth developing guidelines (e.g. ENISA, the Competent Authorities, the eIDAS  Cooperation Network) for some of the aforementioned topics to ensure consistency of eID  schemes across the Member States. These guidelines would benefit from an overview ofthe eID  technology and evolution of threats in this field.  Role of ENISA  Under the Cybersecurity Act, ENISA’s role in the eIDAS electronic identification landscape is to  support the development and implementation of Union policy, by proving advice and issuing  technical guidelines , also for promoting a common understanding of requirements for LoA and  to facilitate the exchange of best practices between competent authorities.  To that extent,  several opportunities to be leveraged by ENISA have been identified, including:   Support  national initiatives and intiatives of the Cooperation Network on issuing  technical and security requirements for eID: ENISA should work with national  competent authorities across the European Union, as well as with the Cooperation  Network,to identify their initiatives and facilitate the exchange of best practices on  technical and security requirements for the Substantial and High Levels of Assurance of  eIDAS.   Provide an overview of  technological advances and monitor the security of notified  schemes: Due to its mandate to support the European Union to improve cybersecurity,  ENISA has a role to play in reporting on the notified security of notified schemes. An  overview of technological advances should be carried out and ENISA should facilitate the  exahange of best practices and vulnerabilities between the Member States.   Publish an annual report on security incidents for eID: ENISA should publish an  annual report aggregating all security incidents which impacted notified electronic  identification schemes, alongside with an overview of the threat landscape for eID  underlying technologies.   Provide guidance on best practice for specific technologies upon request: ENISA  should publish guidelines and recommendations to ensure a consistent understanding of  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  8  the requirements of the CIR 2015/1502 of the eIDAS Regulation. These guidelines could  include use casesregarding compliance of specific technologies and solutions.   Bring insights to the eIDAS review table: ENISA will also be involved in the eIDAS  review process which is due in July 2020. As such, it should bring its technical expertise  and insights to define how the Regulation is fit for purpose and identify areas for  improvement related to electronic identification.  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  9  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1 SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES  Regulation (EU) No 910/20141 (hereafter the eIDAS Regulation) regulates the internal market  for Trust services in the EU, contributing to the implementation of the European Digital Single  Market. Furthermore, the eIDAS Regulation establishes the cross-border recognition of national  electronic identification schemes, in cases where Member States have notified these electronic  identification schemes.  One of the objectives of this Regulation is to remove existing barriers to the cross-border use of  the electronic identification means used in the Member States for authentication, at least for  public services. This Regulation does not aim to interfere with electronic identity management  systems and related infrastructures established in the Member States. Its goal is to ensure that  secure electronic identification and authentication can be used to access cross-border online  services offered by Member States.  The mandatory cross-border recognition of notified eID schemes and means applies since  September 2018. Following the publication and recognition process of eID schemes, citizens  and companies, equipped with a notified eID means, should be able to access online public  services in every Member State. The notification process ensures that all notified national eID  schemes meet the interoperability and security requirements established in the eIDAS  Regulation.  Electronic identification (or eID) constitutes a digital solution, which provides proof of identity for  citizens or organisations, to access online services or conduct online transactions. The objective  of this report is to overview the state of play of current technologies providing eID solutions,  outline the key trends that will guide its evolution, elaborate on security considerations and  recommendations on these technologies and provide a first insight into the envisioned role of  ENISA in this area. The target audience of the report consists of eIDAS stakeholders and third  parties interested in providing eID solutions.  1.2 THE LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK  1.2.1 Electronic identification in the eIDAS Regulation  The eIDAS Regulation provides a common foundation for secure electronic interaction between  citizens, businesses and public authorities. The Regulation aims at increasing the effectiveness  of public and private online services, electronic business and electronic commerce in the Union.  To this end, it includes provisions for electronic identification and trust services.  The provisions on electronic identification are new as this topic was not addressed in the  previous 1999/93/EC Directive superseded by the eIDAS Regulation. These provisions are  detailed in Articles 6 to 16 of the regulation and refer to notions of electronic identification,  electronic identification means and electronic identification schemes:   “Electronic identification” relates to the process of using personal identification data in an  electronic form, uniquely representing either a natural or a legal person, or a natural person  representing a legal person.  1 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/ES/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/ES/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  10   “Electronic identification means” is the material and/or immaterial unit containing the  personal identification data and which is used for authentication to an online service, and   “Electronic identification scheme” is the system for electronic identification under which  electronic identification means are issued to natural or legal persons, or natural persons  representing legal persons.  The regulation introduces several provisions, which aim to build a framework allowing citizens to  use their electronic identification means across borders with a shared level of trust. The  provisions primarily encompass the following elements, in particular:   Notification: an electronic identification scheme can be notified to the Commission in order  to benefit from cross-border recognition. Member States can submit eID schemes for pre-  notification following a pre-defined template that describes the key principles of the scheme.  The CID (EU) 2015/1984 defines the circumstances, formats and procedures of notification  for eID schemes. It also provides a notification form to be used by Member States. The pre-  notified schemes are reviewed by eID experts during a peeriveness review process.The  eIDAS Cooperation Network then issues an opinion regarding the compliance of the  electronic identification scheme with eIDAS provisions (especially regarding the compliance  with the requirements on the claimed LoA). The CID (EU) 2015/296 details the conditions on  the cooperation between Member States, including the peer-review of the schemes.   Mutual recognition: electronic identification means that have been issued under notified  electronic identification schemes shall be recognised for cross-border authentication to  access public online services. This mutual recognition is only mandatory for online services  that require electronic identification means with at least a Substantial LoA (meaning  Substantial or High) and for eID schemes whose LoA matches the level required by the  online service. For instance, a German public service requiring a High LoA electronic  identification means shall accept Belgian electronic identification means issued under a  scheme notified to the Commission for the High LoA. The CIR (EU) 2015/1501 provides  further requirements for the interoperability framework that supports the cross-border  authentication.   Level of assurance (LoA): the Regulation introduces three levels of assurance for electronic  identification means issued under notified electronic identification schemes: Low, Substantial  and High. The LoA of the electronic identification means refers to the degree of confidence  that can be put in the claimed identity of a person during an electronic identification using this  electronic identification means. The CIR (EU) 2015/1502 describes the minimum  requirements to be met for each LoA. It mainly details the requirements expected for the  initial identity proofing before issuing the electronic identification means, for the electronic  identification means characteristics (design, issuance and activation, lifecycle management),  for the authentication process and the general requirements for organisation and  management (including requirements for identity providers issuing these electronic  identification means).  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  11  Figure 1: Main regulatory sources on electronic identification within the eIDAS Regulation  Text Date Topic  REGULATION (EU) No 910/2014  OF THE EUROPEAN  PARLIAMENT AND OF THE  COUNCIL2  July 23rd,  2014  Electronic identification and trust services for  electronic transactions in the internal market,  repealing Directive 1999/93/EC, hereafter  eIDAS Regulation  COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING  DECISION (EU) 2015/2963  February 24th,  2015  Procedural arrangements for Member States  cooperation on electronic identification, pursuant  to Article 12(7) of the eIDAS Regulation  COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING  REGULATION (EU) 2015/15014  September  8th, 2015  Interoperability framework, pursuant to Article  12(8) of the eIDAS Regulation  COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING  REGULATION (EU) 2015/15025  September  8th, 2015  Minimum technical specifications and  procedures for assurance levels for electronic  identification, pursuant to Article 8(3) of the  eIDAS Regulation  COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING  DECISION (EU) 2015/19846  November 3rd,  2015  Circumstances, formats and procedures of  notification, pursuant to Article 9(5) of the eIDAS  Regulation  1.2.2 Focus on the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502  The Annex of the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502 (hereafter CIR  2015/1502) details the technical specifications and procedures for each level of assurance for  electronic identification means issued under a notified electronic identification scheme. It is  organised around 4 main sections:   Enrolment   eID means management   Authentication mechanism   Management and organisation.  It is worth noting that compliance with a given LoA for an eID means requires compliance with  all the requirements for this given LoA (i.e. for the 4 sections). This fact differentiates the eIDAS  framework from the NIST SP 800-63-3 framework, which evaluate the identity assurance level  (IAL) and the authentication assurance level (AAL) in separate documents7. This implies that  the “quality” of the identity data verified during the enrolment is correlated with the robustness of  the eID means and the associated level of protection against attacks.  The enrolment section details the requirements for identity proofing and verification. Several  options can be followed to fulfil the requirements for each level. It is interesting to highlight that  a valid eID means can be used during an identity proofing process in order to perform the  identity proofing and collect identity data as long as it has at least the same LoA as the eID  2 Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on the electronic  identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC  3 Commission implementing Decision (EU) 2015/296 of 24 February 2015 on the procedural arrangements for Member  States cooperation on electronic identification, pursuant to Article 12(7) of the eIDAS Regulation  4 Commission implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1501 of 8 September 2015 on the interoperability framework, pursuant  to Article 12(8) of the eIDAS Regulation  5 Commission implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502 of 8 September 2015 on the minimum technical specifications and  procedures for assurance levels for electronic identification, pursuant to Article 8(3) of the eIDAS Regulation  6 Commission implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1984 of 3 November 2015 on circumstances, formats and procedures of  notification, pursuant to Article 9(5) of the eIDAS Regulation  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2015/296/oj https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2015/296/oj https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2015/1501/oj https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2015/1501/oj https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2015/1502/oj https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2015/1502/oj https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2015/1984/oj https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2015/1984/oj  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  12  means for which the enrolment is performed. In addition, the enrolement section extends the  requirements for legal persons and for the binding between the electronic identification means  of natural and legal persons.  The eID characteristics sections detail the requirements for the eID design, issuance, activation  and lifecycle management. The following elements can be highlighted:   eID based on 2 different authentication factors is mandatory in order to reach LoA  Substantial.   For LoA High, the eID means must be protected against attacks with high potential, and  against duplication and tampering. However, the notion of high attack potential is not  defined in the CIR, but only in the “Guidance for the application of the levels of assurance  which support the eIDAS Regulation” to the CIR, issed by the Cooperation Network8.   Suspension and reactivation are possible, and the reactivation requires that the same  assurance requirements are met as the ones established prior to suspension.   For the renewal process, the CIR does not explicitly mention a maximum duration validity  for an eID means.  Regarding authentication, dynamic authentication is mandatory from LoA Substantial and must  precede the release of the identification data. The authentication mechanisms must be capable  of resisting attacks with enhanced-basic potential for LoA Low, moderate potential for LoA  Substantial and high potential for LoA High respectively.  Finally, the last section on management and organisation details the requirements for  participants that are involved in the eID scheme. These requirements cover general provisions  for the identity providers, the publication of mandatory information, the information security  management, the facility and staff management, the record-keeping, the technical controls and  periodic audits.  From a holistic global perspective, it is worth noting that:   These requirements are agnostic to the underlying technologies used for the eID means.  Even if the requirements could, for instance, suggest the use of a dully certified  cryptographic module to protect data used in an authentication mechanism for an LoA  High eID, no reference to any solution or technology is made, as well as no explicit  requirement in terms of certification scheme to be followed for eID means.   The requirements do not refer to any standards or norms (for instance, ISO 27001 for  information security management, etc.) that could be used to ensure compliance. Even if  the international standard ISO/IEC 29115 is mentioned in the recitals of the 2015/1502  CIR, no reference to this standard is made in the Annex which details the requirements.  Instead, relevant reference is only provided in the “Guidance for the application of the  levels of assurance which support the eIDAS Regulation” to the CIR, issued by the  Cooperation Network.  1.2.3 Focus on the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1501  The Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1501 (hereafter CIR 2015/1501) sets the  technical and operational requirements of the interoperability framework in order to ensure the  interoperability of the electronic identification schemes which Member States notify to the  Commission.  8 Retrieved from the European Commission website:  https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Guidance+documents?preview=/40044784/40044786/Guidanc e%20on%20Levels%20of%20Assurance.docx  https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Guidance+documents?preview=/40044784/40044786/Guidance%20on%20Levels%20of%20Assurance.docx https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Guidance+documents?preview=/40044784/40044786/Guidance%20on%20Levels%20of%20Assurance.docx  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  13  It introduces the notion of eIDAS nodes which are used to ensure the connection between  Member States. The Regulation elaborates on the requirements that these nodes must satisfy  in terms of interoperability, data protection or messages used for communication between  nodes, even if no specific standards are mentioned for these purposes. The only standard that  has been referenced is the ISO/IEC 27001 for the security management of the node operator.  There are no specific requirements for the security of the node regarding the LoA of the  electronic identification processed.  The Regulation also mandates the Cooperation Network to issue opinions on technical  specifications (see section 2.1.1.2), which could support the interoperability framework, and the  Commission to provide a reference implementation as an example, which Member States can  apply or use as a sample for testing. The CIR also defines the minimum data set required for  person identification in a cross-border context, namely the minimum data set that the eIDAS  nodes exchange between them.  1.3 OVERVIEW OF NOTIFIED AND PRE-NOTIFIED eID SCHEMES UNDER  THE eIDAS REGULATION  1.3.1 Landscape of notified and pre-notified eID schemes  For many years, certain European countries have been offering digital identities to their citizens.  The approach was mainly based on electronic identities supported initially by a national identity  card with an electronic chip. For example, Finland was the first country to roll out a national eID  card in 19999.  Since the eIDAS Regulation has come into force, several Member States have notified an eID  scheme. At the time of this report, more than half of European citizens10 have the ability to use  notified (or pre-notified) eID means, thus benefiting from mutual recognition that was made  mandatory since 29th September 2018. The notification pace has increased in the last months,  and 15 Member States11 have launched the procedure of notifying and pre-notifying eID  schemes.

In 2018, the number of notification processes increased notably with six Member States  notifying eID schemes between September and the end of December 2018:   Italy, with its SPID scheme, which includes multiple eID means provided by several identity  providers for Low, Substantial and High assurance levels (depending on the type of eID  means used).   Estonia, with six eID schemes based on the national identity card, the resident permit card, a  dedicated card (Digi-ID), the diplomatic card and the e-resident card, as well as a mobile  scheme based on a dedicated PKI-enabled SIM (Mobiil-ID), all for assurance level High.   Belgium, Croatia, Luxembourg, and Spain notified eID schemes based on their electronic  national identity cards for assurance level High.  In 2019, six more Member States notified their eID schemes for the first time:   Portugal and the Czech Republic with eID schemes based on the electronic national identity  card for the assurance level High.   The UK with GOV.UK Verify, with eID means issued by private players (bank, post office, etc.)  appointed by the UK government, for the assurance levels Low and Substantial.   The Netherlands with a business-oriented scheme (for legal persons) for the levels  Substantial and High depending on the identity provider (3 identity providers identified in the  schemes providing various eID means).   Slovakia with an eID card-based scheme for nationals and foreigners for the assurance level  High.   Latvia with a card-based scheme (eID card and dedicated card) as well as a mobile  application for the assurance levels Substantial and High.  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  15  While also in 2019 two countries notified a second eID scheme:   Italy with a scheme based on electronic identity cards for the assurance level High.   Belgium with the FAS/itsme scheme, a solution provided by Belgian Mobile ID based on a  smartphone application as eID means, for the assurance level High.  In addition, at the delivery date of this report, two schemes were awaiting the completion of the  notification process with the publication in the Official Journal of the EU, after the Cooperation  Network had already published their corresponding Opinions12:   The Chave Móvel Digital, issued by Portugal, notified for the assurance level High, which is  based on certificates issued in a remote environment (also providing qualified electronic  signature compliant with CEN TS 419 241) and accessed through an authentication  mechanism involving a login/password which is coupled with hardware OTP sent through a  mobile application (through push notification).   The NemID scheme for Denmark. Similarly to the SPID scheme in Italy, NemID encompasses  a broad set of eID means ranging from basic card code (list of code to be chosen based on a  line and a column number) to a smartphone app and hardware OTP generator.  And two more schemes were going through peer review processes after being pre-notified by  their respective Member States:   The eID / ATK scheme for Lithuania, based on the Lithuanian national identity card.   The DigiID for the Netherlands, an eID scheme for natural persons based on a smartphone  application.  Finally, there is a need for further analysis13 for the third scheme proposed by Portugal (Sistema  de Certificação de Atributos Profissionais) to assess whether it meets the definition of an  electronic identification scheme, as defined by the eIDAS Regulation. It should be highlighted  that each peer review report should be considered holistically and judgement on security  components can not be drawn in isolation.  1.3.2 Considerations regarding eID means for notified and pre-notified  eID schemes  The first set of eID schemes notified in 2017 and 2018 is mainly based on electronic national  identity cards that offer electronic identification capabilities with their chip. This choice was  consistent as these countries have a long tradition in issuing these cards with a broad  population coverage. This approach takes advantage of an existing physical element, issued  during a process which allows strong identity proofing, and does not require additional physical  hardware deployment (which will increase logistics concerns and costs) to ensure a high level of  security. However, the technical specifications of the applet used on the chip of these cards, for  the chip based eID schemes that use this feature, and the way they are used (contact or  contactless) may vary from one country to another.  Many countries use chips to perform classic identification, authentication and signature features  based on electronic certificates. These cards commonly benefit from a Common Criteria  certification (typically with EAL 4 augmented with AVA_VAN.5) 14. This ensures an adequate  level of protection against duplication and tampering and attacks with high attack potential,  should the solution be used under the target of evaluation. They also commonly follow  12 Opinions of the Cooperation Network are publicly available here:  https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Opinions+of+the+Cooperation+Network  13 See Opinion No. 06/2018 of the Cooperation Network on the Portuguese eID scheme  14 https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/pps/  https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Opinions+of+the+Cooperation+Network https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=71763926  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  16  protection profiles for secure signature creation (such as the Protection Profile for Secure  Signature Creation Device - Part 2: Device with Key Generation15). This is, for instance, the  case for the notified schemes based on eID cards in 2018 (Italy, Estonia, Spain, Croatia,  Luxembourg, Belgium). Portugal also followed this approach for its electronic identity card.  Germany adopted a different approach for its eID scheme notified in 2017. Taking into account  strong privacy concerns while building the scheme, the application on the chip follows the BSI  technical guidelines TR-0311016 that extend security mechanisms, which are endorsed by  ANSSI and were later described in ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) Doc 930317  in order to provide electronic identification features. This notably includes PIN management (not  managed for Doc 9303 electronic travel document such as a passport chip). During a general  authentication procedure, it is ensured that the user correctly knows the PIN code (through  password verification using the PACE protocol18) and that the terminal trying to authenticate is  authorised (through terminal authentication v2 defined in the Technical Report). Data integrity  and authenticity of the eIDAS token are also ensured through Passive Authentication and Chip  Authentication extended for this TR-03110. In addition, the German eID scheme brings  advanced privacy features, such as the ability to perform pseudonymous (sector-specific)  identification and signature, in order to avoid the use of a unique identifier. In this scheme, there  is no central state-operated identity provider that performs authentication. Any service provider  willing to authenticate users based on their eID must be authorised and performs the  authentication directly (using a middleware provided by Germany). By 2019, approximately 69  millions German eID cards were issued (the eID application was already enabled on  approximately 30 million eID cards)19  REMARK  The newly adopted Regulation (EU) 2019/115720 on strengthening the security of identity  cards of Union citizens and of residence documents issued to Union citizens and their family  members aims at converging towards a common target for national identity cards issued by  Member States. The National Identity Cards will, therefore, need to comply with the ICAO Doc  9303, but may contain other applications that use more advanced security mechanisms.  Identity cards will contain a chip with an ICAO compliant application that can be used as an  electronic travel document, as is already the case for some of the notified eID schemes, which  are national eID cards. Member States will implement security protocols described in the Doc  9303 for electronic travel documents (relevant to basic access control, supplemental access  control or extended access control for fingerprint protection). As all European identity cards  shall be compliant, this could be a lever to develop electronic identity schemes and solutions  based on these standards, like the Alicem eID solution currently being developed in France  (using an ICAO chip on passport or resident permit, with a mobile app and an NFC  smartphone), which however has not been pre-notified yet.  It is also worth noting that the Regulation authorises Member States to store data for  electronic services such as e-government and e-business in the identity card. Thereby, this  does not question the approach of using a national identity card as an eID means.  15 https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/ppfiles/pp0059b_pdf.pdf  16 Germany’s Federal Office for Information Security, 2016.

The Estonian Mobiil-ID which is card based, the Latvian eParaksts, the  Portuguese Chave Móvel Digital, the Belgian FAS/itsme eID, the Danish NemID, and some of  the eID means issued under the Italian SPID scheme are examples, amongst others, of notified  or pre-notified solutions that follow this trend. The technologies behind the scheme are thus  different.  Mobiil-ID uses a specific SIM-card that is issued by mobile operators under contractual  agreement. This SIM card has an embedded dedicated application for electronic identification  and electronic signature. SIM cards provided are Common Criteria certified and are QSCD for  electronic signature. The part used by the operator of telecommunication services is out of  scope of this qualification. The user has two different PIN codes in order to use the  authentication certificate for electronic identification or the signature certificate for electronic  signature. The solution supports both RSA and elliptic curves for the private key used for  authentication and signature.  Regarding Chave Móvel Digital or itsme, the approach is different as the keys used for  authentication are stored in a remote environment. The security of the scheme strongly relies on  the authentication mechanism that is used on the mobile device to access these keys when  triggering the authentication process and especially on how these devices protect any kind of  secret used within the authentication mechanism.  For itsme, the solution is based on a smartphone application that needs to be enrolled, either  through an authentication solution managed by a registered bank (the registered banks are the  IDPs)  or by using the national identity card (also notified as an eID means by Belgium). The  authentication mechanism requires the user to type a PIN code (chosen during enrolment) in  the enrolled application after receiving a notification. The PIN could be replaced by a biometric21  factor supported by the smartphone (fingerprint or facial recognition depending on the  smartphone).  SPID and NemID also provide users with a mobile application (amongst other solutions such as  hardware token for these “multi eID means” schemes). Mobile applications could be used to  generate an OTP to copy on, as it is the case for SPID or with an out of band confirmation after  receiving a notification and typing a PIN for NemID.  1.4 eID KEY EVOLUTIONARY TENDENCIES AND OTHER  CONSIDERATIONS  1.4.1 Increasing usage of mobile-based systems  As described in section 1.3, mobile-based identification schemes are already in place in several  European countries, including Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Latvia,  Lithuania, Norway, and Sweden.  Other Member States also investigate the use of mobile-based electronic identification  schemes, as mobile usage has surpassed desktop usage worldwide (53% of website visits were  made via mobile in 201822), the mobile transactions are on the rise and these mobile  transactions require a seamless, secure identification, which will perhaps be mobile-based.  21 The Opinion No. 8/2019 of the Cooperation Network thus indicates, amongst other, that the use of biometric  authentication must be disabled to meet requirements for LoA High  22 Retrieved from StatCounter website: https://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/desktop-mobile/worldwide/#yearly- 2018-2018-bar  https://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/desktop-mobile/worldwide/#yearly-2018-2018-bar https://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/desktop-mobile/worldwide/#yearly-2018-2018-bar  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  18  This trend relies on a high and increasing mobile penetration in Europe (85% in 2017 and  estimated to go up to 88% in 202523). Mobile identity services are expected to be used across  many sectors, from banking to public services. Mobile-based systems have the advantage of  offering convenience and security. For example, mobile applications could leverage functionality  offered by mobile devices, such as geolocation and biometric features.  Moreover, mobile devices tend to increasingly make use of cryptographic modules, such as  Trusted Execution Environments, Secure Elements, eSIMs and iSIMs. eID schemes which  utilise these cryptographic modules could thus have an improved security.  1.4.2 Biometrics – shifting towards multimodal and behavioural  Biometric authentication is on the rise: by 2022, 5.6 billion mobile devices will be used to verify  1.37 trillion transactions24. These transactions will leverage upon built-in sensors on  smartphones.  As using a single biometric modality poses certain weaknesses, multimodal biometric systems  and behavioural biometrics are gaining traction. However, it should be noted that behavioural  biometrics are not among the authentication factors authorized for eID schemes according to  CIR 2015/150225. Single modality, even if used in multi-factor authentication environments, can  be hacked or hijacked. For example, authentication mechanisms always revert to a password  when a biometric authentication fails (see also section 1.1.1.1AB.3 on additional security  considerations regading biometrics). In response, multimodal biometric systems will be  increasingly used. The different types of multimodal biometric systems are mentioned in Figure  3.  Figure 3: Types of multimodal biometric systems26  System Definition  Multiple sensors  A system obtaining data through multiple sensors using one  biometric feature  Multiple samples  A system with multiple algorithms processing a single biometric  feature  Multiple traits A system consolidating multiple occurrences of the same body trait  Multiple instances  A system using multiple templates of the same biometric method  obtained with the help of a single sensor (e.g. multiple fingerprints  from different fingers)  Multiple representations  A system combining information about the biometric features of the  individual  23 GSMA, 2018.

Behavioural biometrics (see also 1.1.1.1AB.3 for a more extensive definition of behavioural  biometrics) are also becoming popular because of their convenience and continuous  authentication capabilities. Their collection is transparent for the user: they are, for instance  collected through pressure of fingers on the screen, how quickly someone types, the angle at  which the device is held, etc. The global behavioural biometrics market is predicted to reach  $3,922.4 Million by 202527.  1.4.3 Private sector involvement  Traditionally, governments would issue identity documents to citizens who would then use them  to prove their identity in the physical world. However, this identity ecosystem is changing with  private sector organisations being more and more involved, providing identity solutions or  services to both their own customers and other entities.  For example, according to GSMA, banks collectively spent more than $1 billion on identity  solutions in 201728, making them the world’s largest investors, even over public institutions.  Financial organisations, post offices and telecommunication operators, traditionally have been  conducting identity proofing. They are now leveraging their procedures to resell this service to  other organisations that rely on verified identities. Several identity schemes based on a  federation of private sector identity providers are already notified under eIDAS, including SPID  in Italy29, GOV.UK Verify in the United Kingdom30 and FAS/itsme in Belgium31.  Government issued eIDs could also be used to “verify” or “endorse” identities provided by other  organisations, including those with Mobile Connect authentication means.  1.4.4 Privacy concerns  Privacy is a key topic driven by user preoccupation, a rights framework and a strong legal  framework in the EU32. This trend impacts digital identities: sharing a digital identity online is  practical to access services, but once authentication is performed, the question is what happens  to the shared data. Citizens should have the right to keep control of their personal data and its  use. They are entitled to a digital identity under their own control, to use different verified  attributes to access a range of services as and when needed. Only information that needs to be  shared should be exchanged, and the identity proofing using multiple pieces of personal  information should only happen once.  A privacy-centric approach would enable citizens to prove a specific fact instead of releasing the  underlying data – for example, proving “I’m over 18” instead of providing the full date of birth or  proving “I’m a British citizen” instead of handing over full passport details. These practices are in  line with the data minimization principle resulting from the data protection legislation.  Germany’s eID takes into account these privacy principles: the unique identifier is only present  on the German eID and is never shared with the service provider; only a pseudonym is shared  27 https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/behavioral-biometrics-market  28 https://www.gsma.com/identity/digital-identity-expect-2018  29 Agenzia per l’Italia Digitale, n.d.

Similar features apply to  Luxembourg’s eID card, while  the UK has made this topic a major trend in their 2019 Call for  Evidence around Digital Identity, referencing to security concerns34.  1.4.5 Self-Sovereign Identities and Verifiable Claims  Privacy concerns described in the previous chapter originated the Self-Sovereign Identities  (SSI) approach. This approach is based on the idea that users should manage their own  Personally Identifiable Data and make sure that only the pieces  of information which are  absolutely necessary to  to prove their legitimacy will be shared with the service provider in  order to access their services. A self-managed identity framework no longer requires centralised  systems to manage the lifecycle of identities, and a decentralised system is needed to  implement this approach. Blockchain is a technology that offers both a decentralised operating  model and immutability ensuring the data integrity. It is thus able to support such an approach  (see also B.4.1 for additional details), although it is not the only technology for implementing  Self-Sovereign schemes. However, under the eIDAS framework, a central entity, to enrol and  verify identity data, is always necessary, as eID under eIDAS is based on verified identities.  One important aspect of the Self-Sovereign Identity approach is the fact that the user can share  only relevant personal data to service providers. To illustrate this, we can consider a sport-  betting website where only adults can use their services: in a classic authentication scheme, the  user will need to communicate his/her date of birth (probably alongside an identity card  containing other personal information) to prove he/she is an adult. Thus, realising more  information that the website truly needs. The only information the service must know is the  answer to the question “Is the user over 18 years old? (or 21, depending on the country)”. In a  Self-Sovereign Identity scheme, the user will prove he/she is “over the age of 18”, without  having to share his/her actual birth date. The statement that the user is over the age of 18 is  called a “Verifiable Claim” than can be previously validated by a trusted identity provider.  Trust in these Verifiable Claims is necessary for public and private services to use Self-  Sovereign Identities. Underlying this trust is the question of where the Personally Identifiable  Information comes from and how it was imported. The maturity of Self-Sovereign Identities  solutions and the amount of services using this technology will only grow once this question is  addressed.  The first implementations of these approaches are already taking place, such as the one being  developed by the Sovrin Foundation35. Canada has also issued a challenge to propose  technical solutions to support these approaches36. In Europe, the regional Catalan government  presented in September 2019 IdentiCAT, a decentralized digital identity project based on the  blockchain technology, in the form of a mobile application expected in 202037.  33 Federal Office for Information Security, 2017.

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS  2.1 DOCUMENTS AND STANDARDS REGARDING eID SECURITY  2.1.1 eID related European documentation: Guidance on Levels of  Assurance  The Cooperation Network has released a guidance document38 for the application of the levels  of assurance which support the eIDAS Regulation. This document follows the CIR 2015/1502  plan and provides guidance and examples to illustrate how the requirements described in the  CIR could be met (for Low, Substantial and High LoA). The document starts by detailing the  applicable definitions from the CIR 2015/1502 Annex:   Authoritative source   Authentication factor, including Possession-based authentication factor, Knowledge-based  authentication factor and Inherent authentication factor   Dynamic authentication   Information security management system.  Following these extensive definitions, the guidance document exhaustively lists the CIR  2015/1502 requirements, following the agenda of the CIR Annex, thus covering the three topics  developed during the peer reviews: enrolment, eID means design and authentication,  organisation and management. It also provides guidance to help identity providers comply with  these requirements.  Regarding the enrolment topic and the comparison between “one or more physical  characteristic” of the applicant “with an authoritative source” for the LoA High, the document  states that if staff is involved in this comparison, the staff must be “sufficiently skilled” and if  automated matching is used, “available best practice should be taken into account”. Best  practices about trained and skilled staff are provided in the document, such as possessing  knowledge of document design, security features, watermarks and printing techniques, and  being able to identify forged and counterfeit documents. However, the current version of the  guidance document does not elaborate on best practices and requirements regarding remote  identity proofing (performed for instance with videoconference or facial recognition), but a  subgroup of the Cooperation Network is currently working on adding parts related to remote  identity proofing.  In the electronic identification means characteristics and creation section, examples of  protection “against duplication and tampering against attacks with high potential” are provided to  satisfy the LoA High:   Embed cryptographic key material in tamper-resistant hardware security module if  possession-based authentication factors are used.   Liveness detection, trusted environment, low false match rate if inherent authentication  factors are used.   Certification against relevant technical standards (e.g. Common Criteria).  38 Retrieved from the European Commission website:  https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Guidance+documents?preview=/40044784/40044786/Guidanc e%20on%20Levels%20of%20Assurance.docx  https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Guidance+documents?preview=/40044784/40044786/Guidance%20on%20Levels%20of%20Assurance.docx https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Guidance+documents?preview=/40044784/40044786/Guidance%20on%20Levels%20of%20Assurance.docx  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  22  The authentication section of this guidance document provides a first insight on how an attack  potential could be interpreted and calculated. The potential of the attacks used in the eIDAS  Regulation (enhanced-basic, moderate and high) considers examples from ISO/IEC 15408  “Information technology – Security techniques – Evaluation criteria for IT security” and ISO/IEC  18045 “Information technology – Security techniques – Methodology for IT security evaluation”.  The document recommends assessing an authentication mechanism taking relevant threats into  account (online guessing, offline guessing, credential duplication, phishing, eavesdropping,  replay attack, session hijacking, man-in-the-middle, credential theft, spoofing and masquerading  are mentioned in the ISO 2911539).  It is worth noting that the document, as it is merely a guidance, provides illustrations and  security considerations. However, it does not provide explicit recommendations and mandatory  protection measures. Consequently, it is not a framework against which conformity with a given  LoA can be assessed. Additionally, guidance is not provided for all the requirements (incl. legal  person identity proofing and verification and renewal and replacement) in the current version.  Additional examples in the relevant sections (for instance eID means design and authentication)  could also be provided in order to give more insights to identity providers and to allow them to  consider these recommendations when designing new eID solutions.  Nonetheless, this guidance document is highly beneficial and should be enriched in the next  version to be adopted by the Cooperation Network, in order to provide eID solution providers  with more examples and guidelines. Some Member States are working on such a guidance  framework that could also be used for evaluation at National level40. The requirements’  framework prepared by ANSSI follows the same structure as the guidance document but  includes more recommendations and requirements that should be applied at national level.  2.1.1.1 Guidance on Notification  The Cooperation Network has also released a guidance document (drafted by Austria, Estonia  and the United Kingdom) for the notification process41, with the objective to provide guidance on  how to fill in the notification form. Currently, this document only provides guidance for two  sections of the notification form. It could be enhanced by providing guidance for each section of  the notification form, taking advantage of the feedback and suggestions of the Cooperation  Network and members of peer reviews that have assessed almost 15 notification forms.  2.1.1.2 Interoperability framework for eID  In line with the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation, technical specifications have been  developed in order to ensure interoperability and help Member States to implement the eIDAS  compliant implementation. The eIDAS Cooperation Network42 has endorsed a new set of  technical specifications (version 1.2) in Opinion No. 5/2019, superseding Opinion No. 2/2016.  The specifications have been developed by Member States and the European Commission  collaborating in the technical subgroup on eID of the eIDAS Cooperation Network.  To provide a comprehensive framework for interoperability, the current version of the technical  specifications consists of four separate documents, each concerning a specific area. This  framework, and especially the cryptographic requirements part, provides useful guidance in  order to ensure the confidentiality and the integrity of the data exchanged during a cross-border  39 Refer to section 2.1.2.2 ISO/IEC 29115:2013 – Entity authentication assurance framework for additional information  40 The requirement framework prepared by ANSSI is not public yet but will be published on the ANSSI website.  41 Retrieved from the European Commission website:  https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Guidance+documents?preview=/40044784/52602661/Guidanc e%20on%20Notification.docx  42 Cooperation Network established by the Commission Decision EU 2015/296 of 24 February 2015  establishing procedural arrangements for cooperation between Member States on electronic identification pursuant to  Article 12(7) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on electronic identification and  trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market - https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015D0296  https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Guidance+documents?preview=/40044784/52602661/Guidance%20on%20Notification.docx https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Guidance+documents?preview=/40044784/52602661/Guidance%20on%20Notification.docx https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015D0296 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015D0296  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  23  authentication process between the nodes. Even if it does not apply to the eID means itself, it  provides key security measures for the eID scheme generally, for the implementation of nodes  and the data exchanges between nodes. Moreover, security flaws or vulnerabilities in the  implementation of the interoperability framework could endanger the whole electronic  identification process.  As a recent example, a vulnerability in the eIDAS node integration package provided by the  European Commission was discovered in June 2019 and publicly disclosed on 29th October  201943. This vulnerability , which exploited a bug in the implementation of the system, identified  a weak procedure to verify the certificates used to sign SAML responses. By creating a  certificate (under relevant assumptions), it was possible to sign SAML responses for which the  signature was considered valid by the receiving MS node. By doing so, it was theoretically  possible, by forging a SAML response, to impersonate an identity in a cross-border  authentication context.  As also explained in section 1.2.3 of this report, the CIR 2015/1501 does not explicitly include  security measures for the nodes and node operators other than the adherence to ISO/IEC  27001 or equivalent. As a next step, an assessment could be carried out to include security  recommendations for node implementation in the Regulation (as per CIR 2015/1502) in order to  align the security of the interoperability part with the one of the eID means.  2.1.2 Other international & third-country frameworks  2.1.2.1 ISO/IEC 29003:2018 – Identity proofing  The ISO/IEC 29003:2018 standard gives guidelines for the identity proofing of a natural person  and specifies levels of identity proofing, as well as requirements to achieve these levels.  Identity proofing is the process to verify identifying attributes to be entered into an identity  management system and to establish that the identifying attributes pertain to the subject to be  enrolled. It includes the collection of identity attributes, the verification of these identity attributes  against authoritative sources and proof that the subject is indeed bound to the claimed identity  attributes.  This standard defines three levels of identity proofing (LoIP) (see  Figure 4). The levels are described as a combination of the assurance in the existence of the  identity and of how it is linked to the applicant. In order to achieve identity proofing at a specific  LoIP, the process shall successfully prove the existence of the identity at that LoIP and the  identity/subject binding at that LoIP.  43 See sec-consult website: https://sec-consult.com/en/blog/2019/10/vulnerability-in-eu-cross-border-authentication- software-eidas-node/  https://sec-consult.com/en/blog/2019/10/vulnerability-in-eu-cross-border-authentication-software-eidas-node/ https://sec-consult.com/en/blog/2019/10/vulnerability-in-eu-cross-border-authentication-software-eidas-node/  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  24  Figure 4: Levels of identity proofing (LoIP) under ISO/IEC 29003:2018  LoIP Definition  Requirements regarding  the existence of the  identity  Requirements  regarding the  identity/applicant  binding  LoIP1  Low confidence in the claimed or asserted  identity (identity is unique within the  context, there is an assumption the identity  exists, and the subject is assumed to be  bound to the identity).  The identifying attributes are  accepted without carrying  any checks.  The binding is  accepted without  carrying any checks.  LoIP2  Moderate confidence in the claimed or  asserted identity (identity is unique within  the context, it’s moderately established that  the identity exists, and the subject has  some binding to the identity).  The identifying attributes  exist in corroborative  evidence.  The binding was  checked using one  factor.  LoIP3  High confidence in the claimed or asserted  identity (identity is unique within the  context, it’s strongly established that the  identity exists, and the subject has a strong  binding to the identity).  The identifying attributes  exist in authoritative  evidence.  The binding was  checked using two  or more factors.  Levels of identity proofing should be selected based on a risk assessment of the subsequent  service and/or credential to be provided.  2.1.2.2 ISO/IEC 29115:2013 – Entity authentication assurance framework  The ISO/IEC 29115:2013 standard provides a framework for entity authentication assurance.  An entity can be either a natural person or a legal person, referred to as NPE for Non-Person  Entity throughout the document. After defining four levels of assurance (from LoA1 to LoA4) and  different actors, the security considerations are organised in three sections: the enrolment  phase, the credential management phase and the entity authentication phase. Guidance is also  provided regarding management and organisational considerations (e.g. legal and contractual  compliance, information security management and audit, external service components).  The four levels of assurance are described as followed:   1 – Low: Little or no confidence in the claimed or asserted identity but enough confidence  that the entity is the same over consecutive authentication events   2 – Medium: Some confidence in the claimed or asserted identity   3 – High: High confidence in the claimed or asserted identity   4 – Very high: Very high confidence in the claimed or asserted identity.  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  25  Levels of assurance are to be selected based on a risk assessment of the transactions or  services for which the entities will be authenticated. The standard provides a table to facilitate  this risk assessment by suggesting possible consequences and impacts of authentication failure  at the various LoAs. For example, if the personal safety of an entity could be substantially  impacted by an authentication failure, then the appropriate LoA is Very high.  Security considerations, called controls, are listed relating to threats, i.e. specific examples of  what an attacker could do. For enrolment and credential management considerations, these  threats are translated into controls based on the level of assurance: security considerations are  stronger for a High LoA than for a Low. The authentication phase is described differently: most  security considerations are applicable to all levels of assurance and should be applied as  determined by a risk assessment.  One key enrolment security consideration is that the enrolment must be completed in person  (for a natural person) to reach a very High LoA while it is not a requirement in the CIR  2015/1502 (remote enrolment could be used for LoA High). Another credential management  control is that credentials shall be contained on a hardware security module to achieve a very  High LoA. On their part, the authentication-related controls range from Multi-Factor-  Authentication to the adoption of anti-phishing measures and anti-counterfeiting measures on  devices holding credentials.  This ISO standard is quoted in recitals of the CIR 2015/1502, stating it was taken into account  for the specifications and procedures set out in the implementing act, but the requirements of  the CIR do not reference any specific section or requirement of the standard. Some Member  States, however, provide references to this ISO standard in their notification form.  2.1.2.3 NIST SP 800-63 – Digital Identity Guidelines  In 2017, NIST published four volumes to provide technical requirements for American federal  agencies implementing digital identity services. The guidelines define technical requirements in  the areas of identity proofing, registration, authenticators, management processes,  authentication protocols, federation and related assertions. These guidelines are agnostic to the  vast array of identity service architectures that can be developed and used.  The four volumes are the following:   SP 800-63-3: Digital Identity Guidelines44   SP 800-63A: Enrollment and Identity Proofing45   SP 800-63B: Authentication and Lifecycle Management46   SP 800-63C: Federation and Assertions47.  Unlike the eIDAS Regulation where levels of assurance are described in tandem to identity and  authentication, the levels of assurance in the NIST document, called xALs, are broken down  into independent levels regarding:   Identity proofing (Identity Assurance Level: IAL)   Authenticators (Authenticator Assurance Level: AAL)   Federated assertions (Federation Assurance Level: FAL), referring to the strength of an  assertion in a federated environment, used to communicate authentication and attribute  information to a relying party.  44 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63-3  45 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63a  46 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63b  47 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63c  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63-3 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63a https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63b https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63c  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  26  Each xAL has three levels, from xAL1 to xAL3. IALs must be selected by service providers  based on their risk profile and on the potential harm caused by an attacker making a successful  false claim of an identity. AALs must be selected based on the risk profile and the potential  harm caused by an attacker taking control of an authenticator and accessing the service. FALs  must be selected based on the risk profile and the potential harm caused by an attacker taking  control of federated transactions. Flowcharts are made available in the SP 800-63-3 volume to  help service providers perform a risk assessment in order to select their three xALs.  It is worth noting that all combinations of Identity Assurance Levels and Authenticator  Assurance Levels are acceptable, except AAL1 with IAL1 with personal data, and IAL2 and  IAL3, as passwords on their own are not enough to protect personal information according to  the E.O. 1368148 (section 3: “all agencies making personal data accessible to citizens through  digital applications require the use of multiple factors of authentication and an effective identity  proofing process, as appropriate.”).  One topic to highlight in the NIST guidelines is the “in-person proofing”. “In-person proofing” is  required at IAL3 and can be satisfied in either of two ways:   A physical interaction with the applicant, supervised by an operator; or   A remote interaction with the applicant, supervised by an operator, based on a strict set of  requirements, including:   A seamless monitoring of the credential service provider during the entire identity  proofing session from which the application shall not depart, for example, by a  continuous high-resolution video transmission of the applicant through an agency-  controlled device.   A monitoring of the entire identity proofing session by a live operator participating  remotely, previously trained to detect potential fraud and to perform a supervised remote  proofing session.   A digital verification of evidence (e.g. via chip or wireless technologies) performed by  integrated scanners and sensors.   Communications occurring over a mutually authenticated protected channel.  Another highlight of these technical guidelines regarding authentication is that authorised  authenticator types are listed for each AAL.  Regarding out-of-band authenticators, the document forbids OTPs via email (“[Authentication]  methods that do not prove possession of a specific device, such as voice-over-IP (VOIP) or  email, SHALL NOT be used for out-of-band authentication”) and places restrictions on the use  of SMS for OTP49. The use of the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) for out-of-band  verification is stated as “RESTRICTED” and NIST may adjust this status over time based on the  evolution of the threat landscape and the technical operation of the PSTN. Implementing a  RESTRICTED authenticator requires the agency to assess, understand, and accept the risk  associated with that authenticator.  The use of biometrics in the document is only partially supported for authentication because of  known limitations of such technologies (need to manage relevant False Match Rate, result of a  comparison is not deterministic, risk of theft of biometrics template without possible revocation,  48 https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/10/17/executive-order-improving-security-consumer- financial-transactions  49 Referred in the FAQ as authenticators leveraging the public switched telephone network (as for phone OTP as well).  Restrictions for such authenticators include to verify that the pre-registered telephone number is associated with a specific  physical device, to bind a new authenticator if the registered phone number changes, not to display the authentication  secret while the device is locked and to request a PIN, passcode or biometric to view, ask the user to accept the reception  of this secret.  https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/10/17/executive-order-improving-security-consumer-financial-transactions https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/10/17/executive-order-improving-security-consumer-financial-transactions  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  27  etc.). They should only be used as part of a multi-factor authentication process with a physical  authenticator, and additional requirements apply50.  Lastly, privacy is a strong concern of these technical guidelines. Many different measures are  listed, for instance:   The collection and processing of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) shall be limited to  the minimum necessary to validate the existence of the claimed identity and associate the  claimed identity with the applicant providing identity evidence for appropriate identity  resolution, validation and verification.   The Credential Service Provider shall provide explicit notice to the applicant regarding the  purpose for collecting and maintaining a record of the attributes necessary for identity  proofing, including whether such attributes are voluntary or mandatory to complete the  identity proofing process, and the consequences for not providing the attributes.   Multiple analysis and actions should be performed to frame the use of PII (perform privacy  risk assessments, consult with the Senior Agency Official for Privacy, publish a System of  Records Notice, publish a Privacy Impact Assessment, etc.).  It is important to note that the NIST SP 800-6351 provides very detailed and specific  requirements that are directly bound to specific types of authenticators or solutions. This is also  a noticeable difference with the eIDAS approach which remains technology agnostic. On one  hand, it allows very detailed guidelines for identity providers that want to set up an eID scheme.  On the other hand, it will require an extensive update process as technologies and solutions  evolve very quickly.  2.1.2.4 CEN/TR 419010 – Framework for standardisation of signature – extended  structure including electronic identification and authentication  The purpose of this technical report is to analyse the impact of CIR 2015/1501 and 2015/1502  on the already published standards for electronic signature and to analyse if updates or further  standards for identification and authentication are needed.  The technical report starts by providing an overview of the CIR 2015/1502 on levels of  assurance for eID means and the CIR 2015/1501 on the interoperability framework. The report  also mentions that a comprehensive framework for eID interoperability has also been published,  covering interoperability architecture, SAML message format, SAML attribute profile and  cryptographic requirements for SAML and TLS.  The core of the report describes the potential impact of both CIR 1501 and 1502 on the framework  for the standardisation of signature as described in ETSI/TR 119 000. Specifically, it details the  foreseen impact or evolution on the six functional areas of the framework:   Signature creation and validation   Signature creation and other related devices   Cryptographic suites   Trust Services providers supporting digital signature   Trust application services providers   Trust service status list providers.  The considerations mainly focus on the cases where the standards could benefit from the  provision brought by eIDAS on electronic identification (especially considering interoperability  50 Refer to NIST SP 800-63B section 5.2.3. for these additional requirements.  51 The SP 800-63 also includes a FAQ that gives useful examples for a better understanding of the publications.  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  28  architecture with 2015/1501 and LoA with 2015/1502). For instance, references to identification  and authentication are relevant:   When an identity proofing is required to issue a certificate or   When authentication of the signer is required to activate a remote signature process.  The considerations are thus not focused on the eID solution itself. Besides, the CEN/TR 419010  report, published in 2017, references several standards that have evolved since. The analysis  could thus be updated to provide a contemporary overview of the standardisation situation and  examine how to further expand the existing standards (e.g. by adding references to relevant  identification or authentication provisions for instance).  The last section of the technical report identifies possible areas where additional standards  could be developed in the field of eID. It notably identifies that standards are needed for identity  providers (as for trust services providers). Especially, it could cover technical specifications for:   Policy requirements for identity providers issuing identification and authentication services for  a considered authentication level of assurance.   Profile for protocol and/or data format for a considered authentication level of assurance for  identity providers.   Compliance testing of these profiles.  The second topic identified as relevant for standardisation is devices supporting identification  and authentication. Standards developed around this topic could describe eIDAS compliant eID  application profiles and conformity assessment methodologies52.  2.2 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS FOR eID SOLUTIONS BASED ON  PEER REVIEW FEEDBACK  2.2.1 Introduction  This section highlights the security considerations that emerged from the various peer reviews of  the eID schemes which have already been pre-notified to the European Commission by Member  States. These considerations are of interest, as they highlight recommendations to be followed  for a targeted LoA. These considerations cover the main topics that are studied during peer  reviews, following the structure of the CIR 2015/1502:   Enrolment   Electronic identification means management and authentication   Management and organisation.  These considerations and recommendations are not exhaustive and are only examples of topics  that raise questions and discussions that could also benefit from further guidance. Further  analysis of the technologies used on eID solutions is provided in the Annex “Technological  landscape of eID solutions”.  2.2.2 Enrolment  2.2.2.1 Verification of document for identity proofing  Peer reviews have highlighted complexity for the verification and validation of identity  documents, especially in the case of foreign identity documents that are used for a request of  an eID (as it is the case for some of the already notified eID schemes). As personnel in charge  of document verification are not always trained to handle such documents, identification could  52 Examples of PP given include for instance the PP for German eID (based on TR 03110) and PP EN 419251 (2013).  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  29  be difficult. These considerations do not apply to a specific scheme but could be faced by any  Member State that needs to verify the identity of non-residents within the scope of their eID  scheme. Some recommendations could thus be identified, including:   International databases such as the Schengen Information System (SIS) or Interpol  databases, PRADO database for verification of optical/physical security features of identity  documents, iFADO (Intranet False and Authentic Documents Online) should be used to  confirm the documents’ validity.   If the verification is performed physically or if the identification is performed solely based  on the picture of a document, a professional and trained agent should assess the validity  of the document.  Consequently, the robustness of the measures in place could affect the assurance that can be  placed in the identification process and thus the associated LoA. This consideration may apply  to all Member States with schemes that are opened to foreigners with foreign-identity  documents.Therefore an EU-wide approach with shared and common guidance could be of  interest for all Member States to address these considerations.  2.2.2.2 Remote identification (video-based) and facial recognition  The use of remote processes for identity proofing before issuing the eID means has been subject  to several security considerations across different peer reviews. This topic is of great interest as  it is now utilised by more processes, and we can expect this use to increase. Besides the use of  remote identification in eID schemes, we can, for instance, mention:   Digital Bank account (know also as neo-bank account) opening that uses a video call with  a bank operator in order to present in front of the camera an identity document and check  that the applicant has the alleged  identity in the identity document.   Car-rental websites that enrol customers by scanning their driving licence to perform a  facial recognition with liveness detection in order to ensure the customer corresponds to  the driving licence.   Remote identification processes already in use for the issuance of qualified certificates for  trust services under eIDAS.  As these processes become more common, we can expect the same for the identity proofing  before the issuance of an eID means by an identity provider. This is already the case for some  of the notified schemes such as Italy (SPID), the Netherlands (eHerkenning) or the UK  (GOV.UK Verify).  The security considerations arising include:   Using a simple photo of the face and of the document raises some questions and remarks  in order to verify if it complies with LoA Substantial. Proven attacks could exist with the  manipulation of the image taken without obvious evidence. This risk could be increased if  the environment is untrustworthy (e.g. a rooted or jailbroken smartphone or an untrusted  webcam on a laptop/desktop).   Rapid developments in video manipulation attacks, such as video simulation and real-time  re-enactement, pose new risks.   It is currently complex to identify which security measures and requirements should  comply with the LoA High, which leads to a non-consensus of experts while evaluating  such technologies against the mentioned LoA. Relevant work in progress, guided by the  Cooperation Network, is expected to address these issues.   Especially for facial recognition, it has been noted that evaluation of assurance is unclear  as there are no guidelines to relate the FAR of a facial recognition solution to an eIDAS  LoA (this is notably mentioned in the publicly available UK peer review).  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  30  In the case of video-based identification, verification of the authenticity of the identity document  and exploitation of the photo by the agent in charge of the verification also raises questions  regarding the associated assurance. In Opinion No. 1/201853 for SPID eID schemes, the  Cooperation Network has issued its opinion taking into account that Italy will remove video  identification for the LoA High. All the above mentioned examples  demonstrate the complexity  of assessing such solutions and the lack of a framework for assessing it.  Knowing that attack vectors could be used at each step of the process, including fake subject,  counterfeit or fake documents presented, manipulation of the video, and the lack of capacity to  verify the user identity by agent, some security measures have already been identified such as:  Using liveness detection along with a facial recognition algorithm. For instance, a random  motion could be requested to the applicant or selfies could be taken in motion. . It should be  noted that liveness detection in this case requires control over the biometric sensor, which in  this scenario is under control of the attacker and not the verifier.   If possible, using a picture already related to the applicant in a national database.  Additional security checks could be carried out in case of doubt.   Verifying the document’s authenticity using Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) or optical  security features (photographs, font type, quality, holograms, laminate integrity, spelling  mistakes, print quality, etc.). It should be noted however, that most of the optical security  features such as holograms cannot be verified properly in the context of remote  identification.   Using a photo extracted from a chip (e.g. passport ICAO chip) with for instance an NFC-  ready smartphone to guarantee the integrity of the data. As this photo would be signed,  verifying the signature would provide assurances for the authenticity of the photo. The  European Regulation standardizing national identity cards54 is an opportunity as it  establishes a common format to protect the photo across Member States.  As the eIDAS Regulation does not prevent remote identification, the Cooperation Network is  currently working onproviding guidance on this topic and examining standardisation  requirements to help assess the solutions that make use of these technologies. It is also worth  noting that this topic already has raised many discussion points between experts as it is also a  major concern for trust services such as the issuance of qualified certificates (i.e. how can the  identity of the certificate holder be verified remotely). Better guidance, standardisation and  conformity assessment practices are highly expected in this area.  2.2.2.3 Qualified electronic signature for enrolment  In case of an identity proofing using a qualified electronic signature, it is relevant to note that  eIDAS (Article 24) allows the use of an eID means complying at least with LoA Substantial or  High, but only if there was a physical presence during the enrolment. Therefore, in the case of  identity proofing for LoA High, some complexity could arise as a qualified signature performed  with a qualified certificate issued with a LoA Substantial eID means may not be accepted as  proof of identity. This consideration must be taken into account when relevant.  2.2.3 Electronic identification means management and authentication  2.2.3.1 eID means using mail or SMS OTP  53 See Opinion No. 1/2018 of the Cooperation Network on the Italian eID scheme  54 Regulation (EU) 2019/1157 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on strengthening the security  of identity cards of Union citizens and of residence documents issued to Union citizens and their family members exercising  their right of free movement  https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=65972774 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32019R1157 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32019R1157 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32019R1157  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  31  SMS or email OTP are known to be subject to various types of attacks (see also annex B.2.1 for  an extensive overview of OTP SMS, link to recent attacks and email security considerations).  OTP delivered through SMS, for instance, could be attacked with:   SS7 vulnerabilities with attackers gaining access to the signalling network used for SMS  transport.   Malware attacks on the smartphone used to re-route SMS without any notification of the  recipient.   SIM swapping attacks that are still common today.  However, for SMS OTP, attacks may be technically complex or may require significant effort to  target a given user. If combined with another authentication factor (such as a password), they  may still remain attractive, providing reasonable protection against several attacks. They are  also familiar to end-users as they are extensively used for online banking and payment.  In  addition, mobile operators could implement more security measures to enhance security  (access to SS7 network, identity check for SIM change, check of SIM changes, etc.)55.  Discussions remain regarding the potential of attacks against which SMS OTP could bring  protection. Acceptability of SMS OTP in eID means targeting LoA High, for instance, is subject  to discussion (schemes with an authentication using SMS OTP and a second factor to trigger  access to keys stored on an HSM).  This topic is currently being discussed between experts.  Specific guidance could be offered in order to clarify vulnerabilities and secure solutions for  SMS OTP.  Regarding mail OTP, these can also be subject to various attacks, the most common being  gaining fraudulent access to the webmail of the user. As this attack type is prevalent and can  scale (e.g. in case of massive account compromise, this could lead to massive risks for mail  OTP), such solutions shouldnot be used even for the Substantial level for eID means.  2.2.3.2 eID mobile-based solutions (software-based, using SE or TEE, SIM-based)  The use of mobile-based eID solutions, in line with end-users’ expectations, is increasing and  will continue to increase in the coming years following the smartphone penetration rate. As the  number of pre-notified and notified mobile-based solutions increases, so do the considerations  that can be highlighted from the reviews and opinions.  One of the key security considerations is the protection of the secrets or cryptographic materials  used within the solution for authentication. Based on the architecture of the solution, the secrets  could be, for instance (the following list is not exhaustive):   Stored on the mobile device encrypted on software key store   Stored on the mobile device on hardware key store such as an embedded secure element  or secure enclave (SE) and used only in a trusted execution environment (TEE) in order to  offer protection of the secrets while stored and used   Stored on the SIM card of the mobile phone, used as a cryptographic chip.  In all cases, the solution may also store other secrets involved in the authentication process in a  remote cryptographic component. The considerations of this section focus on the secrets stored  on the mobile part.  55 According to ENISA’s report of March 2018 (“Signalling Security in Telecom SS7/Diameter/5G - EU level assessment of  the current situation”), in terms of SS7 minimum security measures are adopted by the majority of the providers, and most  operators (87%) implement SMS home routing, to protect their networks against from leaking sensitive information  associated with a subscriber, which would help to mount further attacks. This is only applicable if the owner of the eID  scheme has a relationship to all MNOs whereby he can validate/enforce the applied security measures.  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  32  The latest opinion on the Latvian eParaksts scheme and the Belgian FAS/itsme scheme  (respectively Opinion No. 7/2019 and Opinion No. 8/2019) for the LoA High highlight that such  solutions which use smartphone applications should envisage the use of a hardware key store  such as SE/TEE. The opinions also raise the question of the certification of such SE as they are  mainly not certified against any recognised schemes at the moment, as well as the follow-up of  vulnerabilities on such SE in time. However, it should be noted that not all Member States  concure on introducing requirements for certified components in an eID scheme. It could be  interesting to go further in this analysis by providing an overview of SE/TEE with a list of  certified SEs (if any) and of known vulnerabilities on these components. Such lists would benefit  identity providers issuing mobile-based solutions and would be consistent with the opinions  issued by the Cooperation Network.  Regarding the use of SIM-based solutions to store secrets and cryptographic materials, the  approach is currently followed by Estonia with the Mobiil-ID solution. This solution has been the  subject of discussion during peer review and concerns were raised in Opinion No. 5/2018  regarding the ability of such solutions to be used under the sole control of the user and  therefore provide protection against attacks with high potential (larger attack surface). These  concerns should also apply to solutions using SE/TEE but do not explicitly appear in the related  opinion mentioned in the previous section.  As for the recommendation for SE/TEE, clearer guidance should be provided and it would be  helpful for identity providers in order to help them identify under which conditions SIM-based  solutions can comply with the LoA High, especially by providing protection against attacks with  high potential.  2.2.3.3 Use of biometrics authenticators within eID mobile-based solutions  Consistent with the rise of smartphone-based authentication solutions, the use of embedded  biometrics authenticators is now widespread. They mainly consist in biometric sensors for  fingerprint or for facial recognition. They are operated directly by the operation system (iOS or  Android) and not by the application used for authentication. Commonly, they are used as a  replacement of the PIN code. This raises several considerations (see also section B.3 for  additional security considerations regarding biometrics):   The security of the sensors can vary from one device manufacturer56 to the other with false  acceptance and false rejection rates that could differ.   The solutions often allow to enrol several biometric templates without sufficient checks of  the user enrolling a template. Moreover, the application may not choose which templates  are used during the authentication process. This is an issue to ensure that the user of an  eID is legitimate. In such cases mitigation measures should be applied, as for example  advising the user or even deactivating the function if additional templates are enrolled.  The position of the Cooperation Network in the latest Opinions (No.7/2019 and No.8/2019) for  the Latvian eParaksts and the Belgian itsme schemes is aligned with these considerations: to  meet the requirements for LoA High, Latvia and Belgium should commit to disable the use of  biometric authentication for this LoA.  2.2.3.4 Considerations on other authentication solutions used to trigger access to  certificates stored on a remote HSM  Several peer reviews highlighted considerations regarding eID means based on cryptographic  materials (such as certificates with private key) stored on a remote environment such as HSM  that can be activated only by the user (an approach similar to qualified electronic signature  performed on a remote QSCD under the sole control of the user).  56 See for instance: https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-4s-face-unlock-works-even-if-you-have-your-eyes-closed/  https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-4s-face-unlock-works-even-if-you-have-your-eyes-closed/  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  33  In this case, the assurance of the authentication required to activate the use of the keys stored  in an HSM, is key for the overall security of the solution. Various approaches are used within the  schemes notified such as SMS OTP, software OTP (on a mobile app), hardware OTP, virtual  smartcard, etc. The above considerations for SMS OTP and mobile-based solutions shouldbe  taken into account to assess the compliance with the claimed LoA.  It is certain that this solution type will flourish in the future as it aligns with the eIDAS approach  on remote electronic signature. Therefore, it might be possible for Member States to issue  guidelines regarding rules and standards against which such solutions could be assessed and  the conditions that will make them compliant with the LoA High.  2.2.3.5 Certification of devices usedin eID means  The certification of the eID means (being smartcard, HSM or other cryptographic module-based)  used is a key consideration in order to ensure trust in the ability of a solution to offer protection  against a given attack potential.  Among the pre-notified and notified schemes, several certification schemes are highlighted by  Member States to demonstrate the security of devices:   Common Criteria certification is a basis and devices are mainly being certified CC EAL4  augmented with AVA_VAN.5.   QSCD certification under eIDAS Regulation is often done and is used to demonstrate the  security level of the chip used. It is thus widespread for eIDs based on national eID cards  already used for electronic signature purposes. It should be noted nonetheless, that the  certification scope for local chip QSCD strongly varies from that for remote QCSDs.   Protection profiles are also referenced and used as a base for QSCD certification.  Some public peer-review reports57 have highlighted the need for periodical certification and not  only to rely on an initial certification. In the context of the ROCA vulnerability, this approach is  indeed relevant as it appears that a certification that ensures a protection against a given attack  potential at the time of its issuance may not provide the same assurance a few years later (as  attacks methods and the threat landscape evolve quickly).  It would be relevant to have additional guidance for devices used within eID means regarding  needs in terms of certification (including the scope of the certification) and maintenance in time.  Nevertheless, some Member States have already put approaches in place at national level, in  order to review the evaluation of security components on a regular basis (vulnerability  assessment, cryptography evaluation, etc.). This is the case in France for instance where  ANSSI promotes its “qualification” approach.  2.2.4 Management and organisation  2.2.4.1 Certification of identity providers issuing eID means  The topics related to management and organisation are generally the ones raising the least  comments in peer review reports. Some recommendations have already been given by the  Cooperation Network in their guidance document. There are existing standards (against which  certification is possible) that could be followed by identity providers or third parties involved in  the eID means management for compliance with some of the requirements of the CIR.  Such standards which are highlighted in notification forms or supporting documentation provided  for schemes pre-notification include for instance:  57 See for instance the peer review reports for the Croatian and Luxembourgish schemes, publicly available on the  European Commission website.  https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Overview+of+pre-notified+and+notified+eID+schemes+under+eIDAS  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  34   ISO/IEC 27001:2013 for fulfilment of requirements on information security management,  record keeping, facility and staff and technical controls   Relevant ETSI standards such as ETSI EN 319 401 and ETSI EN 319 411-1 and ETSI EN  319 411-2.  Guidance could be provided in order to help identity providers match the requirements covered  by a certification they already have (as per the mapping already proposed in the current version  of the guidance document of the Cooperation Network). For instance, a provider already  certified as QTSP could easily benefit from all the requirements already covered by the  qualification and the ETSI standards against which it has been assessed. Such standards, if  relevant, could eventually be referred to in the legislation.  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  35  3. NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR  ENISA UNDER THE  CYBERSECURITY ACT  According to the Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17  April 2019 on ENISA and on information and communications technology cybersecurity  certification58 (hereafter Cybersecurity Act), ENISA’s role is in line with achieving “a high  common level of cybersecurity across the Union, including by actively supporting Member  States, Unions institutions, bodies, offices and agencies in improving cybersecurity”. ENISA  shall also “act as a reference point for advice and expertise on cybersecurity for Union  institutions, bodies, offices and agencies as well as for other relevant Union stakeholders”  (Article 3(1)).  In Article 4(6) of this Regulation, it is stated that ENISA “shall promote the use of European  cybersecurity certification, with a view to avoiding the fragmentation of the internal market”. In  the eID landscape, The Commission and ENISA could coordinate the pursuit of consistency  across national competent authorities that have issued or are still working on detailed technical  and security requirements based on the Commission Implementing Regulation 2015/1502.  It is also stated in this Regulation, in Article 5(5), that ENISA “shall contribute to the  development and implementation of Union policy and law […] in the field of electronic identity  and trust services, in particular by providing advice and issuing technical guidelines, as well as  by facilitating the exchange of best practices between competent authorities”. To this end,  ENISA could carry out a periodic technological overview on electronic identification means and  solutions as well as on the evolution of the threat landscape in this area. In case of a  vulnerability, ENISA could put in place communication means between Member States and  provide its expertise.  Along the same lines, it could also be interesting to extend Article 10 of the eIDAS Regulation  focusing on security breaches and stating, “where either the electronic identification scheme […]  or the authentication […] is breached or partially compromised […], the notifying Member States  […] shall inform other Member States and the Commission.” Indeed, Member States have a  58 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/881/oj/  COORDINATE NATIONAL INITIATIVES ON ISSUING TECHNICAL AND  SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR eID  ENISA could work with national Competent Authorities across the European Union to identify  their initiatives and share their views on technical and security requirements for the  Substantial and High Levels of Assurance of eIDAS.  ENISA’s role is  to contribute to  a coherent  European  cybersecurity  landscape  regarding  electronic  identification.  PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND  REPORT ON SECURITY INCIDENTS OF NOTIFIED SCHEMES  ENISA has a role to play in reporting on the security incidents of notified schemes. An  overview of technological advances could be carried out and ENISA could facilitate the  exchange of best practices and vulnerabilities between the Member States.  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/881/oj/  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  36  similar obligation regarding trust service providers: supervisory bodies “shall provide ENISA  once a year with a summary of notifications of breach of security and loss of integrity received  from trust providers” (Article 19 of the eIDAS Regulation). Accordingly, ENISA prepares an  annual report aggregating these breaches to show root causes, statistics and trends. A similar  report could thus be made available to Member States and interested eID stakeholders,  summarising security breaches and incidents of notified electronic identification means and  identity providers issuing these electronic identification means. This report could also include a  threat overview of underlying authentication technologies, which would benefit from the  technological watch proposed in the foregoing provision.  Besides, leveraging technological advances and security concerns of eID schemes and  underlying technologies, ENISA could provide further guidance, including on the definition of the  levels of assurance and attack potential to ensure a consistent comprehension of the topic from  one Member State to another. The NIST guidelines have,for instance, developed flowcharts to  help define which level of assurance is required per use case. Moreover, as stated in section  2.2, ENISA could go one step further and publish recommendations on specific topics, including  OTP SMS and remote identity proofing, in close collaboration with Competent Authorities and  the Cooperation Network.  Finally, as the eIDAS Regulation must be reviewedby July 2020 by the Commission (Article 49  of the eIDAS Regulation), ENISA couldbring insights on what the review of the eIDAS  Regulation should include in the electronic identification area. Towards this end, this report  could form the baseline for ENISA’s feedback, as ENISA continues to delve into this topic in the  first semester of 2020. The Commission haspublished the eIDAS review roadmap59 stating that  reports and studies prepared by ENISA will be fully included in the initial step of the evaluation  process.  59 Retrieved from https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/initiatives/ares-2019-6019401_en  PUBLISH AN ANNUAL REPORT ON SECURITY INCIDENTS FOR eID  ENISA could publish an annual report aggregating all security incidents which impacted  notified electronic identification schemes, alongside with an overview of the threat landscape  for eID underlying technologies.  PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO MS COMPETENT AUTHORITIES  ENISA could publish guidelines and recommendations to ensure a consistent understanding  of the requirements of the CIR 2015/1502 of the eIDAS Regulation. These guidelines could  include use cases by levels of assurance to further detail their definition, as well as  recommendations regarding compliance of specific technologies and solutions.  BRING INSIGHTS TO THE eIDAS REVIEW  ENISA will be involved in the eIDAS review process which is  due in July 2020. As such, it  should bring its technical expertise and insights to define how the Regulation is fit for purpose  and identify areas for improvement related to electronic identification.  https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/initiatives/ares-2019-6019401_en  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  37  A ANNEX: OVERVIEW OF  OTHER EID SCHEMES  This section offers an overview of other relevant eID schemes,that are not pre-notified or  notified at the time of writing this report. It is worth to notice that all the considerations and  analysis of the eID schemes made in this report are based on publicly available information.  A.1 SMART-ID  Smart-ID is an eID solution currently in use in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. It is based on a  smartphone mobile application. From an end-user perspective, the user experience is quite  similar to a push authentication mobile application. When trying to access a service or confirm a  transaction, the user receives a notification on the enrolled application and can perform the  authentication by typing a PIN code. The user has two separate PIN codes, one for  authentication purposes and one for digital signature purposes. From a design standpoint, the  solution offers an interesting perspective. In order not to rely only on the user device (i.e. the  mobile phone with the application), or server signing services (i.e. remote HSM for server  signing, which raises questions on the initial authentication of the user), the solution provides an  alternative by sharing the risks and responsibilities between these two components. The private  keys used for authentication and signature are generated in a shared manner, following  threshold-signature scheme protocol principles. By doing so, each secret sharing of the key  (one stored in an encrypted format in the application with the PIN and the other stored on the  HSM) is used to produce a signature without the need to combine the private keys in a single  location. The signature shares are then combined on the server-side to create the final  composite signature.  Regarding the enrolment, the solution can be activated while deriving the digital identity of the  Estonian eID or Mobiil-ID (for Estonian users).  From a signature perspective, this approach is inspired by the protection profile60 EN 419 241 –  2 Trustworthy Systems Supporting Server Signing Part 2: Protection Profiles for QSCD for  Server Signing but differs in the use of the threshold signature scheme protocol as it does not  use the classic server signature solutions. The server part of the Smart-ID solution (the secure-  zone on the server-side connected to the HSM through a secure channel) has been certified  against Common Criteria for EAL 4+ augmented with AVA_VAN.5 and constitutes a QSCD.  In addition to these principles, Smart-ID also includes interesting security measures:   Verification codes are generated to bind the context of the session on the relying party with  the authentication session on the mobile application (also used, for instance, within the  Estonian Mobiil-ID). Such features are always useful to avoid approval from the user  without being fully aware of the transaction context.   There are clone detection mechanisms to detect duplication of the Smart-ID application  with a parallel use. For this purpose, one-time material is generated by the Smart-ID  server and is expected to be provided by the mobile application for the next interaction.  60 Retrieved from BankID A Protection Profile (PP) is a document used as part of the certification process according to  ISO/IEC 15408 and the Common Criteria (CC). As the generic form of a Security Target (ST), it is typically created by a  user or user community and provides an implementation independent specification of information assurance security  requirements. A PP is a combination of threats, security objectives, assumptions, security functional requirements (SFRs),  security assurance requirements (SARs) and rationales.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Criteria https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Target https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_assurance  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  38  A.2 BANKID IN SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES  Both Sweden and Norway have an electronic identification scheme where banks act as identity  providers to access public administration websites and private sector websites in these  countries. Both schemes are called BankID but are based on different technologies.  A.2.1 Swedish eID  The Swedish eID system relies on eIDs that have been issued by the private sector since 1999.  The main solution is BankID and is in operation since 2003. This eID scheme is based on a  network of 11 banks and has the same value and functionalities, regardless of which bank has  issued it. It can be used for login and identification as well as to perform digital signatures.  Every individual who has a Swedish social security number can obtain BankID e-credentials  through their bank. In 2019, BankID is estimated to have been used on almost 4 billion  occasions61.  BankID is available in 3 forms: a physical smart card (BankID on a card), an application on a  smartphone or tablet (mobile BankID) and a computer software (BankID in a file). Service  providers can choose to accept one or all forms for different services.Identity providers also  select which forms of eID they offer62. By the end of 2019, it is estimated that 8 million of  Sweden’s inhabitants will own a BankID, of which approximately 7.5 million will have a mobile  BankID63.  BankID credentials are ordered via an Internet bank. The process differs between banks: some  require a face-to-face meeting at a bank office with an approved Swedish ID document, while  others require users to only login in the Internet bank and order a BankID online.  Authentication with mobile BankID either requires the user to enter an identification number and  a password or to scan a QR code on the service provider website with the mobile application.  Mobile BankID works only on the initial mobile phone that  it was installed on: if a user changes  his/her mobile phone and tries to restore it from an old laptop, the mobile BankID will not work  and new credentials must be sought from the bank.  A.2.2 Norwegian eId  Mobile BankID was launched in 2009 as a joint initiative between DNB Bank, a leading  Norwegian bank, and Telenor, the country’s largest mobile operator. Mobile BankID is an  electronic identification scheme, supporting authentication and digital signature across online  services through the users’ mobile phones. Today, all five of Norway’s mobile operators offer  Mobile BankID to their customers, leading to a full market coverage. BankID in Norway has a  total of 4 million subscribers64. Mobile BankID uses PKI technology and stores bank-generated  certificates on the SIM card. A PIN code is used for authentication and validation purposes.  61 Retrieved from BankID website: https://www.bankid.com/om-bankid/detta-ar-bankid  62 Retrieved from BankID website: https://www.bankid.com/kontakt/utfaerdare  63 Retrieved from BankID website: https://www.bankid.com/assets/bankid/stats/2019/statistik-2019-08.pdf  64 Retrieved from the BankID website: https://www.bankid.no/en/company/  https://www.bankid.com/om-bankid/detta-ar-bankid https://www.bankid.com/kontakt/utfaerdare https://www.bankid.com/assets/bankid/stats/2019/statistik-2019-08.pdf https://www.bankid.no/en/company/  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  39  B ANNEX:  TECHNOLOGICAL LANDSCAPE  OF EID SOLUTIONS  The following technological landscape of eID solutions is built by regrouping in clusters the  underlying technologies used in all eID solutions including both notified or not eID schemes.  Four broad technological clusters are detailed in the following subsections:   Cards and other hardware authenticators (incl. contact and contactless smart cards)   Mobile-based solutions (incl. OTP, cryptographic SIM and Mobile Connect)   Biometrics (incl. fingerprints and face recognition)   Prospective technologies (such as self-sovereign identity and analytics).  B.1 CARDS AND OTHER HARDWARE AUTHENTICATORS  B.1.1 Physical identity document and visible digital seals  A physical identity document is any document which may be used to prove a person’s identity  without an electronic component. They can, for example, be ID cards made of plastic. They  display personal information such as name, address, date of birth and a photograph.  What are the potential use cases regarding eID in an eIDAS ecosystem?  Physical ID cards cannot be used as an electronic identification means since they don’t offer  useful electronic features. However, since they usually contain a picture of the cardholder, they  can be used during the identity proofing process during a face-to-face verification The unique  identification number located on every card can also be used during an identity claim validation  by an appropriate authority.Most eID schemes use these documents in face-to-face identity  proofing if such enrolment processes are used. They can also be used in remote enrolment  processes where identity documents are photographed, recorded or shown during a videocall  by the users performing the enrolment. However, most physical security features are designed  for verification in a face-to-face scenario and are not suitable for duplication by photography or  video recording.  To further improve the security of identifying attributes retrieval, visible digital seals on physical  documents can be used. Visible digital seals are cryptographically signed data structures  containing document features, encoded as a 2D bar code and printed on a document. This 2D  bar code includes the signed biographic data located on the card. The signature is performed by  document issuers (usually issuing state), using the private keys corresponding to the bar code  signer certificates. The integrity of the data contained in such 2D bar codes is thus ensured, as  detection of the forged digital visible seal would be easy (not signed by the issuing state CA for  instance). It is also a way to check that the data stored in the digital visible seal and on the card  match, helping the identification of counterfeit cards. It is worth noting that these bar codes are  easily decoded by off-the-shelf smartphones or scanners as long as publicly available  algorithms are used to create the seal.  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  40  These digital visible seals do not replace the security features of microchips, do not enable  dynamic authentication and do not protect against duplication. However, they strengthen the  security of the retrieval of information during an enrolment phase.  What are the applicable standards that are related to this technology?  To automate the data capture and to reduce human errors, bar codes (example of an algorithm  for 2D code: PDF417, BSI TR-03137, ANTS 2D-DOC, etc.) located on physical cards can be  used. The use of these bar codes is not harmonised, as the ISO/IEC 781065 standard only  specifies physical characteristics for identification cards (dimensions, resistance to bending,  toxicity, etc.).  Regarding visible digital seals, the ICAO has published a technical report called Visible Digital  Seals for Non-Electronic Documents66 describing these seals, including the container format of  a digital seal, how it should be encoded, and the use-case of digital seals applied to travel  documents. This report states the added value of these visible digital seals for breeder  documents67 and temporary visas while specifying that travel documents should, whenever  possible, employ microchips.  In this ICAO report, the 2D bar codes that can be used as the printed representation of visible  digital seals are the ones specified as an ISO standard, including DataMatrix (ISO/IEC 16022),  Aztec Codes (ISO/IEC 24778), and QR Codes (ISO/IEC 18004). ISO/IEC 15415 is also referred  to regarding the print quality of these bar codes.  These visible digital seals or secured bar codes have been further developed at national level.  For instance, Germany’s cyber security authority, BSI, has published technical guidelines68 on  the topic, and France has developed a framework called 2D-Doc69 based on this principle to  ensure the integrity of public documents. These two documents were the basis of the ICAO  report.  What are the network and information security considerations regarding this technology?  While network and information security considerations do not apply to physical cards, it is  essential to recall that the security level of these cards is closely related to the printed security of  the cards.  The operators verifying those cards in face-to-face processes must be trained and equipped to  recognise and verify the printed secure elements to make sure the cards are not forged.  Identity documents printed without a cryptographic element remain more prone to falsification and  counterfeiting, and the guarantee they can provide during an identity proofing process remains  very limited. The usage of a visible digital seal enhances the security of this process.  B.1.2 Contact Smart Cards  A smart card is a device including an embedded integrated circuit chip (ICC). A contact smart  card needs to be inserted in a card reader to operate the transmission of commands and data.  65 https://www.iso.org/standard/31432.html  66 https://www.icao.int/Security/FAL/TRIP/Documents/TR%20-%20Visible%20Digital%20Seals%20for%20Non- Electronic%20Documents%20V1.7.pdf  67 Documents that can serve as a basis to obtain other identification documents, i.e. a birth certificate that is used to obtain  a passport.  68 BSI TR-03137 Optically Verifiable Cryptographic Protection of non-electronic Documents (Digital Seal), see  https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Publications/TechnicalGuidelines/TR03137/BSITR03137.html  69 https://ants.gouv.fr/Les-solutions/2D-Doc (in French)  https://www.iso.org/standard/31432.html https://www.icao.int/Security/FAL/TRIP/Documents/TR%20-%20Visible%20Digital%20Seals%20for%20Non-Electronic%20Documents%20V1.7.pdf https://www.icao.int/Security/FAL/TRIP/Documents/TR%20-%20Visible%20Digital%20Seals%20for%20Non-Electronic%20Documents%20V1.7.pdf https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Publications/TechnicalGuidelines/TR03137/BSITR03137.html https://ants.gouv.fr/Les-solutions/2D-Doc  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  41  These smart cards usually carry cryptographic functions such as key generation (including  random number generation), encryption and signature.  What are the potential use cases regarding eID in an eIDAS ecosystem?  Contact smart cards can be used for both identity proofing and electronic identification means.  Depending on the use case, the maturity level of the ecosystem and used endpoints, using a  contact smart card can be more or less appropriate for those two purposes.   In countries where citizens possess an electronic national identity card including a  microchip, many public services (healthcare, voting, etc.) and private services (electronic  banking, signing contracts, etc.) can allow the use of these microchips as electronic  identification means for citizens. In a mature ecosystem where every citizen has a contact  smart card reader, they can use their electronic national identity card to access those  electronic services.  In Europe, most countries provide their citizens with electronic identity cards and allow  citizens to access e-gov services with digital identities based on these identity cards (see  also section 1.3 for an overview of eID solutions).   In an ecosystem where the use of a microchip as an electronic identification means is not  widely supported, or where electronic services are used from endpoints for which using a  microchip is difficult, not user friendly or not possible (absence of card readers, from  mobile devices, etc.), eID cards can be used to strengthen a remote initial identity proofing  during a registration process with an identity provider. For example, Estonian and  Lithuanian ID cards can be used as identity proofing documents by reading the microchip  to enrol the Smart-ID solution, a third-party electronic identification means based on a  mobile application (see also section Error! Reference source not found.)70. As another e  xample, the Belgian itsme eID solution can be activated after carrying out an identity  proofing based on the Belgian national eID card.  What are the applicable standards related to this technology?  The ISO/IEC 7816 standard defines contact smart cards. This standard specifies many aspects  such as the physical characteristics, dimension, and location of the contacts parts, electrical  interface and transmission protocol, personal verification through biometric methods (e.g. Match  on Card). For some specific use cases, additional standards can be required, such as EMV for  payment cards, or UICC for SIM cards.  In terms of technology, electronic certificates are commonly used on the chip to provide eID  features.  What are the network and information security considerations regarding this technology?  The microchip security level is usually evaluated against the Common Criteria framework with  an Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL), with potential augmented requirements. For instance,  smart cards are commonly assessed for EAL4 augmented with AVA_VAN.5 (Vulnerability  Assessment and Analysis) to ensure protection against attackers with high potential. The  Common Criteria framework benefits from mutual recognition agreements such as the SOG-IS  in Europe and the CCRA (Common Criteria Recognition Agreement).  In addition to the Common Criteria, some countries are also using national qualification  frameworks. For instance, it is the case in France with the ANSSI qualification process that  70 See also https://www.smart-id.com/help/faq/registering/how-to-register-a-smart-id-account-using-an-id-card  https://www.smart-id.com/help/faq/registering/how-to-register-a-smart-id-account-using-an-id-card  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  42  aims, in addition to the Common Criteria, to ensure the security level of the assessed product in  time (cryptographic review, yearly supervision report, periodic recertification).  Cryptographic modules are also commonly certified as QSCDs under the eIDAS Regulation, as  are most of the national eID cards used in Europe. Several protection profiles have been  defined and certified.  Because of its relevance for the smart cards industry, it is worth mentioning the Federal  Information Processing Standards (FIPS) developed by the American National Institute of  Standards and Technology (NIST), which are standards and guidelines for federal computer  systems, often used also by the private sector. The 140-2 Security Requirements for  Cryptographic Modules standard71 specifies the security requirements that must be satisfied by  a cryptographic module utilised within a security system protecting sensitive but unclassified  information. The standard provides four increasing, qualitative levels of security. The  requirements to satisfy a level of security are partially based on the Common Criteria  framework: level four, for instance, relies on the EAL4 (or higher).  B.1.3 Contactless Smart Cards  A contactless smart card is also a smart card with an embedded microchip like the contact  smart card described above. However, it also embeds an antenna and only requires close  proximity to a card reader. They communicate using radio frequency (RF), and this  electromagnetic signal derives power for the internal chip.  What are the potential use cases regarding eID in an eIDAS ecosystem?  Just as contact smart cards, contactless smart cards can be used for both identity proofing and  as an electronic identification means. They offer an advantage over contact smart cards  regarding compatible devices due to the ability of many smartphones to read contactless smart  cards. Those cards are used, for example in Alicem, a French eID solution, where contactless  passports (or residence permit for foreigners) are used during identity proofing along with facial  recognition mechanism via a smartphone as a card reader. These cards can also be used as  electronic identification means, which is also the case in Alicem, where contactless passports  can be used during electronic identification via the mobile application.  Electronic travel documents standardisation thanks to the ICAO document about Machine  Readable Travel Documents (Doc 9303 ICAO72) has made the reading of identity information  and the photo highly standardised and easily to be included in eID applications on mobile  phones. It thus strengthens the security of the process to derive an identity from an identity  document.  These usages can be developed as more and more smartphones are NFC compatible. Android  phones have long been known to have NFC capabilities as NFC became available on some  Android devices in 2012. Today, all the top ten manufacturers sell NFC phones73. With iOS 13,  iPhones can now read NFC tags, and mobile applications are coming to the App Store in order  to read electronic identity documents74. Since 2018, there is an Android mobile application from  the UK Home Office to facilitate applications for residency in the UK after it leaves the EU, by  quickly and securely confirming identities75. In October 2019, the UK Government has  introduced an iOS version of this app76. The German eID can also be used efficiently on  Android and iOS devices without any additional deviced required.  71 https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf  72 https://www.icao.int/publications/pages/publication.aspx?docnum=9303  73 https://learn.seritag.com/nfc-enabled-phones  74 https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/12/nfc-gets-a-lot-more-powerful-in-ios-13/  75 https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.gov.HomeOffice.ho1&hl=en_GB  76 https://www.nfcw.com/2019/10/21/364763/uk-government-includes-iphone-nfc-passport-reading-in-ios-brexit-app/  https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf https://www.icao.int/publications/pages/publication.aspx?docnum=9303 https://learn.seritag.com/nfc-enabled-phones https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/12/nfc-gets-a-lot-more-powerful-in-ios-13/ https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.gov.HomeOffice.ho1&hl=en_GB https://www.nfcw.com/2019/10/21/364763/uk-government-includes-iphone-nfc-passport-reading-in-ios-brexit-app/  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  43  What are the applicable standards related to this technology?  The ISO/IEC 14443 standard defines contactless smart cards. This standard specifies many  aspects such as physical characteristics, radio frequency power and signal interface,  transmission protocol.  These identity documents are generally compliant with ICAO’s Doc 9303. The document is  divided into 12 parts. For instance, part 10 of the document defines the logical data structure for  data storage in the contactless integrated circuit, and part 11 defines the security mechanisms  for machine-readable travel documents (MRTDs).  What are the network and information security considerations regarding this technology?  Considering the microchip itself, the same considerations as for contact smart card defined in  section B.1.2 apply (the ISO standard, the Common Criteria framework, etc.).  It is worth noting that an ICAO compliant chip (for electronic MRTD) itself only provides one  authentication factor, as the ICAO applet does not manage PIN. If used as part of an electronic  identification means, they need to be associated with another authentication factor.  Contactless smart cards are mainly vulnerable to non-authorised readings by a close reader  (less than 10 centimetres) when no countermeasures are deployed (access control, random  UID), allowing the tracking of identity information and people’s movements. ICAO compliant  chips require at least to use the barcode to access the identity information (non-sensitive) with  protocols such as PACE. Sensitive information such as biometric template (fingerprint) are  protected using Extended Access Control that requires mutual authentication with the inspection  system accessing the information. These protocols are described in the Doc 9303 and aim at  local reading. For remote reading, there exist references to the extension of the protocols in  BSI/ANSSI TR-03110.  B.1.4 FIDO Authenticator  The FIDO Alliance is an open industry association that develops open standards for  authentication intending to replace passwords to promote more secure and convenient  authentication. The association members include authentication specialists, industry  companies, GAFAM (except Apple) or payment companies.  FIDO authentication standards are based on public-key cryptography. The main principle  behind the protocol is the use of a key pair associated with each FIDO compliant relying party  that the user wants to access. The relying party stores the public key along with a credential ID  to identify its owner. The authentication process is performed through the signature of a  challenge by the private key, ensuring the possession of this private key.  Several authentication factors (or form factors) are supported to unlock access to the private  key during the authentication process such as biometrics (e.g. embedded on a smartphone), a  USB second factor, and a contactless authenticator. Moreover, the way private keys are  created, managed and stored depend on the implementation chosen by each factor’s vendor.  Indeed, FIDO does not specify exactly how to perform these operations, but rather gives a set  of security requirements to comply with, which do not currently align with eIDAS requirements77.  77 https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-security-requirements-v1.0-fd-20170524/fido-authenticator-security- requirements_20170524.html  https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-security-requirements-v1.0-fd-20170524/fido-authenticator-security-requirements_20170524.html https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-security-requirements-v1.0-fd-20170524/fido-authenticator-security-requirements_20170524.html  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  44  What are the potential use cases regarding eID in an eIDAS ecosystem?  FIDO is an industry authentication standard that benefits from a broad coverage by all major  browsers (Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox) and Operating Systems (Android, Windows).  Being an authentication standard, a FIDO authenticator in itself does not manage identity but  only authenticates a registered user. An Identity Verification and Binding Working Group78  (IDWG) has been created within the FIDO Alliance and is working on improving identity proofing  mechanisms, based for example on biometrics or government-issued identity documents  remote verification. The compliance to eIDAS requirements appears not to be at stake for now.  It could be therefore interesting to study the outputs of this working group, even to discuss with  the working group, and check proposed identity proofing mechanisms against eIDAS Regulation  or way to bind FIDO authenticator with identity data for instance.  Figure 5: Browser and operating system coverage of FIDO ecosystem (Source  FIDOalliance.org)  What are the applicable standards related to this technology?  Historically, the FIDO Alliance has developed two authentication standards:   FIDO UAF (Universal Authentication Factor): the FIDO UAF protocol was designed to  provide a “passwordless” experience while authenticating on online services. It requires  the use of a device supporting FIDO UAF stack (FIDO client and FIDO authenticator on  the device, mainly a smartphone). Depending on the FIDO compliant authenticators  supported on the device, several form factors for authentication can be used such as  fingerprint biometrics, facial recognition, voice recognition and the use of a PIN.  Authentication unlocks access to the private key used for signing. Confirmation is then  transmitted to the FIDO server-side that checks the validity of transmitted information.   FIDO U2F (Universal 2nd Factor): The FIDO U2F protocol was designed for strong  authentication to provide a second factor with a FIDO U2F device that can be used  through USB (insert and press a button on the USB device) or NFC or BLE (Bluetooth Low  Energy) (tapping the NFC or BLE device). It should be used in conjunction with a  username/password as a second factor to provide strong authentication. The FIDO U2F  device implements the same concept, generating a key pair which is relying party specific  78 https://fidoalliance.org/identity-verification-binding/  https://fidoalliance.org/identity-verification-binding/  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  45  and that is used for signature during the authentication process. The FIDO U2F protocol is  now relabelled as CTAP1 as part of FIDO2.  In order to rationalise the standards used, the FIDO Alliance is now promoting FIDO 2 which is  comprised of:   Client To Authenticator Protocol CTAP 1 (the new label of U2F) and CTAP2 (extension of  U2F to include mobile devices as external authentication factors). These protocols  manage the interaction between a FIDO authenticator and a FIDO client (browser, native  application).   WebAuthn (Web Authentication) is a web-based API that allows websites to support FIDO-  based authentication on supported browsers and platforms. It has been developed with the  World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and was officially recognized as a W3C web standard  in March 2019.  What are the network and information security considerations regarding this technology?  Being based on asymmetric cryptography, with keys stored on software or hardware key stores,  security considerations are related to considerations that could apply for mobile based solution  with SE or smartcards, such as:   Cryptographic mechanisms and algorithm used   Protection of the authenticator against tampering, duplication, attack to steal the  private keys stored, etc   Certification of the authenticator if any to ensure resistance against a given attack  potential.  It is worth noting that the German BSI has released a protection profile for a FIDO U2F based  authenticator: FIDO Universal Second Factor (U2F) Authenticator BSI-PP-CC-0096-201779. The  target of evaluation described in this protection profile can be on a contactless of a contact  secure chip. It has been evaluated for EAL4 augmented with AVA_VAN.5 to ensure resistance  against high potential attacks. Further security concerns consider the use of embedded  biometric sensors and futher details can be found in Section 2.2.3.3.  B.2 MOBILE-BASED eID SOLUTIONS  Mobile technologies related to identity consist of phone and tablet-based hardware and software  solutions used to register, authenticate, and verify an individual’s identity.  B.2.1 SMS and email OTP  One-time password (OTP) is a single factor of authentication, commonly used for a single  authentication in addition to a static password or PIN to implement two-factor authentication  with a possession-based factor (something a person has, such as a specific phone number) and  a knowledge-based factor (something a person knows, such as the PIN). For the user to  authenticate, a single-use password is generated centrally and sent to the registered phone  number through SMS or to the registered email address through email.  What are the potential use cases regarding eID in an eIDAS ecosystem?  OTP SMS or email can be used in the enrolment process to prove the user performing the  enrolment process indeed possesses the phone number or email address. Such validated  contact information can then be used later for authentication purposes. Still, during an eID  79 More information on: https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/ppfiles/pp0096b_pdf.pdf  https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/ppfiles/pp0096b_pdf.pdf  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  46  enrolment process, it is also commonly used to send activation codes (for instance to activate a  card issued after a face-to-face identity proofing).  SMS or email OTP is also used during authentication. When used as a second factor, it  provides a layer of security on top of static user-created passwords which can be weak and/or  reused across multiple accounts.  Examples of SMS OTP use as part of eID schemes are numerous across Europe. For instance,  it is currently used in Spain through the Permanent Cl@ve80 identification scheme where an  OTP is sent by SMS to the mobile phone to access electronic administration services that  require a high level of security. A similar authentication flow is used by Norway’s MinID81  identification means to access more than 1,000 different services from government agencies.  This identification scheme gives access to online public services at a “medium-high level of  security”82 (level 3 out of 4 on the Norwegian ID-porten scale). Numerous other examples of the  usage of SMS OTP can be found for various usages (social network, banking, etc.).  What are the applicable standards related to this technology?  There is no standard per se describing the use of OTP SMS or email. OTP SMS is delivered to  mobile phones through the global SS7 (Signaling System 7) network of mobile operators, and  OTP email is delivered through the Internet (refer to section 2.2.3.1 for additional standards and  security considerations regarding OTP SMS and email).  What are the network and information security considerations regarding this technology?  Email OTP is problematic regarding the risks linked to a mail account takeover by an attacker.  Indeed, a mailbox is attractive to an attacker, and a successful phishing attack can’t be  overlooked. Therefore, this technology is not massively used anymore in eID schemes and  should not be promoted.  Regarding OTP transmitting via SMS, this technology can be considered too reliant on the  network’s operator processes. Recent examples of SIM swapping (incl. Twitter’s CEO on 31st  August 201983) show the danger of having a mobile number both as identifier and  authenticator84.  Moreover, the SS7 protocol used by telecommunications companies to coordinate how texts  and calls are rooted has a long-known security flaw allowing malefactors to send commands  and route text messages as they wish. It has already happened in 2017 and 2019 when bank  customers from Germany85 and the UK86 were victims of fraudulent transfers that exploited this  SS7 vulnerability. Mobile operators could implement additional security measures, but according  to ENISA’s report of March 2018 (“Signalling Security in Telecom SS7/Diameter/5G - EU level  assessment of the current situation”) security measures are already in place:   In general, most of the operators have implemented basic security measures  especially for SS7,   Most operators (87%) implement SMS home routing, to protect their networks against  from leaking sensitive information associated with a subscriber, which would help to  mount further attacks.  80 https://clave.gob.es/clave_Home/en/Clave-Permanente.html  81 http://eid.difi.no/en/minid  82 http://eid.difi.no/en/security-and-cookies/information-about-levels-security  83 https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/31/20841448/jack-dorsey-twitter-hacked-account-sim-swapping  84 https://www.wired.com/story/phone-numbers-indentification-authentication/  85 https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/ss7-attack-intercepts-sms/16877/  86 https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/ss7-hacked/25529/  https://clave.gob.es/clave_Home/en/Clave-Permanente.html http://eid.difi.no/en/minid http://eid.difi.no/en/security-and-cookies/information-about-levels-security https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/31/20841448/jack-dorsey-twitter-hacked-account-sim-swapping https://www.wired.com/story/phone-numbers-indentification-authentication/ https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/ss7-attack-intercepts-sms/16877/ https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/ss7-hacked/25529/  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  47   More than 84% of our respondents are applying different analysis techniques for SS7  interconnect traffic in order to detect abnormal activities.   More than 80% of the respondents monitor for abnormal SMS activities.  Also, the PSD2 Regulation requests strong authentication to perform online payments over  Internet and to access a bank account. The combination of the card details printed on the card  and SMS OTP, very popular to validate online payments, would not be compliant anymore for  strong customer authentication under this directive87. This directive might then indirectly reduce  the usage of the combination of the card details printed on the card with SMS OTP. However,  as stated in the EBA Opinion88 on the implementation of the RTS (paragraph 35), a device  could be used as evidence of possession, provided that there is a ‘reliable means to confirm  possession through the generation or receipt of a dynamic validation element on the device’.  Evidence could, in this context, be provided through the generation of a one-time password  (OTP), whether generated by a piece of software or by hardware, such as a token, text  message (SMS) or push notification. In the case of an SMS, and as highlighted in Q&A 4039,  the possession element ‘would not be the SMS itself, but rather, typically, the SIM-card  associated with the respective mobile number’. (paragraph 25). So, the PSD2 Regulation does  not preclude the usage of SMS OTP in addition to a static password or PIN to implement two-  factor authentication89..  In summary, OTP sent via SMS remain interesting as it is a very known and straightforward way  to perform 2FA at large scale. However, long-known multiple weaknesses should be addressed,  although these weaknesses only benefit an attacker targeting a specific user.  B.2.2 Soft OTP  Another implementation of one-time passwords uses mobile applications or hardware security  tokens. In both cases, they are generated using Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC)  and a moving factor - such as event counter (HOTP) - or time-based information (TOTP). In  two-factor authentication scenarios, a user must enter a traditional, static password as well as a  time-based one-time password to gain access to a digital service. Typically, a time-based  temporary passcode expires after 30, 60 or 120 seconds.  Historically, hardware security tokens (e.g. an RSA token) were used, but the focus here is on  one-time passwords generated by mobile applications (e.g. Google Authenticator).  One-time passwords can also be challenge-based, where the resource being accessed  provides a challenge needed to generate the OTP. The challenge can be meaningless or  related to the transaction. To increase the security of the process, a PIN on the smartphone or  the hardware token can be required to trigger the generation of the OTP. In this case, the  process provides two authentication factors from different nature: knowledge of the PIN and  possession of the smartphone with the enrolled application.  What are the potential use cases regarding eID in an eIDAS ecosystem?  Event-based OTP, time-based OTP and challenge-based OTP can all be used as a second  factor in an electronic identification process, or as a comprehensive authentication solution if a  PIN is required to trigger the OTP generation. For instance, SPID, the Italian notified eID  87 See European Banking Authority opinion, accessible here https://eba.europa.eu/eba-publishes-an-opinion-on-the- elements-of-strong-customer-authentication-under-psd2 and UK’s local decision  https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/34047/fca-delays-introduction-of-strong-consumer-authentication-rules  88 \"Opinion of the European Banking Authority on the elements of strong customer authentication under PSD2.\" - from 21  June 2019, https://eba.europa.eu/documents/10180/2622242/EBA+Opinion+on+SCA+elements+under+PSD2+.pdf  89 There are commercial PSD2-compliant offers based on SMS OTP, like for example https://www.twilio.com/blog/how- twilio-can-help-strong-customer-authentication-psd2.  https://eba.europa.eu/eba-publishes-an-opinion-on-the-elements-of-strong-customer-authentication-under-psd2 https://eba.europa.eu/eba-publishes-an-opinion-on-the-elements-of-strong-customer-authentication-under-psd2 https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/34047/fca-delays-introduction-of-strong-consumer-authentication-rules  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  48  scheme, offers such processes, including mobile OTP on a smartphone application and  hardware OTP generators, depending on the identity provider.  What are the applicable standards related to this technology?  OTP generation methods are described in several RFC:   RFC 4226 – HOTP: An HMAC-Based One-Time Password Algorithm90   RFC 6238 – TOTP: Time-Based One-Time Password Algorithm91   RFC 6287 – OCRA: OATH Challenge-Response Algorithm92.  What are the network and information security considerations regarding this technology?  If the device is stolen, the PIN code may be known by the attacker as well, and in this case, the  security value of this soft OTP is nullified. If this soft OTP is combined only with biometrics without  a PIN code, this weakness is nullified, but this is rarely the case as many countries require  alternative authentication solutions to biometric ones.  As the one-time code generally is generally entered on the login page of the accessed service,  there also is a risk of interception with fake login pages (phishing) that could allow an attacker to  reuse the intercepted code during its validity window. This attack type could be executed by using  challenge-based OTP generation mechanisms.  However, the solution, even with a challenge-based approach could remain vulnerable to targeted  social engineering, as there is also a lack of information regarding the context of the transaction  that requires the generation of an OTP.  Finally, the Soft OTP token is also vulnerable to any malware that extracts or duplicates the  underlying key in the device. The security of the environment storing secrets is fundamental for  the overall resistance against attackers (software or hardware key store. Also, the use of  embedded biometrics sensors for such applications raises security concerns.  B.2.3 Mobile authentication with push notification  Specific mobile applications can be used to enable authentication on online service for a citizen.  The implementation may vary depending on the provider. Sometimes, the mobile application  manages the authentication from end to end, and sometimes it calls cryptographic elements on  the smartphone and/or in a server-side HSM. The authentication and cryptographic processes  are often provided as an SDK from security providers and sometimes embedded in a  smartphone application offering more services. Banking institutions have been following this  model in order to provide a secure but seamless user experience to their customers.  This approach now supersedes the classical soft OTP approach by bringing a better user  experience with:   Push notifications to advise the user of a pending approval   Transparent and over the air transmission of the signed challenge to the server without  needing to copy the OTP on the page of the accessed services   Allowing to replace the PIN code in the app with biometrics leveraging sensors embedded  on the smartphones.  90 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226  91 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238  92 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6287  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6287  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  49  What are the potential use cases regarding eID in an eIDAS ecosystem?  Such applications are used as an electronic identification means when citizens need to  authenticate on an online service.  Smart-ID93 is an electronic identification app available on tablets and smartphones. It enables  authentication of users seeking to access online services. Users register their devices through  the app using their digital ID cards and digital certificates. Once the registration is complete,  they can use Smart-ID to authenticate themselves for various services and digitally sign  documents. In the Baltic countries, 2 million people are using Smart-ID. They perform 40 million  transactions a month with the application, used for entering e-services, confirming transactions  and digitally signing documents.  Other examples in Europe use a similar application, such as Mobile BankID94 in Sweden,  L’Identité Numérique La Poste95 in France and itsme96 in Belgium.  What are the applicable standards related to this technology?  Depending on the technology used in the mobile application, different standards can apply.  What are the network and information security considerations regarding this technology?  As this eID technology is based on mobile applications, the security of the mobile environment  storing secrets is key for the overall resistance against attackers (software or hardware key  store) (refer to section 2.2.3.2 for additional considerations). Also, the use of embedded  biometrics sensors for such applications raises security concerns (refer to section 2.2.3.3 for a  detailed description).  The application or devices that contribute to the authentication process could implement several  security measures to offer protection against duplication and tampering. Moreover, certification  against schemes such as Common Criteria could bring confidence on the assurance level of the  solution.  Finally, it is interesting to note that providing end-users with the context of the authentication  they are performing (e.g. access to a given website, approving a payment for a given amount,  etc.) offers additional protection against social engineering attacks. End-users are indeed more  aware of the operation they are approving and therefore can identify more easily operations  they have initiated.  B.2.4 Cryptographic SIM or smartphone secure element  As a hardware component in the form of a chip used in smartphones, SIM cards can be used to  store secrets and electronic certificates to be used during authentication processes. They can  also embed additional applets than the ones used by network operators, for instance to have a  PKI-based SIM that stores authentication and signature certificates (as for Estonian Mobiil-ID for  instance).  Besides SIM cards, modern smartphones now directly integrate in the device additional  components that could be used to store secrets, sensitive materials or perform operations in  trusted environment such as:  93 https://www.sk.ee/en/News/smart-id-now-has-2-million-users/  94 https://www.bankid.com/en/  95 https://lidentitenumerique.laposte.fr/  96 https://www.itsme.be/  https://www.sk.ee/en/News/smart-id-now-has-2-million-users/ https://www.bankid.com/en/ https://lidentitenumerique.laposte.fr/ https://www.itsme.be/  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  50   Embedded SIM (eSIM)   Integrated SIM (iSIM)   Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)   Secure Enclave (SE)   Secure Element (SE)  Embedded SIMs are typically physical SIMs soldered into the device, enabling storage and  remote management of multiple network operator profiles. Integrated SIMs offer further  optimisations while retaining SIM security: the SIM moves from a separate chip into a secure  enclave. It is worth noting that eSIMs and iSIMs are secure, dedicated physical circuits rather  than software-based SIMs.  A hardware security module, a smart card, a trusted execution environment, a secure enclave  and a secure element are all computing environments designed for secure execution and the  storing of cryptographic keys. Their properties in common include their isolation from unsecured  environments with a degree of tamper resistance, the impossibility to clone them as they hold  unique cryptographic keys and their limited set of interfaces to reduce the attack surface.  What differentiates them is their form factor, which directly impacts their isolation and their  resistance to attacks. The differences between Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), Secure  Enclaves (SE) and Secure Elements (SE) are described below:   A secure element is soldered to a board or part of a system-on-chip package. It is isolated  from other computing environments on the same board or package but may not be  resistant to physical tampering.   If the secure element is inside the same chip package as the main processor, it’s called a  secure enclave.   A trusted execution environment is a software environment which runs on the same  processor as a less-secure environment, sometimes called Rich-OS Execution  Environment (REE) on smartphones. It’s isolated by a piece of software relying on  hardware functionality (e.g. Arm TrustZone or Intel SGX).  GlobalPlatform97 is currently working on standardising both SEs and TEEs. The defined security  features for TEEs are98:   Isolation from the Rich OS – all trusted applications and their related data are separated  from the rich environment.   Isolation from other Trusted Applications (TAs) – TAs are isolated within the TEE, and  from the TEE itself.   Application management control – any modification of the TA and the TEE can only be  performed by the authenticated entity.   Identification and binding – where the boot process is bound to the System-on-Chip,  enforcing the authenticity and integrity of TEE firmware and TAs.   Trusted storage – TA and TEE data is stored securely to ensure integrity, confidentiality  and binding to the TEE (or anti-cloning).   Trusted access to peripherals – the TEE offers APIs accesses to trusted peripherals such  as the screen, biometric sensors and SEs, under the control of the TEE.   State of the art cryptography – random number generation, cryptography and monotonic  timestamps are key assets for value-added services.  97 https://globalplatform.org/  98 https://globalplatform.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Introduction-to-Trusted-Execution-Environment-15May2018.pdf  https://globalplatform.org/ https://globalplatform.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Introduction-to-Trusted-Execution-Environment-15May2018.pdf  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  51  Regarding smartphones, Android-based devices are equipped with TEE and iOS-based devices  are equipped with a Secure Enclave within the System-on-Chip. The iOS Secure Enclave is  also responsible for processing fingerprint and face data from the Touch ID and Face ID  sensors. The Apple Secure Enclave Processor (SEP) has a U.S. Federal Information  Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2 validation.  What are the potential use cases regarding eID in an eIDAS ecosystem?  Electronic identification schemes already use a PKI-enabled SIM card. In Estonia, Mobiil-ID99, a  PKI-enabled SIM card, received when requested to the mobile operator, can be used to access  secure e-services, digitally sign documents and facilitates the enrolment flow to the Smart-ID  application100. In Finland, a PKI SIM card, called Mobile eID, is also used for electronic  identification. Moldova followed Estonia’s example with a mobile e-ID called Me-ID101, existing  since 2011. It operates the same way as the Estonian Mobiil-ID.  What are the applicable standards related to this technology?  SIM cards are defined by the TS 102 221 – Smart cards; UICC-Terminal interface; Physical and  logical characteristics102 and the TS 131 102 – Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systems  (UMTS); LTE; Characteristics of the Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) application103  standards. As described above, GlobalPlatform is currently working on standardizing SEs and  TEEs.  What are the network and information security considerations regarding this technology?  This technology was used in several notified and pre-notified schemes (refer to section 2.2.3.2  for the security recommendations on this topic discussed during peer reviews).  B.2.5 Mobile Connect  Mobile Connect is a global open and common framework developed by the GSM Association  (GSMA) in cooperation with leading mobile operators. The standard is already supported by 60  mobile operators in 30 countries104.  The framework offers authentication, authorisation, identity and attributes sharing or verification  for service providers, although for now, only one operator offers services related to identity and  attribute sharing, all others being focused on authentication. Mobile Connect’s prerequisites are  that the mobile phone uses a compatible SIM card and that the mobile operator supports Mobile  Connect.  The authentication process can work using several authenticators:   A seamless check by the mobile operator that the mobile phone is connected to the  network   A verification link sent by the operator through SMS   A USSD session initiated by the operator allowing the users to verify themselves by typing  a PIN that is stored server-side by the operator   A SIM applet used to authenticate the user on his mobile phone, with an authentication  request triggered by the mobile operator. The verification then requires either only to  99 https://e-estonia.com/solutions/e-identity/mobile-id/  100 https://www.smart-id.com/help/faq/registering/can-use-mobile-id-register-smart-id-account  101 http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/600821469220400272/pdf/107201-WP-PUBLIC-WB-GSMA- SIADigitalIdentity-WEB.pdf, Annex Moldova  102 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_TS/102200_102299/102221/11.00.00_60/ts_102221v110000p.pdf  103 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/131100_131199/131102/13.05.00_60/ts_131102v130500p.pdf  104 Source: https://mobileconnect.io/  https://e-estonia.com/solutions/e-identity/mobile-id/ https://www.smart-id.com/help/faq/registering/can-use-mobile-id-register-smart-id-account http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/600821469220400272/pdf/107201-WP-PUBLIC-WB-GSMA-SIADigitalIdentity-WEB.pdf http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/600821469220400272/pdf/107201-WP-PUBLIC-WB-GSMA-SIADigitalIdentity-WEB.pdf https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_TS/102200_102299/102221/11.00.00_60/ts_102221v110000p.pdf https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/131100_131199/131102/13.05.00_60/ts_131102v130500p.pdf https://mobileconnect.io/  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  52  approve the authentication process or to require an additional PIN code, verified locally on  the SIM applet.  The last authentication mode is the most interesting offered by the Mobile Connect framework  as it offers additional security with the usage of the SIM applet on the SIM card, which is a  secure element. For this authenticator, a SIM toolkit session is initialised by the SIM card and  generates the information prompted to the user, either to confirm an authentication or to type a  PIN code chosen at the service activation. This process thus uses the SIM applet directly,  without relying on a native smartphone application.  In addition to the Mobile Connect API used for authentication, the GSMA has also developed a  Discovery API (API Exchange) that can be used by a service provider (or a third-party identity  provider) to discover the mobile operator of the user trying to authenticate with Mobile Connect.  Figure 6: Mobile Connect standard authentication process105  In the process described previously, it is worth noting that identity attributes are not stored on  the user’s SIM card, as it would require additional storage space on the SIM which has limited  capabilities. Mobile Connect offers identification based, for instance, on identity attributes  gathered by the mobile operator, potentially shared with the service provider for which the  authentication is performed. However, the way Mobile Connect is deployed and used today is  more focused on authentication. Either way, in order to link the user with a persistent unique  identifier for non-ambiguous authentication purposes, Mobile Connect manages a PCR  (Pseudonymous Customer Reference). The mobile operator generates this PCR during the first  successful authentication of a user with Mobile Connect. This PCR remains unchanged for the  combination of an end-user and the application or web service, even if the user switches  operators.  105 Retrieved from mobileconnect.io  file:///C:/Users/mitraan/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/HUI0D3S5/mobileconnect.io  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  53  Besides, Mobile Connect could also benefit from contextual information captured by mobile  operators in its network to help identify risky situations and provide a risk-based approach. The  contextual data could include the SIM’s location, roaming, recent changes and more. Finally, in  terms of standards, it is also worth noting that the API provided with Mobile Connect for  exchanges between the service providers and the mobile operators uses Open ID Connect.  Building a comprehensive eID solution with Mobile Connect indeed requires defining how  identity attributes are collected, how the initial identity proofing functions, and how identity  attributes are issued once the authentication is performed.  An example of a Mobile Connect integration in an eID scheme: Mobile Connect et Moi  Mobile Connect et Moi is a French identity provider that is part of FranceConnect (the French  state-operated identity federation service). Mobile Connect et Moi offers a mobile app, used for  the initial identity proofing and the collection of identity attributes. The whole process is remotely  performed and requires taking a photo of a valid identity document and performing a facial  recognition (with liveness detection) to verify the requester’s identity. After this process, the  Mobile Connect service is activated on the SIM card and the user can choose the associated  PIN code. Mobile Connect et Moi, as the identity provider, stores the identity attributes  previously collected.  During the electronic identification process, the user enters his mobile phone number and then  performs a Mobile Connect authentication with the SIM applet and the PIN code. The PIN  CODE is verified locally on the SIM card. After the authentication confirmation, Mobile Connect  et Moi shares the identity attributes to FranceConnect, using Open ID Connect, that verifies  them and sends them to the service provider.  Mobile Connect eIDAS pilot  GSMA with its Mobile Connect technology was involved in an eIDAS pilot initiative which started  in 2015 to demonstrate how Mobile Connect can be used to identify a citizen of one EU Member  State in order to gain access to a public service of another Member State. Other stakeholders  were involved, such as mobile operators, technology companies and government services. This  pilot demonstrated the ability to support eIDAS compliant cross-border authentication with eID  means based on Mobile Connect, including the identity provider Mobile Connect et Moi. The  pilot was designed using the eIDAS reference architecture based on eIDAS nodes, with a  proxy/connector approach, as developed by the European Commission and the Member States  technical sub-group of the eIDAS Expert Group (see section 2.1.1.2 Interoperability framework  for eID).  What are the applicable standards related to this technology?  As Mobile Connect is a framework developed by GSMA, there is no applicable standard related  to this technology other than the Mobile Connect standard itself.  What are the network and information security considerations regarding this technology?  During a Mobile Connect API authentication request, the application declares the degree of  confidence that is required in the returned asserted identity. The recommended Level of  Assurance depends on the risk associated with an erroneous authentication: the greater the  risk, the higher the Level of Assurance. These Level of Assurance are defined in the ISO/IEC  29115 Standard, described in section 2.1.2 Other international & third-country frameworks.  Mobile Connect supports Level of Assurance 2 and 3, i.e. some and high confidence in the  asserted identity. A Mobile Connect authentication for LoA2 means the user needs to prove he  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  54  is in possession of the device, playing the role of the credentials. A Mobile Connect  authentication for LoA3 means the user needs to enter a secret PIN or use biometric factors on  the enrolled mobile device.  B.3 BIOMETRICS  Biometric recognition uses an individual’s unique physiological and behavioural attributes to  identify and authenticate his or her identity. Physiological attributes include elements related to  the shape or composition of the body, such as fingerprint ridges, iris patterns, or facial  characteristics. Examples of behavioural attributes include gait, signature, keystroke patterns,  and mouse usage. The type of attribute collected and matched is called modality. For example,  fingerprint and iris are different biometric modalities.  A practical biometric modality should meet the specified recognition, accuracy, speed, and  resource requirements, be harmless to the users, be accepted by the intended population, and  be sufficiently robust to various fraudulent methods and attacks to the system.106  During an enrolment process, physiological and behavioural biometric characteristics are  acquired through adequate sensors extracting distinctive features in order to form a biometric  template. At the time of verification, the system processes another biometric input which is  compared against the stored template, yielding acceptance or rejection.107 Biometrics can also  be used in an identification mode where a system recognises an individual by searching the  templates of all the users in the database for a match.  Biometrics can be classified into two categories, primary and soft biometrics:   Primary biometrics are modalities such as fingerprint, face, and iris recognition. They yield  accurate results for identification (relatively low FARs and FRRs).   Soft biometrics relate to an individual’s behaviour and includes keystroke dynamics,  signature analysis, and gait analysis. They are rarely used for identification purposes as  error rates are high to identify a user. However, these modalities are currently more and  more used for continuous authentication to verify the identity of a user throughout a  session.  What are the applicable standards related to this technology, for all modalities?  Biometric information protection is defined in the ISO/IEC 24745:2011 – Information technology  – Security techniques – Biometric information protection standard. It guides the protection of  biometric information under various requirements for confidentiality, integrity and  renewability/revocability during storage and transfer. Additionally, it provides requirements and  guidelines for the secure and privacy-compliant management and processing of biometric  information. This standard is currently under review108.  Requirements of biometric information protection include (ISO/IEC 24745:2011):   Confidentiality: “to protect biometric references against access by an unauthorised  outsider resulting in a privacy risk, biometric references shall be kept confidential”.   Irreversibility: “to prevent the use of biometric data for any purpose than originally  intended, biometric data shall be processed by irreversible transformations before  storage”. It thus should be computationally hard to reconstruct the original biometric  template from the protected template, while it should be easy to generate it.  106 JAIN AK, ROSS A, PRABHAKAR S, An introduction to biometric recognition, 2004,  https://www.cse.msu.edu/~rossarun/pubs/RossBioIntro_CSVT2004.pdf  107 RATHGEB C and UHL A, A survey on biometric cryptosystems and cancellable biometrics, 2011  108 https://www.iso.org/standard/52946.html  https://www.cse.msu.edu/~rossarun/pubs/RossBioIntro_CSVT2004.pdf https://www.iso.org/standard/52946.html  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  55   Unlinkability: “the stored biometric references shall not be linkable across applications or  databases.” Accordingly, different versions of protected biometric templates can be  generated based on the same biometric data (renewability), while protected templates  should not allow cross-matching (diversity).  ISO/IEC 30107:2016 focuses on presentation attacks and their automated detection. A  presentation attack is a presentation to the biometric capture subsystem to interfere with the  operation of the biometric system.  What are the network and information security considerations regarding this technology,  for all modalities?  Biometrics, in general, have a crucial security consideration to keep in mind: they are uniquely  and permanently linked to the person. The direct consequence is that if biometric template data  is revealed in some way, from a data breach, for instance, or if it can be copied, then the  security of this technology is nullified. Unlike passwords that can easily be changed, getting a  new fingerprint or face is impossible.  Concepts such as cancellable biometrics and biometric cryptosystems109 were thus investigated  and developed:   In cancellable biometrics, complex mathematical functions are used to transform the  original template data of a scanned fingerprint or face. This transformation is non-  reversible, meaning it’s impossible to turn back the transformed template data being into  the original fingerprint or face scan. If the database holding the transformed template data  is breached, these transformed templates can be changed for new ones, as each  enrolment results in a new unique template, even if the same finger or face is used.   Biometrics cryptosystems combine the strengths of both cryptography and biometrics by  dynamically generating keys with the help of biometrics to secure the template and  biometric system.  B.3.1 Fingerprint Recognition  Fingerprint recognition is one of the most popular biometric techniques used in personal  identification. Each individual has unique fingerprints, the pattern of ridges and valleys on the  surface of a fingertip. There are three basic patterns of fingerprint ridges: the arch (a pattern  where the ridge enters one side of the finger), the loop (the ridge enters one side of the finger,  then forms a curve and exists on the same site of the finger from which it entered) and the whorl  (the ridges form circularly around a central point)110. Ridge ending (the point where a ridge ends  abruptly) and ridge bifurcation (the point where a ridge forks or diverges into branch ridges) are  collectively called minutiae111.  Depending on the business needs and on the level of assurance needed, the number of  fingerprints captured and matched for an individual can be from one to all ten fingers. Multiple  sensors can capture fingerprints:   Optical sensors capture an image, mostly a photograph, and use algorithms to detect  unique patterns by analysing the image’s lightest and darkest areas112.  109  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257879510_A_survey_on_biometric_cryptosystems_and_cancelable_biometrics  110 http://www.biometric-solutions.com/fingerprint-recognition.html  111 ZAERI Naser, Minutiae-based Fingerprint Extraction and Recognition DOI: 10.5772/17527, 2011.

They thus read the fingerprint  on the dermal skin layer, eliminating the need for a clean and free of scares surface.  What are the potential use cases regarding eID in an eIDAS ecosystem and the related  security considerations?  At first glance, it looks like fingerprint recognition could be used for identity proofing as well for  authentication.  Indeed, another eID scheme or identity document storing fingerprints could be used to validate  an identity enrolling to another eID. However, fingerprints are subject to enhanced security due  to their sensitivity: they are, for example, protected with Extended Access Control on electronic  travel documents. Their access is regulated and restricted, which makes it a priori impossible to  use them to enrol a new eID.  Smartphone-embedded biometrics directly operated by the mobile operation system (e.g. iOS  and Android) also seem like they could be used as an authentication means (to protect secrets  stored in a smartphone or to unlock sensitive application such as the ones described in section  B.2.3). However:   Multiple fingerprints can be stored in Touch ID or equivalent, and they can belong to more  than one person.   Even if a specific fingerprint was saved during the enrolment phase, there is no way to  associate it with a specific action and to force its use as an authentication factor linked to  an eID means. Embedded biometrics sensor works with all stored biometrics templates  regardless of under which circumstances they have been enrolled. Mitigation measures to  avoid such situations are advising the end-user (similarly to advising smartcard users not  to disclose their secret PIN) or deactivating this functionality if additional templates are  enroled.  It is thus assumed that the owner of the smartphone is the one enrolling the templates and is  responsible for it. Therefore, in case of eID means using such biometrics sensor as an  authentication factor, there is no assurance that the templates enrolled match actually the  identity of the user that has been issued the eID means.  Moreover, fingerprint recognition technology is not immune to circumvention, i.e. the system  being fooled using fraudulent methods. A study has recently shown that fingerprint recognition  is vulnerable to dictionary attacks based on MasterPrints (real or synthetic fingerprints that can  luckily match with a large number of fingerprints, constructed with a Generative Adversarial  Network113).  Besides, fingerprints raise privacy concerns as their collection is simple and transparent for the  end-users. Therefore, fingerprints could be collected without the person knowing it.  The combination of these security and privacy concerns result in fingerprint recognition being  more and more abandoned in favour of face recognition for electronic identification.  113 https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07386  https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07386  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  57  B.3.2 Face Recognition  Face recognition is the process of identifying or verifying the identity of a person using their  face. First, the face needs to be detected, then captured and finally matched.  To capture a face, 2D or 3D sensors can be used. The “face” is then transformed into digital  template by applying an algorithm before comparing the image captured to those held in a  database.  Face recognition uses features of the face such as the distance between the eyes, the width of  the nose, the depth of the eye sockets, the shape of the cheekbones and the length of the  jawline. These features do not change significantly over time114.  What are the potential use cases regarding eID in an eIDAS ecosystem?  Face recognition could be used in the enrolment phase as well as the authentication phase.  France, for instance, is currently developing Alicem eID scheme which use facial recognition  during the enrolment phase. This eID scheme is in test mode. Facial recognition is used during  enrolment to make sure that the applicant matches the photo stored on the ICAO chip of the  passport. If they match, the facial recognition will validate the identity and enrol the identity on  the smartphone application.  What are the network and information security considerations regarding this  technology?  Facial recognition brings up multiple security and privacy considerations (Refer to section  2.2.2.2 for additional security considerations regarding face recognition that have arisen during  the conducted peer reviews), including:   Algorithms are often proprietary and difficult to rate, so their selection is complicated. NIST  is for instance maintaining a program to assess facial recognition algorithm quality115   Morphing pictures (creating a photo ID containing a graphical representation of several  faces, which enables multiple individuals to share credentials) is a way to bypass facial  recognition if the picture source is not managed correctly (i.e. if there is no existing  relationship between the picture and the identity, for example, through a national  database)   According to the GDPR, a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous consent must  be granted to approve the usage of biometric features116. As it should be a freely given  consent, an alternative to facial recognition must be offered.  B.4 PROSPECTIVE TECHNOLOGIES  B.4.1 eID using Blockchain/Distributed Ledger Technology  The blockchain is a technical solution that leverages the notion of distributed ledgers technology  (DLT) that was popularised by the bitcoin phenomenon born in 2009. A distributed ledger is a  replicated set of data across multiple actors. In the case of bitcoin, only the transactions are  shared and replicated. Distributed ledgers were created to ensure trust between actors without  the need for a third-party trusted by all the stakeholders.  114 For adult. For Children, facial recognition may not be suitable.  115 See for instance: https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/frvt-11-verification  116 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural  persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, Article 9, https://eur- lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj  https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/frvt-11-verification https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  58  Blockchains are created around a few fundamental properties:   Distributed and shared: for records to be consigned, the main actors of the blockchain are  required to know and witness that data is being recorded. All parties are therefore required  to be online and participate in giving the consensus to publish new records;   Immutable: the blockchain records integrity is based on an uninterrupted chain since the  beginning of the blockchain. This chain ensures the immutability of data recorded but  requires establishing a consensus to add a new block to the chain consistently. As a  consequence, records cannot be modified, but new records can be added to the chain to  describe modifications to existing ones;   Ordered: as the records are chained, they are ordered one after the other, which can be  used for proof of anteriority.  Blockchain technology can be leveraged to implement the immutable property of Self-Sovereign  Identity approach and the need of a distributed system to support it. It also serves as a  container for the Verifiable Claims that goes along with the SSI. Those two evolutionary  tendencies are introduced in chapter 1.4.5.  What are the potential use cases regarding eID in an eIDAS ecosystem?  Blockchain-based eID solutions can be used as electronic identification means, once the  identity information is proofed using a third party eID solution. In this case, the trustworthiness of  the identity information or verifiable claim a user can share is inherited from the authority that  proofed that piece of information. It may appear inconsistent to rely on trusted third parties to  proof identities to be used in a decentralised system, but blockchain-based eID solutions offer a  standard cross-platform technology independent from the eID solutions that trusted third parties  could offer and manage.  Identity proofing for blockchain-based eID solutions can be performed when the identity  information is first inserted by the owner, or later when the user wants to verify it against a  certain level of assurance requested by a service provider. This identity proofing can be  achieved through two mechanisms under the eIDAS framework117:   Authentication with a notified eID scheme   Electronic signature using electronic certificates issued by trust service providers.  What are the applicable standards related to this technology?  Blockchain and distributed ledgers technologies are based on a set of technical specifications  including cryptography operations. Some initiatives are launched to work on standards related  to blockchain-based applications. For example, ETSI launched in 2018 a new Industry  Specification Group on Permissioned Distributed Ledger118. The IEEE has been actively  pursuing blockchain standardisation efforts through various activities in multiple industry  sectors119.  When it comes to eID solutions as a blockchain application, the main initiatives are:    The one related to the Self-Sovereign Identity approach using Decentralized Identifiers  (DIDs), which are “a new type of identifier for verifiable, decentralized digital identity.  117 https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/system/files/ged/eidas_supported_ssi_may_2019_0.pdf  118 https://www.etsi.org/newsroom/press-releases/1473-2018-12-press-etsi-launches-new-industry-specification-group-on- blockchain  119 https://blockchain.ieee.org/standards  https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/system/files/ged/eidas_supported_ssi_may_2019_0.pdf https://www.etsi.org/newsroom/press-releases/1473-2018-12-press-etsi-launches-new-industry-specification-group-on-blockchain https://www.etsi.org/newsroom/press-releases/1473-2018-12-press-etsi-launches-new-industry-specification-group-on-blockchain https://blockchain.ieee.org/standards  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  59  These new identifiers are designed to enable the controller of a DID to prove control over it  and to be implemented independently of any centralized registry, identity provider, or  certificate authority.” Data Model and Syntaxes used in Decentralized Identifiers are  specified by W3C120   The one related to the Verifiable Claims to “provides a mechanism to express these sorts  of credentials on the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and  machine-verifiable”121 specified by W3C as well.  What are the network and information security considerations regarding this  technology?  A first security consideration to keep in mind is related to the blockchain technology itself and its  vulnerability to what is called the “51% attack”, where an attacker controlling a majority of the  nodes can record incorrect data to the chain. In this case, the attacker focusses on corrupting  the nodes, which is less complicated than attacking the cryptography behind the blockchain  itself. The more the blockchain nodes network is vast, the more this attack is complex to carry  out because of the higher number of nodes to corrupt.  Another issue regarding this technology is related to one of its inherent properties, immutability:  once identity information is added to the blockchain, they cannot be removed. If today it is  assumed that cryptographic mechanisms used with the blockchain are secure enough for  current attacker’s capabilities, no one can know for sure when technology breakthroughs will be  made available to overcome those cryptographic mechanisms, especially with the rise of  Quantum Computing122. When that happens, personal data stored in the blockchain would be  made public. To mitigate this risk, personally identifiable information and biometric information  should never be stored on a blockchain123.  One last issue to consider is related to the decentralisation aspect of the blockchain: the  features usually delivered by centralised systems are now to be managed by the users  themselves. The most striking example of these features is the recovery of lost or forgotten  private keys: in the blockchain, recovery of these pieces of information is not available, and  users must find a way to do it outside the blockchain, for example by using centralised systems  to manage their private keys, which goes against one of the reasons to use blockchain as an  eID solution.  120 https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/  121 https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model  122 https://medium.com/fintech-kellogg/quantum-computing-is-it-the-end-of-the-blockchain-10fa7e222b0a  123 http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/199411519691370495/Technology-Landscape-for-Digital-Identification.pdf  https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/ https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model https://medium.com/fintech-kellogg/quantum-computing-is-it-the-end-of-the-blockchain-10fa7e222b0a http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/199411519691370495/Technology-Landscape-for-Digital-Identification.pdf  X X  -0 0  -0 0  -0 0  0 -X  X -X  ABOUT ENISA  The mission of the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) is to achieve a high  common level of cybersecurity across the Union, by actively supporting Member States,  Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies in improving cybersecurity.

The eIDAS Regulation allows  Member States to notify their electronic identification scheme and since September 29th, 2018,  the provisions for mandatory mutual recognition of notified eID schemes have come into force.  The eIDAS Regulation also introduces 3 levels of assurance, Low, Substantial and High, for the  eID means issued under an eID scheme. Finally, it lays down the interoperability framework  supporting cross-border electronic identification.  This report provides an overview of the legislative framework under eIDAS for electronic  identification, presents the landscape of notified and pre-notified eID schemes and identifies key  trends in the electronic identification field. Moreover, it discusses preliminary security  considerations and recommendations related to the underlying technologies used for eID  means and makes a proposal on the role that ENISA could play in the eIDAS compliant eID  ecosystem. Since Germany notified in September 2017 the first European eID scheme under  the eIDAS Regulation, an increasing number of countries have started an eID scheme  notification process. Other schemes are pre-notified and more will undoubtedly follow, thus  demonstrating the success of eID across the European Union.  From historical card-based eID schemes requiring card-readers, Member States and identity  providers are moving towards mobile-based solutions, which are more convenient for the end-  users. This shift is clearly depicted on the latest notified schemes for which more eID means  include the use of smartphone. These eID means can use software applications but can also  leverage hardware embedded components such as SIM cards, Secure Element and Trusted  Execution Environment for an increased protection against attacks. In the future, it is expected  to have more mobile-based eID means relying on such embedded devices. Nevertheless, the  security of such an embedded device strongly depends on technology and the actual mobile  phone used.  Besides the move to mobile devices, other key trends in the electronic identification field include  the increasing use of biometrics and the need to take into consideration users’ privacy  (protection of the identity data as well as usage of eID means) while building eID schemes.  Today, distributed ledger technologies and blockchain for digital identities have also gained  momentum, although there are no cases of real world deployements yet.  Security considerations and recommendations  A significant number of published documents already provide relevant and useful guidance on  the security of electronic identification means; for instance: ISO standards, NIST Special  Publications and European focused documents (including a Guidance Document on Levels of  Assurance published by the Cooperation Network, which provides security considerations and  examples for a better understanding of the Commission Implementing Regulation 2015/1502).  The reports of the peer reviews performed during eID schemes notification processes (some of  them being public) and public opinions of the Cooperation Network on notified eID schemes  also provide very relevant feedback and key points to be considered while assessing the  security of electronic identification means and their compliance with a given level of assurance.  It should be highlighted that each peer review report should be considered holistically and  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  7  judgement on security components can not be drawn in isolation. These reviews and opinions  highlight some key security considerations:   Security of remote identification processes and solutions, as for trust services (e.g.  issuance of qualified certificates), is a major concern. There are currently no standards or  detailed requirements available to help identify how providers assess their process’s  compliance with a given Level of Assurance (LoA)  based on the classification scale of  Regulation CIR (EU) 2015/1502. However, remote identification requirements for each  LoA are currently examined and expected to be formalized in future updates of the  document “Guidance for the application of the Levels of Assurance which support the  eIDAS Regulation”, as additional guidance and standardization is needed in this area.   A rising number of mobile-based eID solutions require more detailed guidance (especially  on cryptographic modules used within the mobile) on their compliance with a given LoA,  especially for levels Substantial and High.   The use of SMS OTP in some eID schemes raises many discussion points regarding the  protection it can provide against a potential attack. Specific guidance on this technology  may be useful for identity providers.   As the eIDAS Regulation and CIR 2015/1502 do not require a specific certification scheme  for devices used within eID means for LoA High, the security assessment of such devices  and the consistency between these assessments may vary. Guidance and further  requirements (e.g. from ENISA and the eIDAS Cooperation Network) would be helpful in  order to ensure the security level of such devices, and explain how they maintain their  security level over time.  It is worth developing guidelines (e.g. ENISA, the Competent Authorities, the eIDAS  Cooperation Network) for some of the aforementioned topics to ensure consistency of eID  schemes across the Member States. These guidelines would benefit from an overview ofthe eID  technology and evolution of threats in this field.  Role of ENISA  Under the Cybersecurity Act, ENISA’s role in the eIDAS electronic identification landscape is to  support the development and implementation of Union policy, by proving advice and issuing  technical guidelines , also for promoting a common understanding of requirements for LoA and  to facilitate the exchange of best practices between competent authorities.  To that extent,  several opportunities to be leveraged by ENISA have been identified, including:   Support  national initiatives and intiatives of the Cooperation Network on issuing  technical and security requirements for eID: ENISA should work with national  competent authorities across the European Union, as well as with the Cooperation  Network,to identify their initiatives and facilitate the exchange of best practices on  technical and security requirements for the Substantial and High Levels of Assurance of  eIDAS.   Provide an overview of  technological advances and monitor the security of notified  schemes: Due to its mandate to support the European Union to improve cybersecurity,  ENISA has a role to play in reporting on the notified security of notified schemes. An  overview of technological advances should be carried out and ENISA should facilitate the  exahange of best practices and vulnerabilities between the Member States.   Publish an annual report on security incidents for eID: ENISA should publish an  annual report aggregating all security incidents which impacted notified electronic  identification schemes, alongside with an overview of the threat landscape for eID  underlying technologies.   Provide guidance on best practice for specific technologies upon request: ENISA  should publish guidelines and recommendations to ensure a consistent understanding of  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  8  the requirements of the CIR 2015/1502 of the eIDAS Regulation. These guidelines could  include use casesregarding compliance of specific technologies and solutions.   Bring insights to the eIDAS review table: ENISA will also be involved in the eIDAS  review process which is due in July 2020. As such, it should bring its technical expertise  and insights to define how the Regulation is fit for purpose and identify areas for  improvement related to electronic identification.  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  9  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1 SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES  Regulation (EU) No 910/20141 (hereafter the eIDAS Regulation) regulates the internal market  for Trust services in the EU, contributing to the implementation of the European Digital Single  Market. Furthermore, the eIDAS Regulation establishes the cross-border recognition of national  electronic identification schemes, in cases where Member States have notified these electronic  identification schemes.  One of the objectives of this Regulation is to remove existing barriers to the cross-border use of  the electronic identification means used in the Member States for authentication, at least for  public services. This Regulation does not aim to interfere with electronic identity management  systems and related infrastructures established in the Member States. Its goal is to ensure that  secure electronic identification and authentication can be used to access cross-border online  services offered by Member States.  The mandatory cross-border recognition of notified eID schemes and means applies since  September 2018. Following the publication and recognition process of eID schemes, citizens  and companies, equipped with a notified eID means, should be able to access online public  services in every Member State. The notification process ensures that all notified national eID  schemes meet the interoperability and security requirements established in the eIDAS  Regulation.  Electronic identification (or eID) constitutes a digital solution, which provides proof of identity for  citizens or organisations, to access online services or conduct online transactions. The objective  of this report is to overview the state of play of current technologies providing eID solutions,  outline the key trends that will guide its evolution, elaborate on security considerations and  recommendations on these technologies and provide a first insight into the envisioned role of  ENISA in this area. The target audience of the report consists of eIDAS stakeholders and third  parties interested in providing eID solutions.  1.2 THE LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK  1.2.1 Electronic identification in the eIDAS Regulation  The eIDAS Regulation provides a common foundation for secure electronic interaction between  citizens, businesses and public authorities. The Regulation aims at increasing the effectiveness  of public and private online services, electronic business and electronic commerce in the Union.  To this end, it includes provisions for electronic identification and trust services.  The provisions on electronic identification are new as this topic was not addressed in the  previous 1999/93/EC Directive superseded by the eIDAS Regulation. These provisions are  detailed in Articles 6 to 16 of the regulation and refer to notions of electronic identification,  electronic identification means and electronic identification schemes:   “Electronic identification” relates to the process of using personal identification data in an  electronic form, uniquely representing either a natural or a legal person, or a natural person  representing a legal person.  1 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/ES/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/ES/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  10   “Electronic identification means” is the material and/or immaterial unit containing the  personal identification data and which is used for authentication to an online service, and   “Electronic identification scheme” is the system for electronic identification under which  electronic identification means are issued to natural or legal persons, or natural persons  representing legal persons.  The regulation introduces several provisions, which aim to build a framework allowing citizens to  use their electronic identification means across borders with a shared level of trust. The  provisions primarily encompass the following elements, in particular:   Notification: an electronic identification scheme can be notified to the Commission in order  to benefit from cross-border recognition. Member States can submit eID schemes for pre-  notification following a pre-defined template that describes the key principles of the scheme.  The CID (EU) 2015/1984 defines the circumstances, formats and procedures of notification  for eID schemes. It also provides a notification form to be used by Member States. The pre-  notified schemes are reviewed by eID experts during a peeriveness review process.The  eIDAS Cooperation Network then issues an opinion regarding the compliance of the  electronic identification scheme with eIDAS provisions (especially regarding the compliance  with the requirements on the claimed LoA). The CID (EU) 2015/296 details the conditions on  the cooperation between Member States, including the peer-review of the schemes.   Mutual recognition: electronic identification means that have been issued under notified  electronic identification schemes shall be recognised for cross-border authentication to  access public online services. This mutual recognition is only mandatory for online services  that require electronic identification means with at least a Substantial LoA (meaning  Substantial or High) and for eID schemes whose LoA matches the level required by the  online service. For instance, a German public service requiring a High LoA electronic  identification means shall accept Belgian electronic identification means issued under a  scheme notified to the Commission for the High LoA. The CIR (EU) 2015/1501 provides  further requirements for the interoperability framework that supports the cross-border  authentication.   Level of assurance (LoA): the Regulation introduces three levels of assurance for electronic  identification means issued under notified electronic identification schemes: Low, Substantial  and High. The LoA of the electronic identification means refers to the degree of confidence  that can be put in the claimed identity of a person during an electronic identification using this  electronic identification means. The CIR (EU) 2015/1502 describes the minimum  requirements to be met for each LoA. It mainly details the requirements expected for the  initial identity proofing before issuing the electronic identification means, for the electronic  identification means characteristics (design, issuance and activation, lifecycle management),  for the authentication process and the general requirements for organisation and  management (including requirements for identity providers issuing these electronic  identification means).

It is  organised around 4 main sections:   Enrolment   eID means management   Authentication mechanism   Management and organisation.  It is worth noting that compliance with a given LoA for an eID means requires compliance with  all the requirements for this given LoA (i.e. for the 4 sections). This fact differentiates the eIDAS  framework from the NIST SP 800-63-3 framework, which evaluate the identity assurance level  (IAL) and the authentication assurance level (AAL) in separate documents7. This implies that  the “quality” of the identity data verified during the enrolment is correlated with the robustness of  the eID means and the associated level of protection against attacks.  The enrolment section details the requirements for identity proofing and verification. Several  options can be followed to fulfil the requirements for each level. It is interesting to highlight that  a valid eID means can be used during an identity proofing process in order to perform the  identity proofing and collect identity data as long as it has at least the same LoA as the eID  2 Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on the electronic  identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC  3 Commission implementing Decision (EU) 2015/296 of 24 February 2015 on the procedural arrangements for Member  States cooperation on electronic identification, pursuant to Article 12(7) of the eIDAS Regulation  4 Commission implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1501 of 8 September 2015 on the interoperability framework, pursuant  to Article 12(8) of the eIDAS Regulation  5 Commission implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502 of 8 September 2015 on the minimum technical specifications and  procedures for assurance levels for electronic identification, pursuant to Article 8(3) of the eIDAS Regulation  6 Commission implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1984 of 3 November 2015 on circumstances, formats and procedures of  notification, pursuant to Article 9(5) of the eIDAS Regulation  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2015/296/oj https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2015/296/oj https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2015/1501/oj https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2015/1501/oj https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2015/1502/oj https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2015/1502/oj https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2015/1984/oj https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2015/1984/oj  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  12  means for which the enrolment is performed. In addition, the enrolement section extends the  requirements for legal persons and for the binding between the electronic identification means  of natural and legal persons.  The eID characteristics sections detail the requirements for the eID design, issuance, activation  and lifecycle management. The following elements can be highlighted:   eID based on 2 different authentication factors is mandatory in order to reach LoA  Substantial.   For LoA High, the eID means must be protected against attacks with high potential, and  against duplication and tampering. However, the notion of high attack potential is not  defined in the CIR, but only in the “Guidance for the application of the levels of assurance  which support the eIDAS Regulation” to the CIR, issed by the Cooperation Network8.   Suspension and reactivation are possible, and the reactivation requires that the same  assurance requirements are met as the ones established prior to suspension.   For the renewal process, the CIR does not explicitly mention a maximum duration validity  for an eID means.  Regarding authentication, dynamic authentication is mandatory from LoA Substantial and must  precede the release of the identification data. The authentication mechanisms must be capable  of resisting attacks with enhanced-basic potential for LoA Low, moderate potential for LoA  Substantial and high potential for LoA High respectively.  Finally, the last section on management and organisation details the requirements for  participants that are involved in the eID scheme. These requirements cover general provisions  for the identity providers, the publication of mandatory information, the information security  management, the facility and staff management, the record-keeping, the technical controls and  periodic audits.  From a holistic global perspective, it is worth noting that:   These requirements are agnostic to the underlying technologies used for the eID means.  Even if the requirements could, for instance, suggest the use of a dully certified  cryptographic module to protect data used in an authentication mechanism for an LoA  High eID, no reference to any solution or technology is made, as well as no explicit  requirement in terms of certification scheme to be followed for eID means.   The requirements do not refer to any standards or norms (for instance, ISO 27001 for  information security management, etc.) that could be used to ensure compliance. Even if  the international standard ISO/IEC 29115 is mentioned in the recitals of the 2015/1502  CIR, no reference to this standard is made in the Annex which details the requirements.  Instead, relevant reference is only provided in the “Guidance for the application of the  levels of assurance which support the eIDAS Regulation” to the CIR, issued by the  Cooperation Network.  1.2.3 Focus on the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1501  The Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1501 (hereafter CIR 2015/1501) sets the  technical and operational requirements of the interoperability framework in order to ensure the  interoperability of the electronic identification schemes which Member States notify to the  Commission.  8 Retrieved from the European Commission website:  https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Guidance+documents?preview=/40044784/40044786/Guidanc e%20on%20Levels%20of%20Assurance.docx  https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Guidance+documents?preview=/40044784/40044786/Guidance%20on%20Levels%20of%20Assurance.docx https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Guidance+documents?preview=/40044784/40044786/Guidance%20on%20Levels%20of%20Assurance.docx  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  13  It introduces the notion of eIDAS nodes which are used to ensure the connection between  Member States. The Regulation elaborates on the requirements that these nodes must satisfy  in terms of interoperability, data protection or messages used for communication between  nodes, even if no specific standards are mentioned for these purposes. The only standard that  has been referenced is the ISO/IEC 27001 for the security management of the node operator.  There are no specific requirements for the security of the node regarding the LoA of the  electronic identification processed.  The Regulation also mandates the Cooperation Network to issue opinions on technical  specifications (see section 2.1.1.2), which could support the interoperability framework, and the  Commission to provide a reference implementation as an example, which Member States can  apply or use as a sample for testing. The CIR also defines the minimum data set required for  person identification in a cross-border context, namely the minimum data set that the eIDAS  nodes exchange between them.  1.3 OVERVIEW OF NOTIFIED AND PRE-NOTIFIED eID SCHEMES UNDER  THE eIDAS REGULATION  1.3.1 Landscape of notified and pre-notified eID schemes  For many years, certain European countries have been offering digital identities to their citizens.  The approach was mainly based on electronic identities supported initially by a national identity  card with an electronic chip. For example, Finland was the first country to roll out a national eID  card in 19999.  Since the eIDAS Regulation has come into force, several Member States have notified an eID  scheme. At the time of this report, more than half of European citizens10 have the ability to use  notified (or pre-notified) eID means, thus benefiting from mutual recognition that was made  mandatory since 29th September 2018. The notification pace has increased in the last months,  and 15 Member States11 have launched the procedure of notifying and pre-notifying eID  schemes. Figure 2 summarises the current state of play regarding notification for Member  States under eIDAS.  9 World Bank Group, 2016.

In 2018, the number of notification processes increased notably with six Member States  notifying eID schemes between September and the end of December 2018:   Italy, with its SPID scheme, which includes multiple eID means provided by several identity  providers for Low, Substantial and High assurance levels (depending on the type of eID  means used).   Estonia, with six eID schemes based on the national identity card, the resident permit card, a  dedicated card (Digi-ID), the diplomatic card and the e-resident card, as well as a mobile  scheme based on a dedicated PKI-enabled SIM (Mobiil-ID), all for assurance level High.   Belgium, Croatia, Luxembourg, and Spain notified eID schemes based on their electronic  national identity cards for assurance level High.  In 2019, six more Member States notified their eID schemes for the first time:   Portugal and the Czech Republic with eID schemes based on the electronic national identity  card for the assurance level High.   The UK with GOV.UK Verify, with eID means issued by private players (bank, post office, etc.)  appointed by the UK government, for the assurance levels Low and Substantial.   The Netherlands with a business-oriented scheme (for legal persons) for the levels  Substantial and High depending on the identity provider (3 identity providers identified in the  schemes providing various eID means).   Slovakia with an eID card-based scheme for nationals and foreigners for the assurance level  High.   Latvia with a card-based scheme (eID card and dedicated card) as well as a mobile  application for the assurance levels Substantial and High.  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  15  While also in 2019 two countries notified a second eID scheme:   Italy with a scheme based on electronic identity cards for the assurance level High.   Belgium with the FAS/itsme scheme, a solution provided by Belgian Mobile ID based on a  smartphone application as eID means, for the assurance level High.  In addition, at the delivery date of this report, two schemes were awaiting the completion of the  notification process with the publication in the Official Journal of the EU, after the Cooperation  Network had already published their corresponding Opinions12:   The Chave Móvel Digital, issued by Portugal, notified for the assurance level High, which is  based on certificates issued in a remote environment (also providing qualified electronic  signature compliant with CEN TS 419 241) and accessed through an authentication  mechanism involving a login/password which is coupled with hardware OTP sent through a  mobile application (through push notification).   The NemID scheme for Denmark. Similarly to the SPID scheme in Italy, NemID encompasses  a broad set of eID means ranging from basic card code (list of code to be chosen based on a  line and a column number) to a smartphone app and hardware OTP generator.  And two more schemes were going through peer review processes after being pre-notified by  their respective Member States:   The eID / ATK scheme for Lithuania, based on the Lithuanian national identity card.   The DigiID for the Netherlands, an eID scheme for natural persons based on a smartphone  application.  Finally, there is a need for further analysis13 for the third scheme proposed by Portugal (Sistema  de Certificação de Atributos Profissionais) to assess whether it meets the definition of an  electronic identification scheme, as defined by the eIDAS Regulation. It should be highlighted  that each peer review report should be considered holistically and judgement on security  components can not be drawn in isolation.  1.3.2 Considerations regarding eID means for notified and pre-notified  eID schemes  The first set of eID schemes notified in 2017 and 2018 is mainly based on electronic national  identity cards that offer electronic identification capabilities with their chip. This choice was  consistent as these countries have a long tradition in issuing these cards with a broad  population coverage. This approach takes advantage of an existing physical element, issued  during a process which allows strong identity proofing, and does not require additional physical  hardware deployment (which will increase logistics concerns and costs) to ensure a high level of  security. However, the technical specifications of the applet used on the chip of these cards, for  the chip based eID schemes that use this feature, and the way they are used (contact or  contactless) may vary from one country to another.  Many countries use chips to perform classic identification, authentication and signature features  based on electronic certificates. These cards commonly benefit from a Common Criteria  certification (typically with EAL 4 augmented with AVA_VAN.5) 14. This ensures an adequate  level of protection against duplication and tampering and attacks with high attack potential,  should the solution be used under the target of evaluation. They also commonly follow  12 Opinions of the Cooperation Network are publicly available here:  https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Opinions+of+the+Cooperation+Network  13 See Opinion No. 06/2018 of the Cooperation Network on the Portuguese eID scheme  14 https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/pps/  https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Opinions+of+the+Cooperation+Network https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=71763926  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  16  protection profiles for secure signature creation (such as the Protection Profile for Secure  Signature Creation Device - Part 2: Device with Key Generation15). This is, for instance, the  case for the notified schemes based on eID cards in 2018 (Italy, Estonia, Spain, Croatia,  Luxembourg, Belgium). Portugal also followed this approach for its electronic identity card.  Germany adopted a different approach for its eID scheme notified in 2017. Taking into account  strong privacy concerns while building the scheme, the application on the chip follows the BSI  technical guidelines TR-0311016 that extend security mechanisms, which are endorsed by  ANSSI and were later described in ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) Doc 930317  in order to provide electronic identification features. This notably includes PIN management (not  managed for Doc 9303 electronic travel document such as a passport chip). During a general  authentication procedure, it is ensured that the user correctly knows the PIN code (through  password verification using the PACE protocol18) and that the terminal trying to authenticate is  authorised (through terminal authentication v2 defined in the Technical Report). Data integrity  and authenticity of the eIDAS token are also ensured through Passive Authentication and Chip  Authentication extended for this TR-03110. In addition, the German eID scheme brings  advanced privacy features, such as the ability to perform pseudonymous (sector-specific)  identification and signature, in order to avoid the use of a unique identifier. In this scheme, there  is no central state-operated identity provider that performs authentication. Any service provider  willing to authenticate users based on their eID must be authorised and performs the  authentication directly (using a middleware provided by Germany). By 2019, approximately 69  millions German eID cards were issued (the eID application was already enabled on  approximately 30 million eID cards)19  REMARK  The newly adopted Regulation (EU) 2019/115720 on strengthening the security of identity  cards of Union citizens and of residence documents issued to Union citizens and their family  members aims at converging towards a common target for national identity cards issued by  Member States. The National Identity Cards will, therefore, need to comply with the ICAO Doc  9303, but may contain other applications that use more advanced security mechanisms.  Identity cards will contain a chip with an ICAO compliant application that can be used as an  electronic travel document, as is already the case for some of the notified eID schemes, which  are national eID cards. Member States will implement security protocols described in the Doc  9303 for electronic travel documents (relevant to basic access control, supplemental access  control or extended access control for fingerprint protection). As all European identity cards  shall be compliant, this could be a lever to develop electronic identity schemes and solutions  based on these standards, like the Alicem eID solution currently being developed in France  (using an ICAO chip on passport or resident permit, with a mobile app and an NFC  smartphone), which however has not been pre-notified yet.  It is also worth noting that the Regulation authorises Member States to store data for  electronic services such as e-government and e-business in the identity card. Thereby, this  does not question the approach of using a national identity card as an eID means.  15 https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/ppfiles/pp0059b_pdf.pdf  16 Germany’s Federal Office for Information Security, 2016.

The Estonian Mobiil-ID which is card based, the Latvian eParaksts, the  Portuguese Chave Móvel Digital, the Belgian FAS/itsme eID, the Danish NemID, and some of  the eID means issued under the Italian SPID scheme are examples, amongst others, of notified  or pre-notified solutions that follow this trend. The technologies behind the scheme are thus  different.  Mobiil-ID uses a specific SIM-card that is issued by mobile operators under contractual  agreement. This SIM card has an embedded dedicated application for electronic identification  and electronic signature. SIM cards provided are Common Criteria certified and are QSCD for  electronic signature. The part used by the operator of telecommunication services is out of  scope of this qualification. The user has two different PIN codes in order to use the  authentication certificate for electronic identification or the signature certificate for electronic  signature. The solution supports both RSA and elliptic curves for the private key used for  authentication and signature.  Regarding Chave Móvel Digital or itsme, the approach is different as the keys used for  authentication are stored in a remote environment. The security of the scheme strongly relies on  the authentication mechanism that is used on the mobile device to access these keys when  triggering the authentication process and especially on how these devices protect any kind of  secret used within the authentication mechanism.  For itsme, the solution is based on a smartphone application that needs to be enrolled, either  through an authentication solution managed by a registered bank (the registered banks are the  IDPs)  or by using the national identity card (also notified as an eID means by Belgium). The  authentication mechanism requires the user to type a PIN code (chosen during enrolment) in  the enrolled application after receiving a notification. The PIN could be replaced by a biometric21  factor supported by the smartphone (fingerprint or facial recognition depending on the  smartphone).  SPID and NemID also provide users with a mobile application (amongst other solutions such as  hardware token for these “multi eID means” schemes). Mobile applications could be used to  generate an OTP to copy on, as it is the case for SPID or with an out of band confirmation after  receiving a notification and typing a PIN for NemID.  1.4 eID KEY EVOLUTIONARY TENDENCIES AND OTHER  CONSIDERATIONS  1.4.1 Increasing usage of mobile-based systems  As described in section 1.3, mobile-based identification schemes are already in place in several  European countries, including Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Latvia,  Lithuania, Norway, and Sweden.  Other Member States also investigate the use of mobile-based electronic identification  schemes, as mobile usage has surpassed desktop usage worldwide (53% of website visits were  made via mobile in 201822), the mobile transactions are on the rise and these mobile  transactions require a seamless, secure identification, which will perhaps be mobile-based.  21 The Opinion No. 8/2019 of the Cooperation Network thus indicates, amongst other, that the use of biometric  authentication must be disabled to meet requirements for LoA High  22 Retrieved from StatCounter website: https://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/desktop-mobile/worldwide/#yearly- 2018-2018-bar  https://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/desktop-mobile/worldwide/#yearly-2018-2018-bar https://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/desktop-mobile/worldwide/#yearly-2018-2018-bar  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  18  This trend relies on a high and increasing mobile penetration in Europe (85% in 2017 and  estimated to go up to 88% in 202523). Mobile identity services are expected to be used across  many sectors, from banking to public services. Mobile-based systems have the advantage of  offering convenience and security. For example, mobile applications could leverage functionality  offered by mobile devices, such as geolocation and biometric features.  Moreover, mobile devices tend to increasingly make use of cryptographic modules, such as  Trusted Execution Environments, Secure Elements, eSIMs and iSIMs. eID schemes which  utilise these cryptographic modules could thus have an improved security.  1.4.2 Biometrics – shifting towards multimodal and behavioural  Biometric authentication is on the rise: by 2022, 5.6 billion mobile devices will be used to verify  1.37 trillion transactions24. These transactions will leverage upon built-in sensors on  smartphones.  As using a single biometric modality poses certain weaknesses, multimodal biometric systems  and behavioural biometrics are gaining traction. However, it should be noted that behavioural  biometrics are not among the authentication factors authorized for eID schemes according to  CIR 2015/150225. Single modality, even if used in multi-factor authentication environments, can  be hacked or hijacked. For example, authentication mechanisms always revert to a password  when a biometric authentication fails (see also section 1.1.1.1AB.3 on additional security  considerations regading biometrics). In response, multimodal biometric systems will be  increasingly used. The different types of multimodal biometric systems are mentioned in Figure  3.  Figure 3: Types of multimodal biometric systems26  System Definition  Multiple sensors  A system obtaining data through multiple sensors using one  biometric feature  Multiple samples  A system with multiple algorithms processing a single biometric  feature  Multiple traits A system consolidating multiple occurrences of the same body trait  Multiple instances  A system using multiple templates of the same biometric method  obtained with the help of a single sensor (e.g. multiple fingerprints  from different fingers)  Multiple representations  A system combining information about the biometric features of the  individual  23 GSMA, 2018.

Behavioural biometrics (see also 1.1.1.1AB.3 for a more extensive definition of behavioural  biometrics) are also becoming popular because of their convenience and continuous  authentication capabilities. Their collection is transparent for the user: they are, for instance  collected through pressure of fingers on the screen, how quickly someone types, the angle at  which the device is held, etc. The global behavioural biometrics market is predicted to reach  $3,922.4 Million by 202527.  1.4.3 Private sector involvement  Traditionally, governments would issue identity documents to citizens who would then use them  to prove their identity in the physical world. However, this identity ecosystem is changing with  private sector organisations being more and more involved, providing identity solutions or  services to both their own customers and other entities.  For example, according to GSMA, banks collectively spent more than $1 billion on identity  solutions in 201728, making them the world’s largest investors, even over public institutions.  Financial organisations, post offices and telecommunication operators, traditionally have been  conducting identity proofing. They are now leveraging their procedures to resell this service to  other organisations that rely on verified identities. Several identity schemes based on a  federation of private sector identity providers are already notified under eIDAS, including SPID  in Italy29, GOV.UK Verify in the United Kingdom30 and FAS/itsme in Belgium31.  Government issued eIDs could also be used to “verify” or “endorse” identities provided by other  organisations, including those with Mobile Connect authentication means.  1.4.4 Privacy concerns  Privacy is a key topic driven by user preoccupation, a rights framework and a strong legal  framework in the EU32. This trend impacts digital identities: sharing a digital identity online is  practical to access services, but once authentication is performed, the question is what happens  to the shared data. Citizens should have the right to keep control of their personal data and its  use. They are entitled to a digital identity under their own control, to use different verified  attributes to access a range of services as and when needed. Only information that needs to be  shared should be exchanged, and the identity proofing using multiple pieces of personal  information should only happen once.  A privacy-centric approach would enable citizens to prove a specific fact instead of releasing the  underlying data – for example, proving “I’m over 18” instead of providing the full date of birth or  proving “I’m a British citizen” instead of handing over full passport details. These practices are in  line with the data minimization principle resulting from the data protection legislation.  Germany’s eID takes into account these privacy principles: the unique identifier is only present  on the German eID and is never shared with the service provider; only a pseudonym is shared  27 https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/behavioral-biometrics-market  28 https://www.gsma.com/identity/digital-identity-expect-2018  29 Agenzia per l’Italia Digitale, n.d.

Similar features apply to  Luxembourg’s eID card, while  the UK has made this topic a major trend in their 2019 Call for  Evidence around Digital Identity, referencing to security concerns34.  1.4.5 Self-Sovereign Identities and Verifiable Claims  Privacy concerns described in the previous chapter originated the Self-Sovereign Identities  (SSI) approach. This approach is based on the idea that users should manage their own  Personally Identifiable Data and make sure that only the pieces  of information which are  absolutely necessary to  to prove their legitimacy will be shared with the service provider in  order to access their services. A self-managed identity framework no longer requires centralised  systems to manage the lifecycle of identities, and a decentralised system is needed to  implement this approach. Blockchain is a technology that offers both a decentralised operating  model and immutability ensuring the data integrity. It is thus able to support such an approach  (see also B.4.1 for additional details), although it is not the only technology for implementing  Self-Sovereign schemes. However, under the eIDAS framework, a central entity, to enrol and  verify identity data, is always necessary, as eID under eIDAS is based on verified identities.  One important aspect of the Self-Sovereign Identity approach is the fact that the user can share  only relevant personal data to service providers. To illustrate this, we can consider a sport-  betting website where only adults can use their services: in a classic authentication scheme, the  user will need to communicate his/her date of birth (probably alongside an identity card  containing other personal information) to prove he/she is an adult. Thus, realising more  information that the website truly needs. The only information the service must know is the  answer to the question “Is the user over 18 years old? (or 21, depending on the country)”. In a  Self-Sovereign Identity scheme, the user will prove he/she is “over the age of 18”, without  having to share his/her actual birth date. The statement that the user is over the age of 18 is  called a “Verifiable Claim” than can be previously validated by a trusted identity provider.  Trust in these Verifiable Claims is necessary for public and private services to use Self-  Sovereign Identities. Underlying this trust is the question of where the Personally Identifiable  Information comes from and how it was imported. The maturity of Self-Sovereign Identities  solutions and the amount of services using this technology will only grow once this question is  addressed.  The first implementations of these approaches are already taking place, such as the one being  developed by the Sovrin Foundation35. Canada has also issued a challenge to propose  technical solutions to support these approaches36. In Europe, the regional Catalan government  presented in September 2019 IdentiCAT, a decentralized digital identity project based on the  blockchain technology, in the form of a mobile application expected in 202037.  33 Federal Office for Information Security, 2017.

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS  2.1 DOCUMENTS AND STANDARDS REGARDING eID SECURITY  2.1.1 eID related European documentation: Guidance on Levels of  Assurance  The Cooperation Network has released a guidance document38 for the application of the levels  of assurance which support the eIDAS Regulation. This document follows the CIR 2015/1502  plan and provides guidance and examples to illustrate how the requirements described in the  CIR could be met (for Low, Substantial and High LoA). The document starts by detailing the  applicable definitions from the CIR 2015/1502 Annex:   Authoritative source   Authentication factor, including Possession-based authentication factor, Knowledge-based  authentication factor and Inherent authentication factor   Dynamic authentication   Information security management system.  Following these extensive definitions, the guidance document exhaustively lists the CIR  2015/1502 requirements, following the agenda of the CIR Annex, thus covering the three topics  developed during the peer reviews: enrolment, eID means design and authentication,  organisation and management. It also provides guidance to help identity providers comply with  these requirements.  Regarding the enrolment topic and the comparison between “one or more physical  characteristic” of the applicant “with an authoritative source” for the LoA High, the document  states that if staff is involved in this comparison, the staff must be “sufficiently skilled” and if  automated matching is used, “available best practice should be taken into account”. Best  practices about trained and skilled staff are provided in the document, such as possessing  knowledge of document design, security features, watermarks and printing techniques, and  being able to identify forged and counterfeit documents. However, the current version of the  guidance document does not elaborate on best practices and requirements regarding remote  identity proofing (performed for instance with videoconference or facial recognition), but a  subgroup of the Cooperation Network is currently working on adding parts related to remote  identity proofing.  In the electronic identification means characteristics and creation section, examples of  protection “against duplication and tampering against attacks with high potential” are provided to  satisfy the LoA High:   Embed cryptographic key material in tamper-resistant hardware security module if  possession-based authentication factors are used.   Liveness detection, trusted environment, low false match rate if inherent authentication  factors are used.   Certification against relevant technical standards (e.g. Common Criteria).  38 Retrieved from the European Commission website:  https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Guidance+documents?preview=/40044784/40044786/Guidanc e%20on%20Levels%20of%20Assurance.docx  https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Guidance+documents?preview=/40044784/40044786/Guidance%20on%20Levels%20of%20Assurance.docx https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Guidance+documents?preview=/40044784/40044786/Guidance%20on%20Levels%20of%20Assurance.docx  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  22  The authentication section of this guidance document provides a first insight on how an attack  potential could be interpreted and calculated. The potential of the attacks used in the eIDAS  Regulation (enhanced-basic, moderate and high) considers examples from ISO/IEC 15408  “Information technology – Security techniques – Evaluation criteria for IT security” and ISO/IEC  18045 “Information technology – Security techniques – Methodology for IT security evaluation”.  The document recommends assessing an authentication mechanism taking relevant threats into  account (online guessing, offline guessing, credential duplication, phishing, eavesdropping,  replay attack, session hijacking, man-in-the-middle, credential theft, spoofing and masquerading  are mentioned in the ISO 2911539).  It is worth noting that the document, as it is merely a guidance, provides illustrations and  security considerations. However, it does not provide explicit recommendations and mandatory  protection measures. Consequently, it is not a framework against which conformity with a given  LoA can be assessed. Additionally, guidance is not provided for all the requirements (incl. legal  person identity proofing and verification and renewal and replacement) in the current version.  Additional examples in the relevant sections (for instance eID means design and authentication)  could also be provided in order to give more insights to identity providers and to allow them to  consider these recommendations when designing new eID solutions.  Nonetheless, this guidance document is highly beneficial and should be enriched in the next  version to be adopted by the Cooperation Network, in order to provide eID solution providers  with more examples and guidelines. Some Member States are working on such a guidance  framework that could also be used for evaluation at National level40. The requirements’  framework prepared by ANSSI follows the same structure as the guidance document but  includes more recommendations and requirements that should be applied at national level.  2.1.1.1 Guidance on Notification  The Cooperation Network has also released a guidance document (drafted by Austria, Estonia  and the United Kingdom) for the notification process41, with the objective to provide guidance on  how to fill in the notification form. Currently, this document only provides guidance for two  sections of the notification form. It could be enhanced by providing guidance for each section of  the notification form, taking advantage of the feedback and suggestions of the Cooperation  Network and members of peer reviews that have assessed almost 15 notification forms.  2.1.1.2 Interoperability framework for eID  In line with the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation, technical specifications have been  developed in order to ensure interoperability and help Member States to implement the eIDAS  compliant implementation. The eIDAS Cooperation Network42 has endorsed a new set of  technical specifications (version 1.2) in Opinion No. 5/2019, superseding Opinion No. 2/2016.  The specifications have been developed by Member States and the European Commission  collaborating in the technical subgroup on eID of the eIDAS Cooperation Network.  To provide a comprehensive framework for interoperability, the current version of the technical  specifications consists of four separate documents, each concerning a specific area. This  framework, and especially the cryptographic requirements part, provides useful guidance in  order to ensure the confidentiality and the integrity of the data exchanged during a cross-border  39 Refer to section 2.1.2.2 ISO/IEC 29115:2013 – Entity authentication assurance framework for additional information  40 The requirement framework prepared by ANSSI is not public yet but will be published on the ANSSI website.  41 Retrieved from the European Commission website:  https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Guidance+documents?preview=/40044784/52602661/Guidanc e%20on%20Notification.docx  42 Cooperation Network established by the Commission Decision EU 2015/296 of 24 February 2015  establishing procedural arrangements for cooperation between Member States on electronic identification pursuant to  Article 12(7) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on electronic identification and  trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market - https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015D0296  https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Guidance+documents?preview=/40044784/52602661/Guidance%20on%20Notification.docx https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Guidance+documents?preview=/40044784/52602661/Guidance%20on%20Notification.docx https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015D0296 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015D0296  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  23  authentication process between the nodes. Even if it does not apply to the eID means itself, it  provides key security measures for the eID scheme generally, for the implementation of nodes  and the data exchanges between nodes. Moreover, security flaws or vulnerabilities in the  implementation of the interoperability framework could endanger the whole electronic  identification process.  As a recent example, a vulnerability in the eIDAS node integration package provided by the  European Commission was discovered in June 2019 and publicly disclosed on 29th October  201943. This vulnerability , which exploited a bug in the implementation of the system, identified  a weak procedure to verify the certificates used to sign SAML responses. By creating a  certificate (under relevant assumptions), it was possible to sign SAML responses for which the  signature was considered valid by the receiving MS node. By doing so, it was theoretically  possible, by forging a SAML response, to impersonate an identity in a cross-border  authentication context.  As also explained in section 1.2.3 of this report, the CIR 2015/1501 does not explicitly include  security measures for the nodes and node operators other than the adherence to ISO/IEC  27001 or equivalent. As a next step, an assessment could be carried out to include security  recommendations for node implementation in the Regulation (as per CIR 2015/1502) in order to  align the security of the interoperability part with the one of the eID means.  2.1.2 Other international & third-country frameworks  2.1.2.1 ISO/IEC 29003:2018 – Identity proofing  The ISO/IEC 29003:2018 standard gives guidelines for the identity proofing of a natural person  and specifies levels of identity proofing, as well as requirements to achieve these levels.  Identity proofing is the process to verify identifying attributes to be entered into an identity  management system and to establish that the identifying attributes pertain to the subject to be  enrolled. It includes the collection of identity attributes, the verification of these identity attributes  against authoritative sources and proof that the subject is indeed bound to the claimed identity  attributes.  This standard defines three levels of identity proofing (LoIP) (see  Figure 4). The levels are described as a combination of the assurance in the existence of the  identity and of how it is linked to the applicant. In order to achieve identity proofing at a specific  LoIP, the process shall successfully prove the existence of the identity at that LoIP and the  identity/subject binding at that LoIP.  43 See sec-consult website: https://sec-consult.com/en/blog/2019/10/vulnerability-in-eu-cross-border-authentication- software-eidas-node/  https://sec-consult.com/en/blog/2019/10/vulnerability-in-eu-cross-border-authentication-software-eidas-node/ https://sec-consult.com/en/blog/2019/10/vulnerability-in-eu-cross-border-authentication-software-eidas-node/  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  24  Figure 4: Levels of identity proofing (LoIP) under ISO/IEC 29003:2018  LoIP Definition  Requirements regarding  the existence of the  identity  Requirements  regarding the  identity/applicant  binding  LoIP1  Low confidence in the claimed or asserted  identity (identity is unique within the  context, there is an assumption the identity  exists, and the subject is assumed to be  bound to the identity).  The identifying attributes are  accepted without carrying  any checks.  The binding is  accepted without  carrying any checks.  LoIP2  Moderate confidence in the claimed or  asserted identity (identity is unique within  the context, it’s moderately established that  the identity exists, and the subject has  some binding to the identity).  The identifying attributes  exist in corroborative  evidence.  The binding was  checked using one  factor.  LoIP3  High confidence in the claimed or asserted  identity (identity is unique within the  context, it’s strongly established that the  identity exists, and the subject has a strong  binding to the identity).  The identifying attributes  exist in authoritative  evidence.  The binding was  checked using two  or more factors.  Levels of identity proofing should be selected based on a risk assessment of the subsequent  service and/or credential to be provided.  2.1.2.2 ISO/IEC 29115:2013 – Entity authentication assurance framework  The ISO/IEC 29115:2013 standard provides a framework for entity authentication assurance.  An entity can be either a natural person or a legal person, referred to as NPE for Non-Person  Entity throughout the document. After defining four levels of assurance (from LoA1 to LoA4) and  different actors, the security considerations are organised in three sections: the enrolment  phase, the credential management phase and the entity authentication phase. Guidance is also  provided regarding management and organisational considerations (e.g. legal and contractual  compliance, information security management and audit, external service components).  The four levels of assurance are described as followed:   1 – Low: Little or no confidence in the claimed or asserted identity but enough confidence  that the entity is the same over consecutive authentication events   2 – Medium: Some confidence in the claimed or asserted identity   3 – High: High confidence in the claimed or asserted identity   4 – Very high: Very high confidence in the claimed or asserted identity.  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  25  Levels of assurance are to be selected based on a risk assessment of the transactions or  services for which the entities will be authenticated. The standard provides a table to facilitate  this risk assessment by suggesting possible consequences and impacts of authentication failure  at the various LoAs. For example, if the personal safety of an entity could be substantially  impacted by an authentication failure, then the appropriate LoA is Very high.  Security considerations, called controls, are listed relating to threats, i.e. specific examples of  what an attacker could do. For enrolment and credential management considerations, these  threats are translated into controls based on the level of assurance: security considerations are  stronger for a High LoA than for a Low. The authentication phase is described differently: most  security considerations are applicable to all levels of assurance and should be applied as  determined by a risk assessment.  One key enrolment security consideration is that the enrolment must be completed in person  (for a natural person) to reach a very High LoA while it is not a requirement in the CIR  2015/1502 (remote enrolment could be used for LoA High). Another credential management  control is that credentials shall be contained on a hardware security module to achieve a very  High LoA. On their part, the authentication-related controls range from Multi-Factor-  Authentication to the adoption of anti-phishing measures and anti-counterfeiting measures on  devices holding credentials.  This ISO standard is quoted in recitals of the CIR 2015/1502, stating it was taken into account  for the specifications and procedures set out in the implementing act, but the requirements of  the CIR do not reference any specific section or requirement of the standard. Some Member  States, however, provide references to this ISO standard in their notification form.  2.1.2.3 NIST SP 800-63 – Digital Identity Guidelines  In 2017, NIST published four volumes to provide technical requirements for American federal  agencies implementing digital identity services. The guidelines define technical requirements in  the areas of identity proofing, registration, authenticators, management processes,  authentication protocols, federation and related assertions. These guidelines are agnostic to the  vast array of identity service architectures that can be developed and used.  The four volumes are the following:   SP 800-63-3: Digital Identity Guidelines44   SP 800-63A: Enrollment and Identity Proofing45   SP 800-63B: Authentication and Lifecycle Management46   SP 800-63C: Federation and Assertions47.  Unlike the eIDAS Regulation where levels of assurance are described in tandem to identity and  authentication, the levels of assurance in the NIST document, called xALs, are broken down  into independent levels regarding:   Identity proofing (Identity Assurance Level: IAL)   Authenticators (Authenticator Assurance Level: AAL)   Federated assertions (Federation Assurance Level: FAL), referring to the strength of an  assertion in a federated environment, used to communicate authentication and attribute  information to a relying party.  44 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63-3  45 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63a  46 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63b  47 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63c  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63-3 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63a https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63b https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63c  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  26  Each xAL has three levels, from xAL1 to xAL3. IALs must be selected by service providers  based on their risk profile and on the potential harm caused by an attacker making a successful  false claim of an identity. AALs must be selected based on the risk profile and the potential  harm caused by an attacker taking control of an authenticator and accessing the service. FALs  must be selected based on the risk profile and the potential harm caused by an attacker taking  control of federated transactions. Flowcharts are made available in the SP 800-63-3 volume to  help service providers perform a risk assessment in order to select their three xALs.  It is worth noting that all combinations of Identity Assurance Levels and Authenticator  Assurance Levels are acceptable, except AAL1 with IAL1 with personal data, and IAL2 and  IAL3, as passwords on their own are not enough to protect personal information according to  the E.O. 1368148 (section 3: “all agencies making personal data accessible to citizens through  digital applications require the use of multiple factors of authentication and an effective identity  proofing process, as appropriate.”).  One topic to highlight in the NIST guidelines is the “in-person proofing”. “In-person proofing” is  required at IAL3 and can be satisfied in either of two ways:   A physical interaction with the applicant, supervised by an operator; or   A remote interaction with the applicant, supervised by an operator, based on a strict set of  requirements, including:   A seamless monitoring of the credential service provider during the entire identity  proofing session from which the application shall not depart, for example, by a  continuous high-resolution video transmission of the applicant through an agency-  controlled device.   A monitoring of the entire identity proofing session by a live operator participating  remotely, previously trained to detect potential fraud and to perform a supervised remote  proofing session.   A digital verification of evidence (e.g. via chip or wireless technologies) performed by  integrated scanners and sensors.   Communications occurring over a mutually authenticated protected channel.  Another highlight of these technical guidelines regarding authentication is that authorised  authenticator types are listed for each AAL.  Regarding out-of-band authenticators, the document forbids OTPs via email (“[Authentication]  methods that do not prove possession of a specific device, such as voice-over-IP (VOIP) or  email, SHALL NOT be used for out-of-band authentication”) and places restrictions on the use  of SMS for OTP49. The use of the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) for out-of-band  verification is stated as “RESTRICTED” and NIST may adjust this status over time based on the  evolution of the threat landscape and the technical operation of the PSTN. Implementing a  RESTRICTED authenticator requires the agency to assess, understand, and accept the risk  associated with that authenticator.  The use of biometrics in the document is only partially supported for authentication because of  known limitations of such technologies (need to manage relevant False Match Rate, result of a  comparison is not deterministic, risk of theft of biometrics template without possible revocation,  48 https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/10/17/executive-order-improving-security-consumer- financial-transactions  49 Referred in the FAQ as authenticators leveraging the public switched telephone network (as for phone OTP as well).  Restrictions for such authenticators include to verify that the pre-registered telephone number is associated with a specific  physical device, to bind a new authenticator if the registered phone number changes, not to display the authentication  secret while the device is locked and to request a PIN, passcode or biometric to view, ask the user to accept the reception  of this secret.  https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/10/17/executive-order-improving-security-consumer-financial-transactions https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/10/17/executive-order-improving-security-consumer-financial-transactions  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  27  etc.). They should only be used as part of a multi-factor authentication process with a physical  authenticator, and additional requirements apply50.  Lastly, privacy is a strong concern of these technical guidelines. Many different measures are  listed, for instance:   The collection and processing of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) shall be limited to  the minimum necessary to validate the existence of the claimed identity and associate the  claimed identity with the applicant providing identity evidence for appropriate identity  resolution, validation and verification.   The Credential Service Provider shall provide explicit notice to the applicant regarding the  purpose for collecting and maintaining a record of the attributes necessary for identity  proofing, including whether such attributes are voluntary or mandatory to complete the  identity proofing process, and the consequences for not providing the attributes.   Multiple analysis and actions should be performed to frame the use of PII (perform privacy  risk assessments, consult with the Senior Agency Official for Privacy, publish a System of  Records Notice, publish a Privacy Impact Assessment, etc.).  It is important to note that the NIST SP 800-6351 provides very detailed and specific  requirements that are directly bound to specific types of authenticators or solutions. This is also  a noticeable difference with the eIDAS approach which remains technology agnostic. On one  hand, it allows very detailed guidelines for identity providers that want to set up an eID scheme.  On the other hand, it will require an extensive update process as technologies and solutions  evolve very quickly.  2.1.2.4 CEN/TR 419010 – Framework for standardisation of signature – extended  structure including electronic identification and authentication  The purpose of this technical report is to analyse the impact of CIR 2015/1501 and 2015/1502  on the already published standards for electronic signature and to analyse if updates or further  standards for identification and authentication are needed.  The technical report starts by providing an overview of the CIR 2015/1502 on levels of  assurance for eID means and the CIR 2015/1501 on the interoperability framework. The report  also mentions that a comprehensive framework for eID interoperability has also been published,  covering interoperability architecture, SAML message format, SAML attribute profile and  cryptographic requirements for SAML and TLS.  The core of the report describes the potential impact of both CIR 1501 and 1502 on the framework  for the standardisation of signature as described in ETSI/TR 119 000. Specifically, it details the  foreseen impact or evolution on the six functional areas of the framework:   Signature creation and validation   Signature creation and other related devices   Cryptographic suites   Trust Services providers supporting digital signature   Trust application services providers   Trust service status list providers.  The considerations mainly focus on the cases where the standards could benefit from the  provision brought by eIDAS on electronic identification (especially considering interoperability  50 Refer to NIST SP 800-63B section 5.2.3. for these additional requirements.  51 The SP 800-63 also includes a FAQ that gives useful examples for a better understanding of the publications.  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  28  architecture with 2015/1501 and LoA with 2015/1502). For instance, references to identification  and authentication are relevant:   When an identity proofing is required to issue a certificate or   When authentication of the signer is required to activate a remote signature process.  The considerations are thus not focused on the eID solution itself. Besides, the CEN/TR 419010  report, published in 2017, references several standards that have evolved since. The analysis  could thus be updated to provide a contemporary overview of the standardisation situation and  examine how to further expand the existing standards (e.g. by adding references to relevant  identification or authentication provisions for instance).  The last section of the technical report identifies possible areas where additional standards  could be developed in the field of eID. It notably identifies that standards are needed for identity  providers (as for trust services providers). Especially, it could cover technical specifications for:   Policy requirements for identity providers issuing identification and authentication services for  a considered authentication level of assurance.   Profile for protocol and/or data format for a considered authentication level of assurance for  identity providers.   Compliance testing of these profiles.  The second topic identified as relevant for standardisation is devices supporting identification  and authentication. Standards developed around this topic could describe eIDAS compliant eID  application profiles and conformity assessment methodologies52.  2.2 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS FOR eID SOLUTIONS BASED ON  PEER REVIEW FEEDBACK  2.2.1 Introduction  This section highlights the security considerations that emerged from the various peer reviews of  the eID schemes which have already been pre-notified to the European Commission by Member  States. These considerations are of interest, as they highlight recommendations to be followed  for a targeted LoA. These considerations cover the main topics that are studied during peer  reviews, following the structure of the CIR 2015/1502:   Enrolment   Electronic identification means management and authentication   Management and organisation.  These considerations and recommendations are not exhaustive and are only examples of topics  that raise questions and discussions that could also benefit from further guidance. Further  analysis of the technologies used on eID solutions is provided in the Annex “Technological  landscape of eID solutions”.  2.2.2 Enrolment  2.2.2.1 Verification of document for identity proofing  Peer reviews have highlighted complexity for the verification and validation of identity  documents, especially in the case of foreign identity documents that are used for a request of  an eID (as it is the case for some of the already notified eID schemes). As personnel in charge  of document verification are not always trained to handle such documents, identification could  52 Examples of PP given include for instance the PP for German eID (based on TR 03110) and PP EN 419251 (2013).  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  29  be difficult. These considerations do not apply to a specific scheme but could be faced by any  Member State that needs to verify the identity of non-residents within the scope of their eID  scheme. Some recommendations could thus be identified, including:   International databases such as the Schengen Information System (SIS) or Interpol  databases, PRADO database for verification of optical/physical security features of identity  documents, iFADO (Intranet False and Authentic Documents Online) should be used to  confirm the documents’ validity.   If the verification is performed physically or if the identification is performed solely based  on the picture of a document, a professional and trained agent should assess the validity  of the document.  Consequently, the robustness of the measures in place could affect the assurance that can be  placed in the identification process and thus the associated LoA. This consideration may apply  to all Member States with schemes that are opened to foreigners with foreign-identity  documents.Therefore an EU-wide approach with shared and common guidance could be of  interest for all Member States to address these considerations.  2.2.2.2 Remote identification (video-based) and facial recognition  The use of remote processes for identity proofing before issuing the eID means has been subject  to several security considerations across different peer reviews. This topic is of great interest as  it is now utilised by more processes, and we can expect this use to increase. Besides the use of  remote identification in eID schemes, we can, for instance, mention:   Digital Bank account (know also as neo-bank account) opening that uses a video call with  a bank operator in order to present in front of the camera an identity document and check  that the applicant has the alleged  identity in the identity document.   Car-rental websites that enrol customers by scanning their driving licence to perform a  facial recognition with liveness detection in order to ensure the customer corresponds to  the driving licence.   Remote identification processes already in use for the issuance of qualified certificates for  trust services under eIDAS.  As these processes become more common, we can expect the same for the identity proofing  before the issuance of an eID means by an identity provider. This is already the case for some  of the notified schemes such as Italy (SPID), the Netherlands (eHerkenning) or the UK  (GOV.UK Verify).  The security considerations arising include:   Using a simple photo of the face and of the document raises some questions and remarks  in order to verify if it complies with LoA Substantial. Proven attacks could exist with the  manipulation of the image taken without obvious evidence. This risk could be increased if  the environment is untrustworthy (e.g. a rooted or jailbroken smartphone or an untrusted  webcam on a laptop/desktop).   Rapid developments in video manipulation attacks, such as video simulation and real-time  re-enactement, pose new risks.   It is currently complex to identify which security measures and requirements should  comply with the LoA High, which leads to a non-consensus of experts while evaluating  such technologies against the mentioned LoA. Relevant work in progress, guided by the  Cooperation Network, is expected to address these issues.   Especially for facial recognition, it has been noted that evaluation of assurance is unclear  as there are no guidelines to relate the FAR of a facial recognition solution to an eIDAS  LoA (this is notably mentioned in the publicly available UK peer review).  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  30  In the case of video-based identification, verification of the authenticity of the identity document  and exploitation of the photo by the agent in charge of the verification also raises questions  regarding the associated assurance. In Opinion No. 1/201853 for SPID eID schemes, the  Cooperation Network has issued its opinion taking into account that Italy will remove video  identification for the LoA High. All the above mentioned examples  demonstrate the complexity  of assessing such solutions and the lack of a framework for assessing it.  Knowing that attack vectors could be used at each step of the process, including fake subject,  counterfeit or fake documents presented, manipulation of the video, and the lack of capacity to  verify the user identity by agent, some security measures have already been identified such as:  Using liveness detection along with a facial recognition algorithm. For instance, a random  motion could be requested to the applicant or selfies could be taken in motion. . It should be  noted that liveness detection in this case requires control over the biometric sensor, which in  this scenario is under control of the attacker and not the verifier.   If possible, using a picture already related to the applicant in a national database.  Additional security checks could be carried out in case of doubt.   Verifying the document’s authenticity using Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) or optical  security features (photographs, font type, quality, holograms, laminate integrity, spelling  mistakes, print quality, etc.). It should be noted however, that most of the optical security  features such as holograms cannot be verified properly in the context of remote  identification.   Using a photo extracted from a chip (e.g. passport ICAO chip) with for instance an NFC-  ready smartphone to guarantee the integrity of the data. As this photo would be signed,  verifying the signature would provide assurances for the authenticity of the photo. The  European Regulation standardizing national identity cards54 is an opportunity as it  establishes a common format to protect the photo across Member States.  As the eIDAS Regulation does not prevent remote identification, the Cooperation Network is  currently working onproviding guidance on this topic and examining standardisation  requirements to help assess the solutions that make use of these technologies. It is also worth  noting that this topic already has raised many discussion points between experts as it is also a  major concern for trust services such as the issuance of qualified certificates (i.e. how can the  identity of the certificate holder be verified remotely). Better guidance, standardisation and  conformity assessment practices are highly expected in this area.  2.2.2.3 Qualified electronic signature for enrolment  In case of an identity proofing using a qualified electronic signature, it is relevant to note that  eIDAS (Article 24) allows the use of an eID means complying at least with LoA Substantial or  High, but only if there was a physical presence during the enrolment. Therefore, in the case of  identity proofing for LoA High, some complexity could arise as a qualified signature performed  with a qualified certificate issued with a LoA Substantial eID means may not be accepted as  proof of identity. This consideration must be taken into account when relevant.  2.2.3 Electronic identification means management and authentication  2.2.3.1 eID means using mail or SMS OTP  53 See Opinion No. 1/2018 of the Cooperation Network on the Italian eID scheme  54 Regulation (EU) 2019/1157 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on strengthening the security  of identity cards of Union citizens and of residence documents issued to Union citizens and their family members exercising  their right of free movement  https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=65972774 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32019R1157 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32019R1157 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32019R1157  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  31  SMS or email OTP are known to be subject to various types of attacks (see also annex B.2.1 for  an extensive overview of OTP SMS, link to recent attacks and email security considerations).  OTP delivered through SMS, for instance, could be attacked with:   SS7 vulnerabilities with attackers gaining access to the signalling network used for SMS  transport.   Malware attacks on the smartphone used to re-route SMS without any notification of the  recipient.   SIM swapping attacks that are still common today.  However, for SMS OTP, attacks may be technically complex or may require significant effort to  target a given user. If combined with another authentication factor (such as a password), they  may still remain attractive, providing reasonable protection against several attacks. They are  also familiar to end-users as they are extensively used for online banking and payment.  In  addition, mobile operators could implement more security measures to enhance security  (access to SS7 network, identity check for SIM change, check of SIM changes, etc.)55.  Discussions remain regarding the potential of attacks against which SMS OTP could bring  protection. Acceptability of SMS OTP in eID means targeting LoA High, for instance, is subject  to discussion (schemes with an authentication using SMS OTP and a second factor to trigger  access to keys stored on an HSM).  This topic is currently being discussed between experts.  Specific guidance could be offered in order to clarify vulnerabilities and secure solutions for  SMS OTP.  Regarding mail OTP, these can also be subject to various attacks, the most common being  gaining fraudulent access to the webmail of the user. As this attack type is prevalent and can  scale (e.g. in case of massive account compromise, this could lead to massive risks for mail  OTP), such solutions shouldnot be used even for the Substantial level for eID means.  2.2.3.2 eID mobile-based solutions (software-based, using SE or TEE, SIM-based)  The use of mobile-based eID solutions, in line with end-users’ expectations, is increasing and  will continue to increase in the coming years following the smartphone penetration rate. As the  number of pre-notified and notified mobile-based solutions increases, so do the considerations  that can be highlighted from the reviews and opinions.  One of the key security considerations is the protection of the secrets or cryptographic materials  used within the solution for authentication. Based on the architecture of the solution, the secrets  could be, for instance (the following list is not exhaustive):   Stored on the mobile device encrypted on software key store   Stored on the mobile device on hardware key store such as an embedded secure element  or secure enclave (SE) and used only in a trusted execution environment (TEE) in order to  offer protection of the secrets while stored and used   Stored on the SIM card of the mobile phone, used as a cryptographic chip.  In all cases, the solution may also store other secrets involved in the authentication process in a  remote cryptographic component. The considerations of this section focus on the secrets stored  on the mobile part.  55 According to ENISA’s report of March 2018 (“Signalling Security in Telecom SS7/Diameter/5G - EU level assessment of  the current situation”), in terms of SS7 minimum security measures are adopted by the majority of the providers, and most  operators (87%) implement SMS home routing, to protect their networks against from leaking sensitive information  associated with a subscriber, which would help to mount further attacks. This is only applicable if the owner of the eID  scheme has a relationship to all MNOs whereby he can validate/enforce the applied security measures.  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  32  The latest opinion on the Latvian eParaksts scheme and the Belgian FAS/itsme scheme  (respectively Opinion No. 7/2019 and Opinion No. 8/2019) for the LoA High highlight that such  solutions which use smartphone applications should envisage the use of a hardware key store  such as SE/TEE. The opinions also raise the question of the certification of such SE as they are  mainly not certified against any recognised schemes at the moment, as well as the follow-up of  vulnerabilities on such SE in time. However, it should be noted that not all Member States  concure on introducing requirements for certified components in an eID scheme. It could be  interesting to go further in this analysis by providing an overview of SE/TEE with a list of  certified SEs (if any) and of known vulnerabilities on these components. Such lists would benefit  identity providers issuing mobile-based solutions and would be consistent with the opinions  issued by the Cooperation Network.  Regarding the use of SIM-based solutions to store secrets and cryptographic materials, the  approach is currently followed by Estonia with the Mobiil-ID solution. This solution has been the  subject of discussion during peer review and concerns were raised in Opinion No. 5/2018  regarding the ability of such solutions to be used under the sole control of the user and  therefore provide protection against attacks with high potential (larger attack surface). These  concerns should also apply to solutions using SE/TEE but do not explicitly appear in the related  opinion mentioned in the previous section.  As for the recommendation for SE/TEE, clearer guidance should be provided and it would be  helpful for identity providers in order to help them identify under which conditions SIM-based  solutions can comply with the LoA High, especially by providing protection against attacks with  high potential.  2.2.3.3 Use of biometrics authenticators within eID mobile-based solutions  Consistent with the rise of smartphone-based authentication solutions, the use of embedded  biometrics authenticators is now widespread. They mainly consist in biometric sensors for  fingerprint or for facial recognition. They are operated directly by the operation system (iOS or  Android) and not by the application used for authentication. Commonly, they are used as a  replacement of the PIN code. This raises several considerations (see also section B.3 for  additional security considerations regarding biometrics):   The security of the sensors can vary from one device manufacturer56 to the other with false  acceptance and false rejection rates that could differ.   The solutions often allow to enrol several biometric templates without sufficient checks of  the user enrolling a template. Moreover, the application may not choose which templates  are used during the authentication process. This is an issue to ensure that the user of an  eID is legitimate. In such cases mitigation measures should be applied, as for example  advising the user or even deactivating the function if additional templates are enrolled.  The position of the Cooperation Network in the latest Opinions (No.7/2019 and No.8/2019) for  the Latvian eParaksts and the Belgian itsme schemes is aligned with these considerations: to  meet the requirements for LoA High, Latvia and Belgium should commit to disable the use of  biometric authentication for this LoA.  2.2.3.4 Considerations on other authentication solutions used to trigger access to  certificates stored on a remote HSM  Several peer reviews highlighted considerations regarding eID means based on cryptographic  materials (such as certificates with private key) stored on a remote environment such as HSM  that can be activated only by the user (an approach similar to qualified electronic signature  performed on a remote QSCD under the sole control of the user).  56 See for instance: https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-4s-face-unlock-works-even-if-you-have-your-eyes-closed/  https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-4s-face-unlock-works-even-if-you-have-your-eyes-closed/  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  33  In this case, the assurance of the authentication required to activate the use of the keys stored  in an HSM, is key for the overall security of the solution. Various approaches are used within the  schemes notified such as SMS OTP, software OTP (on a mobile app), hardware OTP, virtual  smartcard, etc. The above considerations for SMS OTP and mobile-based solutions shouldbe  taken into account to assess the compliance with the claimed LoA.  It is certain that this solution type will flourish in the future as it aligns with the eIDAS approach  on remote electronic signature. Therefore, it might be possible for Member States to issue  guidelines regarding rules and standards against which such solutions could be assessed and  the conditions that will make them compliant with the LoA High.  2.2.3.5 Certification of devices usedin eID means  The certification of the eID means (being smartcard, HSM or other cryptographic module-based)  used is a key consideration in order to ensure trust in the ability of a solution to offer protection  against a given attack potential.  Among the pre-notified and notified schemes, several certification schemes are highlighted by  Member States to demonstrate the security of devices:   Common Criteria certification is a basis and devices are mainly being certified CC EAL4  augmented with AVA_VAN.5.   QSCD certification under eIDAS Regulation is often done and is used to demonstrate the  security level of the chip used. It is thus widespread for eIDs based on national eID cards  already used for electronic signature purposes. It should be noted nonetheless, that the  certification scope for local chip QSCD strongly varies from that for remote QCSDs.   Protection profiles are also referenced and used as a base for QSCD certification.  Some public peer-review reports57 have highlighted the need for periodical certification and not  only to rely on an initial certification. In the context of the ROCA vulnerability, this approach is  indeed relevant as it appears that a certification that ensures a protection against a given attack  potential at the time of its issuance may not provide the same assurance a few years later (as  attacks methods and the threat landscape evolve quickly).  It would be relevant to have additional guidance for devices used within eID means regarding  needs in terms of certification (including the scope of the certification) and maintenance in time.  Nevertheless, some Member States have already put approaches in place at national level, in  order to review the evaluation of security components on a regular basis (vulnerability  assessment, cryptography evaluation, etc.). This is the case in France for instance where  ANSSI promotes its “qualification” approach.  2.2.4 Management and organisation  2.2.4.1 Certification of identity providers issuing eID means  The topics related to management and organisation are generally the ones raising the least  comments in peer review reports. Some recommendations have already been given by the  Cooperation Network in their guidance document. There are existing standards (against which  certification is possible) that could be followed by identity providers or third parties involved in  the eID means management for compliance with some of the requirements of the CIR.  Such standards which are highlighted in notification forms or supporting documentation provided  for schemes pre-notification include for instance:  57 See for instance the peer review reports for the Croatian and Luxembourgish schemes, publicly available on the  European Commission website.  https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Overview+of+pre-notified+and+notified+eID+schemes+under+eIDAS  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  34   ISO/IEC 27001:2013 for fulfilment of requirements on information security management,  record keeping, facility and staff and technical controls   Relevant ETSI standards such as ETSI EN 319 401 and ETSI EN 319 411-1 and ETSI EN  319 411-2.  Guidance could be provided in order to help identity providers match the requirements covered  by a certification they already have (as per the mapping already proposed in the current version  of the guidance document of the Cooperation Network). For instance, a provider already  certified as QTSP could easily benefit from all the requirements already covered by the  qualification and the ETSI standards against which it has been assessed. Such standards, if  relevant, could eventually be referred to in the legislation.  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  35  3. NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR  ENISA UNDER THE  CYBERSECURITY ACT  According to the Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17  April 2019 on ENISA and on information and communications technology cybersecurity  certification58 (hereafter Cybersecurity Act), ENISA’s role is in line with achieving “a high  common level of cybersecurity across the Union, including by actively supporting Member  States, Unions institutions, bodies, offices and agencies in improving cybersecurity”. ENISA  shall also “act as a reference point for advice and expertise on cybersecurity for Union  institutions, bodies, offices and agencies as well as for other relevant Union stakeholders”  (Article 3(1)).  In Article 4(6) of this Regulation, it is stated that ENISA “shall promote the use of European  cybersecurity certification, with a view to avoiding the fragmentation of the internal market”. In  the eID landscape, The Commission and ENISA could coordinate the pursuit of consistency  across national competent authorities that have issued or are still working on detailed technical  and security requirements based on the Commission Implementing Regulation 2015/1502.  It is also stated in this Regulation, in Article 5(5), that ENISA “shall contribute to the  development and implementation of Union policy and law […] in the field of electronic identity  and trust services, in particular by providing advice and issuing technical guidelines, as well as  by facilitating the exchange of best practices between competent authorities”. To this end,  ENISA could carry out a periodic technological overview on electronic identification means and  solutions as well as on the evolution of the threat landscape in this area. In case of a  vulnerability, ENISA could put in place communication means between Member States and  provide its expertise.  Along the same lines, it could also be interesting to extend Article 10 of the eIDAS Regulation  focusing on security breaches and stating, “where either the electronic identification scheme […]  or the authentication […] is breached or partially compromised […], the notifying Member States  […] shall inform other Member States and the Commission.” Indeed, Member States have a  58 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/881/oj/  COORDINATE NATIONAL INITIATIVES ON ISSUING TECHNICAL AND  SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR eID  ENISA could work with national Competent Authorities across the European Union to identify  their initiatives and share their views on technical and security requirements for the  Substantial and High Levels of Assurance of eIDAS.  ENISA’s role is  to contribute to  a coherent  European  cybersecurity  landscape  regarding  electronic  identification.  PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND  REPORT ON SECURITY INCIDENTS OF NOTIFIED SCHEMES  ENISA has a role to play in reporting on the security incidents of notified schemes. An  overview of technological advances could be carried out and ENISA could facilitate the  exchange of best practices and vulnerabilities between the Member States.  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/881/oj/  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  36  similar obligation regarding trust service providers: supervisory bodies “shall provide ENISA  once a year with a summary of notifications of breach of security and loss of integrity received  from trust providers” (Article 19 of the eIDAS Regulation). Accordingly, ENISA prepares an  annual report aggregating these breaches to show root causes, statistics and trends. A similar  report could thus be made available to Member States and interested eID stakeholders,  summarising security breaches and incidents of notified electronic identification means and  identity providers issuing these electronic identification means. This report could also include a  threat overview of underlying authentication technologies, which would benefit from the  technological watch proposed in the foregoing provision.  Besides, leveraging technological advances and security concerns of eID schemes and  underlying technologies, ENISA could provide further guidance, including on the definition of the  levels of assurance and attack potential to ensure a consistent comprehension of the topic from  one Member State to another. The NIST guidelines have,for instance, developed flowcharts to  help define which level of assurance is required per use case. Moreover, as stated in section  2.2, ENISA could go one step further and publish recommendations on specific topics, including  OTP SMS and remote identity proofing, in close collaboration with Competent Authorities and  the Cooperation Network.  Finally, as the eIDAS Regulation must be reviewedby July 2020 by the Commission (Article 49  of the eIDAS Regulation), ENISA couldbring insights on what the review of the eIDAS  Regulation should include in the electronic identification area. Towards this end, this report  could form the baseline for ENISA’s feedback, as ENISA continues to delve into this topic in the  first semester of 2020. The Commission haspublished the eIDAS review roadmap59 stating that  reports and studies prepared by ENISA will be fully included in the initial step of the evaluation  process.  59 Retrieved from https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/initiatives/ares-2019-6019401_en  PUBLISH AN ANNUAL REPORT ON SECURITY INCIDENTS FOR eID  ENISA could publish an annual report aggregating all security incidents which impacted  notified electronic identification schemes, alongside with an overview of the threat landscape  for eID underlying technologies.  PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO MS COMPETENT AUTHORITIES  ENISA could publish guidelines and recommendations to ensure a consistent understanding  of the requirements of the CIR 2015/1502 of the eIDAS Regulation. These guidelines could  include use cases by levels of assurance to further detail their definition, as well as  recommendations regarding compliance of specific technologies and solutions.  BRING INSIGHTS TO THE eIDAS REVIEW  ENISA will be involved in the eIDAS review process which is  due in July 2020. As such, it  should bring its technical expertise and insights to define how the Regulation is fit for purpose  and identify areas for improvement related to electronic identification.  https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/initiatives/ares-2019-6019401_en  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  37  A ANNEX: OVERVIEW OF  OTHER EID SCHEMES  This section offers an overview of other relevant eID schemes,that are not pre-notified or  notified at the time of writing this report. It is worth to notice that all the considerations and  analysis of the eID schemes made in this report are based on publicly available information.  A.1 SMART-ID  Smart-ID is an eID solution currently in use in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. It is based on a  smartphone mobile application. From an end-user perspective, the user experience is quite  similar to a push authentication mobile application. When trying to access a service or confirm a  transaction, the user receives a notification on the enrolled application and can perform the  authentication by typing a PIN code. The user has two separate PIN codes, one for  authentication purposes and one for digital signature purposes. From a design standpoint, the  solution offers an interesting perspective. In order not to rely only on the user device (i.e. the  mobile phone with the application), or server signing services (i.e. remote HSM for server  signing, which raises questions on the initial authentication of the user), the solution provides an  alternative by sharing the risks and responsibilities between these two components. The private  keys used for authentication and signature are generated in a shared manner, following  threshold-signature scheme protocol principles. By doing so, each secret sharing of the key  (one stored in an encrypted format in the application with the PIN and the other stored on the  HSM) is used to produce a signature without the need to combine the private keys in a single  location. The signature shares are then combined on the server-side to create the final  composite signature.  Regarding the enrolment, the solution can be activated while deriving the digital identity of the  Estonian eID or Mobiil-ID (for Estonian users).  From a signature perspective, this approach is inspired by the protection profile60 EN 419 241 –  2 Trustworthy Systems Supporting Server Signing Part 2: Protection Profiles for QSCD for  Server Signing but differs in the use of the threshold signature scheme protocol as it does not  use the classic server signature solutions. The server part of the Smart-ID solution (the secure-  zone on the server-side connected to the HSM through a secure channel) has been certified  against Common Criteria for EAL 4+ augmented with AVA_VAN.5 and constitutes a QSCD.  In addition to these principles, Smart-ID also includes interesting security measures:   Verification codes are generated to bind the context of the session on the relying party with  the authentication session on the mobile application (also used, for instance, within the  Estonian Mobiil-ID). Such features are always useful to avoid approval from the user  without being fully aware of the transaction context.   There are clone detection mechanisms to detect duplication of the Smart-ID application  with a parallel use. For this purpose, one-time material is generated by the Smart-ID  server and is expected to be provided by the mobile application for the next interaction.  60 Retrieved from BankID A Protection Profile (PP) is a document used as part of the certification process according to  ISO/IEC 15408 and the Common Criteria (CC). As the generic form of a Security Target (ST), it is typically created by a  user or user community and provides an implementation independent specification of information assurance security  requirements. A PP is a combination of threats, security objectives, assumptions, security functional requirements (SFRs),  security assurance requirements (SARs) and rationales.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Criteria https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Target https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_assurance  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  38  A.2 BANKID IN SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES  Both Sweden and Norway have an electronic identification scheme where banks act as identity  providers to access public administration websites and private sector websites in these  countries. Both schemes are called BankID but are based on different technologies.  A.2.1 Swedish eID  The Swedish eID system relies on eIDs that have been issued by the private sector since 1999.  The main solution is BankID and is in operation since 2003. This eID scheme is based on a  network of 11 banks and has the same value and functionalities, regardless of which bank has  issued it. It can be used for login and identification as well as to perform digital signatures.  Every individual who has a Swedish social security number can obtain BankID e-credentials  through their bank. In 2019, BankID is estimated to have been used on almost 4 billion  occasions61.  BankID is available in 3 forms: a physical smart card (BankID on a card), an application on a  smartphone or tablet (mobile BankID) and a computer software (BankID in a file). Service  providers can choose to accept one or all forms for different services.Identity providers also  select which forms of eID they offer62. By the end of 2019, it is estimated that 8 million of  Sweden’s inhabitants will own a BankID, of which approximately 7.5 million will have a mobile  BankID63.  BankID credentials are ordered via an Internet bank. The process differs between banks: some  require a face-to-face meeting at a bank office with an approved Swedish ID document, while  others require users to only login in the Internet bank and order a BankID online.  Authentication with mobile BankID either requires the user to enter an identification number and  a password or to scan a QR code on the service provider website with the mobile application.  Mobile BankID works only on the initial mobile phone that  it was installed on: if a user changes  his/her mobile phone and tries to restore it from an old laptop, the mobile BankID will not work  and new credentials must be sought from the bank.  A.2.2 Norwegian eId  Mobile BankID was launched in 2009 as a joint initiative between DNB Bank, a leading  Norwegian bank, and Telenor, the country’s largest mobile operator. Mobile BankID is an  electronic identification scheme, supporting authentication and digital signature across online  services through the users’ mobile phones. Today, all five of Norway’s mobile operators offer  Mobile BankID to their customers, leading to a full market coverage. BankID in Norway has a  total of 4 million subscribers64. Mobile BankID uses PKI technology and stores bank-generated  certificates on the SIM card. A PIN code is used for authentication and validation purposes.  61 Retrieved from BankID website: https://www.bankid.com/om-bankid/detta-ar-bankid  62 Retrieved from BankID website: https://www.bankid.com/kontakt/utfaerdare  63 Retrieved from BankID website: https://www.bankid.com/assets/bankid/stats/2019/statistik-2019-08.pdf  64 Retrieved from the BankID website: https://www.bankid.no/en/company/  https://www.bankid.com/om-bankid/detta-ar-bankid https://www.bankid.com/kontakt/utfaerdare https://www.bankid.com/assets/bankid/stats/2019/statistik-2019-08.pdf https://www.bankid.no/en/company/  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  39  B ANNEX:  TECHNOLOGICAL LANDSCAPE  OF EID SOLUTIONS  The following technological landscape of eID solutions is built by regrouping in clusters the  underlying technologies used in all eID solutions including both notified or not eID schemes.  Four broad technological clusters are detailed in the following subsections:   Cards and other hardware authenticators (incl. contact and contactless smart cards)   Mobile-based solutions (incl. OTP, cryptographic SIM and Mobile Connect)   Biometrics (incl. fingerprints and face recognition)   Prospective technologies (such as self-sovereign identity and analytics).  B.1 CARDS AND OTHER HARDWARE AUTHENTICATORS  B.1.1 Physical identity document and visible digital seals  A physical identity document is any document which may be used to prove a person’s identity  without an electronic component. They can, for example, be ID cards made of plastic. They  display personal information such as name, address, date of birth and a photograph.  What are the potential use cases regarding eID in an eIDAS ecosystem?  Physical ID cards cannot be used as an electronic identification means since they don’t offer  useful electronic features. However, since they usually contain a picture of the cardholder, they  can be used during the identity proofing process during a face-to-face verification The unique  identification number located on every card can also be used during an identity claim validation  by an appropriate authority.Most eID schemes use these documents in face-to-face identity  proofing if such enrolment processes are used. They can also be used in remote enrolment  processes where identity documents are photographed, recorded or shown during a videocall  by the users performing the enrolment. However, most physical security features are designed  for verification in a face-to-face scenario and are not suitable for duplication by photography or  video recording.  To further improve the security of identifying attributes retrieval, visible digital seals on physical  documents can be used. Visible digital seals are cryptographically signed data structures  containing document features, encoded as a 2D bar code and printed on a document. This 2D  bar code includes the signed biographic data located on the card. The signature is performed by  document issuers (usually issuing state), using the private keys corresponding to the bar code  signer certificates. The integrity of the data contained in such 2D bar codes is thus ensured, as  detection of the forged digital visible seal would be easy (not signed by the issuing state CA for  instance). It is also a way to check that the data stored in the digital visible seal and on the card  match, helping the identification of counterfeit cards. It is worth noting that these bar codes are  easily decoded by off-the-shelf smartphones or scanners as long as publicly available  algorithms are used to create the seal.  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  40  These digital visible seals do not replace the security features of microchips, do not enable  dynamic authentication and do not protect against duplication. However, they strengthen the  security of the retrieval of information during an enrolment phase.  What are the applicable standards that are related to this technology?  To automate the data capture and to reduce human errors, bar codes (example of an algorithm  for 2D code: PDF417, BSI TR-03137, ANTS 2D-DOC, etc.) located on physical cards can be  used. The use of these bar codes is not harmonised, as the ISO/IEC 781065 standard only  specifies physical characteristics for identification cards (dimensions, resistance to bending,  toxicity, etc.).  Regarding visible digital seals, the ICAO has published a technical report called Visible Digital  Seals for Non-Electronic Documents66 describing these seals, including the container format of  a digital seal, how it should be encoded, and the use-case of digital seals applied to travel  documents. This report states the added value of these visible digital seals for breeder  documents67 and temporary visas while specifying that travel documents should, whenever  possible, employ microchips.  In this ICAO report, the 2D bar codes that can be used as the printed representation of visible  digital seals are the ones specified as an ISO standard, including DataMatrix (ISO/IEC 16022),  Aztec Codes (ISO/IEC 24778), and QR Codes (ISO/IEC 18004). ISO/IEC 15415 is also referred  to regarding the print quality of these bar codes.  These visible digital seals or secured bar codes have been further developed at national level.  For instance, Germany’s cyber security authority, BSI, has published technical guidelines68 on  the topic, and France has developed a framework called 2D-Doc69 based on this principle to  ensure the integrity of public documents. These two documents were the basis of the ICAO  report.  What are the network and information security considerations regarding this technology?  While network and information security considerations do not apply to physical cards, it is  essential to recall that the security level of these cards is closely related to the printed security of  the cards.  The operators verifying those cards in face-to-face processes must be trained and equipped to  recognise and verify the printed secure elements to make sure the cards are not forged.  Identity documents printed without a cryptographic element remain more prone to falsification and  counterfeiting, and the guarantee they can provide during an identity proofing process remains  very limited. The usage of a visible digital seal enhances the security of this process.  B.1.2 Contact Smart Cards  A smart card is a device including an embedded integrated circuit chip (ICC). A contact smart  card needs to be inserted in a card reader to operate the transmission of commands and data.  65 https://www.iso.org/standard/31432.html  66 https://www.icao.int/Security/FAL/TRIP/Documents/TR%20-%20Visible%20Digital%20Seals%20for%20Non- Electronic%20Documents%20V1.7.pdf  67 Documents that can serve as a basis to obtain other identification documents, i.e. a birth certificate that is used to obtain  a passport.  68 BSI TR-03137 Optically Verifiable Cryptographic Protection of non-electronic Documents (Digital Seal), see  https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Publications/TechnicalGuidelines/TR03137/BSITR03137.html  69 https://ants.gouv.fr/Les-solutions/2D-Doc (in French)  https://www.iso.org/standard/31432.html https://www.icao.int/Security/FAL/TRIP/Documents/TR%20-%20Visible%20Digital%20Seals%20for%20Non-Electronic%20Documents%20V1.7.pdf https://www.icao.int/Security/FAL/TRIP/Documents/TR%20-%20Visible%20Digital%20Seals%20for%20Non-Electronic%20Documents%20V1.7.pdf https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Publications/TechnicalGuidelines/TR03137/BSITR03137.html https://ants.gouv.fr/Les-solutions/2D-Doc  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  41  These smart cards usually carry cryptographic functions such as key generation (including  random number generation), encryption and signature.  What are the potential use cases regarding eID in an eIDAS ecosystem?  Contact smart cards can be used for both identity proofing and electronic identification means.  Depending on the use case, the maturity level of the ecosystem and used endpoints, using a  contact smart card can be more or less appropriate for those two purposes.   In countries where citizens possess an electronic national identity card including a  microchip, many public services (healthcare, voting, etc.) and private services (electronic  banking, signing contracts, etc.) can allow the use of these microchips as electronic  identification means for citizens. In a mature ecosystem where every citizen has a contact  smart card reader, they can use their electronic national identity card to access those  electronic services.  In Europe, most countries provide their citizens with electronic identity cards and allow  citizens to access e-gov services with digital identities based on these identity cards (see  also section 1.3 for an overview of eID solutions).   In an ecosystem where the use of a microchip as an electronic identification means is not  widely supported, or where electronic services are used from endpoints for which using a  microchip is difficult, not user friendly or not possible (absence of card readers, from  mobile devices, etc.), eID cards can be used to strengthen a remote initial identity proofing  during a registration process with an identity provider. For example, Estonian and  Lithuanian ID cards can be used as identity proofing documents by reading the microchip  to enrol the Smart-ID solution, a third-party electronic identification means based on a  mobile application (see also section Error! Reference source not found.)70. As another e  xample, the Belgian itsme eID solution can be activated after carrying out an identity  proofing based on the Belgian national eID card.  What are the applicable standards related to this technology?  The ISO/IEC 7816 standard defines contact smart cards. This standard specifies many aspects  such as the physical characteristics, dimension, and location of the contacts parts, electrical  interface and transmission protocol, personal verification through biometric methods (e.g. Match  on Card). For some specific use cases, additional standards can be required, such as EMV for  payment cards, or UICC for SIM cards.  In terms of technology, electronic certificates are commonly used on the chip to provide eID  features.  What are the network and information security considerations regarding this technology?  The microchip security level is usually evaluated against the Common Criteria framework with  an Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL), with potential augmented requirements. For instance,  smart cards are commonly assessed for EAL4 augmented with AVA_VAN.5 (Vulnerability  Assessment and Analysis) to ensure protection against attackers with high potential. The  Common Criteria framework benefits from mutual recognition agreements such as the SOG-IS  in Europe and the CCRA (Common Criteria Recognition Agreement).  In addition to the Common Criteria, some countries are also using national qualification  frameworks. For instance, it is the case in France with the ANSSI qualification process that  70 See also https://www.smart-id.com/help/faq/registering/how-to-register-a-smart-id-account-using-an-id-card  https://www.smart-id.com/help/faq/registering/how-to-register-a-smart-id-account-using-an-id-card  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  42  aims, in addition to the Common Criteria, to ensure the security level of the assessed product in  time (cryptographic review, yearly supervision report, periodic recertification).  Cryptographic modules are also commonly certified as QSCDs under the eIDAS Regulation, as  are most of the national eID cards used in Europe. Several protection profiles have been  defined and certified.  Because of its relevance for the smart cards industry, it is worth mentioning the Federal  Information Processing Standards (FIPS) developed by the American National Institute of  Standards and Technology (NIST), which are standards and guidelines for federal computer  systems, often used also by the private sector. The 140-2 Security Requirements for  Cryptographic Modules standard71 specifies the security requirements that must be satisfied by  a cryptographic module utilised within a security system protecting sensitive but unclassified  information. The standard provides four increasing, qualitative levels of security. The  requirements to satisfy a level of security are partially based on the Common Criteria  framework: level four, for instance, relies on the EAL4 (or higher).  B.1.3 Contactless Smart Cards  A contactless smart card is also a smart card with an embedded microchip like the contact  smart card described above. However, it also embeds an antenna and only requires close  proximity to a card reader. They communicate using radio frequency (RF), and this  electromagnetic signal derives power for the internal chip.  What are the potential use cases regarding eID in an eIDAS ecosystem?  Just as contact smart cards, contactless smart cards can be used for both identity proofing and  as an electronic identification means. They offer an advantage over contact smart cards  regarding compatible devices due to the ability of many smartphones to read contactless smart  cards. Those cards are used, for example in Alicem, a French eID solution, where contactless  passports (or residence permit for foreigners) are used during identity proofing along with facial  recognition mechanism via a smartphone as a card reader. These cards can also be used as  electronic identification means, which is also the case in Alicem, where contactless passports  can be used during electronic identification via the mobile application.  Electronic travel documents standardisation thanks to the ICAO document about Machine  Readable Travel Documents (Doc 9303 ICAO72) has made the reading of identity information  and the photo highly standardised and easily to be included in eID applications on mobile  phones. It thus strengthens the security of the process to derive an identity from an identity  document.  These usages can be developed as more and more smartphones are NFC compatible. Android  phones have long been known to have NFC capabilities as NFC became available on some  Android devices in 2012. Today, all the top ten manufacturers sell NFC phones73. With iOS 13,  iPhones can now read NFC tags, and mobile applications are coming to the App Store in order  to read electronic identity documents74. Since 2018, there is an Android mobile application from  the UK Home Office to facilitate applications for residency in the UK after it leaves the EU, by  quickly and securely confirming identities75. In October 2019, the UK Government has  introduced an iOS version of this app76. The German eID can also be used efficiently on  Android and iOS devices without any additional deviced required.  71 https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf  72 https://www.icao.int/publications/pages/publication.aspx?docnum=9303  73 https://learn.seritag.com/nfc-enabled-phones  74 https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/12/nfc-gets-a-lot-more-powerful-in-ios-13/  75 https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.gov.HomeOffice.ho1&hl=en_GB  76 https://www.nfcw.com/2019/10/21/364763/uk-government-includes-iphone-nfc-passport-reading-in-ios-brexit-app/  https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf https://www.icao.int/publications/pages/publication.aspx?docnum=9303 https://learn.seritag.com/nfc-enabled-phones https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/12/nfc-gets-a-lot-more-powerful-in-ios-13/ https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.gov.HomeOffice.ho1&hl=en_GB https://www.nfcw.com/2019/10/21/364763/uk-government-includes-iphone-nfc-passport-reading-in-ios-brexit-app/  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  43  What are the applicable standards related to this technology?  The ISO/IEC 14443 standard defines contactless smart cards. This standard specifies many  aspects such as physical characteristics, radio frequency power and signal interface,  transmission protocol.  These identity documents are generally compliant with ICAO’s Doc 9303. The document is  divided into 12 parts. For instance, part 10 of the document defines the logical data structure for  data storage in the contactless integrated circuit, and part 11 defines the security mechanisms  for machine-readable travel documents (MRTDs).  What are the network and information security considerations regarding this technology?  Considering the microchip itself, the same considerations as for contact smart card defined in  section B.1.2 apply (the ISO standard, the Common Criteria framework, etc.).  It is worth noting that an ICAO compliant chip (for electronic MRTD) itself only provides one  authentication factor, as the ICAO applet does not manage PIN. If used as part of an electronic  identification means, they need to be associated with another authentication factor.  Contactless smart cards are mainly vulnerable to non-authorised readings by a close reader  (less than 10 centimetres) when no countermeasures are deployed (access control, random  UID), allowing the tracking of identity information and people’s movements. ICAO compliant  chips require at least to use the barcode to access the identity information (non-sensitive) with  protocols such as PACE. Sensitive information such as biometric template (fingerprint) are  protected using Extended Access Control that requires mutual authentication with the inspection  system accessing the information. These protocols are described in the Doc 9303 and aim at  local reading. For remote reading, there exist references to the extension of the protocols in  BSI/ANSSI TR-03110.  B.1.4 FIDO Authenticator  The FIDO Alliance is an open industry association that develops open standards for  authentication intending to replace passwords to promote more secure and convenient  authentication. The association members include authentication specialists, industry  companies, GAFAM (except Apple) or payment companies.  FIDO authentication standards are based on public-key cryptography. The main principle  behind the protocol is the use of a key pair associated with each FIDO compliant relying party  that the user wants to access. The relying party stores the public key along with a credential ID  to identify its owner. The authentication process is performed through the signature of a  challenge by the private key, ensuring the possession of this private key.  Several authentication factors (or form factors) are supported to unlock access to the private  key during the authentication process such as biometrics (e.g. embedded on a smartphone), a  USB second factor, and a contactless authenticator. Moreover, the way private keys are  created, managed and stored depend on the implementation chosen by each factor’s vendor.  Indeed, FIDO does not specify exactly how to perform these operations, but rather gives a set  of security requirements to comply with, which do not currently align with eIDAS requirements77.  77 https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-security-requirements-v1.0-fd-20170524/fido-authenticator-security- requirements_20170524.html  https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-security-requirements-v1.0-fd-20170524/fido-authenticator-security-requirements_20170524.html https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-security-requirements-v1.0-fd-20170524/fido-authenticator-security-requirements_20170524.html  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  44  What are the potential use cases regarding eID in an eIDAS ecosystem?  FIDO is an industry authentication standard that benefits from a broad coverage by all major  browsers (Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox) and Operating Systems (Android, Windows).  Being an authentication standard, a FIDO authenticator in itself does not manage identity but  only authenticates a registered user. An Identity Verification and Binding Working Group78  (IDWG) has been created within the FIDO Alliance and is working on improving identity proofing  mechanisms, based for example on biometrics or government-issued identity documents  remote verification. The compliance to eIDAS requirements appears not to be at stake for now.  It could be therefore interesting to study the outputs of this working group, even to discuss with  the working group, and check proposed identity proofing mechanisms against eIDAS Regulation  or way to bind FIDO authenticator with identity data for instance.  Figure 5: Browser and operating system coverage of FIDO ecosystem (Source  FIDOalliance.org)  What are the applicable standards related to this technology?  Historically, the FIDO Alliance has developed two authentication standards:   FIDO UAF (Universal Authentication Factor): the FIDO UAF protocol was designed to  provide a “passwordless” experience while authenticating on online services. It requires  the use of a device supporting FIDO UAF stack (FIDO client and FIDO authenticator on  the device, mainly a smartphone). Depending on the FIDO compliant authenticators  supported on the device, several form factors for authentication can be used such as  fingerprint biometrics, facial recognition, voice recognition and the use of a PIN.  Authentication unlocks access to the private key used for signing. Confirmation is then  transmitted to the FIDO server-side that checks the validity of transmitted information.   FIDO U2F (Universal 2nd Factor): The FIDO U2F protocol was designed for strong  authentication to provide a second factor with a FIDO U2F device that can be used  through USB (insert and press a button on the USB device) or NFC or BLE (Bluetooth Low  Energy) (tapping the NFC or BLE device). It should be used in conjunction with a  username/password as a second factor to provide strong authentication. The FIDO U2F  device implements the same concept, generating a key pair which is relying party specific  78 https://fidoalliance.org/identity-verification-binding/  https://fidoalliance.org/identity-verification-binding/  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  45  and that is used for signature during the authentication process. The FIDO U2F protocol is  now relabelled as CTAP1 as part of FIDO2.  In order to rationalise the standards used, the FIDO Alliance is now promoting FIDO 2 which is  comprised of:   Client To Authenticator Protocol CTAP 1 (the new label of U2F) and CTAP2 (extension of  U2F to include mobile devices as external authentication factors). These protocols  manage the interaction between a FIDO authenticator and a FIDO client (browser, native  application).   WebAuthn (Web Authentication) is a web-based API that allows websites to support FIDO-  based authentication on supported browsers and platforms. It has been developed with the  World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and was officially recognized as a W3C web standard  in March 2019.  What are the network and information security considerations regarding this technology?  Being based on asymmetric cryptography, with keys stored on software or hardware key stores,  security considerations are related to considerations that could apply for mobile based solution  with SE or smartcards, such as:   Cryptographic mechanisms and algorithm used   Protection of the authenticator against tampering, duplication, attack to steal the  private keys stored, etc   Certification of the authenticator if any to ensure resistance against a given attack  potential.  It is worth noting that the German BSI has released a protection profile for a FIDO U2F based  authenticator: FIDO Universal Second Factor (U2F) Authenticator BSI-PP-CC-0096-201779. The  target of evaluation described in this protection profile can be on a contactless of a contact  secure chip. It has been evaluated for EAL4 augmented with AVA_VAN.5 to ensure resistance  against high potential attacks. Further security concerns consider the use of embedded  biometric sensors and futher details can be found in Section 2.2.3.3.  B.2 MOBILE-BASED eID SOLUTIONS  Mobile technologies related to identity consist of phone and tablet-based hardware and software  solutions used to register, authenticate, and verify an individual’s identity.  B.2.1 SMS and email OTP  One-time password (OTP) is a single factor of authentication, commonly used for a single  authentication in addition to a static password or PIN to implement two-factor authentication  with a possession-based factor (something a person has, such as a specific phone number) and  a knowledge-based factor (something a person knows, such as the PIN). For the user to  authenticate, a single-use password is generated centrally and sent to the registered phone  number through SMS or to the registered email address through email.  What are the potential use cases regarding eID in an eIDAS ecosystem?  OTP SMS or email can be used in the enrolment process to prove the user performing the  enrolment process indeed possesses the phone number or email address. Such validated  contact information can then be used later for authentication purposes. Still, during an eID  79 More information on: https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/ppfiles/pp0096b_pdf.pdf  https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/ppfiles/pp0096b_pdf.pdf  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  46  enrolment process, it is also commonly used to send activation codes (for instance to activate a  card issued after a face-to-face identity proofing).  SMS or email OTP is also used during authentication. When used as a second factor, it  provides a layer of security on top of static user-created passwords which can be weak and/or  reused across multiple accounts.  Examples of SMS OTP use as part of eID schemes are numerous across Europe. For instance,  it is currently used in Spain through the Permanent Cl@ve80 identification scheme where an  OTP is sent by SMS to the mobile phone to access electronic administration services that  require a high level of security. A similar authentication flow is used by Norway’s MinID81  identification means to access more than 1,000 different services from government agencies.  This identification scheme gives access to online public services at a “medium-high level of  security”82 (level 3 out of 4 on the Norwegian ID-porten scale). Numerous other examples of the  usage of SMS OTP can be found for various usages (social network, banking, etc.).  What are the applicable standards related to this technology?  There is no standard per se describing the use of OTP SMS or email. OTP SMS is delivered to  mobile phones through the global SS7 (Signaling System 7) network of mobile operators, and  OTP email is delivered through the Internet (refer to section 2.2.3.1 for additional standards and  security considerations regarding OTP SMS and email).  What are the network and information security considerations regarding this technology?  Email OTP is problematic regarding the risks linked to a mail account takeover by an attacker.  Indeed, a mailbox is attractive to an attacker, and a successful phishing attack can’t be  overlooked. Therefore, this technology is not massively used anymore in eID schemes and  should not be promoted.  Regarding OTP transmitting via SMS, this technology can be considered too reliant on the  network’s operator processes. Recent examples of SIM swapping (incl. Twitter’s CEO on 31st  August 201983) show the danger of having a mobile number both as identifier and  authenticator84.  Moreover, the SS7 protocol used by telecommunications companies to coordinate how texts  and calls are rooted has a long-known security flaw allowing malefactors to send commands  and route text messages as they wish. It has already happened in 2017 and 2019 when bank  customers from Germany85 and the UK86 were victims of fraudulent transfers that exploited this  SS7 vulnerability. Mobile operators could implement additional security measures, but according  to ENISA’s report of March 2018 (“Signalling Security in Telecom SS7/Diameter/5G - EU level  assessment of the current situation”) security measures are already in place:   In general, most of the operators have implemented basic security measures  especially for SS7,   Most operators (87%) implement SMS home routing, to protect their networks against  from leaking sensitive information associated with a subscriber, which would help to  mount further attacks.  80 https://clave.gob.es/clave_Home/en/Clave-Permanente.html  81 http://eid.difi.no/en/minid  82 http://eid.difi.no/en/security-and-cookies/information-about-levels-security  83 https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/31/20841448/jack-dorsey-twitter-hacked-account-sim-swapping  84 https://www.wired.com/story/phone-numbers-indentification-authentication/  85 https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/ss7-attack-intercepts-sms/16877/  86 https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/ss7-hacked/25529/  https://clave.gob.es/clave_Home/en/Clave-Permanente.html http://eid.difi.no/en/minid http://eid.difi.no/en/security-and-cookies/information-about-levels-security https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/31/20841448/jack-dorsey-twitter-hacked-account-sim-swapping https://www.wired.com/story/phone-numbers-indentification-authentication/ https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/ss7-attack-intercepts-sms/16877/ https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/ss7-hacked/25529/  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  47   More than 84% of our respondents are applying different analysis techniques for SS7  interconnect traffic in order to detect abnormal activities.   More than 80% of the respondents monitor for abnormal SMS activities.  Also, the PSD2 Regulation requests strong authentication to perform online payments over  Internet and to access a bank account. The combination of the card details printed on the card  and SMS OTP, very popular to validate online payments, would not be compliant anymore for  strong customer authentication under this directive87. This directive might then indirectly reduce  the usage of the combination of the card details printed on the card with SMS OTP. However,  as stated in the EBA Opinion88 on the implementation of the RTS (paragraph 35), a device  could be used as evidence of possession, provided that there is a ‘reliable means to confirm  possession through the generation or receipt of a dynamic validation element on the device’.  Evidence could, in this context, be provided through the generation of a one-time password  (OTP), whether generated by a piece of software or by hardware, such as a token, text  message (SMS) or push notification. In the case of an SMS, and as highlighted in Q&A 4039,  the possession element ‘would not be the SMS itself, but rather, typically, the SIM-card  associated with the respective mobile number’. (paragraph 25). So, the PSD2 Regulation does  not preclude the usage of SMS OTP in addition to a static password or PIN to implement two-  factor authentication89..  In summary, OTP sent via SMS remain interesting as it is a very known and straightforward way  to perform 2FA at large scale. However, long-known multiple weaknesses should be addressed,  although these weaknesses only benefit an attacker targeting a specific user.  B.2.2 Soft OTP  Another implementation of one-time passwords uses mobile applications or hardware security  tokens. In both cases, they are generated using Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC)  and a moving factor - such as event counter (HOTP) - or time-based information (TOTP). In  two-factor authentication scenarios, a user must enter a traditional, static password as well as a  time-based one-time password to gain access to a digital service. Typically, a time-based  temporary passcode expires after 30, 60 or 120 seconds.  Historically, hardware security tokens (e.g. an RSA token) were used, but the focus here is on  one-time passwords generated by mobile applications (e.g. Google Authenticator).  One-time passwords can also be challenge-based, where the resource being accessed  provides a challenge needed to generate the OTP. The challenge can be meaningless or  related to the transaction. To increase the security of the process, a PIN on the smartphone or  the hardware token can be required to trigger the generation of the OTP. In this case, the  process provides two authentication factors from different nature: knowledge of the PIN and  possession of the smartphone with the enrolled application.  What are the potential use cases regarding eID in an eIDAS ecosystem?  Event-based OTP, time-based OTP and challenge-based OTP can all be used as a second  factor in an electronic identification process, or as a comprehensive authentication solution if a  PIN is required to trigger the OTP generation. For instance, SPID, the Italian notified eID  87 See European Banking Authority opinion, accessible here https://eba.europa.eu/eba-publishes-an-opinion-on-the- elements-of-strong-customer-authentication-under-psd2 and UK’s local decision  https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/34047/fca-delays-introduction-of-strong-consumer-authentication-rules  88 \"Opinion of the European Banking Authority on the elements of strong customer authentication under PSD2.\" - from 21  June 2019, https://eba.europa.eu/documents/10180/2622242/EBA+Opinion+on+SCA+elements+under+PSD2+.pdf  89 There are commercial PSD2-compliant offers based on SMS OTP, like for example https://www.twilio.com/blog/how- twilio-can-help-strong-customer-authentication-psd2.  https://eba.europa.eu/eba-publishes-an-opinion-on-the-elements-of-strong-customer-authentication-under-psd2 https://eba.europa.eu/eba-publishes-an-opinion-on-the-elements-of-strong-customer-authentication-under-psd2 https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/34047/fca-delays-introduction-of-strong-consumer-authentication-rules  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  48  scheme, offers such processes, including mobile OTP on a smartphone application and  hardware OTP generators, depending on the identity provider.  What are the applicable standards related to this technology?  OTP generation methods are described in several RFC:   RFC 4226 – HOTP: An HMAC-Based One-Time Password Algorithm90   RFC 6238 – TOTP: Time-Based One-Time Password Algorithm91   RFC 6287 – OCRA: OATH Challenge-Response Algorithm92.  What are the network and information security considerations regarding this technology?  If the device is stolen, the PIN code may be known by the attacker as well, and in this case, the  security value of this soft OTP is nullified. If this soft OTP is combined only with biometrics without  a PIN code, this weakness is nullified, but this is rarely the case as many countries require  alternative authentication solutions to biometric ones.  As the one-time code generally is generally entered on the login page of the accessed service,  there also is a risk of interception with fake login pages (phishing) that could allow an attacker to  reuse the intercepted code during its validity window. This attack type could be executed by using  challenge-based OTP generation mechanisms.  However, the solution, even with a challenge-based approach could remain vulnerable to targeted  social engineering, as there is also a lack of information regarding the context of the transaction  that requires the generation of an OTP.  Finally, the Soft OTP token is also vulnerable to any malware that extracts or duplicates the  underlying key in the device. The security of the environment storing secrets is fundamental for  the overall resistance against attackers (software or hardware key store. Also, the use of  embedded biometrics sensors for such applications raises security concerns.  B.2.3 Mobile authentication with push notification  Specific mobile applications can be used to enable authentication on online service for a citizen.  The implementation may vary depending on the provider. Sometimes, the mobile application  manages the authentication from end to end, and sometimes it calls cryptographic elements on  the smartphone and/or in a server-side HSM. The authentication and cryptographic processes  are often provided as an SDK from security providers and sometimes embedded in a  smartphone application offering more services. Banking institutions have been following this  model in order to provide a secure but seamless user experience to their customers.  This approach now supersedes the classical soft OTP approach by bringing a better user  experience with:   Push notifications to advise the user of a pending approval   Transparent and over the air transmission of the signed challenge to the server without  needing to copy the OTP on the page of the accessed services   Allowing to replace the PIN code in the app with biometrics leveraging sensors embedded  on the smartphones.  90 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226  91 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238  92 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6287  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6287  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  49  What are the potential use cases regarding eID in an eIDAS ecosystem?  Such applications are used as an electronic identification means when citizens need to  authenticate on an online service.  Smart-ID93 is an electronic identification app available on tablets and smartphones. It enables  authentication of users seeking to access online services. Users register their devices through  the app using their digital ID cards and digital certificates. Once the registration is complete,  they can use Smart-ID to authenticate themselves for various services and digitally sign  documents. In the Baltic countries, 2 million people are using Smart-ID. They perform 40 million  transactions a month with the application, used for entering e-services, confirming transactions  and digitally signing documents.  Other examples in Europe use a similar application, such as Mobile BankID94 in Sweden,  L’Identité Numérique La Poste95 in France and itsme96 in Belgium.  What are the applicable standards related to this technology?  Depending on the technology used in the mobile application, different standards can apply.  What are the network and information security considerations regarding this technology?  As this eID technology is based on mobile applications, the security of the mobile environment  storing secrets is key for the overall resistance against attackers (software or hardware key  store) (refer to section 2.2.3.2 for additional considerations). Also, the use of embedded  biometrics sensors for such applications raises security concerns (refer to section 2.2.3.3 for a  detailed description).  The application or devices that contribute to the authentication process could implement several  security measures to offer protection against duplication and tampering. Moreover, certification  against schemes such as Common Criteria could bring confidence on the assurance level of the  solution.  Finally, it is interesting to note that providing end-users with the context of the authentication  they are performing (e.g. access to a given website, approving a payment for a given amount,  etc.) offers additional protection against social engineering attacks. End-users are indeed more  aware of the operation they are approving and therefore can identify more easily operations  they have initiated.  B.2.4 Cryptographic SIM or smartphone secure element  As a hardware component in the form of a chip used in smartphones, SIM cards can be used to  store secrets and electronic certificates to be used during authentication processes. They can  also embed additional applets than the ones used by network operators, for instance to have a  PKI-based SIM that stores authentication and signature certificates (as for Estonian Mobiil-ID for  instance).  Besides SIM cards, modern smartphones now directly integrate in the device additional  components that could be used to store secrets, sensitive materials or perform operations in  trusted environment such as:  93 https://www.sk.ee/en/News/smart-id-now-has-2-million-users/  94 https://www.bankid.com/en/  95 https://lidentitenumerique.laposte.fr/  96 https://www.itsme.be/  https://www.sk.ee/en/News/smart-id-now-has-2-million-users/ https://www.bankid.com/en/ https://lidentitenumerique.laposte.fr/ https://www.itsme.be/  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  50   Embedded SIM (eSIM)   Integrated SIM (iSIM)   Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)   Secure Enclave (SE)   Secure Element (SE)  Embedded SIMs are typically physical SIMs soldered into the device, enabling storage and  remote management of multiple network operator profiles. Integrated SIMs offer further  optimisations while retaining SIM security: the SIM moves from a separate chip into a secure  enclave. It is worth noting that eSIMs and iSIMs are secure, dedicated physical circuits rather  than software-based SIMs.  A hardware security module, a smart card, a trusted execution environment, a secure enclave  and a secure element are all computing environments designed for secure execution and the  storing of cryptographic keys. Their properties in common include their isolation from unsecured  environments with a degree of tamper resistance, the impossibility to clone them as they hold  unique cryptographic keys and their limited set of interfaces to reduce the attack surface.  What differentiates them is their form factor, which directly impacts their isolation and their  resistance to attacks. The differences between Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), Secure  Enclaves (SE) and Secure Elements (SE) are described below:   A secure element is soldered to a board or part of a system-on-chip package. It is isolated  from other computing environments on the same board or package but may not be  resistant to physical tampering.   If the secure element is inside the same chip package as the main processor, it’s called a  secure enclave.   A trusted execution environment is a software environment which runs on the same  processor as a less-secure environment, sometimes called Rich-OS Execution  Environment (REE) on smartphones. It’s isolated by a piece of software relying on  hardware functionality (e.g. Arm TrustZone or Intel SGX).  GlobalPlatform97 is currently working on standardising both SEs and TEEs. The defined security  features for TEEs are98:   Isolation from the Rich OS – all trusted applications and their related data are separated  from the rich environment.   Isolation from other Trusted Applications (TAs) – TAs are isolated within the TEE, and  from the TEE itself.   Application management control – any modification of the TA and the TEE can only be  performed by the authenticated entity.   Identification and binding – where the boot process is bound to the System-on-Chip,  enforcing the authenticity and integrity of TEE firmware and TAs.   Trusted storage – TA and TEE data is stored securely to ensure integrity, confidentiality  and binding to the TEE (or anti-cloning).   Trusted access to peripherals – the TEE offers APIs accesses to trusted peripherals such  as the screen, biometric sensors and SEs, under the control of the TEE.   State of the art cryptography – random number generation, cryptography and monotonic  timestamps are key assets for value-added services.  97 https://globalplatform.org/  98 https://globalplatform.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Introduction-to-Trusted-Execution-Environment-15May2018.pdf  https://globalplatform.org/ https://globalplatform.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Introduction-to-Trusted-Execution-Environment-15May2018.pdf  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  51  Regarding smartphones, Android-based devices are equipped with TEE and iOS-based devices  are equipped with a Secure Enclave within the System-on-Chip. The iOS Secure Enclave is  also responsible for processing fingerprint and face data from the Touch ID and Face ID  sensors. The Apple Secure Enclave Processor (SEP) has a U.S. Federal Information  Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2 validation.  What are the potential use cases regarding eID in an eIDAS ecosystem?  Electronic identification schemes already use a PKI-enabled SIM card. In Estonia, Mobiil-ID99, a  PKI-enabled SIM card, received when requested to the mobile operator, can be used to access  secure e-services, digitally sign documents and facilitates the enrolment flow to the Smart-ID  application100. In Finland, a PKI SIM card, called Mobile eID, is also used for electronic  identification. Moldova followed Estonia’s example with a mobile e-ID called Me-ID101, existing  since 2011. It operates the same way as the Estonian Mobiil-ID.  What are the applicable standards related to this technology?  SIM cards are defined by the TS 102 221 – Smart cards; UICC-Terminal interface; Physical and  logical characteristics102 and the TS 131 102 – Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systems  (UMTS); LTE; Characteristics of the Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) application103  standards. As described above, GlobalPlatform is currently working on standardizing SEs and  TEEs.  What are the network and information security considerations regarding this technology?  This technology was used in several notified and pre-notified schemes (refer to section 2.2.3.2  for the security recommendations on this topic discussed during peer reviews).  B.2.5 Mobile Connect  Mobile Connect is a global open and common framework developed by the GSM Association  (GSMA) in cooperation with leading mobile operators. The standard is already supported by 60  mobile operators in 30 countries104.  The framework offers authentication, authorisation, identity and attributes sharing or verification  for service providers, although for now, only one operator offers services related to identity and  attribute sharing, all others being focused on authentication. Mobile Connect’s prerequisites are  that the mobile phone uses a compatible SIM card and that the mobile operator supports Mobile  Connect.  The authentication process can work using several authenticators:   A seamless check by the mobile operator that the mobile phone is connected to the  network   A verification link sent by the operator through SMS   A USSD session initiated by the operator allowing the users to verify themselves by typing  a PIN that is stored server-side by the operator   A SIM applet used to authenticate the user on his mobile phone, with an authentication  request triggered by the mobile operator. The verification then requires either only to  99 https://e-estonia.com/solutions/e-identity/mobile-id/  100 https://www.smart-id.com/help/faq/registering/can-use-mobile-id-register-smart-id-account  101 http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/600821469220400272/pdf/107201-WP-PUBLIC-WB-GSMA- SIADigitalIdentity-WEB.pdf, Annex Moldova  102 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_TS/102200_102299/102221/11.00.00_60/ts_102221v110000p.pdf  103 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/131100_131199/131102/13.05.00_60/ts_131102v130500p.pdf  104 Source: https://mobileconnect.io/  https://e-estonia.com/solutions/e-identity/mobile-id/ https://www.smart-id.com/help/faq/registering/can-use-mobile-id-register-smart-id-account http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/600821469220400272/pdf/107201-WP-PUBLIC-WB-GSMA-SIADigitalIdentity-WEB.pdf http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/600821469220400272/pdf/107201-WP-PUBLIC-WB-GSMA-SIADigitalIdentity-WEB.pdf https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_TS/102200_102299/102221/11.00.00_60/ts_102221v110000p.pdf https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/131100_131199/131102/13.05.00_60/ts_131102v130500p.pdf https://mobileconnect.io/  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  52  approve the authentication process or to require an additional PIN code, verified locally on  the SIM applet.  The last authentication mode is the most interesting offered by the Mobile Connect framework  as it offers additional security with the usage of the SIM applet on the SIM card, which is a  secure element. For this authenticator, a SIM toolkit session is initialised by the SIM card and  generates the information prompted to the user, either to confirm an authentication or to type a  PIN code chosen at the service activation. This process thus uses the SIM applet directly,  without relying on a native smartphone application.  In addition to the Mobile Connect API used for authentication, the GSMA has also developed a  Discovery API (API Exchange) that can be used by a service provider (or a third-party identity  provider) to discover the mobile operator of the user trying to authenticate with Mobile Connect.  Figure 6: Mobile Connect standard authentication process105  In the process described previously, it is worth noting that identity attributes are not stored on  the user’s SIM card, as it would require additional storage space on the SIM which has limited  capabilities. Mobile Connect offers identification based, for instance, on identity attributes  gathered by the mobile operator, potentially shared with the service provider for which the  authentication is performed. However, the way Mobile Connect is deployed and used today is  more focused on authentication. Either way, in order to link the user with a persistent unique  identifier for non-ambiguous authentication purposes, Mobile Connect manages a PCR  (Pseudonymous Customer Reference). The mobile operator generates this PCR during the first  successful authentication of a user with Mobile Connect. This PCR remains unchanged for the  combination of an end-user and the application or web service, even if the user switches  operators.  105 Retrieved from mobileconnect.io  file:///C:/Users/mitraan/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/HUI0D3S5/mobileconnect.io  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  53  Besides, Mobile Connect could also benefit from contextual information captured by mobile  operators in its network to help identify risky situations and provide a risk-based approach. The  contextual data could include the SIM’s location, roaming, recent changes and more. Finally, in  terms of standards, it is also worth noting that the API provided with Mobile Connect for  exchanges between the service providers and the mobile operators uses Open ID Connect.  Building a comprehensive eID solution with Mobile Connect indeed requires defining how  identity attributes are collected, how the initial identity proofing functions, and how identity  attributes are issued once the authentication is performed.  An example of a Mobile Connect integration in an eID scheme: Mobile Connect et Moi  Mobile Connect et Moi is a French identity provider that is part of FranceConnect (the French  state-operated identity federation service). Mobile Connect et Moi offers a mobile app, used for  the initial identity proofing and the collection of identity attributes. The whole process is remotely  performed and requires taking a photo of a valid identity document and performing a facial  recognition (with liveness detection) to verify the requester’s identity. After this process, the  Mobile Connect service is activated on the SIM card and the user can choose the associated  PIN code. Mobile Connect et Moi, as the identity provider, stores the identity attributes  previously collected.  During the electronic identification process, the user enters his mobile phone number and then  performs a Mobile Connect authentication with the SIM applet and the PIN code. The PIN  CODE is verified locally on the SIM card. After the authentication confirmation, Mobile Connect  et Moi shares the identity attributes to FranceConnect, using Open ID Connect, that verifies  them and sends them to the service provider.  Mobile Connect eIDAS pilot  GSMA with its Mobile Connect technology was involved in an eIDAS pilot initiative which started  in 2015 to demonstrate how Mobile Connect can be used to identify a citizen of one EU Member  State in order to gain access to a public service of another Member State. Other stakeholders  were involved, such as mobile operators, technology companies and government services. This  pilot demonstrated the ability to support eIDAS compliant cross-border authentication with eID  means based on Mobile Connect, including the identity provider Mobile Connect et Moi. The  pilot was designed using the eIDAS reference architecture based on eIDAS nodes, with a  proxy/connector approach, as developed by the European Commission and the Member States  technical sub-group of the eIDAS Expert Group (see section 2.1.1.2 Interoperability framework  for eID).  What are the applicable standards related to this technology?  As Mobile Connect is a framework developed by GSMA, there is no applicable standard related  to this technology other than the Mobile Connect standard itself.  What are the network and information security considerations regarding this technology?  During a Mobile Connect API authentication request, the application declares the degree of  confidence that is required in the returned asserted identity. The recommended Level of  Assurance depends on the risk associated with an erroneous authentication: the greater the  risk, the higher the Level of Assurance. These Level of Assurance are defined in the ISO/IEC  29115 Standard, described in section 2.1.2 Other international & third-country frameworks.  Mobile Connect supports Level of Assurance 2 and 3, i.e. some and high confidence in the  asserted identity. A Mobile Connect authentication for LoA2 means the user needs to prove he  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  54  is in possession of the device, playing the role of the credentials. A Mobile Connect  authentication for LoA3 means the user needs to enter a secret PIN or use biometric factors on  the enrolled mobile device.  B.3 BIOMETRICS  Biometric recognition uses an individual’s unique physiological and behavioural attributes to  identify and authenticate his or her identity. Physiological attributes include elements related to  the shape or composition of the body, such as fingerprint ridges, iris patterns, or facial  characteristics. Examples of behavioural attributes include gait, signature, keystroke patterns,  and mouse usage. The type of attribute collected and matched is called modality. For example,  fingerprint and iris are different biometric modalities.  A practical biometric modality should meet the specified recognition, accuracy, speed, and  resource requirements, be harmless to the users, be accepted by the intended population, and  be sufficiently robust to various fraudulent methods and attacks to the system.106  During an enrolment process, physiological and behavioural biometric characteristics are  acquired through adequate sensors extracting distinctive features in order to form a biometric  template. At the time of verification, the system processes another biometric input which is  compared against the stored template, yielding acceptance or rejection.107 Biometrics can also  be used in an identification mode where a system recognises an individual by searching the  templates of all the users in the database for a match.  Biometrics can be classified into two categories, primary and soft biometrics:   Primary biometrics are modalities such as fingerprint, face, and iris recognition. They yield  accurate results for identification (relatively low FARs and FRRs).   Soft biometrics relate to an individual’s behaviour and includes keystroke dynamics,  signature analysis, and gait analysis. They are rarely used for identification purposes as  error rates are high to identify a user. However, these modalities are currently more and  more used for continuous authentication to verify the identity of a user throughout a  session.  What are the applicable standards related to this technology, for all modalities?  Biometric information protection is defined in the ISO/IEC 24745:2011 – Information technology  – Security techniques – Biometric information protection standard. It guides the protection of  biometric information under various requirements for confidentiality, integrity and  renewability/revocability during storage and transfer. Additionally, it provides requirements and  guidelines for the secure and privacy-compliant management and processing of biometric  information. This standard is currently under review108.  Requirements of biometric information protection include (ISO/IEC 24745:2011):   Confidentiality: “to protect biometric references against access by an unauthorised  outsider resulting in a privacy risk, biometric references shall be kept confidential”.   Irreversibility: “to prevent the use of biometric data for any purpose than originally  intended, biometric data shall be processed by irreversible transformations before  storage”. It thus should be computationally hard to reconstruct the original biometric  template from the protected template, while it should be easy to generate it.  106 JAIN AK, ROSS A, PRABHAKAR S, An introduction to biometric recognition, 2004,  https://www.cse.msu.edu/~rossarun/pubs/RossBioIntro_CSVT2004.pdf  107 RATHGEB C and UHL A, A survey on biometric cryptosystems and cancellable biometrics, 2011  108 https://www.iso.org/standard/52946.html  https://www.cse.msu.edu/~rossarun/pubs/RossBioIntro_CSVT2004.pdf https://www.iso.org/standard/52946.html  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  55   Unlinkability: “the stored biometric references shall not be linkable across applications or  databases.” Accordingly, different versions of protected biometric templates can be  generated based on the same biometric data (renewability), while protected templates  should not allow cross-matching (diversity).  ISO/IEC 30107:2016 focuses on presentation attacks and their automated detection. A  presentation attack is a presentation to the biometric capture subsystem to interfere with the  operation of the biometric system.  What are the network and information security considerations regarding this technology,  for all modalities?  Biometrics, in general, have a crucial security consideration to keep in mind: they are uniquely  and permanently linked to the person. The direct consequence is that if biometric template data  is revealed in some way, from a data breach, for instance, or if it can be copied, then the  security of this technology is nullified. Unlike passwords that can easily be changed, getting a  new fingerprint or face is impossible.  Concepts such as cancellable biometrics and biometric cryptosystems109 were thus investigated  and developed:   In cancellable biometrics, complex mathematical functions are used to transform the  original template data of a scanned fingerprint or face. This transformation is non-  reversible, meaning it’s impossible to turn back the transformed template data being into  the original fingerprint or face scan. If the database holding the transformed template data  is breached, these transformed templates can be changed for new ones, as each  enrolment results in a new unique template, even if the same finger or face is used.   Biometrics cryptosystems combine the strengths of both cryptography and biometrics by  dynamically generating keys with the help of biometrics to secure the template and  biometric system.  B.3.1 Fingerprint Recognition  Fingerprint recognition is one of the most popular biometric techniques used in personal  identification. Each individual has unique fingerprints, the pattern of ridges and valleys on the  surface of a fingertip. There are three basic patterns of fingerprint ridges: the arch (a pattern  where the ridge enters one side of the finger), the loop (the ridge enters one side of the finger,  then forms a curve and exists on the same site of the finger from which it entered) and the whorl  (the ridges form circularly around a central point)110. Ridge ending (the point where a ridge ends  abruptly) and ridge bifurcation (the point where a ridge forks or diverges into branch ridges) are  collectively called minutiae111.  Depending on the business needs and on the level of assurance needed, the number of  fingerprints captured and matched for an individual can be from one to all ten fingers. Multiple  sensors can capture fingerprints:   Optical sensors capture an image, mostly a photograph, and use algorithms to detect  unique patterns by analysing the image’s lightest and darkest areas112.  109  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257879510_A_survey_on_biometric_cryptosystems_and_cancelable_biometrics  110 http://www.biometric-solutions.com/fingerprint-recognition.html  111 ZAERI Naser, Minutiae-based Fingerprint Extraction and Recognition DOI: 10.5772/17527, 2011. Retrieved from:  https://www.intechopen.com/books/biometrics/minutiae-based-fingerprint-extraction-and-recognition  112 https://www.androidauthority.com/how-fingerprint-scanners-work-670934/  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257879510_A_survey_on_biometric_cryptosystems_and_cancelable_biometrics http://www.biometric-solutions.com/fingerprint-recognition.html https://www.intechopen.com/books/biometrics/minutiae-based-fingerprint-extraction-and-recognition https://www.androidauthority.com/how-fingerprint-scanners-work-670934/  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  56   Capacitive sensors use electrical current to form an image of the fingerprint by tracking the  changes in the charge stored in the capacitor when a ridge is placed over the conductive  plates whereas it stays unchanged with an air gap.   Thermal sensors read the temperature differences on the contact surface between  fingerprint ridges and valleys.   Ultrasonic sensors send high-frequency sound waves to penetrate the skin and get  absorbed or bounced back based on the fingerprint pattern. They thus read the fingerprint  on the dermal skin layer, eliminating the need for a clean and free of scares surface.  What are the potential use cases regarding eID in an eIDAS ecosystem and the related  security considerations?  At first glance, it looks like fingerprint recognition could be used for identity proofing as well for  authentication.  Indeed, another eID scheme or identity document storing fingerprints could be used to validate  an identity enrolling to another eID. However, fingerprints are subject to enhanced security due  to their sensitivity: they are, for example, protected with Extended Access Control on electronic  travel documents. Their access is regulated and restricted, which makes it a priori impossible to  use them to enrol a new eID.  Smartphone-embedded biometrics directly operated by the mobile operation system (e.g. iOS  and Android) also seem like they could be used as an authentication means (to protect secrets  stored in a smartphone or to unlock sensitive application such as the ones described in section  B.2.3). However:   Multiple fingerprints can be stored in Touch ID or equivalent, and they can belong to more  than one person.   Even if a specific fingerprint was saved during the enrolment phase, there is no way to  associate it with a specific action and to force its use as an authentication factor linked to  an eID means. Embedded biometrics sensor works with all stored biometrics templates  regardless of under which circumstances they have been enrolled. Mitigation measures to  avoid such situations are advising the end-user (similarly to advising smartcard users not  to disclose their secret PIN) or deactivating this functionality if additional templates are  enroled.  It is thus assumed that the owner of the smartphone is the one enrolling the templates and is  responsible for it. Therefore, in case of eID means using such biometrics sensor as an  authentication factor, there is no assurance that the templates enrolled match actually the  identity of the user that has been issued the eID means.  Moreover, fingerprint recognition technology is not immune to circumvention, i.e. the system  being fooled using fraudulent methods. A study has recently shown that fingerprint recognition  is vulnerable to dictionary attacks based on MasterPrints (real or synthetic fingerprints that can  luckily match with a large number of fingerprints, constructed with a Generative Adversarial  Network113).  Besides, fingerprints raise privacy concerns as their collection is simple and transparent for the  end-users. Therefore, fingerprints could be collected without the person knowing it.  The combination of these security and privacy concerns result in fingerprint recognition being  more and more abandoned in favour of face recognition for electronic identification.  113 https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07386  https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07386  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  57  B.3.2 Face Recognition  Face recognition is the process of identifying or verifying the identity of a person using their  face. First, the face needs to be detected, then captured and finally matched.  To capture a face, 2D or 3D sensors can be used. The “face” is then transformed into digital  template by applying an algorithm before comparing the image captured to those held in a  database.  Face recognition uses features of the face such as the distance between the eyes, the width of  the nose, the depth of the eye sockets, the shape of the cheekbones and the length of the  jawline. These features do not change significantly over time114.  What are the potential use cases regarding eID in an eIDAS ecosystem?  Face recognition could be used in the enrolment phase as well as the authentication phase.  France, for instance, is currently developing Alicem eID scheme which use facial recognition  during the enrolment phase. This eID scheme is in test mode. Facial recognition is used during  enrolment to make sure that the applicant matches the photo stored on the ICAO chip of the  passport. If they match, the facial recognition will validate the identity and enrol the identity on  the smartphone application.  What are the network and information security considerations regarding this  technology?  Facial recognition brings up multiple security and privacy considerations (Refer to section  2.2.2.2 for additional security considerations regarding face recognition that have arisen during  the conducted peer reviews), including:   Algorithms are often proprietary and difficult to rate, so their selection is complicated. NIST  is for instance maintaining a program to assess facial recognition algorithm quality115   Morphing pictures (creating a photo ID containing a graphical representation of several  faces, which enables multiple individuals to share credentials) is a way to bypass facial  recognition if the picture source is not managed correctly (i.e. if there is no existing  relationship between the picture and the identity, for example, through a national  database)   According to the GDPR, a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous consent must  be granted to approve the usage of biometric features116. As it should be a freely given  consent, an alternative to facial recognition must be offered.  B.4 PROSPECTIVE TECHNOLOGIES  B.4.1 eID using Blockchain/Distributed Ledger Technology  The blockchain is a technical solution that leverages the notion of distributed ledgers technology  (DLT) that was popularised by the bitcoin phenomenon born in 2009. A distributed ledger is a  replicated set of data across multiple actors. In the case of bitcoin, only the transactions are  shared and replicated. Distributed ledgers were created to ensure trust between actors without  the need for a third-party trusted by all the stakeholders.  114 For adult. For Children, facial recognition may not be suitable.  115 See for instance: https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/frvt-11-verification  116 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural  persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, Article 9, https://eur- lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj  https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/frvt-11-verification https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  58  Blockchains are created around a few fundamental properties:   Distributed and shared: for records to be consigned, the main actors of the blockchain are  required to know and witness that data is being recorded. All parties are therefore required  to be online and participate in giving the consensus to publish new records;   Immutable: the blockchain records integrity is based on an uninterrupted chain since the  beginning of the blockchain. This chain ensures the immutability of data recorded but  requires establishing a consensus to add a new block to the chain consistently. As a  consequence, records cannot be modified, but new records can be added to the chain to  describe modifications to existing ones;   Ordered: as the records are chained, they are ordered one after the other, which can be  used for proof of anteriority.  Blockchain technology can be leveraged to implement the immutable property of Self-Sovereign  Identity approach and the need of a distributed system to support it. It also serves as a  container for the Verifiable Claims that goes along with the SSI. Those two evolutionary  tendencies are introduced in chapter 1.4.5.  What are the potential use cases regarding eID in an eIDAS ecosystem?  Blockchain-based eID solutions can be used as electronic identification means, once the  identity information is proofed using a third party eID solution. In this case, the trustworthiness of  the identity information or verifiable claim a user can share is inherited from the authority that  proofed that piece of information. It may appear inconsistent to rely on trusted third parties to  proof identities to be used in a decentralised system, but blockchain-based eID solutions offer a  standard cross-platform technology independent from the eID solutions that trusted third parties  could offer and manage.  Identity proofing for blockchain-based eID solutions can be performed when the identity  information is first inserted by the owner, or later when the user wants to verify it against a  certain level of assurance requested by a service provider. This identity proofing can be  achieved through two mechanisms under the eIDAS framework117:   Authentication with a notified eID scheme   Electronic signature using electronic certificates issued by trust service providers.  What are the applicable standards related to this technology?  Blockchain and distributed ledgers technologies are based on a set of technical specifications  including cryptography operations. Some initiatives are launched to work on standards related  to blockchain-based applications. For example, ETSI launched in 2018 a new Industry  Specification Group on Permissioned Distributed Ledger118. The IEEE has been actively  pursuing blockchain standardisation efforts through various activities in multiple industry  sectors119.  When it comes to eID solutions as a blockchain application, the main initiatives are:    The one related to the Self-Sovereign Identity approach using Decentralized Identifiers  (DIDs), which are “a new type of identifier for verifiable, decentralized digital identity.  117 https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/system/files/ged/eidas_supported_ssi_may_2019_0.pdf  118 https://www.etsi.org/newsroom/press-releases/1473-2018-12-press-etsi-launches-new-industry-specification-group-on- blockchain  119 https://blockchain.ieee.org/standards  https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/system/files/ged/eidas_supported_ssi_may_2019_0.pdf https://www.etsi.org/newsroom/press-releases/1473-2018-12-press-etsi-launches-new-industry-specification-group-on-blockchain https://www.etsi.org/newsroom/press-releases/1473-2018-12-press-etsi-launches-new-industry-specification-group-on-blockchain https://blockchain.ieee.org/standards  EIDAS COMPLIANT EID SOLUTIONS  March 2020  59  These new identifiers are designed to enable the controller of a DID to prove control over it  and to be implemented independently of any centralized registry, identity provider, or  certificate authority.” Data Model and Syntaxes used in Decentralized Identifiers are  specified by W3C120   The one related to the Verifiable Claims to “provides a mechanism to express these sorts  of credentials on the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and  machine-verifiable”121 specified by W3C as well.  What are the network and information security considerations regarding this  technology?  A first security consideration to keep in mind is related to the blockchain technology itself and its  vulnerability to what is called the “51% attack”, where an attacker controlling a majority of the  nodes can record incorrect data to the chain. In this case, the attacker focusses on corrupting  the nodes, which is less complicated than attacking the cryptography behind the blockchain  itself. The more the blockchain nodes network is vast, the more this attack is complex to carry  out because of the higher number of nodes to corrupt.  Another issue regarding this technology is related to one of its inherent properties, immutability:  once identity information is added to the blockchain, they cannot be removed. If today it is  assumed that cryptographic mechanisms used with the blockchain are secure enough for  current attacker’s capabilities, no one can know for sure when technology breakthroughs will be  made available to overcome those cryptographic mechanisms, especially with the rise of  Quantum Computing122. When that happens, personal data stored in the blockchain would be  made public. To mitigate this risk, personally identifiable information and biometric information  should never be stored on a blockchain123.  One last issue to consider is related to the decentralisation aspect of the blockchain: the  features usually delivered by centralised systems are now to be managed by the users  themselves. The most striking example of these features is the recovery of lost or forgotten  private keys: in the blockchain, recovery of these pieces of information is not available, and  users must find a way to do it outside the blockchain, for example by using centralised systems  to manage their private keys, which goes against one of the reasons to use blockchain as an  eID solution.  120 https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/  121 https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model  122 https://medium.com/fintech-kellogg/quantum-computing-is-it-the-end-of-the-blockchain-10fa7e222b0a  123 http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/199411519691370495/Technology-Landscape-for-Digital-Identification.pdf  https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/ https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model https://medium.com/fintech-kellogg/quantum-computing-is-it-the-end-of-the-blockchain-10fa7e222b0a http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/199411519691370495/Technology-Landscape-for-Digital-Identification.pdf  X X  -0 0  -0 0  -0 0  0 -X  X -X  ABOUT ENISA  The mission of the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) is to achieve a high  common level of cybersecurity across the Union, by actively supporting Member States,  Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies in improving cybersecurity.

    "abstract": "This report provides an overview of the legislative framework under eIDAS for electronic identification, presents the landscape of notified and pre-notified eID schemes and identifies key trends in the electronic identification field. Moreover, it discusses preliminary security considerations and recommendations related to the underlying technologies used for eID means and makes a proposal on the role that ENISA could play in the eIDAS compliant eID ecosystem. Since Germany notified in September 2017 the first European eID scheme under the eIDAS Regulation, an increasing number of countries have started an eID scheme notification process. Other schemes are pre-notified and more will undoubtedly follow, thus demonstrating the success of eID across the European Union."

Families of malware include cryptominers, viruses,  ransomware, worms and spyware. Its common objectives are  information or identity theft, espionage and service disruption.1  During 2019, cryptominers were one of the most prevalent malware  family in the threat landscape,2 resulting in high IT costs, increased  electricity consumption and reduced employee productivity.3  Ransomware presented a slight increase in 2019 compared with 2018,  though still remaining at the bottom of the malware type list.2  Web and e-mail protocols were the most common initial attack vectors  used to spread malware. However, using brute force techniques or  exploiting system vulnerabilities, certain malware families were able to  spread even further inside a network. Although global detections of  attacks have remained at the previous year’s levels, there was a  noticeable shift from consumer to business targets.4  2  3  __Findings  400.000_detections of pre-installed spyware  and adware on mobile devices4  13%_increase in Windows malware detections  at business endpoints globally4  71%_of organizations experienced malware  activity that spread from one employee to another47  46,5%_of all malware in e-mail messages  found in ‘.docx’ file type24  50%_increase in malware designed to steal  personal data or stalkerware15  67%_of malware was delivered via encrypted  HTTPS connections48  4  Kill chain  Reconnaissance Weaponisation Delivery Exploitation  Step of Attack Workflow  Width of Purpose  5  Installation Command &  Control  Actions on  Objectives  Malware  MORE INFORMATION  The Cyber Kill Chain® framework was developed by  Lockheed Martin, adapted from a military concept related  with the structure of an attack.

Emotet was initially discovered in 2014 as a banking trojan. Since  then, it has been upgraded with command and control (C2) functionality,  additional evasion mechanisms such as the ability to tell whether if it is  running in a sandbox environment and the ability to deliver dangerous  payloads, such as Trickbot and Ryuk.7 The figure above presents the  raking of baking malware detected in 2019.  During the reporting period, Emotet evolved into a botnet2, increased its  activity8 and initiated new localized spam campaigns with spear-phishing  functionality to install ransomware or steal information.5 During 2019,  Emotet detections increased by 73% compared with previous year,  mainly targeting business endpoints in the United States and the United  Kingdom as presented in the figure below.4  _Most prevalent malware types  0.26%  0.29%  0.29%  0.45%  0.96%  1.02%  1.23%  23.63%  71.58%  Philippines  Brazil  Australia  Argentina  Mexico  Canada  Germany  United Kingdom  Unted States  2019 global Emotet detections by country. Source MalwareBytes 4  Trends  7  Although malware detections globally remained at the same levels as in  20184,9, a 13% increase in malware targeting businesses was observed in  services, education and retail among the worst affected sectors.4 It is  estimated that over one third of banking malware attacks in 2019  targeted corporate users, with the intention of compromising the  company’s financial resources.10 The top five strains of malware4 targeting  businesses were Trojan.Emotet, Adware.InstallCore,  HackTool.WinActivator, Riskware.BitCoinMiner and Virus.Renamer.  Ransomware attacks targeting the public sector increased in 2019  because of its ability to pay higher ransoms.11 As Cybercriminals aim for  high-value targets, new malware types were designed to spread laterally  inside a corporate network rather than through the internet.12  _A shift towards business targets  25%  31%  19%  10%  6% 6%3% Other Trickbot  Ramnit Ursnif  DanaBot Dridex  Qbot  Global banking malware detections in 2019. Source: CheckPoint 2  Malware-as-a-service (MaaS) refers to a specific malware sold in  underground forums which provides customers (cyber criminals) with the  tools and infrastructure  needed for targeted attacks. A MaaS owner  provides this service through the delivery of a kit that includes an initial  loader, command and control Server (C2) and a backdoor for taking full  control of the infected computer.  A security researcher46 recently identified four type of attacks using  various tools from the Golden Chickens (GC) Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS)  portfolio, confirming the release of improved variants with code updates  to three of these tools.   TerraLoader. A multipurpose loader written in PureBasic. TerraLoader  is a flagship product of GC MaaS service portfolio.   more_eggs. A backdoor malware capable of beaconing to a fixed C2  server and executing additional payloads downloaded from an  external web resource. The backdoor is written in JavaScript.   VenomLNK. A Windows shortcut file likely generated by a newer  version of the VenomKit building kit.  _ Malware-as-a-service (MaaS)  8  Trends  9  __Mobile banking malware  surged Mobile applications designed to steal payment data, credentials  and funds from victims’ bank accounts increased by 50% in the  first half of 2019.13 Traditionally, threat actors have used phishing  techniques to gain bank credentials, either by displaying a fake  page that mimics the bank’s login page or by introducing fake  mobile apps that resemble the original banking apps. However,  in 2019, cybercriminals became more creative, as in the case of  Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Gustuff.a, which was able to control a  legitimate banking app by misusing the operating system’s  accessibility functions, thereby automating malicious  transactions.14 New versions of mobile financial malware were  commonly found for sale in underground forums15 and new  evasion techniques were continuously being developed. A  notable new addition discovered in 2019 was the ability of  malware to use motion sensors and be triggered only when a  smartphone is moving, as used by the mobile banking  trojanAnubis in an effort to detect a sandboxed environment.16  The most popular banking malware during 201911 was Asacub  (44,4%), Svpeng (22,4%), Agent (19,1%), Faketoken (12%) and  Hqwar (3,8%).  10  Trends  Fileless malware does not contain an executable file and can evade  common security filters and whitelisting techniques. For this reason, this  malware family can be up to ten times more likely to succeed than the  others.18 Instead of an executable file, this type of malware requires the  attacker to inject malicious code into already installed and trusted  software, either remotely (e.g. in the case of Windows Management  Instrumentation or WMI and PowerShell) or by actively downloading  document files (i.e. office documents) containing malicious macros.19  After a successful attack, the malware can gain persistence through the  registry, built-in task scheduler or the WMI. Fileless malware attacks  increased by 265% during the first half of 2019.20 The majority of such  attacks were script-based (38%), while others executed an in-memory  attack (24%) or abused built-in system tools (20%).21  _File-less malware  38%  24%  1%  10%  1%  20%  6% Script-based attack  In-memory attack  WMI persistence  Task scheduler  Windows registry  System built-in tool  Document exploit  Percentage of file-less events detected in first half of 2019. Source: Norton 19  11  __How to prevent and defend  from a file-less attack? The most effective way for organisations to defend against  fileless attacks is by keeping software up to date. Since most  fileless infections happen with Microsoft applications and  especially with ‘.docx’ files, it is particularly important to keep  updating this software to the latest version. Microsoft has also  upgraded its Windows Defender package to detect irregular  activity using the PowerShell application.  According to a security researcher18, the key to successfully  counteracting a fileless attack campaign is by dealing with each of  the phases of the threat’s life cycle with an integrated and multi-  layered defence approach. In this approach, it is important to  investigate the different stages of the attack and undertake the  following activities:   analyse and measure the actions performed by the attacker;   identify the techniques used;   monitor activities in PowerShell or other scripting engines;   Access aggregated threat data;   control the state of the targeted system;   halt arbitrary processes;   remediate processes that are part of the attack;   isolate infected devices.  12  Trends  Overall global botnet traffic increased by 71,5% since 20182. The botnets  most often observed were Emotet (41%), Trickbot (25%) and DanaBot  (5%)2. A notable increase in botnet traffic was observed in Russia (143%),  attributed mostly to relaxed registration procedures and less interest  from law enforcement agencies.14 During 2019, Russia hosted most botnet  C2s, followed by the United States, the Netherlands, China and France.  Domain name generation algorithms (DGAs) were used by cybercriminals  to support many C2 communication. 50% of these registrations occurred  in top-level domains (TLDs) ‘.com’ and ‘.net’.15 During the reporting period,  such domain name registrations dropped by 71%, in favour of other  communication protocols such as peer-to-peer (P2P).13  _Botnet and Command and Control (C&C)  landscape  18%  15%  14%  14%  12%  11%  10%  10%  Emotet  Jsecoin  XMRig  Cryptoloot  Coinhive  Trickbot  Lokibot  AgentTesla  0% 5% 10% 15% 20%  Malware types identified in 2019. Source: MalwareBytes4  13  According to a study from 2019, 94% of all malware types were delivered  via e-mail.24 Although this is counted as an entry point vector, it is  interesting to note that, upon  successful attack, the malware might  download an additional payload that exhibits worm-like behaviour to  allow laterally spread across the network (Emotet and Trickbot). Moreover,  after the initial delivery of malware, in most cases (71%) it was spreading  by employees’ activity. Once again, new vulnerabilities in the remote  desktop protocol (RDP) attracted attention, as they allow remote code  execution (RCE) and are therefore wormable.30 Although these newly  discovered vulnerabilities have not been exploited on a large scale, it is  expected that a new worm may target unpatched systems in the near  future.31  _How  _Incidents   Airbus suffered a data breach affecting employees in  Europe.34, 35   Card skimming malware installed on the American Medical  Collection Agency’s web site resulted in the theft of 12 million  patients’ personal data.36   Major provider of laboratory diagnostics LifeLabs fell victim to  a ransomware attack, resulting in the theft of 15 million  accounts containing the test results and health card  numbers.37,38   A ransomware attack on the City of Pensacola, Florida  resulted in 2GB of data being made available online, possibly  containing personally identifiable information (PII).39   The personal data of 2.400 Singapore armed forces staff  may have been leaked through e-mail phishing by malicious  malware.40  _Proposed actions  14  Mitigation   Implement malware detection for all inbound/outbound channels,  including email, network, web and application systems in all  applicable platforms (i.e. servers, network infrastructure, personal  computers and mobile devices).   Inspect the SSL/TLS traffic allowing the firewall to decrypt what is  being transmitted to and from websites, email communications, and  mobile applications.   Establish interfaces between malware detection functions  (intelligence-led threat hunting) and security incident management to  establish efficient response capabilities.   Use the tools available for malware analysis for sharing malware  information and malware mitigation (i.e. MISP).32   Develop security policies that specify the processes to be followed in  the event of infection.   Understand the capabilities of various security tools and develop new  security solutions. Identify gaps and apply the defence-in-depth  principle.   Employ mail filtering (or spam filtering) for malicious e-mails and  remove executable attachments.   Regularly monitor the results of antivirus tests.30,42   Log monitoring using security incident and event management (SIEM)  solution. Indicative log sources are anti-virus alerts, endpoint  detection and response (EDR), proxy server logs, Windows Event and  Sysmon43 logs, intrusion detection system (IDS) logs44, etc.   Disable or reduce access to PowerShell functions.45  15  “The sophistication  of threat capabilities  increased in 2019,  with many  adversaries using  exploits, credential  stealing and multi-  stage attacks.” in ETL 2020  16  References 1. “What is Malware”.

    "original document": "ENISA ETL2020 - Malware  From January 2019 to April 2020  Malware ENISA Threat Landscape  Overview  Malware is a common type of cyberattack in the form of malicious  software. Families of malware include cryptominers, viruses,  ransomware, worms and spyware. Its common objectives are  information or identity theft, espionage and service disruption.1  During 2019, cryptominers were one of the most prevalent malware  family in the threat landscape,2 resulting in high IT costs, increased  electricity consumption and reduced employee productivity.3  Ransomware presented a slight increase in 2019 compared with 2018,  though still remaining at the bottom of the malware type list.2  Web and e-mail protocols were the most common initial attack vectors  used to spread malware. However, using brute force techniques or  exploiting system vulnerabilities, certain malware families were able to  spread even further inside a network. Although global detections of  attacks have remained at the previous year’s levels, there was a  noticeable shift from consumer to business targets.4  2  3  __Findings  400.000_detections of pre-installed spyware  and adware on mobile devices4  13%_increase in Windows malware detections  at business endpoints globally4  71%_of organizations experienced malware  activity that spread from one employee to another47  46,5%_of all malware in e-mail messages  found in ‘.docx’ file type24  50%_increase in malware designed to steal  personal data or stalkerware15  67%_of malware was delivered via encrypted  HTTPS connections48  4  Kill chain  Reconnaissance Weaponisation Delivery Exploitation  Step of Attack Workflow  Width of Purpose  5  Installation Command &  Control  Actions on  Objectives  Malware  MORE INFORMATION  The Cyber Kill Chain® framework was developed by  Lockheed Martin, adapted from a military concept related  with the structure of an attack.

Emotet was initially discovered in 2014 as a banking trojan. Since  then, it has been upgraded with command and control (C2) functionality,  additional evasion mechanisms such as the ability to tell whether if it is  running in a sandbox environment and the ability to deliver dangerous  payloads, such as Trickbot and Ryuk.7 The figure above presents the  raking of baking malware detected in 2019.  During the reporting period, Emotet evolved into a botnet2, increased its  activity8 and initiated new localized spam campaigns with spear-phishing  functionality to install ransomware or steal information.5 During 2019,  Emotet detections increased by 73% compared with previous year,  mainly targeting business endpoints in the United States and the United  Kingdom as presented in the figure below.4  _Most prevalent malware types  0.26%  0.29%  0.29%  0.45%  0.96%  1.02%  1.23%  23.63%  71.58%  Philippines  Brazil  Australia  Argentina  Mexico  Canada  Germany  United Kingdom  Unted States  2019 global Emotet detections by country. Source MalwareBytes 4  Trends  7  Although malware detections globally remained at the same levels as in  20184,9, a 13% increase in malware targeting businesses was observed in  services, education and retail among the worst affected sectors.4 It is  estimated that over one third of banking malware attacks in 2019  targeted corporate users, with the intention of compromising the  company’s financial resources.10 The top five strains of malware4 targeting  businesses were Trojan.Emotet, Adware.InstallCore,  HackTool.WinActivator, Riskware.BitCoinMiner and Virus.Renamer.  Ransomware attacks targeting the public sector increased in 2019  because of its ability to pay higher ransoms.11 As Cybercriminals aim for  high-value targets, new malware types were designed to spread laterally  inside a corporate network rather than through the internet.12  _A shift towards business targets  25%  31%  19%  10%  6% 6%3% Other Trickbot  Ramnit Ursnif  DanaBot Dridex  Qbot  Global banking malware detections in 2019. Source: CheckPoint 2  Malware-as-a-service (MaaS) refers to a specific malware sold in  underground forums which provides customers (cyber criminals) with the  tools and infrastructure  needed for targeted attacks. A MaaS owner  provides this service through the delivery of a kit that includes an initial  loader, command and control Server (C2) and a backdoor for taking full  control of the infected computer.  A security researcher46 recently identified four type of attacks using  various tools from the Golden Chickens (GC) Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS)  portfolio, confirming the release of improved variants with code updates  to three of these tools.   TerraLoader. A multipurpose loader written in PureBasic. TerraLoader  is a flagship product of GC MaaS service portfolio.   more_eggs. A backdoor malware capable of beaconing to a fixed C2  server and executing additional payloads downloaded from an  external web resource. The backdoor is written in JavaScript.   VenomLNK. A Windows shortcut file likely generated by a newer  version of the VenomKit building kit.  _ Malware-as-a-service (MaaS)  8  Trends  9  __Mobile banking malware  surged Mobile applications designed to steal payment data, credentials  and funds from victims’ bank accounts increased by 50% in the  first half of 2019.13 Traditionally, threat actors have used phishing  techniques to gain bank credentials, either by displaying a fake  page that mimics the bank’s login page or by introducing fake  mobile apps that resemble the original banking apps. However,  in 2019, cybercriminals became more creative, as in the case of  Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Gustuff.a, which was able to control a  legitimate banking app by misusing the operating system’s  accessibility functions, thereby automating malicious  transactions.14 New versions of mobile financial malware were  commonly found for sale in underground forums15 and new  evasion techniques were continuously being developed. A  notable new addition discovered in 2019 was the ability of  malware to use motion sensors and be triggered only when a  smartphone is moving, as used by the mobile banking  trojanAnubis in an effort to detect a sandboxed environment.16  The most popular banking malware during 201911 was Asacub  (44,4%), Svpeng (22,4%), Agent (19,1%), Faketoken (12%) and  Hqwar (3,8%).  10  Trends  Fileless malware does not contain an executable file and can evade  common security filters and whitelisting techniques. For this reason, this  malware family can be up to ten times more likely to succeed than the  others.18 Instead of an executable file, this type of malware requires the  attacker to inject malicious code into already installed and trusted  software, either remotely (e.g. in the case of Windows Management  Instrumentation or WMI and PowerShell) or by actively downloading  document files (i.e. office documents) containing malicious macros.19  After a successful attack, the malware can gain persistence through the  registry, built-in task scheduler or the WMI. Fileless malware attacks  increased by 265% during the first half of 2019.20 The majority of such  attacks were script-based (38%), while others executed an in-memory  attack (24%) or abused built-in system tools (20%).21  _File-less malware  38%  24%  1%  10%  1%  20%  6% Script-based attack  In-memory attack  WMI persistence  Task scheduler  Windows registry  System built-in tool  Document exploit  Percentage of file-less events detected in first half of 2019. Source: Norton 19  11  __How to prevent and defend  from a file-less attack? The most effective way for organisations to defend against  fileless attacks is by keeping software up to date. Since most  fileless infections happen with Microsoft applications and  especially with ‘.docx’ files, it is particularly important to keep  updating this software to the latest version. Microsoft has also  upgraded its Windows Defender package to detect irregular  activity using the PowerShell application.  According to a security researcher18, the key to successfully  counteracting a fileless attack campaign is by dealing with each of  the phases of the threat’s life cycle with an integrated and multi-  layered defence approach. In this approach, it is important to  investigate the different stages of the attack and undertake the  following activities:   analyse and measure the actions performed by the attacker;   identify the techniques used;   monitor activities in PowerShell or other scripting engines;   Access aggregated threat data;   control the state of the targeted system;   halt arbitrary processes;   remediate processes that are part of the attack;   isolate infected devices.  12  Trends  Overall global botnet traffic increased by 71,5% since 20182. The botnets  most often observed were Emotet (41%), Trickbot (25%) and DanaBot  (5%)2. A notable increase in botnet traffic was observed in Russia (143%),  attributed mostly to relaxed registration procedures and less interest  from law enforcement agencies.14 During 2019, Russia hosted most botnet  C2s, followed by the United States, the Netherlands, China and France.  Domain name generation algorithms (DGAs) were used by cybercriminals  to support many C2 communication. 50% of these registrations occurred  in top-level domains (TLDs) ‘.com’ and ‘.net’.15 During the reporting period,  such domain name registrations dropped by 71%, in favour of other  communication protocols such as peer-to-peer (P2P).13  _Botnet and Command and Control (C&C)  landscape  18%  15%  14%  14%  12%  11%  10%  10%  Emotet  Jsecoin  XMRig  Cryptoloot  Coinhive  Trickbot  Lokibot  AgentTesla  0% 5% 10% 15% 20%  Malware types identified in 2019. Source: MalwareBytes4  13  According to a study from 2019, 94% of all malware types were delivered  via e-mail.24 Although this is counted as an entry point vector, it is  interesting to note that, upon  successful attack, the malware might  download an additional payload that exhibits worm-like behaviour to  allow laterally spread across the network (Emotet and Trickbot). Moreover,  after the initial delivery of malware, in most cases (71%) it was spreading  by employees’ activity. Once again, new vulnerabilities in the remote  desktop protocol (RDP) attracted attention, as they allow remote code  execution (RCE) and are therefore wormable.30 Although these newly  discovered vulnerabilities have not been exploited on a large scale, it is  expected that a new worm may target unpatched systems in the near  future.31  _How  _Incidents   Airbus suffered a data breach affecting employees in  Europe.34, 35   Card skimming malware installed on the American Medical  Collection Agency’s web site resulted in the theft of 12 million  patients’ personal data.36   Major provider of laboratory diagnostics LifeLabs fell victim to  a ransomware attack, resulting in the theft of 15 million  accounts containing the test results and health card  numbers.37,38   A ransomware attack on the City of Pensacola, Florida  resulted in 2GB of data being made available online, possibly  containing personally identifiable information (PII).39   The personal data of 2.400 Singapore armed forces staff  may have been leaked through e-mail phishing by malicious  malware.40  _Proposed actions  14  Mitigation   Implement malware detection for all inbound/outbound channels,  including email, network, web and application systems in all  applicable platforms (i.e. servers, network infrastructure, personal  computers and mobile devices).   Inspect the SSL/TLS traffic allowing the firewall to decrypt what is  being transmitted to and from websites, email communications, and  mobile applications.   Establish interfaces between malware detection functions  (intelligence-led threat hunting) and security incident management to  establish efficient response capabilities.   Use the tools available for malware analysis for sharing malware  information and malware mitigation (i.e. MISP).32   Develop security policies that specify the processes to be followed in  the event of infection.   Understand the capabilities of various security tools and develop new  security solutions. Identify gaps and apply the defence-in-depth  principle.   Employ mail filtering (or spam filtering) for malicious e-mails and  remove executable attachments.   Regularly monitor the results of antivirus tests.30,42   Log monitoring using security incident and event management (SIEM)  solution. Indicative log sources are anti-virus alerts, endpoint  detection and response (EDR), proxy server logs, Windows Event and  Sysmon43 logs, intrusion detection system (IDS) logs44, etc.   Disable or reduce access to PowerShell functions.45  15  “The sophistication  of threat capabilities  increased in 2019,  with many  adversaries using  exploits, credential  stealing and multi-  stage attacks.” in ETL 2020  16  References 1. “What is Malware”.

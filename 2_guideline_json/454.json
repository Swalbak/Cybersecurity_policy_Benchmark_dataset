It defines trust services for supporting  electronic signatures, electronic seals, electronic time stamps, electronic registered delivery services and  website authentication.  The eIDAS Regulation represented a big step forward in building a digital single market as it provides one  common legal framework for all parties relying or providing on those kinds of services. Indeed, various  sectors of the economy (e.g. finance, banking, transport, insurance, health, sharing economy, trading, etc.)  where obligations exist for security, reliable identification, strong authentication, legal certainty of  evidences, will clearly be positively affected by the eIDAS Regulation. This latter will indeed allow citizens,  businesses and public administrations to meet such obligations for any (cross-border) electronic  transaction as they will now be able to use the recognised eID means and (qualified) trust services. In  particular, data sent and received using a qualified electronic registered delivery service shall enjoy the  presumption of the integrity of the data, the sending of that data by the identified sender, its receipt by  the identified addressee and the accuracy of the date and time of sending and receipt indicated by the  qualified electronic registered delivery service.  This document addresses qualified electronic registered delivery services and is one out of a series of five  documents which aim to assist parties wishing to use qualified electronic signatures, seals, time stamps,  eDelivery or website authentication certificates to understand the subject correctly as-well-as the potential  benefits, amongst others, by giving examples of possible applications. This series of documents also aims  to give those parties some advice on how to correctly use the related qualified trust services.  After explaining what a qualified electronic registered delivery service is and what properties/function it  does and does not provide, the following concrete examples of use are given for inspiration to the readers:  • Enabling electronic registered mail;  • Supporting official submissions in eGovernment services;  • Accessing sensitive data;  • Exchanging (sensitive) data;  • Notarization of events.  Next to the above, and as even the most secure / trusted service becomes insecure and unreliable if not  being integrated or used correctly, some key recommendations are given for correct integration and use.  This is expressed in three levels for relying parties:  • Basic/Minimum recommended level of implementation to be followed by entities or in processes  dealing with normal levels of criticality of data and therefor can live with a lower maturity in  implementing trust services (technology).  • (Standard) Recommended level of implementation to be followed by entities or in processes  dealing with important business data and therefor need to be able to rely on a medium to higher  maturity of implementation of trust services (technology).  • Enhanced recommended level of implementation to be followed by entities or in processes dealing  with data of sensitive/high level of criticality and therefor need to be able to rely on a (very) high  maturity of implementation of trust services (technology).  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  07  1. Introduction  General context/the eIDAS regulation on eID and trust services  Regulation (EU) No 910/20141 (hereafter the eIDAS2 Regulation), on electronic identification and trust  services for electronic transactions in the internal market, provides a predictable regulatory environment  for electronic identification and a set of electronic trust services, namely electronic signatures, seals, time  stamps, registered delivery services and certificates for website authentication.  It is possible to use these trust services as well as electronic documents as evidence in legal proceedings in  all EU Member States contributing to their general cross- border use. Courts (or other bodies in charge of legal  proceedings) cannot discard them as evidence only because  they are electronic but have to assess these electronic tools  in the same way they would do for their paper equivalent.  Whether you are a large company, a SME or a citizen willing  to complete an electronic transaction in another EU country,  e.g. submit a call for tender or register as a student in  another EU Member State (MS), besides reducing time and  costs, the eIDAS Regulation will ensure cross-border  recognition of national eID and electronic trust services supporting your electronic transaction. Hence it  will boost trust, security and convenience.  Since 1 July 2016, most provisions of the eIDAS Regulation are directly applicable in the 28 EU Member  States’ legal framework overcoming problems of fragmented national regimes. It provides legal certainty  and fosters the usage of eID means and electronic trust services for online access and online transactions  at EU level.  The eIDAS Regulation will ensure that people and businesses can use their national eIDs to access public  services in other EU countries where eIDs are required for such an access at national level. It also creates  an EU wide internal market for electronic trust services by ensuring their recognition and workability  across borders and are considered equivalent to traditional paper based processes.  Opportunities brought by the eIDAS Regulation  The opportunities reside in leveraging eID and electronic trust services as key enablers for making national  and cross-border electronic transactions more secure, more convenient, trustworthy and benefiting from  legal certainty.  The broader adoption of EU-wide recognised eID means and of electronic trust services will facilitate and  boost the digital transformation of organisations, be it public administrations or businesses, enhance  customer experience, improve the security of electronic transactions and stimulate the provisioning of  new and innovative services.  1 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/ES/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG  2 See Glossary.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/ES/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  08  To this end, a large number of sectors (e.g. finance, banking, transport, insurance, health, sharing  economy, trading, etc.) where obligations exist for security, reliable identification, strong authentication,  legal certainty of evidences, will be positively affected. The eIDAS Regulation will indeed allow citizens,  businesses and public administrations to conveniently meet such obligations for any cross-border  electronic transaction using the recognised eID means and (qualified) trust services of their choice.  Without undergoing identity verification  based on physical presence, but by using  MS notified eID means of a level “high”,  one should for example be able to use  public services in another country or banks  may accept such eID to open a bank  account3. By relying on a qualified  electronic time stamp, one shall enjoy, all  over the EU, the presumption of the  accuracy of the date and the time it  indicates and the integrity of the data to  which the date and time are bound. By  relying on a qualified electronic registered  delivery service, one will benefit, all over  the EU, from the presumption of the  integrity of the registered data, the  sending of that data by the identified  sender, its receipt by the identified  addressee and the accuracy of the date  and time of sending and receipt indicated  by that qualified trust service.  Specific Role of the qualified trust services  To further enhance in particular the trust of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and consumers in  the internal market and to promote the use of trust services and products, the eIDAS Regulation  introduces the notions of qualified trust service and qualified trust service provider with a view to  indicating requirements and obligations that ensure high-level security of whatever qualified trust service  or product is used or provided and, as a consequence, are granted a higher presumption of their legal  effect.  Therefore, when looking for trust services, selecting qualified ones ensures benefiting from a high level of  security and legal certainty of trust services. E.g., qualified electronic time stamp shall enjoy, all over the  EU, the presumption of the accuracy of the date and the time it indicates and the integrity of the data to  which the date and time are bound.  Initiation and supervision of qualified trust services  In order to ensure high-level security of qualified trust services, the eIDAS Regulation foresees an active  supervision scheme of qualified trust service providers (QTSP) and qualified trust services (QTS) they  3 National legislations on prevention of money laundering may currently may force identity verification to be based  on physical presence. Furthermore, the use by the private sector of electronic identification means under a notified  scheme is on a voluntarily basis only (see Recital 17 of the eIDAS Regulation).  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  09  provide (hereafter referred to as a QTSP/QTS) by the national competent supervisory body (SB) that  supervises, ex ante and ex post, fulfilment of the QTSP/QTS requirements and obligations4.  All those requirements must be met by the QTSP/QTS before providing the very first qualified trust service  output, e.g. before issuing the very first qualified time stamp in the case of QTSP providing qualified time  stamping services.  Before a TSP/TS is granted a qualified status (QTSP/QTS), it will be subject to a pre-authorisation process –  the so-called initiation process. QTSPs may only begin to provide the qualified trust service after the  qualified status has been granted by the competent supervisory body and indicated in the national trusted  list5. From there, the supervision scheme covers the full life cycle of each QTS and each QTSP, from its  genesis until its termination.  In practice, where TSPs, without qualified status, intend to start providing qualified trust services, they  shall submit to the supervisory body a notification of their intention together with a conformity  assessment report issued by an “eIDAS” accredited conformity assessment body. Before notifying the  competent supervisory body of their intention to start providing qualified trust services, the future  QTSP/QTS must hence successfully pass an external assessment (audit) to confirm it fulfils the eIDAS  requirements. That audit must be conducted by a conformity assessment body specifically accredited to  carry out assessments of QTSP/QTS. The audit results in a formal conformity statement confirming - if such  is the case - that the QTSP/QTS meets all the applicable requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. Based on  the notified information including the report of such an audit, the competent SB will formally verify that  the candidate QTSP/QTS meets the applicable eIDAS requirements and, in case of positive verification, it  will undertake the publication of the grant of the qualified status for that QTSP/QTS in the national trusted  list.  It is only when its qualified status is published in the corresponding national trusted list that the QTSP/QTS  is authorised to provide the corresponding QTS.  Note: A TSP cannot be deemed as qualified without providing at least one type of a qualified trust  service (cfr Art.3.20 of the eIDAS Regulation). A TSP is granted a qualified status separately for each  type of qualified trust service covered by the eIDAS Regulation. E.g. a QTSP qualified for the  provisioning of qualified certificates for electronic signatures is not per se granted a qualified status  for the issuance of qualified time stamps; it must first complete the full pre-authorisation process and  have its granted qualified status for the provision of qualified time stamp published explicitly in the  national trusted list before issuing qualified time stamps in addition to the provision of qualified  certificates for electronic signatures. There are nine different types of QTSs defined by the eIDAS  Regulation for which a qualified status is granted separately: provision of qualified certificates for  electronic signatures, provision of qualified certificates for electronic seals, provision of qualified  certificates for website authentication, qualified preservation service for qualified electronic  signatures, qualified preservation service for qualified electronic seals, qualified validation service for  qualified electronic signatures, qualified validation service for qualified electronic seals, qualified  electronic time stamps services, and qualified electronic registered delivery services.6  4 See glossary  5 See glossary.  6 See Annex A.7 for further details.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  10  For marketing purposes, once qualified, a QTSP/QTS may use the EU Trust Mark for qualified trust services  when promoting its QTS. That trust mark shown in Figure 1 can only be used by a QTSP to “label” its QTS. It  can be used on any support provided it meets requirements from Art.23 of the eIDAS Regulation (e.g. a link  to the corresponding national trusted list where consumers may verify the granted qualified status must  be displayed on the QTSP’s website) and rules of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/806.7  Basically, this secondary legislation sets the form, colour and size of the EU trust mark, sets the obligation  to clearly indicate the qualified services that the EU trust mark pertains to, and allows association with  other graphical or textual elements provided that certain conditions are met. 8  Figure 1: EU trust mark for qualified trust services  The use of the EU trust mark, which is voluntary, aims to foster transparency of the market and help  consumers distinguishing between qualified trust services and non-qualified ones.  Once granted a qualified status, QTSPs and their QTSs have the obligation to pass, and submit the  competent supervisory body with a two-yearly conformity assessment report (CAR) issued by an  accredited CAB confirming that the QTSP and the QTSs it provides fulfil the requirements laid down in the  Regulation. Competent supervisory bodies are also allowed, at their own discretion and at any time, to  audit themselves any QTSP/QTS for which they are competent or to request an accredited CAB to perform  an ad hoc audit.  QTSPs and their QTSs are supervised for their entire lifecycle, from their genesis to their termination. In  particular, in order to ensure sustainability and durability of QTSs, as well as to ensure proper termination  and user’s confidence in their provision, QTSPs must maintain, at all times, an up-to-date termination plan.  That plan is to be agreed by the SB upon initiation and regularly checked for compliance during the life of  the QTSP/QTS.  A focus on qualified electronic registered delivery services  The eIDAS Regulation establishes the principle that an electronic document should not be denied legal  effect on the grounds that it is in an electronic form.  This regulation also defines an electronic registered delivery service, hereafter called eDelivery service, as  “a service that makes it possible to transmit data between third parties by electronic means and provides  evidence relating to the handling of the transmitted data, including proof of sending and receiving the  7 Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/806 of 22 May 2015 laying down specifications relating to the form  of the EU trust mark for qualified trust services (Text with EEA relevance).

In practice the data referred to by that definition as being transmitted under such an eDelivery service  from a sender to a receiver can be of any type, including electronic documents (initially created in  electronic form or dematerialised documents), structured or not. The transmission means can be of any  kind as well including but not limited to the well-known email system.  By relying on a qualified electronic registered delivery service, one will benefit, all over the EU, from the  presumption of the integrity of the registered data, the sending of that data by the identified sender, its  receipt by the identified addressee and the accuracy of the date and time of sending and receipt indicated  by that qualified trust service.  Scope of the present document and relationship with the other recommendations  This document proposes security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered  delivery services. It aims to support relying parties and end users of qualified electronic registered delivery  services to securely use these services.  The target audience of the document are end users and relying parties of qualified electronic registered  delivery services. This could comprise individuals, businesses and public administrations. For example, it  could be a public administration that wishes to formalize electronic interactions with citizens to benefit  from the legal guarantees provided by such qualified trust services, and which would like to ensure it is  utilizing these services:   In compliance with the eIDAS Regulation.   In a proper and secure manner that guarantees that the security properties of the service are  being maintained.  The present document is organised to provide information and guidance with regards to the following  aspects of qualified electronic registered delivery services:   What is it?   What key properties it provides?   What properties can it not provide?   What are the potential use cases?   What are the usage best practices?   Example of tools & practical usage aspects.  Four other linked documents propose security guidelines on the appropriate use respectively of qualified  electronic signatures, qualified electronic seals, qualified electronic time stamps and qualified website  authentication certificates.9  Although each of these qualified trust services share some technical backgrounds or tools and thus provide  some common functionalities, such as illustrated below, each of them has its own objectives and core  functionalities as summarised in the following table:  9 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services/qualified-trust-services.

Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  13  2. Qualified electronic registered delivery – what is it?  Electronic registered delivery service  The eIDAS Regulation establishes the principle that an electronic document should not be denied legal  effect on the grounds that it is in electronic form.  This regulation also defines an electronic registered delivery service, hereafter called eDelivery service, as  “a service that makes it possible to transmit data between third parties by electronic means and provides  evidence relating to the handling of the transmitted data, including proof of sending and receiving the  data, and that protects transmitted data against the risk of loss, theft, damage or any unauthorised  alterations” (Art.3.36).  In practice the data referred to by that definition as being transmitted under such an eDelivery service  from a sender to a receiver can be of any type, including electronic documents (initially created in  electronic form or dematerialised documents), structured or not. The transmission means can be of any  kind as well including but not limited to email.  Usually the data referred to by the definition as being transmitted under such an eDelivery service from a  sender to a receiver is generally called a message.  eDelivery can be used by all kinds of entities willing to share electronic documents securely, such as public  administrations, business organisations, and citizens. The following figure illustrates the different types of  message transfers that can benefit from eDelivery: Administration to Administration (A2A), Administration  to Business… Customer to Customer (C2C).  Qualified electronic registered delivery service  Qualified eDelivery service means an electronic registered delivery service which:   is provided by qualified trust service providers, i.e. organisations under national supervision and  whose compliance with requirements is regularly checked by an  accredited, trusted entity, the so-called conformity assessment  body;   ensures a high level of confidence with regards to the  identification of the sender;   ensures the identification of the addressee before the delivery;   protects the sending and receiving of data by using an advanced  electronic signature or seal of a qualified trust service provider in  such a manner as to detect all data alteration;   protects the date and time of sending and of receiving by using qualified electronic time stamps;   conforms to other potential standards considered relevant by the Commission.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  14  Figure 1: Qualified eDelivery service example  Registered email is a general-purpose implementation of eDelivery, whereas there are more specific  eDelivery services, such as tax declaration delivery or eInvoicing that uses different message types and  communication channels.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  15  3. Qualified electronic registered delivery – what key properties does  it  provide?  Legal Properties  Data sent and received using a qualified electronic registered delivery service shall enjoy the presumption  of the integrity of the data, the sending of that data by the identified sender, its receipt by the identified  addressee and the accuracy of the date and time of sending and of the date and time of receipt, indicated  by the qualified electronic registered delivery service.  Data in this context can equally refer to email, other messages, or structured attachments, depending on  the general conditions of the service provider.  Hence, qualified electronic registered delivery provides the sender with a legal proof that he/she has sent  a given data at a given time to a given receiver and that this receiver has accepted the message at a given  time.  Proof of delivery  The sender receives an unforgeable time stamped proof of when he/she has delivered a given message to  a receiver, independently on the receivers’ ability to receive it. The currently used receipt for paper based  registered mail contains a handwritten address, a date and a signature by a postal officer, which in general  is not that difficult to fake.  Proof of reception  Both the sender and the recipient receive an unforgeable time stamped proof of when the receiver  received or opened the electronic message.  Proof of integrity  Both the sender and the receiver can be sure that the message has not been changed during transmission.  Protection against the risk of loss, theft, damage or any unauthorised alterations  Qualified and non-qualified electronic registered delivery are services that are legally defined as ensuring  the protection of the transmitted data against the risk of loss, theft, damage or any unauthorised  alterations.  Security properties  Sender identification  The receivers know for sure who sends the data to them. Current email and current registered mail has no  such proof as anybody can write any sender address on an email or a registered mail.  Secure time stamping  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  16  All time indications, i.e. the date and time of sending, receiving and any change of the transmitted data,  are protected by a qualified electronic time stamp. Such reliable time sources provide legal presumption of  the accuracy of the date and time of the time stamped data as well as the integrity of that data.  Confidentiality  Both the sender and the receiver can be sure that the message cannot be accessed by unauthorised  persons during the transmission.  Content (data) integrity  A traditional postal service can never guarantee which message was in the envelope of a registered mail.  This opens the door for conflict where the receiver claims to have received a different document than the  one the sender claims to have sent. Qualified electronic registered delivery services ensures the integrity  of the transmitted data, i.e. of the content of the message.  Control on routing errors  With current email, the sender may accidently type the wrong email address. Qualified electronic  registered delivery procedures typically help the user to check different parameters of the receiver before  processing to the transmission.  When sending a letter to a non-existent address, the mistake is found out only when the parcel comes  back. Qualified electronic registered delivery service provider should inform you about the ability of the  receiver to accept the message before you transmit it.  Interoperability  A useful concept of qualified electronic registered delivery services is to indicate to the sender all formats  of messages that the intended receiver can process. Sometimes, the service provider can check and accept  only messages explicitly accepted by the receiver. Qualified electronic registered delivery service providers  can also propose additional services consisting in transforming a message from one format to another, e.g.  from Word to PDF, if there is no confidentiality rule avoiding them to get access to the message.  Functional properties  Sending of large files  Most qualified electronic registered delivery services allow large messages and messages of all kinds of  formats to be transmitted. Currently used systems for transmitting large files are not always accepted by  the receiver, as they do not have a certified trust level.  Fast processing  Qualified electronic registered delivery services is instantaneous, e. g., much faster than paper based mail.  Other properties  Reduced risk  During message transmission via insecure current transmission channels, such as email, there is no  guarantee on delivery, no assured confirmation of receipt, no proof that the received message is the same  as the sent one, and little assurance on the confidentiality of the message. Qualified electronic registered  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  17  delivery makes it infeasible to manipulate data, to forge time stamps of sending or receiving, or to provide  unauthorised access to the message.  All trust services that are used in qualified electronic registered delivery are provided by trusted service  providers, which are regularly checked for having put in place the security measures required to avoid  security risks for their customers.  Reduced cost  Qualified electronic registered delivery mainly avoids the logistical costs of delivering printed electronic  documents or documents stored on some support such as a CD. Moreover, it reduces the cost of encoding  information received on paper or of uploading files from the received support to the ICT system.  Qualified electronic registered delivery also reduces the cost of transmission failure or uncertainty  inherent to insecure electronic messaging.  No transmission delays  As electronic transmission is virtually instantaneous, communication partners do not waste time when  sharing documents. Similarly, as for parcels, the receiver of large message is informed once a message has  been send to him and where he can download or process it.  No double sending  A common business practice today is to send information electronically for fast processing, and to send a  signed paper version in addition in parallel for legal purposes. Using a qualified electronic registered  delivery service instead of an unsecured messaging system such as email will make the additional sending  of a signed paper version obsolete.  Incident handling and liabilities  In case of security incidents on data delivery, a qualified electronic registered delivery service provider  must handle it properly and inform his/her supervisory body, who has to assess, whether the qualification  status has to be withdrawn or not. Thus, customers will be informed independently and transparently in  case of security issue related to the service on which they rely. The qualified trust service provider,  nevertheless, remains liable for damage that was made to its customer by his/her negligence or omission.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  18  4. Qualified electronic registered delivery – what cannot be provided?  Personal repository  (Qualified) electronic registered delivery is not about uploading documents to a central store so that they  are available for processing or downloading by other partners wherever they like. It may use a secure  repository to temporarily store the message once the sender sends it, until the receiver has accepted it.  Back-end processing  (Qualified) electronic registered delivery is not about ensuring that back-end processing systems get  connected to better share information. It does however, provide a message communication channel to  send and receive messages between backend processors. Back-end processors can only process messages  of a very specific format, e.g. Excel accepts the formats *.xls, and *.csv, but no scanned image of a table.  That is why the format of messages for backend processing has to be specified, but such specification is  often out of scope of a pure electronic registered delivery project. Electronic registered delivery  technology deals with all kinds of payload, i.e., all kind of message formats, and the communication  partners have to agree which message they send over the (qualified) electronic registered delivery  infrastructure.  Archiving  (Qualified) electronic registered delivery is not about archiving the transmitted message, nor the proof of  sending or receiving it. However, such additional services can be provided as an additional service either  from the (qualified) electronic registered delivery service provider or by a third party.  Boosting your activity  Your messaging partner will not send more messages just because a new message channel is made  available. (Qualified) electronic registered delivery is mainly a less expensive and less risky message  transmission technology; but it is not a generator of more messages. Nevertheless, if messaging is less  expensive, this may increase the motivation to communicate.  Faster treatment of messages  A fast messaging transmission system does not guarantee a fast message processing system. The speed at  which messages are processed depends on the abilities of the receiver to process the request and on the  quality of the integration of (qualified) electronic registered delivery in back-end systems. If the receiver  does not have the time to read your message once it is available, you cannot force him, just as the postal  service cannot force someone to later pick up a registered letter that could not be delivered because  nobody was at home.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  19  5. Qualified electronic registered delivery – what are the potential use  cases?  Overview and context of the given examples  In general, and to put (qualified) electronic registered delivery services into context, they are most often  seen coming in addition to other identification and/or trust services as part of a wider solution. Although  they allow exchanging data between parties in a legally certain way, communicating parties will have to be  authenticated before being allowed to access the service and in some case the messages may be required  to electronically signed, sealed and/or notarized (e.g. for longer term preservation).  In this context, and although the properties of qualified electronic registered delivery services have been  described in the previous sections, the following properties are key for the use case examples mentioned  below:   Qualified electronic registered delivery services provide the parties involved with a vehicle via which  they can obtain “guaranteed delivery” of their data to the other party.   Optionally such services can amongst others be extended with longer term notarisation services to  preserve legal evidence of the transaction having taken place.  These properties allow several “types of use cases” which can be applied in many areas of application as  show in the present section. The table below highlights the identified types of use cases. The mapping on  areas of applications in no way tries to be exhaustive but only tries to indicate the huge potential of  qualified electronic registered delivery services.

If the service provider for such electronic registered e-mail is a qualified electronic registered  delivery service provider, the users can trust the security properties of the offered qualified trust service  and use the provided evidences in any legal proceedings. Where today there is a lot of exchanges of  (optionally signed) messages, parties at current have no way of knowing with (legal) certainty whether  their message has arrived and may not receive any formal proof of delivery. Qualified electronic registered  delivery services have the ability to change that.  Figure 2: Electronic registered mail delivery service  Examples of concrete application are:   C2C/B2B: Replacement of registered postal mail by qualified electronic registered delivery services.   C2G/G2C: Delivery of official notifications (e.g. in context of Court proceedings).  Supporting official submissions in eGovernment services  Citizens/Companies have multiple possibilities to ask for public subsidies. In most cases, signed documents  are used to apply for such help.  Upon receipt, the administration encodes the data, sends back a  confirmation of receipt, then validates the request and sends back the final decision. In general, citizens fill  in the request on their PC, but still print it and send it by ordinary (or registered) post. Public  administration can spare encoding time and several processing steps, including generating a confirmation  of receipt, should this service be offered by means of a qualified electronic registered delivery service.  Faster processing can motivate citizens to use such a qualified trust service rather than sending printed  forms. The overall advantages are less paper, no delay on transmission, simplified and automated  processing at the administration, and avoidance of manual encoding of electronic forms if predefined  message types are used.  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102600_102699/10264001/02.01.01_60/ts_10264001v020101p.pdf  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102600_102699/10264001/02.01.01_60/ts_10264001v020101p.pdf  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  21  Figure 3: Submission in e-Government services  Examples of concrete application are:   C2G: Citizens submitting a request for parental leave, for social security benefits, etc.   B2G: Companies requesting subsidies, filing a periodic report, etc.  Accessing sensitive data  In many cases certain parties need to get access to sensitive information and be very sure they receive the  right information/response to their request. ePrescription is such a case. Today, in most cases, patients  bring their prescription to the pharmacist. In case the prescribed medicine is unavailable, they have to  contact the doctor to obtain clarifications or authorization of alternative medicine. In all cases, they  encode the sold product before establishing a bill addressed both to the patient and to the health  insurances. A qualified electronic registered delivery service would allow the doctor to send the  prescription in electronic form to the pharmacist chosen by the patient (and at the same time report this  prescription to the competent administration).  This could also be applied cross border where a person  needs to get a prescription and a local pharmacist needs to be able to request the right prescription from  the person’s doctor.  Figure 4: Accessing medical data example  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  22  Examples of concrete application are:   A2C: ePrescription allowing the exchange of and access to the correct prescription by involved parties.   B2G: Business being able to request formally/officially from government to receive certain  attestations/official documents (and to get proof of receipt of the request/handling of their request).   A2G: Attorneys having to deposit or access court-case files which should for obvious reasons only be  exchanged in a secured manner.  Exchanging (sensitive) data  In many cases information needs to be exchanged in the context of a (longer term running) process. Data  may need to be exchanged between social security administrations to handle a pension file or to handle  child benefits (cross border). In an electronic procurement process the sequence of events and the exact  moment of exchange of data needs to be established.  Qualified electronic registered delivery services can  not only be used in context of just a single exchange of informative (send/confirm receipt) but can also be  used to ensure that a process is fully automated and the right process-controls are being put in place  whereby guaranteed/confirmed and legally valid delivery of messages and documents can be very  valuable. Examples of use include the use of qualified electronic registered delivery systems in the way  enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems operate in large companies. Multiple messages, such as those  regarding price negotiations, trading transactions, order management, inventory management,  transportation, and capacity management have to be securely transmitted between buyers and vendors.  Examples of concrete applications are:   G2G: Exchange of social security information (nationally or cross border) such as pension file info, tax  information, or child benefit information.   B2G: Exchange of data in context of import/export and customs handling (including handling of  permits) or the handling of eProcurement/eInvoicing.   B2B: Exchange of information in context of just in time production with contractors and suppliers.   A2A: Exchange of health files between parties treating the patient and the administration involved in  paying the social security covered expenses.  Notarization of events  Today, in many countries, organisations need to send information to regulators, such as annual reports,  activity reports, risk assessment and risk registers, or audit reports. Often, these reports are sent in paper  form via registered postal mail, or sometimes are physically delivered to make sure that deadlines are  kept. To avoid scanning of such paper-based reports, the regulators often ask for an electronic version on  an annexed CD.  Faster and more reliable deliveries can be achieved when using qualified electronic  registered delivery services whereby the receiving authority can upon receipt notarize the receipt and  return a confirmation of that receipt. In addition, there could also be situations whereby a third party acts  as go-between to handle the electronic delivery as a neutral third party instead of the receiving party  handling the notarization.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  23  Figure 5: Notarizing events example  Examples of concrete application are:   B2G: Submission of audit reports and financial statement to financial supervisors or submission of  periodic audit reports of qualified trust service providers to the national supervisory bodies.   B2B: Electronic registered delivery of financial/payment data between involved parties and  notarization in a ledger of all transactions.

Qualified electronic registered delivery – what are the usage best  practices?  Security guidelines and levels  In this section, we propose recommendations according to three levels which represent the  “strength/rigorousness” with which qualified electronic registered delivery services should be applied in a  specific context. This “strength/rigorousness” of course depends on the use case or type of application /  environment in which qualified electronic registered delivery services are being applied. Dimensions that  could have an impact on the “strength/rigorousness” of applying the recommendations, are the criticality  of the processes and/or data being involved in the business process which is being supported by the  respective qualified trust service.  This, every organization has to determine for itself based on a risk  assessment.  For inspiration possible mapping of basic/recommended/enhanced vs business criticality  and/or data protection is being given in Annex B.  In short the three levels of recommendations are in increasing order (whereby the higher level suppose  that the lower level is also taken into account):  BASIC for recommendations to be followed by entities or in processes dealing with normal  levels of criticality of data and therefor can live with a lower maturity in implementing  trust services (technology).  RECOMMENDED for recommendations to be followed by entities or in processes dealing with  important business data and therefor need to be able to rely on a medium to higher  maturity of implementation of trust services (technology).  ENHANCED for recommendations to be followed by entities or in processes dealing with data of  sensitive/high level of criticality and therefor need to be able to rely on a (very) high  maturity of implementation of trust services (technology).  BASIC  Citizens  Be users of a qualified electronic signature or seal, which is often the entry condition to qualified  electronic registered delivery services (hereafter QeRDS).  Look for the EU trust mark for qualified trust services when selecting providers.  Make sure to archive your messages in an appropriate way (a single hard disk is far more likely to crash  than your letter folder to get lost or burned.  Public administration / Business entity  Understand the opportunities; assess which of your current messaging can benefit from the  advantages of QeRDS.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  25  Use QeRDS for key communication partner in a pilot phase before deploying it for all communication  partners. Note, however, that it is easier to convince key players than multiple citizens that only rarely  exchange messages with the administration.  Use existing or upcoming qualified QeRDS providers that can easily be introduced to your  communication partners.  Use, whenever possible, operational or ready to start QeRDS service provider(s) that your  communication partner uses for other purposes too, rather than choosing silo solution.  Do not charge for the QeRDS, rather for the service based on the shared message.  Involve the operation staff in changing the delivery procedures.  RECOMMENDED  Citizens  Privilege qualified QeRDS providers that allow combining several QeRDS (communication with several  administrations, with banks, shops) and maybe other services such as archiving, internet service  providers).  Organise your QeRDS messages with the same, if not with more care than your paper bills, product  guarantees, banking sheets, medical advice, insurance papers, etc.).  Read the applicable terms and conditions, in particular clauses on your responsibility in maintaining  the security of your credential or access to the service.  Public administration / Business entity  Correctly define message format and foster integration in the backend systems. There is little benefit  for the administration when introducing QeRDS for tax declaration, if the electronically delivered  document still needs to be encoded manually in a backend system.  Use open standard and open services whenever the message volume and the cost saving are high  enough to finance more than a single service provider to allow fair competition among service  provides in the interest of the quality of service offered to your communication partners.  Build your QeRDS introduction project upon an assessment of risks to be avoided, opportunities and  cost saving, estimation of implementation and operational costs, and quantified return on investment.  Do not underestimate operational costs to operate QeRDS and traditional delivery at the same time,  nor setup costs to train staff and change operational procedures  Allow sufficient time to your communication partner to migrate to QeRDS before saving the cost of  maintaining traditional messaging systems.  Identify key implementation issues.  Communicate on your project and during your project with the interested parties, in particular the  qualified QeRDS providers and the communication partners.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  26  ENHANCED  Citizens  Make sure that you can continuously, even in case of an ICT issue or loss of your primary credentials,  connect and process your QeRDS messages.  Public administration / Business entity  Consult with other public administration to create the critical mass for a QeRDS.  Align your QeRDS introduction strategy with the national strategic for lean administration.  Produce a strategic roadmap for migrating communication, primarily non-electronic communication to  QeRDS. Prioritise key applications, but do not ignore quick wins to gain credibility among your  stakeholders.  Plan your budget as QeRDS is a substantial investment that does not only change an ICT system, but  also your administrative processes and the way you expect your communication partners to behave.  Be prepared that easier communication may trigger more activities for the administration. If a  complaint to policy can be made via QeRDS, more people will make complaints than if a victim has to  go physically to an office and spend some time waiting for his/her complaint to be accepted. This,  however, is a general remark applying to easy access to administration; independently whether it is  open via a QeRDS or a dedicated Web portal.  To introduce QeRDS in A2B, negotiate private public partnership to finance the migration towards this  new technology.  Use key performance indicators to measure the benefits of QeRDS and the reach of the predicted  return on investment.  Consider openness for communication partners using unusual setups, such as eID cards from other EU  member states, etc.  Privileged compatibility with commercial products.  Select standards for the message format with great care (e.g. xml format for structured data). Publish  your message format in due time to all communication partners, so that they can adapt their backend  systems.

Qualified electronic registered delivery – example of tools & practical  usage aspects  Implementing qualified electronic registered delivery services (user perspective)  The user experience and tools for using qualified electronic registered delivery services is pretty dependent  of the end-user application and interface provided by the related qualified trust service provider.  Relevant standards regarding qualified electronic registered delivery services  (expert perspective)  ETSI Technical Committee Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI)  ETSI EN 102 640 is multi-part deliverable covering Registered Electronic Mail (REM), as identified below:   Part 1: \"Architecture\";   Part 2: \"Data requirements, Formats and Signatures for REM\";   Part 3: \"Information Security Policy Requirements for REM Management Domains\";   Part 4: \"REM-MD Conformance Profiles\";   Part 5: \"REM-MD Interoperability Profiles\";   Part 6: \"Interoperability Profiles\":  o Sub-part 1: \"REM-MD UPU PReM Interoperability Profile\";  o Sub-part 2: \"REM-MD BUSDOX Interoperability Profile\";  o Sub-part 3: \"REM-MD SOAP Binding Profile\".  The Universal Postal Union (UPU)  The UPU has developed some standards regarding interoperability aspects, the registered electronic mail,  in collaboration with CEN11.  S33 Interoperability framework for postal public key infrastructure:  “The objective of this standard is to create a common Postal Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to  provide global certification and security services aimed at globally binding the identity of  individuals and organisations with their public key. The framework itself and its first four elements  (PKI structure, cryptographic algorithms, data formats and data dissemination protocols) are  included.”  S52 Functional specification for postal registered electronic mail (PReM):  “This standard defines the functional specification of a secure electronic postal service, referred to  as the postal registered electronic mail or PReM service. PReM provides a trusted and certified  electronic mail exchange between mailer, designated operators and addressee/mailee. In addition,  evidence of corresponding events and operations within the scope of PReM will be generated and  archived for future attestation.”  11 http://www.upu.int/uploads/tx_sbdownloader/20160209_Catalogue-of-UPU-standards.pdf  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  28  Annex A: Glossary  eIDAS – What is it?  eIDAS is the acronym used to refer to Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 on electronic identification (eID) and  trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market. The eIDAS Regulation is about trust,  seamless user experience and convenience in online cross-border transactions.  Electronic seal  An electronic seal is a piece of data in electronic form, created by a legal person, which is attached to or  logically associated with an electronic document (or data) to ensure its origin and integrity.  It is similar in the paper world to the dry seal of a company on a piece of paper to indicate that the  document originates from the company and make it authentic and official.  Message  An information or document sent to a receiver.  Hash value (of a file)  A hash value is a standardised and unique summary of a message, which is obtained by applying a specific  cryptographic tool called a cryptographic hash function.  A hash function is any function that can be used to map digital data of arbitrary size to digital data of fixed  size, with slight differences in input data producing very big differences in output data.  A cryptographic hash function is a hash function which has specific security properties:   It is considered practically impossible to recreate the input message from its hash value;   It is considered practically impossible to compute from a specific message a second message that  has the same hash value (i.e. different messages lead to different has values);   It is considered practically impossible to find two different messages that would lead to the same  hash value (no collisions)  With such properties, when applied to the same message repetitively the hash value is always the same,  while if the message is slightly modified (even by one single bit) the hash value will always be different.  That allows to verify the integrity of a message compared to the message on which the hash was  previously computed; when the hash values are identical, then the messages are identical.  As cryptographic hash values represent large amounts of data as much smaller numeric values, they are  often used with digital signatures. Signing a hash value is more efficient than signing the larger value.  Trusted list  A trusted list is a list including information related to the qualified trust service providers which are  established in and supervised by an EU Member State, together with information related to the qualified  trust services provided by them, in accordance with the relevant provisions laid down in Regulation (EU)  No 910/2014. Those lists have constitutive value and are primary source of information to validate that a  qualified status is or has been granted to a QTSP and to the QTS it provides.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  29  Trusted lists are essential elements in building trust among electronic market operators by allowing users  to determine the qualified status and the status history of trust service providers and their services.  Member States may include in the trusted lists information on non-qualified trust service providers,  together with information related to the non-qualified trust services provided by them. It shall be clearly  indicated that they are not qualified according to Regulation (EU) No 910/2014.  Member States may include in the trusted lists information on nationally defined trust services of other  types than those defined under Article 3(16) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014. It shall be clearly indicated  that they are not qualified according to Regulation (EU) No 910/2014.  QTSP/QTS requirements and obligations  The eIDAS Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 foresees a set of requirements and obligations for qualified trust  service providers (QTSP) and qualified trust services (QTS) they provide in order to ensure high-level  security of the qualified trust services. Those obligations include in a nutshell:   Processing of personal data shall be carried out in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC.   Trust service provider (TSP) is liable for damage caused intentionally or negligently to any natural or  legal person due to a failure to comply with the obligations under this Regulation, while the intention  or negligence of a QTSP shall be presumed, unless proven otherwise by QTS. When TSP informed  customer in advance on limitations on the use of their services, and when such limitations are  recognisable to third parties, TSP is not liable when limitations have been exceeded.   Where feasible, services must be accessible for person with disabilities.   Implementing appropriate technical and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the  security of the trust services they provide. Having regard to the latest technological developments,  those measures shall ensure that the level of security is commensurate to the degree of risk. Measures  shall be taken to prevent and minimize the impact of security incidents and inform stakeholders of the  adverse effects of any such incidents.   Very strict rules regarding the obligation of notifying security & personal data breaches.   Additional requirements on QTSP operations and practices:  o Inform SB of any change in QTS provisioning and of intention to cease;  o Up-to-date termination plan, agreed with the competent supervisory body (SB), to ensure  continuity of service;  o Requirements on employed staff and subcontractors, when used;  o Sufficient financial resources and/or liability insurance, in accordance with national law;  o Consumer information on terms and conditions, incl. on limitations on use;  o Use of trustworthy systems and products ensuring the technical security and reliability of the  supported processes;  o Use of trustworthy systems to store (personal) data in a verifiable form;  o Take appropriate measures against forgery and theft of data; and  o Record and keep accessible activities related data, issued and received, even after cessation of  activities.   Specific requirements from the provisions laid down in the eIDAS Regulation with regards to the  provision of a specific type of qualified trust service.  All those requirements must be met by the QTSP/QTS before issuing the very first qualified trust service  output, i.e. before issuing the very first qualified time stamp in the case of QTSP providing qualified time  stamping services.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  30  Once granted a qualified status, the eIDAS Regulation also foresees an active supervision scheme of  qualified trust service providers (QTSP) and qualified trust services (QTS) they provide by the national  competent supervisory body (SB) to monitor fulfilment of the QTSP/QTS requirements and obligations  throughout their lifetime.  Trust services defined by the eIDAS Regulation  In its Art.3.16, the eIDAS Regulation defines a ‘trust service’ as an electronic service normally provided for  remuneration which consists of:  (a) the creation, verification, and validation of electronic signatures, electronic seals or electronic time  stamps, electronic registered delivery services and certificates related to those services, or  (b) the creation, verification and validation of certificates for website authentication; or  (c) the preservation of electronic signatures, seals or certificates related to those services.  Qualified trust services defined by the eIDAS Regulation  Only those trust services listed in Art.3.16 of the eIDAS Regulation for which there are applicable  requirements in the Regulation can benefit from the qualified status. eIDAS regulates the following nine  qualified trust services:  1. The provision of qualified certificates for electronic signatures  Certificates for electronic signature are electronic attestations which link electronic signature  validation data to a natural person and confirm at least the name or the pseudonym of that  person. Since 1 July 2016, an electronic signature can only be used by a natural person to sign, i.e.  mainly to express consent on the signed data/document. This represents a significant difference  from the eSignature Directive 1999/93/EC regime where an electronic signature, which could be  used by legal persons, was defined as a means of authentication. Under the eIDAS Regulation, the  entity who creates an electronic signature (the so called signatory) will be a natural person.  Therefore, certificates for electronic signature cannot be issued to legal persons anymore. Instead  legal persons can use certificates for electronic seals (see below).  A qualified electronic certificate for electronic signatures is an essential element for a signatory to  create qualified electronic signatures that shall have the equivalent legal effect of a handwritten  signature all over the EU.  2. The provision of qualified certificates for electronic seals  As explained above, since 1 July 2016, legal persons cannot create legally valid (qualified)  electronic signatures anymore and cannot be issued (qualified) certificates for electronic  signatures. Instead legal persons can use certificates for electronic seals, which are electronic  attestations that link electronic seal validation data to a legal person and confirm the name of that  person. The aim of an electronic seal is not to sign but to serve as an evidence that an electronic  data/document was issued by a legal person, ensuring certainty of the data/document’s origin and  integrity.  A qualified electronic certificate for electronic seals is an essential element for a legal person to  create qualified electronic seals that shall enjoy, all over the EU, the presumption of integrity of  the data and of correctness of the origin of that data to which the qualified electronic seal is  linked.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  31  3. The provision of qualified certificates for website authentication  Certificates for website authentication are issued to ensure the users (in particular citizens and  SMEs) that behind the website there is a legal or natural person identifiable by trustworthy  information.  The Regulation sets clear requirements for qualified website authentication certificates to be  considered trustworthy together with obligations for qualified trust service providers of such  qualified certificates with regard to the security of their operations, their liability and their  supervision regime. As a consequence, the Regulation ensures transparency regarding the quality  of the service offered to users, accountability of providers with regard to security of their services,  trustworthiness of the data associated to qualified authenticated websites and technological  neutrality of services and solutions.  4. Qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures  Such a qualified trust service aims to ensure the long-term preservation of information, in order to  ensure the legal validity and trustworthiness of qualified electronic signatures over extended  periods of time and guarantee that they can be validated irrespective of future technological  changes.  5. Qualified preservation service for qualified electronic seals  Such a qualified trust service aims to ensure the long-term preservation of information, in order to  ensure the legal validity and trustworthiness of qualified electronic seals over extended periods of  time and guarantee that they can be validated irrespective of future technological changes.  6. Qualified validation service for qualified electronic signatures  Validation of electronic signature is an ancillary service to electronic signatures whose process  aims to confirm the validity of an electronic signature.  Qualified validation services for qualified electronic signatures entail the verification by a qualified  trust service provider that the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation are met by a qualified  electronic signature in order to confirm its validity.  7. Qualified validation service for qualified electronic seals  Validation of electronic seal is an ancillary service to electronic seals whose process aims to  confirm the validity of an electronic seal.  Qualified validation services for qualified electronic seals entail the verification by a qualified trust  service provider that the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation are met by a qualified electronic  seal in order to confirm its validity.  8. Qualified electronic time stamps services  Electronic time stamps are issued to ensure the correctness of the time linked to data/documents.  Qualified electronic time stamp shall enjoy, all over the EU, the presumption of the accuracy of the  date and the time it indicates and the integrity of the data to which the date and time are bound.  9. Qualified electronic registered delivery services  By relying on a qualified electronic registered delivery service, one will benefit, all over the EU,  from the presumption of the integrity of the registered data, the sending of that data by the  identified sender, its receipt by the identified addressee and the accuracy of the date and time of  sending and receipt indicated by that qualified trust service.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  32  The Regulation sets clear requirements for all such qualified trust services to be considered trustworthy  together with obligations for their qualified trust service providers with regard to the security of their  operations, their liability and their supervision regime.

However, and depending  on the concrete environment the use case is applied in, the “strength/rigorousness” with which the  recommendations should be applied might be less or more severe.  Dimensions that could have an impact  on the “strength/rigorousness” of applying the recommendations, are the criticality of the processes  and/or data being involved in the business process which is being supported by the respective qualified  trust service. So, without intending to be complete as a risk assessment depends of the concrete  environment/context in which the organization is operating, some dimensions which might be considered  to determine the risk-profile of the process and/or data being protected (and therefor the minimum  “strength/rigorousness” to apply) are:   Business critical data & processes:  organizations store or process information that can have a less  or more significant impact on their own organization and/or their partners and/or their clients.  Examples of potential risks are e.g. loss of integrity of a database, compromise of business- confidential data, incorrect contracting-data, etc.   Data & processes with potential financial impact:  organization (especially but not only financial  industry related organizations) have several processes which might have direct financial impact for  themselves, for their partners and/or their clients ranging from amounts e.g. below a thousand  euros to amounts going into millions of euros. Examples of potential risks are e.g.: faulty validation  of signatures on mandates or payment instructions, rogue / criminal impersonation of third party  providers, hacking of personnel or corporate accounts, false invoices, etc.   Personal data (processing):  Personal data is clearly a very complex and high risk matter. The  scope of personal data is very broad, ranging from less delicate personal data, to directly  identifiable information to sensitive personal data. The more sensitive the data the stronger and  more rigorous one should apply the recommendations. Examples of potential risks are:  fines of up  to 4% of the global annual revenues of a company, embarrassment due to faulty access personal  information, unauthorized access/manipulation to e.g. biometric data, responding to a request- for-info based on an incorrect signed request, health data getting exposed / delivered incorrectly,  authenticity/integrity of critical health records being non-verifiable, etc.  Note:  We stress that the above are just examples of possible areas to consider to assess the risk-profile of  the process and/or data being protected. Depending on the reader’s environment other dimensions might  apply depending on regulation, corporate policies, contractual obligations, etc.  Determining applicable criticality-levels and derive resulting minimum applicable  recommendations  Following the above, it is proposed that organizations do their own analyses and following map their  processes / data-to-be-processed onto the following “criticality-levels”:   “Standard” would entail any usage of a trust service under normal circumstance like but not  limited to use cases e.g. involving financial exchange of a rather limited amount, personal records  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  35  with limited potential impact, or access to data/services of a limited classification level (e.g.  internal/restraint).   “Advanced” would entail any usage of a trust service in a context where more precautions /  prudence is to be advised like cases which involve financial exchange of a rather important  magnitude, personal records with rather important impact if going wrong, or access to  data/services of a higher classification level like company-confidential.   “Sensitive” would entail any usage of a trust service in a context where sensitive data is being  involved, e.g. involving financial exchanges of a significant amount, personal record access of  personal sensitive information, or access to data/services of a high classification level  like company-/commercial-secret.  Based on the above “criticality-levels”, one can easily see how the levels (Basic, Recommended, Enhanced)  can match to these levels:   Basic would entail the recommendations to-be-considered at the moment one is involved in a  (trans)action that involves data/services of a “standard” level of criticality.   Recommended would entail the recommendations to-be-considered at the moment one is  involved in a (trans)action that involves data/services of an “advanced” level of criticality.   Enhanced would be the recommendations to-be-considered at the moment one is involved in a  (trans)action that involves data/services of a “sensitive” level of criticality.

The complied a Q&A document is available from https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single- market/en/news/questions-answers-trust-services-under-eidas.  The Commission launched the eIDAS Observatory - an online collaborative platform for exchanging views  and positions, sharing ideas and good practices. It is a virtual community of stakeholders whose aim is to  build a common understanding of the issues relating to the implementation and uptake of the eIDAS  Regulation and to facilitate the use of cross-border electronic identification and trust services. You can join  the eIDAS Observatory and take part in the discussions.  D.2 How can I find a qualified trust service provider providing qualified electronic  registered delivery services?  You can find a qualified trust service provider providing qualified electronic registered delivery services by  looking:  - For the use of the EU trust mark for qualified trust services associated to the provision of qualified  electronic registered delivery services in the marketing material of envisaged providers;  - For EU MS national trusted list as they are available from the EC list of pointers to the EU MS  trusted lists (https://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/esignature/trusted-list/tl-mp.xml)  or by browsing the EU MS trusted lists from, e.g. http://tlbrowser.tsl.website. Trusted lists are  organised per TSP, and then per trust service. Look up for a service type identifying the provision  of qualified electronic registered delivery services (http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/Svctype/EDS/Q or  http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/Svctype/EDS/REM/Q) for which the current status is “granted”  (http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/TrustedList/Svcstatus/granted).  - For applicable terms and conditions, the policies and practices used by the QTSP to provide its  qualified electronic registered delivery services should be available from the “TSP information  URI” as part of the TSP information as listed in the relevant EU MS trusted list.  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/questions-answers-trust-services-under-eidas https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/questions-answers-trust-services-under-eidas http://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/eidas-observatory https://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/esignature/trusted-list/tl-mp.xml http://tlbrowser.tsl.website/ http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/Svctype/EDS/Q http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/Svctype/EDS/REM/Q http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/TrustedList/Svcstatus/granted  ENISA  European Union Agency for Network  and Information Security  Science and Technology Park of Crete (ITE)  Vassilika Vouton, 700 13, Heraklion, Greece  Athens Office  1 Vasilissis Sofias  Marousi 151 24, Athens, Greece  TP-06-16-353-EN-N  PO Box 1309, 710 01 Heraklion, Greece  Tel: +30 28 14 40 9710  info@enisa.europa.eu  www.enisa.europa.eu  ISBN: 978-92-9204-214-1  DOI: 10.2824/985945",

It defines trust services for supporting  electronic signatures, electronic seals, electronic time stamps, electronic registered delivery services and  website authentication.  The eIDAS Regulation represented a big step forward in building a digital single market as it provides one  common legal framework for all parties relying or providing on those kinds of services. Indeed, various  sectors of the economy (e.g. finance, banking, transport, insurance, health, sharing economy, trading, etc.)  where obligations exist for security, reliable identification, strong authentication, legal certainty of  evidences, will clearly be positively affected by the eIDAS Regulation. This latter will indeed allow citizens,  businesses and public administrations to meet such obligations for any (cross-border) electronic  transaction as they will now be able to use the recognised eID means and (qualified) trust services. In  particular, data sent and received using a qualified electronic registered delivery service shall enjoy the  presumption of the integrity of the data, the sending of that data by the identified sender, its receipt by  the identified addressee and the accuracy of the date and time of sending and receipt indicated by the  qualified electronic registered delivery service.  This document addresses qualified electronic registered delivery services and is one out of a series of five  documents which aim to assist parties wishing to use qualified electronic signatures, seals, time stamps,  eDelivery or website authentication certificates to understand the subject correctly as-well-as the potential  benefits, amongst others, by giving examples of possible applications. This series of documents also aims  to give those parties some advice on how to correctly use the related qualified trust services.  After explaining what a qualified electronic registered delivery service is and what properties/function it  does and does not provide, the following concrete examples of use are given for inspiration to the readers:  • Enabling electronic registered mail;  • Supporting official submissions in eGovernment services;  • Accessing sensitive data;  • Exchanging (sensitive) data;  • Notarization of events.  Next to the above, and as even the most secure / trusted service becomes insecure and unreliable if not  being integrated or used correctly, some key recommendations are given for correct integration and use.  This is expressed in three levels for relying parties:  • Basic/Minimum recommended level of implementation to be followed by entities or in processes  dealing with normal levels of criticality of data and therefor can live with a lower maturity in  implementing trust services (technology).  • (Standard) Recommended level of implementation to be followed by entities or in processes  dealing with important business data and therefor need to be able to rely on a medium to higher  maturity of implementation of trust services (technology).  • Enhanced recommended level of implementation to be followed by entities or in processes dealing  with data of sensitive/high level of criticality and therefor need to be able to rely on a (very) high  maturity of implementation of trust services (technology).  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  07  1. Introduction  General context/the eIDAS regulation on eID and trust services  Regulation (EU) No 910/20141 (hereafter the eIDAS2 Regulation), on electronic identification and trust  services for electronic transactions in the internal market, provides a predictable regulatory environment  for electronic identification and a set of electronic trust services, namely electronic signatures, seals, time  stamps, registered delivery services and certificates for website authentication.  It is possible to use these trust services as well as electronic documents as evidence in legal proceedings in  all EU Member States contributing to their general cross- border use. Courts (or other bodies in charge of legal  proceedings) cannot discard them as evidence only because  they are electronic but have to assess these electronic tools  in the same way they would do for their paper equivalent.  Whether you are a large company, a SME or a citizen willing  to complete an electronic transaction in another EU country,  e.g. submit a call for tender or register as a student in  another EU Member State (MS), besides reducing time and  costs, the eIDAS Regulation will ensure cross-border  recognition of national eID and electronic trust services supporting your electronic transaction. Hence it  will boost trust, security and convenience.  Since 1 July 2016, most provisions of the eIDAS Regulation are directly applicable in the 28 EU Member  States’ legal framework overcoming problems of fragmented national regimes. It provides legal certainty  and fosters the usage of eID means and electronic trust services for online access and online transactions  at EU level.  The eIDAS Regulation will ensure that people and businesses can use their national eIDs to access public  services in other EU countries where eIDs are required for such an access at national level. It also creates  an EU wide internal market for electronic trust services by ensuring their recognition and workability  across borders and are considered equivalent to traditional paper based processes.  Opportunities brought by the eIDAS Regulation  The opportunities reside in leveraging eID and electronic trust services as key enablers for making national  and cross-border electronic transactions more secure, more convenient, trustworthy and benefiting from  legal certainty.  The broader adoption of EU-wide recognised eID means and of electronic trust services will facilitate and  boost the digital transformation of organisations, be it public administrations or businesses, enhance  customer experience, improve the security of electronic transactions and stimulate the provisioning of  new and innovative services.  1 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/ES/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG  2 See Glossary.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/ES/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  08  To this end, a large number of sectors (e.g. finance, banking, transport, insurance, health, sharing  economy, trading, etc.) where obligations exist for security, reliable identification, strong authentication,  legal certainty of evidences, will be positively affected. The eIDAS Regulation will indeed allow citizens,  businesses and public administrations to conveniently meet such obligations for any cross-border  electronic transaction using the recognised eID means and (qualified) trust services of their choice.  Without undergoing identity verification  based on physical presence, but by using  MS notified eID means of a level “high”,  one should for example be able to use  public services in another country or banks  may accept such eID to open a bank  account3. By relying on a qualified  electronic time stamp, one shall enjoy, all  over the EU, the presumption of the  accuracy of the date and the time it  indicates and the integrity of the data to  which the date and time are bound. By  relying on a qualified electronic registered  delivery service, one will benefit, all over  the EU, from the presumption of the  integrity of the registered data, the  sending of that data by the identified  sender, its receipt by the identified  addressee and the accuracy of the date  and time of sending and receipt indicated  by that qualified trust service.  Specific Role of the qualified trust services  To further enhance in particular the trust of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and consumers in  the internal market and to promote the use of trust services and products, the eIDAS Regulation  introduces the notions of qualified trust service and qualified trust service provider with a view to  indicating requirements and obligations that ensure high-level security of whatever qualified trust service  or product is used or provided and, as a consequence, are granted a higher presumption of their legal  effect.  Therefore, when looking for trust services, selecting qualified ones ensures benefiting from a high level of  security and legal certainty of trust services. E.g., qualified electronic time stamp shall enjoy, all over the  EU, the presumption of the accuracy of the date and the time it indicates and the integrity of the data to  which the date and time are bound.  Initiation and supervision of qualified trust services  In order to ensure high-level security of qualified trust services, the eIDAS Regulation foresees an active  supervision scheme of qualified trust service providers (QTSP) and qualified trust services (QTS) they  3 National legislations on prevention of money laundering may currently may force identity verification to be based  on physical presence. Furthermore, the use by the private sector of electronic identification means under a notified  scheme is on a voluntarily basis only (see Recital 17 of the eIDAS Regulation).  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  09  provide (hereafter referred to as a QTSP/QTS) by the national competent supervisory body (SB) that  supervises, ex ante and ex post, fulfilment of the QTSP/QTS requirements and obligations4.  All those requirements must be met by the QTSP/QTS before providing the very first qualified trust service  output, e.g. before issuing the very first qualified time stamp in the case of QTSP providing qualified time  stamping services.  Before a TSP/TS is granted a qualified status (QTSP/QTS), it will be subject to a pre-authorisation process –  the so-called initiation process. QTSPs may only begin to provide the qualified trust service after the  qualified status has been granted by the competent supervisory body and indicated in the national trusted  list5. From there, the supervision scheme covers the full life cycle of each QTS and each QTSP, from its  genesis until its termination.  In practice, where TSPs, without qualified status, intend to start providing qualified trust services, they  shall submit to the supervisory body a notification of their intention together with a conformity  assessment report issued by an “eIDAS” accredited conformity assessment body. Before notifying the  competent supervisory body of their intention to start providing qualified trust services, the future  QTSP/QTS must hence successfully pass an external assessment (audit) to confirm it fulfils the eIDAS  requirements. That audit must be conducted by a conformity assessment body specifically accredited to  carry out assessments of QTSP/QTS. The audit results in a formal conformity statement confirming - if such  is the case - that the QTSP/QTS meets all the applicable requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. Based on  the notified information including the report of such an audit, the competent SB will formally verify that  the candidate QTSP/QTS meets the applicable eIDAS requirements and, in case of positive verification, it  will undertake the publication of the grant of the qualified status for that QTSP/QTS in the national trusted  list.  It is only when its qualified status is published in the corresponding national trusted list that the QTSP/QTS  is authorised to provide the corresponding QTS.  Note: A TSP cannot be deemed as qualified without providing at least one type of a qualified trust  service (cfr Art.3.20 of the eIDAS Regulation). A TSP is granted a qualified status separately for each  type of qualified trust service covered by the eIDAS Regulation. E.g. a QTSP qualified for the  provisioning of qualified certificates for electronic signatures is not per se granted a qualified status  for the issuance of qualified time stamps; it must first complete the full pre-authorisation process and  have its granted qualified status for the provision of qualified time stamp published explicitly in the  national trusted list before issuing qualified time stamps in addition to the provision of qualified  certificates for electronic signatures. There are nine different types of QTSs defined by the eIDAS  Regulation for which a qualified status is granted separately: provision of qualified certificates for  electronic signatures, provision of qualified certificates for electronic seals, provision of qualified  certificates for website authentication, qualified preservation service for qualified electronic  signatures, qualified preservation service for qualified electronic seals, qualified validation service for  qualified electronic signatures, qualified validation service for qualified electronic seals, qualified  electronic time stamps services, and qualified electronic registered delivery services.6  4 See glossary  5 See glossary.  6 See Annex A.7 for further details.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  10  For marketing purposes, once qualified, a QTSP/QTS may use the EU Trust Mark for qualified trust services  when promoting its QTS. That trust mark shown in Figure 1 can only be used by a QTSP to “label” its QTS. It  can be used on any support provided it meets requirements from Art.23 of the eIDAS Regulation (e.g. a link  to the corresponding national trusted list where consumers may verify the granted qualified status must  be displayed on the QTSP’s website) and rules of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/806.7  Basically, this secondary legislation sets the form, colour and size of the EU trust mark, sets the obligation  to clearly indicate the qualified services that the EU trust mark pertains to, and allows association with  other graphical or textual elements provided that certain conditions are met. 8  Figure 1: EU trust mark for qualified trust services  The use of the EU trust mark, which is voluntary, aims to foster transparency of the market and help  consumers distinguishing between qualified trust services and non-qualified ones.  Once granted a qualified status, QTSPs and their QTSs have the obligation to pass, and submit the  competent supervisory body with a two-yearly conformity assessment report (CAR) issued by an  accredited CAB confirming that the QTSP and the QTSs it provides fulfil the requirements laid down in the  Regulation. Competent supervisory bodies are also allowed, at their own discretion and at any time, to  audit themselves any QTSP/QTS for which they are competent or to request an accredited CAB to perform  an ad hoc audit.  QTSPs and their QTSs are supervised for their entire lifecycle, from their genesis to their termination. In  particular, in order to ensure sustainability and durability of QTSs, as well as to ensure proper termination  and user’s confidence in their provision, QTSPs must maintain, at all times, an up-to-date termination plan.  That plan is to be agreed by the SB upon initiation and regularly checked for compliance during the life of  the QTSP/QTS.  A focus on qualified electronic registered delivery services  The eIDAS Regulation establishes the principle that an electronic document should not be denied legal  effect on the grounds that it is in an electronic form.  This regulation also defines an electronic registered delivery service, hereafter called eDelivery service, as  “a service that makes it possible to transmit data between third parties by electronic means and provides  evidence relating to the handling of the transmitted data, including proof of sending and receiving the  7 Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/806 of 22 May 2015 laying down specifications relating to the form  of the EU trust mark for qualified trust services (Text with EEA relevance).

In practice the data referred to by that definition as being transmitted under such an eDelivery service  from a sender to a receiver can be of any type, including electronic documents (initially created in  electronic form or dematerialised documents), structured or not. The transmission means can be of any  kind as well including but not limited to the well-known email system.  By relying on a qualified electronic registered delivery service, one will benefit, all over the EU, from the  presumption of the integrity of the registered data, the sending of that data by the identified sender, its  receipt by the identified addressee and the accuracy of the date and time of sending and receipt indicated  by that qualified trust service.  Scope of the present document and relationship with the other recommendations  This document proposes security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered  delivery services. It aims to support relying parties and end users of qualified electronic registered delivery  services to securely use these services.  The target audience of the document are end users and relying parties of qualified electronic registered  delivery services. This could comprise individuals, businesses and public administrations. For example, it  could be a public administration that wishes to formalize electronic interactions with citizens to benefit  from the legal guarantees provided by such qualified trust services, and which would like to ensure it is  utilizing these services:   In compliance with the eIDAS Regulation.   In a proper and secure manner that guarantees that the security properties of the service are  being maintained.  The present document is organised to provide information and guidance with regards to the following  aspects of qualified electronic registered delivery services:   What is it?   What key properties it provides?   What properties can it not provide?   What are the potential use cases?   What are the usage best practices?   Example of tools & practical usage aspects.  Four other linked documents propose security guidelines on the appropriate use respectively of qualified  electronic signatures, qualified electronic seals, qualified electronic time stamps and qualified website  authentication certificates.9  Although each of these qualified trust services share some technical backgrounds or tools and thus provide  some common functionalities, such as illustrated below, each of them has its own objectives and core  functionalities as summarised in the following table:  9 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services/qualified-trust-services.

Qualified electronic registered delivery – what is it?  Electronic registered delivery service  The eIDAS Regulation establishes the principle that an electronic document should not be denied legal  effect on the grounds that it is in electronic form.  This regulation also defines an electronic registered delivery service, hereafter called eDelivery service, as  “a service that makes it possible to transmit data between third parties by electronic means and provides  evidence relating to the handling of the transmitted data, including proof of sending and receiving the  data, and that protects transmitted data against the risk of loss, theft, damage or any unauthorised  alterations” (Art.3.36).  In practice the data referred to by that definition as being transmitted under such an eDelivery service  from a sender to a receiver can be of any type, including electronic documents (initially created in  electronic form or dematerialised documents), structured or not. The transmission means can be of any  kind as well including but not limited to email.  Usually the data referred to by the definition as being transmitted under such an eDelivery service from a  sender to a receiver is generally called a message.  eDelivery can be used by all kinds of entities willing to share electronic documents securely, such as public  administrations, business organisations, and citizens. The following figure illustrates the different types of  message transfers that can benefit from eDelivery: Administration to Administration (A2A), Administration  to Business… Customer to Customer (C2C).  Qualified electronic registered delivery service  Qualified eDelivery service means an electronic registered delivery service which:   is provided by qualified trust service providers, i.e. organisations under national supervision and  whose compliance with requirements is regularly checked by an  accredited, trusted entity, the so-called conformity assessment  body;   ensures a high level of confidence with regards to the  identification of the sender;   ensures the identification of the addressee before the delivery;   protects the sending and receiving of data by using an advanced  electronic signature or seal of a qualified trust service provider in  such a manner as to detect all data alteration;   protects the date and time of sending and of receiving by using qualified electronic time stamps;   conforms to other potential standards considered relevant by the Commission.

Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  15  3. Qualified electronic registered delivery – what key properties does  it  provide?  Legal Properties  Data sent and received using a qualified electronic registered delivery service shall enjoy the presumption  of the integrity of the data, the sending of that data by the identified sender, its receipt by the identified  addressee and the accuracy of the date and time of sending and of the date and time of receipt, indicated  by the qualified electronic registered delivery service.  Data in this context can equally refer to email, other messages, or structured attachments, depending on  the general conditions of the service provider.  Hence, qualified electronic registered delivery provides the sender with a legal proof that he/she has sent  a given data at a given time to a given receiver and that this receiver has accepted the message at a given  time.  Proof of delivery  The sender receives an unforgeable time stamped proof of when he/she has delivered a given message to  a receiver, independently on the receivers’ ability to receive it. The currently used receipt for paper based  registered mail contains a handwritten address, a date and a signature by a postal officer, which in general  is not that difficult to fake.  Proof of reception  Both the sender and the recipient receive an unforgeable time stamped proof of when the receiver  received or opened the electronic message.  Proof of integrity  Both the sender and the receiver can be sure that the message has not been changed during transmission.  Protection against the risk of loss, theft, damage or any unauthorised alterations  Qualified and non-qualified electronic registered delivery are services that are legally defined as ensuring  the protection of the transmitted data against the risk of loss, theft, damage or any unauthorised  alterations.  Security properties  Sender identification  The receivers know for sure who sends the data to them. Current email and current registered mail has no  such proof as anybody can write any sender address on an email or a registered mail.  Secure time stamping  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  16  All time indications, i.e. the date and time of sending, receiving and any change of the transmitted data,  are protected by a qualified electronic time stamp. Such reliable time sources provide legal presumption of  the accuracy of the date and time of the time stamped data as well as the integrity of that data.  Confidentiality  Both the sender and the receiver can be sure that the message cannot be accessed by unauthorised  persons during the transmission.  Content (data) integrity  A traditional postal service can never guarantee which message was in the envelope of a registered mail.  This opens the door for conflict where the receiver claims to have received a different document than the  one the sender claims to have sent. Qualified electronic registered delivery services ensures the integrity  of the transmitted data, i.e. of the content of the message.  Control on routing errors  With current email, the sender may accidently type the wrong email address. Qualified electronic  registered delivery procedures typically help the user to check different parameters of the receiver before  processing to the transmission.  When sending a letter to a non-existent address, the mistake is found out only when the parcel comes  back. Qualified electronic registered delivery service provider should inform you about the ability of the  receiver to accept the message before you transmit it.  Interoperability  A useful concept of qualified electronic registered delivery services is to indicate to the sender all formats  of messages that the intended receiver can process. Sometimes, the service provider can check and accept  only messages explicitly accepted by the receiver. Qualified electronic registered delivery service providers  can also propose additional services consisting in transforming a message from one format to another, e.g.  from Word to PDF, if there is no confidentiality rule avoiding them to get access to the message.  Functional properties  Sending of large files  Most qualified electronic registered delivery services allow large messages and messages of all kinds of  formats to be transmitted. Currently used systems for transmitting large files are not always accepted by  the receiver, as they do not have a certified trust level.  Fast processing  Qualified electronic registered delivery services is instantaneous, e. g., much faster than paper based mail.  Other properties  Reduced risk  During message transmission via insecure current transmission channels, such as email, there is no  guarantee on delivery, no assured confirmation of receipt, no proof that the received message is the same  as the sent one, and little assurance on the confidentiality of the message. Qualified electronic registered  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  17  delivery makes it infeasible to manipulate data, to forge time stamps of sending or receiving, or to provide  unauthorised access to the message.  All trust services that are used in qualified electronic registered delivery are provided by trusted service  providers, which are regularly checked for having put in place the security measures required to avoid  security risks for their customers.  Reduced cost  Qualified electronic registered delivery mainly avoids the logistical costs of delivering printed electronic  documents or documents stored on some support such as a CD. Moreover, it reduces the cost of encoding  information received on paper or of uploading files from the received support to the ICT system.  Qualified electronic registered delivery also reduces the cost of transmission failure or uncertainty  inherent to insecure electronic messaging.  No transmission delays  As electronic transmission is virtually instantaneous, communication partners do not waste time when  sharing documents. Similarly, as for parcels, the receiver of large message is informed once a message has  been send to him and where he can download or process it.  No double sending  A common business practice today is to send information electronically for fast processing, and to send a  signed paper version in addition in parallel for legal purposes. Using a qualified electronic registered  delivery service instead of an unsecured messaging system such as email will make the additional sending  of a signed paper version obsolete.  Incident handling and liabilities  In case of security incidents on data delivery, a qualified electronic registered delivery service provider  must handle it properly and inform his/her supervisory body, who has to assess, whether the qualification  status has to be withdrawn or not. Thus, customers will be informed independently and transparently in  case of security issue related to the service on which they rely. The qualified trust service provider,  nevertheless, remains liable for damage that was made to its customer by his/her negligence or omission.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  18  4. Qualified electronic registered delivery – what cannot be provided?  Personal repository  (Qualified) electronic registered delivery is not about uploading documents to a central store so that they  are available for processing or downloading by other partners wherever they like. It may use a secure  repository to temporarily store the message once the sender sends it, until the receiver has accepted it.  Back-end processing  (Qualified) electronic registered delivery is not about ensuring that back-end processing systems get  connected to better share information. It does however, provide a message communication channel to  send and receive messages between backend processors. Back-end processors can only process messages  of a very specific format, e.g. Excel accepts the formats *.xls, and *.csv, but no scanned image of a table.  That is why the format of messages for backend processing has to be specified, but such specification is  often out of scope of a pure electronic registered delivery project. Electronic registered delivery  technology deals with all kinds of payload, i.e., all kind of message formats, and the communication  partners have to agree which message they send over the (qualified) electronic registered delivery  infrastructure.  Archiving  (Qualified) electronic registered delivery is not about archiving the transmitted message, nor the proof of  sending or receiving it. However, such additional services can be provided as an additional service either  from the (qualified) electronic registered delivery service provider or by a third party.  Boosting your activity  Your messaging partner will not send more messages just because a new message channel is made  available. (Qualified) electronic registered delivery is mainly a less expensive and less risky message  transmission technology; but it is not a generator of more messages. Nevertheless, if messaging is less  expensive, this may increase the motivation to communicate.  Faster treatment of messages  A fast messaging transmission system does not guarantee a fast message processing system. The speed at  which messages are processed depends on the abilities of the receiver to process the request and on the  quality of the integration of (qualified) electronic registered delivery in back-end systems. If the receiver  does not have the time to read your message once it is available, you cannot force him, just as the postal  service cannot force someone to later pick up a registered letter that could not be delivered because  nobody was at home.

Qualified electronic registered delivery – what are the potential use  cases?  Overview and context of the given examples  In general, and to put (qualified) electronic registered delivery services into context, they are most often  seen coming in addition to other identification and/or trust services as part of a wider solution. Although  they allow exchanging data between parties in a legally certain way, communicating parties will have to be  authenticated before being allowed to access the service and in some case the messages may be required  to electronically signed, sealed and/or notarized (e.g. for longer term preservation).  In this context, and although the properties of qualified electronic registered delivery services have been  described in the previous sections, the following properties are key for the use case examples mentioned  below:   Qualified electronic registered delivery services provide the parties involved with a vehicle via which  they can obtain “guaranteed delivery” of their data to the other party.   Optionally such services can amongst others be extended with longer term notarisation services to  preserve legal evidence of the transaction having taken place.  These properties allow several “types of use cases” which can be applied in many areas of application as  show in the present section. The table below highlights the identified types of use cases. The mapping on  areas of applications in no way tries to be exhaustive but only tries to indicate the huge potential of  qualified electronic registered delivery services.

If the service provider for such electronic registered e-mail is a qualified electronic registered  delivery service provider, the users can trust the security properties of the offered qualified trust service  and use the provided evidences in any legal proceedings. Where today there is a lot of exchanges of  (optionally signed) messages, parties at current have no way of knowing with (legal) certainty whether  their message has arrived and may not receive any formal proof of delivery. Qualified electronic registered  delivery services have the ability to change that.  Figure 2: Electronic registered mail delivery service  Examples of concrete application are:   C2C/B2B: Replacement of registered postal mail by qualified electronic registered delivery services.   C2G/G2C: Delivery of official notifications (e.g. in context of Court proceedings).  Supporting official submissions in eGovernment services  Citizens/Companies have multiple possibilities to ask for public subsidies. In most cases, signed documents  are used to apply for such help.  Upon receipt, the administration encodes the data, sends back a  confirmation of receipt, then validates the request and sends back the final decision. In general, citizens fill  in the request on their PC, but still print it and send it by ordinary (or registered) post. Public  administration can spare encoding time and several processing steps, including generating a confirmation  of receipt, should this service be offered by means of a qualified electronic registered delivery service.  Faster processing can motivate citizens to use such a qualified trust service rather than sending printed  forms. The overall advantages are less paper, no delay on transmission, simplified and automated  processing at the administration, and avoidance of manual encoding of electronic forms if predefined  message types are used.  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102600_102699/10264001/02.01.01_60/ts_10264001v020101p.pdf  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102600_102699/10264001/02.01.01_60/ts_10264001v020101p.pdf  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  21  Figure 3: Submission in e-Government services  Examples of concrete application are:   C2G: Citizens submitting a request for parental leave, for social security benefits, etc.   B2G: Companies requesting subsidies, filing a periodic report, etc.  Accessing sensitive data  In many cases certain parties need to get access to sensitive information and be very sure they receive the  right information/response to their request. ePrescription is such a case. Today, in most cases, patients  bring their prescription to the pharmacist. In case the prescribed medicine is unavailable, they have to  contact the doctor to obtain clarifications or authorization of alternative medicine. In all cases, they  encode the sold product before establishing a bill addressed both to the patient and to the health  insurances. A qualified electronic registered delivery service would allow the doctor to send the  prescription in electronic form to the pharmacist chosen by the patient (and at the same time report this  prescription to the competent administration).  This could also be applied cross border where a person  needs to get a prescription and a local pharmacist needs to be able to request the right prescription from  the person’s doctor.  Figure 4: Accessing medical data example  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  22  Examples of concrete application are:   A2C: ePrescription allowing the exchange of and access to the correct prescription by involved parties.   B2G: Business being able to request formally/officially from government to receive certain  attestations/official documents (and to get proof of receipt of the request/handling of their request).   A2G: Attorneys having to deposit or access court-case files which should for obvious reasons only be  exchanged in a secured manner.  Exchanging (sensitive) data  In many cases information needs to be exchanged in the context of a (longer term running) process. Data  may need to be exchanged between social security administrations to handle a pension file or to handle  child benefits (cross border). In an electronic procurement process the sequence of events and the exact  moment of exchange of data needs to be established.  Qualified electronic registered delivery services can  not only be used in context of just a single exchange of informative (send/confirm receipt) but can also be  used to ensure that a process is fully automated and the right process-controls are being put in place  whereby guaranteed/confirmed and legally valid delivery of messages and documents can be very  valuable. Examples of use include the use of qualified electronic registered delivery systems in the way  enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems operate in large companies. Multiple messages, such as those  regarding price negotiations, trading transactions, order management, inventory management,  transportation, and capacity management have to be securely transmitted between buyers and vendors.  Examples of concrete applications are:   G2G: Exchange of social security information (nationally or cross border) such as pension file info, tax  information, or child benefit information.   B2G: Exchange of data in context of import/export and customs handling (including handling of  permits) or the handling of eProcurement/eInvoicing.   B2B: Exchange of information in context of just in time production with contractors and suppliers.   A2A: Exchange of health files between parties treating the patient and the administration involved in  paying the social security covered expenses.  Notarization of events  Today, in many countries, organisations need to send information to regulators, such as annual reports,  activity reports, risk assessment and risk registers, or audit reports. Often, these reports are sent in paper  form via registered postal mail, or sometimes are physically delivered to make sure that deadlines are  kept. To avoid scanning of such paper-based reports, the regulators often ask for an electronic version on  an annexed CD.  Faster and more reliable deliveries can be achieved when using qualified electronic  registered delivery services whereby the receiving authority can upon receipt notarize the receipt and  return a confirmation of that receipt. In addition, there could also be situations whereby a third party acts  as go-between to handle the electronic delivery as a neutral third party instead of the receiving party  handling the notarization.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  23  Figure 5: Notarizing events example  Examples of concrete application are:   B2G: Submission of audit reports and financial statement to financial supervisors or submission of  periodic audit reports of qualified trust service providers to the national supervisory bodies.   B2B: Electronic registered delivery of financial/payment data between involved parties and  notarization in a ledger of all transactions.

Qualified electronic registered delivery – what are the usage best  practices?  Security guidelines and levels  In this section, we propose recommendations according to three levels which represent the  “strength/rigorousness” with which qualified electronic registered delivery services should be applied in a  specific context. This “strength/rigorousness” of course depends on the use case or type of application /  environment in which qualified electronic registered delivery services are being applied. Dimensions that  could have an impact on the “strength/rigorousness” of applying the recommendations, are the criticality  of the processes and/or data being involved in the business process which is being supported by the  respective qualified trust service.  This, every organization has to determine for itself based on a risk  assessment.  For inspiration possible mapping of basic/recommended/enhanced vs business criticality  and/or data protection is being given in Annex B.  In short the three levels of recommendations are in increasing order (whereby the higher level suppose  that the lower level is also taken into account):  BASIC for recommendations to be followed by entities or in processes dealing with normal  levels of criticality of data and therefor can live with a lower maturity in implementing  trust services (technology).  RECOMMENDED for recommendations to be followed by entities or in processes dealing with  important business data and therefor need to be able to rely on a medium to higher  maturity of implementation of trust services (technology).  ENHANCED for recommendations to be followed by entities or in processes dealing with data of  sensitive/high level of criticality and therefor need to be able to rely on a (very) high  maturity of implementation of trust services (technology).  BASIC  Citizens  Be users of a qualified electronic signature or seal, which is often the entry condition to qualified  electronic registered delivery services (hereafter QeRDS).  Look for the EU trust mark for qualified trust services when selecting providers.  Make sure to archive your messages in an appropriate way (a single hard disk is far more likely to crash  than your letter folder to get lost or burned.  Public administration / Business entity  Understand the opportunities; assess which of your current messaging can benefit from the  advantages of QeRDS.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  25  Use QeRDS for key communication partner in a pilot phase before deploying it for all communication  partners. Note, however, that it is easier to convince key players than multiple citizens that only rarely  exchange messages with the administration.  Use existing or upcoming qualified QeRDS providers that can easily be introduced to your  communication partners.  Use, whenever possible, operational or ready to start QeRDS service provider(s) that your  communication partner uses for other purposes too, rather than choosing silo solution.  Do not charge for the QeRDS, rather for the service based on the shared message.  Involve the operation staff in changing the delivery procedures.  RECOMMENDED  Citizens  Privilege qualified QeRDS providers that allow combining several QeRDS (communication with several  administrations, with banks, shops) and maybe other services such as archiving, internet service  providers).  Organise your QeRDS messages with the same, if not with more care than your paper bills, product  guarantees, banking sheets, medical advice, insurance papers, etc.).  Read the applicable terms and conditions, in particular clauses on your responsibility in maintaining  the security of your credential or access to the service.  Public administration / Business entity  Correctly define message format and foster integration in the backend systems. There is little benefit  for the administration when introducing QeRDS for tax declaration, if the electronically delivered  document still needs to be encoded manually in a backend system.  Use open standard and open services whenever the message volume and the cost saving are high  enough to finance more than a single service provider to allow fair competition among service  provides in the interest of the quality of service offered to your communication partners.  Build your QeRDS introduction project upon an assessment of risks to be avoided, opportunities and  cost saving, estimation of implementation and operational costs, and quantified return on investment.  Do not underestimate operational costs to operate QeRDS and traditional delivery at the same time,  nor setup costs to train staff and change operational procedures  Allow sufficient time to your communication partner to migrate to QeRDS before saving the cost of  maintaining traditional messaging systems.  Identify key implementation issues.  Communicate on your project and during your project with the interested parties, in particular the  qualified QeRDS providers and the communication partners.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  26  ENHANCED  Citizens  Make sure that you can continuously, even in case of an ICT issue or loss of your primary credentials,  connect and process your QeRDS messages.  Public administration / Business entity  Consult with other public administration to create the critical mass for a QeRDS.  Align your QeRDS introduction strategy with the national strategic for lean administration.  Produce a strategic roadmap for migrating communication, primarily non-electronic communication to  QeRDS. Prioritise key applications, but do not ignore quick wins to gain credibility among your  stakeholders.  Plan your budget as QeRDS is a substantial investment that does not only change an ICT system, but  also your administrative processes and the way you expect your communication partners to behave.  Be prepared that easier communication may trigger more activities for the administration. If a  complaint to policy can be made via QeRDS, more people will make complaints than if a victim has to  go physically to an office and spend some time waiting for his/her complaint to be accepted. This,  however, is a general remark applying to easy access to administration; independently whether it is  open via a QeRDS or a dedicated Web portal.  To introduce QeRDS in A2B, negotiate private public partnership to finance the migration towards this  new technology.  Use key performance indicators to measure the benefits of QeRDS and the reach of the predicted  return on investment.  Consider openness for communication partners using unusual setups, such as eID cards from other EU  member states, etc.  Privileged compatibility with commercial products.  Select standards for the message format with great care (e.g. xml format for structured data). Publish  your message format in due time to all communication partners, so that they can adapt their backend  systems.

Qualified electronic registered delivery – example of tools & practical  usage aspects  Implementing qualified electronic registered delivery services (user perspective)  The user experience and tools for using qualified electronic registered delivery services is pretty dependent  of the end-user application and interface provided by the related qualified trust service provider.  Relevant standards regarding qualified electronic registered delivery services  (expert perspective)  ETSI Technical Committee Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI)  ETSI EN 102 640 is multi-part deliverable covering Registered Electronic Mail (REM), as identified below:   Part 1: \"Architecture\";   Part 2: \"Data requirements, Formats and Signatures for REM\";   Part 3: \"Information Security Policy Requirements for REM Management Domains\";   Part 4: \"REM-MD Conformance Profiles\";   Part 5: \"REM-MD Interoperability Profiles\";   Part 6: \"Interoperability Profiles\":  o Sub-part 1: \"REM-MD UPU PReM Interoperability Profile\";  o Sub-part 2: \"REM-MD BUSDOX Interoperability Profile\";  o Sub-part 3: \"REM-MD SOAP Binding Profile\".  The Universal Postal Union (UPU)  The UPU has developed some standards regarding interoperability aspects, the registered electronic mail,  in collaboration with CEN11.  S33 Interoperability framework for postal public key infrastructure:  “The objective of this standard is to create a common Postal Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to  provide global certification and security services aimed at globally binding the identity of  individuals and organisations with their public key. The framework itself and its first four elements  (PKI structure, cryptographic algorithms, data formats and data dissemination protocols) are  included.”  S52 Functional specification for postal registered electronic mail (PReM):  “This standard defines the functional specification of a secure electronic postal service, referred to  as the postal registered electronic mail or PReM service. PReM provides a trusted and certified  electronic mail exchange between mailer, designated operators and addressee/mailee.

Electronic seal  An electronic seal is a piece of data in electronic form, created by a legal person, which is attached to or  logically associated with an electronic document (or data) to ensure its origin and integrity.  It is similar in the paper world to the dry seal of a company on a piece of paper to indicate that the  document originates from the company and make it authentic and official.  Message  An information or document sent to a receiver.  Hash value (of a file)  A hash value is a standardised and unique summary of a message, which is obtained by applying a specific  cryptographic tool called a cryptographic hash function.  A hash function is any function that can be used to map digital data of arbitrary size to digital data of fixed  size, with slight differences in input data producing very big differences in output data.  A cryptographic hash function is a hash function which has specific security properties:   It is considered practically impossible to recreate the input message from its hash value;   It is considered practically impossible to compute from a specific message a second message that  has the same hash value (i.e. different messages lead to different has values);   It is considered practically impossible to find two different messages that would lead to the same  hash value (no collisions)  With such properties, when applied to the same message repetitively the hash value is always the same,  while if the message is slightly modified (even by one single bit) the hash value will always be different.  That allows to verify the integrity of a message compared to the message on which the hash was  previously computed; when the hash values are identical, then the messages are identical.  As cryptographic hash values represent large amounts of data as much smaller numeric values, they are  often used with digital signatures. Signing a hash value is more efficient than signing the larger value.  Trusted list  A trusted list is a list including information related to the qualified trust service providers which are  established in and supervised by an EU Member State, together with information related to the qualified  trust services provided by them, in accordance with the relevant provisions laid down in Regulation (EU)  No 910/2014. Those lists have constitutive value and are primary source of information to validate that a  qualified status is or has been granted to a QTSP and to the QTS it provides.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  29  Trusted lists are essential elements in building trust among electronic market operators by allowing users  to determine the qualified status and the status history of trust service providers and their services.  Member States may include in the trusted lists information on non-qualified trust service providers,  together with information related to the non-qualified trust services provided by them. It shall be clearly  indicated that they are not qualified according to Regulation (EU) No 910/2014.  Member States may include in the trusted lists information on nationally defined trust services of other  types than those defined under Article 3(16) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014. It shall be clearly indicated  that they are not qualified according to Regulation (EU) No 910/2014.  QTSP/QTS requirements and obligations  The eIDAS Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 foresees a set of requirements and obligations for qualified trust  service providers (QTSP) and qualified trust services (QTS) they provide in order to ensure high-level  security of the qualified trust services. Those obligations include in a nutshell:   Processing of personal data shall be carried out in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC.   Trust service provider (TSP) is liable for damage caused intentionally or negligently to any natural or  legal person due to a failure to comply with the obligations under this Regulation, while the intention  or negligence of a QTSP shall be presumed, unless proven otherwise by QTS. When TSP informed  customer in advance on limitations on the use of their services, and when such limitations are  recognisable to third parties, TSP is not liable when limitations have been exceeded.   Where feasible, services must be accessible for person with disabilities.   Implementing appropriate technical and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the  security of the trust services they provide. Having regard to the latest technological developments,  those measures shall ensure that the level of security is commensurate to the degree of risk. Measures  shall be taken to prevent and minimize the impact of security incidents and inform stakeholders of the  adverse effects of any such incidents.   Very strict rules regarding the obligation of notifying security & personal data breaches.   Additional requirements on QTSP operations and practices:  o Inform SB of any change in QTS provisioning and of intention to cease;  o Up-to-date termination plan, agreed with the competent supervisory body (SB), to ensure  continuity of service;  o Requirements on employed staff and subcontractors, when used;  o Sufficient financial resources and/or liability insurance, in accordance with national law;  o Consumer information on terms and conditions, incl. on limitations on use;  o Use of trustworthy systems and products ensuring the technical security and reliability of the  supported processes;  o Use of trustworthy systems to store (personal) data in a verifiable form;  o Take appropriate measures against forgery and theft of data; and  o Record and keep accessible activities related data, issued and received, even after cessation of  activities.   Specific requirements from the provisions laid down in the eIDAS Regulation with regards to the  provision of a specific type of qualified trust service.  All those requirements must be met by the QTSP/QTS before issuing the very first qualified trust service  output, i.e. before issuing the very first qualified time stamp in the case of QTSP providing qualified time  stamping services.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  30  Once granted a qualified status, the eIDAS Regulation also foresees an active supervision scheme of  qualified trust service providers (QTSP) and qualified trust services (QTS) they provide by the national  competent supervisory body (SB) to monitor fulfilment of the QTSP/QTS requirements and obligations  throughout their lifetime.  Trust services defined by the eIDAS Regulation  In its Art.3.16, the eIDAS Regulation defines a ‘trust service’ as an electronic service normally provided for  remuneration which consists of:  (a) the creation, verification, and validation of electronic signatures, electronic seals or electronic time  stamps, electronic registered delivery services and certificates related to those services, or  (b) the creation, verification and validation of certificates for website authentication; or  (c) the preservation of electronic signatures, seals or certificates related to those services.  Qualified trust services defined by the eIDAS Regulation  Only those trust services listed in Art.3.16 of the eIDAS Regulation for which there are applicable  requirements in the Regulation can benefit from the qualified status. eIDAS regulates the following nine  qualified trust services:  1. The provision of qualified certificates for electronic signatures  Certificates for electronic signature are electronic attestations which link electronic signature  validation data to a natural person and confirm at least the name or the pseudonym of that  person. Since 1 July 2016, an electronic signature can only be used by a natural person to sign, i.e.  mainly to express consent on the signed data/document. This represents a significant difference  from the eSignature Directive 1999/93/EC regime where an electronic signature, which could be  used by legal persons, was defined as a means of authentication. Under the eIDAS Regulation, the  entity who creates an electronic signature (the so called signatory) will be a natural person.  Therefore, certificates for electronic signature cannot be issued to legal persons anymore. Instead  legal persons can use certificates for electronic seals (see below).  A qualified electronic certificate for electronic signatures is an essential element for a signatory to  create qualified electronic signatures that shall have the equivalent legal effect of a handwritten  signature all over the EU.  2. The provision of qualified certificates for electronic seals  As explained above, since 1 July 2016, legal persons cannot create legally valid (qualified)  electronic signatures anymore and cannot be issued (qualified) certificates for electronic  signatures. Instead legal persons can use certificates for electronic seals, which are electronic  attestations that link electronic seal validation data to a legal person and confirm the name of that  person. The aim of an electronic seal is not to sign but to serve as an evidence that an electronic  data/document was issued by a legal person, ensuring certainty of the data/document’s origin and  integrity.  A qualified electronic certificate for electronic seals is an essential element for a legal person to  create qualified electronic seals that shall enjoy, all over the EU, the presumption of integrity of  the data and of correctness of the origin of that data to which the qualified electronic seal is  linked.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  31  3. The provision of qualified certificates for website authentication  Certificates for website authentication are issued to ensure the users (in particular citizens and  SMEs) that behind the website there is a legal or natural person identifiable by trustworthy  information.  The Regulation sets clear requirements for qualified website authentication certificates to be  considered trustworthy together with obligations for qualified trust service providers of such  qualified certificates with regard to the security of their operations, their liability and their  supervision regime. As a consequence, the Regulation ensures transparency regarding the quality  of the service offered to users, accountability of providers with regard to security of their services,  trustworthiness of the data associated to qualified authenticated websites and technological  neutrality of services and solutions.  4. Qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures  Such a qualified trust service aims to ensure the long-term preservation of information, in order to  ensure the legal validity and trustworthiness of qualified electronic signatures over extended  periods of time and guarantee that they can be validated irrespective of future technological  changes.  5. Qualified preservation service for qualified electronic seals  Such a qualified trust service aims to ensure the long-term preservation of information, in order to  ensure the legal validity and trustworthiness of qualified electronic seals over extended periods of  time and guarantee that they can be validated irrespective of future technological changes.  6. Qualified validation service for qualified electronic signatures  Validation of electronic signature is an ancillary service to electronic signatures whose process  aims to confirm the validity of an electronic signature.  Qualified validation services for qualified electronic signatures entail the verification by a qualified  trust service provider that the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation are met by a qualified  electronic signature in order to confirm its validity.  7. Qualified validation service for qualified electronic seals  Validation of electronic seal is an ancillary service to electronic seals whose process aims to  confirm the validity of an electronic seal.  Qualified validation services for qualified electronic seals entail the verification by a qualified trust  service provider that the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation are met by a qualified electronic  seal in order to confirm its validity.  8. Qualified electronic time stamps services  Electronic time stamps are issued to ensure the correctness of the time linked to data/documents.  Qualified electronic time stamp shall enjoy, all over the EU, the presumption of the accuracy of the  date and the time it indicates and the integrity of the data to which the date and time are bound.  9. Qualified electronic registered delivery services  By relying on a qualified electronic registered delivery service, one will benefit, all over the EU,  from the presumption of the integrity of the registered data, the sending of that data by the  identified sender, its receipt by the identified addressee and the accuracy of the date and time of  sending and receipt indicated by that qualified trust service.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  32  The Regulation sets clear requirements for all such qualified trust services to be considered trustworthy  together with obligations for their qualified trust service providers with regard to the security of their  operations, their liability and their supervision regime.

However, and depending  on the concrete environment the use case is applied in, the “strength/rigorousness” with which the  recommendations should be applied might be less or more severe.  Dimensions that could have an impact  on the “strength/rigorousness” of applying the recommendations, are the criticality of the processes  and/or data being involved in the business process which is being supported by the respective qualified  trust service. So, without intending to be complete as a risk assessment depends of the concrete  environment/context in which the organization is operating, some dimensions which might be considered  to determine the risk-profile of the process and/or data being protected (and therefor the minimum  “strength/rigorousness” to apply) are:   Business critical data & processes:  organizations store or process information that can have a less  or more significant impact on their own organization and/or their partners and/or their clients.  Examples of potential risks are e.g. loss of integrity of a database, compromise of business- confidential data, incorrect contracting-data, etc.   Data & processes with potential financial impact:  organization (especially but not only financial  industry related organizations) have several processes which might have direct financial impact for  themselves, for their partners and/or their clients ranging from amounts e.g. below a thousand  euros to amounts going into millions of euros. Examples of potential risks are e.g.: faulty validation  of signatures on mandates or payment instructions, rogue / criminal impersonation of third party  providers, hacking of personnel or corporate accounts, false invoices, etc.   Personal data (processing):  Personal data is clearly a very complex and high risk matter. The  scope of personal data is very broad, ranging from less delicate personal data, to directly  identifiable information to sensitive personal data. The more sensitive the data the stronger and  more rigorous one should apply the recommendations. Examples of potential risks are:  fines of up  to 4% of the global annual revenues of a company, embarrassment due to faulty access personal  information, unauthorized access/manipulation to e.g. biometric data, responding to a request- for-info based on an incorrect signed request, health data getting exposed / delivered incorrectly,  authenticity/integrity of critical health records being non-verifiable, etc.  Note:  We stress that the above are just examples of possible areas to consider to assess the risk-profile of  the process and/or data being protected. Depending on the reader’s environment other dimensions might  apply depending on regulation, corporate policies, contractual obligations, etc.  Determining applicable criticality-levels and derive resulting minimum applicable  recommendations  Following the above, it is proposed that organizations do their own analyses and following map their  processes / data-to-be-processed onto the following “criticality-levels”:   “Standard” would entail any usage of a trust service under normal circumstance like but not  limited to use cases e.g. involving financial exchange of a rather limited amount, personal records  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic registered delivery services  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  December 2016  35  with limited potential impact, or access to data/services of a limited classification level (e.g.  internal/restraint).   “Advanced” would entail any usage of a trust service in a context where more precautions /  prudence is to be advised like cases which involve financial exchange of a rather important  magnitude, personal records with rather important impact if going wrong, or access to  data/services of a higher classification level like company-confidential.   “Sensitive” would entail any usage of a trust service in a context where sensitive data is being  involved, e.g. involving financial exchanges of a significant amount, personal record access of  personal sensitive information, or access to data/services of a high classification level  like company-/commercial-secret.  Based on the above “criticality-levels”, one can easily see how the levels (Basic, Recommended, Enhanced)  can match to these levels:   Basic would entail the recommendations to-be-considered at the moment one is involved in a  (trans)action that involves data/services of a “standard” level of criticality.   Recommended would entail the recommendations to-be-considered at the moment one is  involved in a (trans)action that involves data/services of an “advanced” level of criticality.   Enhanced would be the recommendations to-be-considered at the moment one is involved in a  (trans)action that involves data/services of a “sensitive” level of criticality.

The complied a Q&A document is available from https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single- market/en/news/questions-answers-trust-services-under-eidas.  The Commission launched the eIDAS Observatory - an online collaborative platform for exchanging views  and positions, sharing ideas and good practices. It is a virtual community of stakeholders whose aim is to  build a common understanding of the issues relating to the implementation and uptake of the eIDAS  Regulation and to facilitate the use of cross-border electronic identification and trust services. You can join  the eIDAS Observatory and take part in the discussions.  D.2 How can I find a qualified trust service provider providing qualified electronic  registered delivery services?  You can find a qualified trust service provider providing qualified electronic registered delivery services by  looking:  - For the use of the EU trust mark for qualified trust services associated to the provision of qualified  electronic registered delivery services in the marketing material of envisaged providers;  - For EU MS national trusted list as they are available from the EC list of pointers to the EU MS  trusted lists (https://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/esignature/trusted-list/tl-mp.xml)  or by browsing the EU MS trusted lists from, e.g. http://tlbrowser.tsl.website. Trusted lists are  organised per TSP, and then per trust service. Look up for a service type identifying the provision  of qualified electronic registered delivery services (http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/Svctype/EDS/Q or  http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/Svctype/EDS/REM/Q) for which the current status is “granted”  (http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/TrustedList/Svcstatus/granted).  - For applicable terms and conditions, the policies and practices used by the QTSP to provide its  qualified electronic registered delivery services should be available from the “TSP information  URI” as part of the TSP information as listed in the relevant EU MS trusted list.  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/questions-answers-trust-services-under-eidas https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/questions-answers-trust-services-under-eidas http://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/eidas-observatory https://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/esignature/trusted-list/tl-mp.xml http://tlbrowser.tsl.website/ http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/Svctype/EDS/Q http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/Svctype/EDS/REM/Q http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/TrustedList/Svcstatus/granted  ENISA  European Union Agency for Network  and Information Security  Science and Technology Park of Crete (ITE)  Vassilika Vouton, 700 13, Heraklion, Greece  Athens Office  1 Vasilissis Sofias  Marousi 151 24, Athens, Greece  TP-06-16-353-EN-N  PO Box 1309, 710 01 Heraklion, Greece  Tel: +30 28 14 40 9710  info@enisa.europa.eu  www.enisa.europa.eu  ISBN: 978-92-9204-214-1  DOI: 10.2824/985945",

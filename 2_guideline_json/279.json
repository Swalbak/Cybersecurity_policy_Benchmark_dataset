This culminated in the NIS Cooperation Group issuing the EU 5G Cybersecurity Risk  Mitigation Toolbox in January 20204 (EU 5G Toolbox).   The European Commission has been reviewing the Network and Information Systems  Directive5 (NIS Directive) and, on 16 December 2020, made a proposal for its  amendment6 (NIS2 proposal), which would bring EU telecom security rules under the  NIS Directive.  In light of these policy changes, ENISA carried out an assessment of the implementation of EU  telecom security policy, to inform policy makers in the Commission and in the Member States,  as well as experts from the sector, about challenges, gaps and possible improvements. This  paper contains the highlights of this assessment. We summarize our findings here and we refer  the reader to the body of the paper for more details.  This assessment of the implementation of EU telecom security legislation focuses on:  1. Implementation at national level, including the relevant national telecom security  legislation, the powers and capabilities of the national authorities, and collaboration  and information sharing at national level.  2. Implementation at EU level, including the harmonisation across the EU, the  collaboration between the different Member States, and ENISA’s role.  The assessment was carried out by interviewing and surveying a balanced group of experts  from the public and private sectors, including the national authorities responsible for telecom  security, the national authorities responsible for the NIS Directive, and experts from the EU  telecom sector (see Figures ES1 and ES2).  1  Directive (EU) 2018/1972 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 establishing the  European Electronic Communications Code, OJ L 321, 17.12.2018, p. 36.  2  Directive 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory  framework for electronic communications networks and services, OJ L 108, 24.4.2002, p. 33.  3  Commission Recommendation (EU) 2019/534 of 26 March 2019 – Cybersecurity of 5G networks, OJ L 88, 29.3.2019,  p. 42.  4  Cybersecurity of 5G networks EU Toolbox of risk mitigating measures, available at https://digital- strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/cybersecurity-5g-networks-eu-toolbox-risk-mitigating-measures.  5  Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 concerning measures for a high  common level of security of network and information systems across the Union, OJ L 194, 19.7.2016, p. 1.  6  Proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2020 on measures for a high  common level of cybersecurity across the Union, repealing Directive (EU) 2016/1148, COM(2020) 823 final, 16.12.2020.  https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/cybersecurity-5g-networks-eu-toolbox-risk-mitigating-measures https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/cybersecurity-5g-networks-eu-toolbox-risk-mitigating-measures  ASSESSMENT OF EU TELECOM SECURITY LEGISLATION  July 2021  3  Figure ES1: Participation in the online survey Figure ES2: Participation in the telephone interviews  We highlight the findings from the assessment7:  1. EU telecom security legislation has a positive impact. The security provisions in  the EU regulatory framework have contributed to a high level of cybersecurity in the  telecommunications sector.  2. The legislative framework is complex. Several experts found national telecom  security legislation rather complex.  3. Authorities have powers but few resources. The powers of the national telecom  security authorities are considered sufficient, but there are concerns about scarcity of  resources and expertise.  4. Incident reporting can be improved. In general, national-level incident reporting is  working well, but there is room for improvement, for example to address the problem of  reporting the same incident to multiple authorities, or the lack of feedback after  submission of an incident report.  5. Collaboration at national and EU levels is good. In general, both national- and EU-  level collaboration works well. On the latter, experts recognised the positive  contribution of ENISA and the European Competent Authorities for Secure Electronic  Communications (ECASEC, formerly Article 13a) Expert Group.  7  See also Section 6 of this report for full details of the conclusions and recommendations.  ASSESSMENT OF EU TELECOM SECURITY LEGISLATION  July 2021  4  The experts who were interviewed and surveyed also provided recommendations for ENISA,  Commission, and the national authorities in the EU Member States:  1. Prioritise the implementation of new policies. In the short term, the priority is to  implement the EECC, the EU 5G Toolbox and the related recommendations.  2. More resource sharing and collaboration. To address cybersecurity skills shortages,  it is important to explore resource and capability sharing not only between authorities in  the same country and between authorities across the EU, but also between authorities  and providers, depending on the topic.  3. More technical guidance for service providers. While ENISA’s role and the work of  the ENISA ECASEC Expert Group were valued, experts from the sector asked for  more technical and operational guidelines.  4. Better incident reporting. To improve incident reporting, it is important that authorities  provide feedback in response to incident reports. In addition, definitions of what should  be reported and the thresholds for reporting should be clarified.  5. More trust and engagement between public and private sectors. Trust between  authorities and providers, as well as engagement with the private sector, are important,  including in the early stages of policymaking.  As mentioned, at the end of 2020 the Commission put forward its NIS2 proposal. The NIS2  proposal constitutes part of a broader EU cybersecurity strategy8, which addresses, among  other things, the next steps in 5G security policy and updates the existing critical infrastructure  protection legislation with a proposal for a directive on the resilience of critical entities9. Under  the NIS2 proposal, the EU telecom security provisions would be brought under the NIS  Directive. We look forward to supporting these policy discussions between the European  Commission, the EU Member States and the European Parliament.  8 European Commission, ‘New EU cybersecurity strategy and new rules to make physical and digital critical entities more  resilient’, press release, 16 December 2020 (https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_2391).  9 Proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2020 on the resilience of critical  entities, COM(2020) 829 final, 16.12.2020.  https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_2391  ASSESSMENT OF EU TELECOM SECURITY LEGISLATION  July 2021  5  TABLE OF CONTENTS  1.

INTRODUCTION  In 2020, ENISA carried out an assessment of the implementation of EU telecom security policy  across the EU. The aim was to provide policymakers with input on a number of recent policy  changes and reviews, such as the new EECC (whose Article 40 replaced Article 13a of the  Telecom Framework Directive), the review of the NIS Directive and the review of the  Commission Recommendation on Cybersecurity of 5G networks.  This assessment was carried out by interviewing and surveying a large and balanced group of  experts working in the EU telecom sector, experts working at telecommunications national  regulatory authorities (NRAs) and experts working at national authorities for the NIS Directive.  The body of this report contains the main results of this assessment.  1.1.  SCOPE  The scope of this assessment includes the security provisions of the EU legislative framework  for electronic communications (namely, Article 13a of the Telecom Framework Directive), the  new security provisions (Article 40) under the EECC, other relevant EU policies related to  telecom security, and national policies and legislation incorporating EU legislation adopted in  the EU Member States.  1.2.  TARGET AUDIENCE  The target audience of this report are policymakers at EU and national levels and telecom  security and policy/legislation experts.  1.3.  METHODOLOGY  An online survey was used to gather expert input. The survey was completed by a mixed group  of 45 experts from across the EU, including experts working in the telecom sector and experts  working at the national authorities. In addition, 21 telephone interviews were conducted with the  experts to explore the key issues in more detail. Figures 1 and 2 show how each group was  represented in the survey and interviews, respectively.

FINDINGS  This section presents the findings of the assessment. They are discussed at two levels:  1. National level. Implementation of telecommunications security legislation at national  level, including its impact, powers and capabilities of NRAs, incident reporting and  national-level collaboration.  2. EU level. Operation of telecommunications security legislation at EU level, including  harmonisation, EU-level collaboration and work of the Article 13a (now ECASEC)  Expert Group and ENISA.  2.1.  ASSESSMENT OF TELECOM LEGISLATION AT NATIONAL LEVEL  2.1.1.  Summary  Overall, collaboration at national level is considered to be strong, especially between national  telecom security authorities and the telecom sector, and between national telecom security  authorities and NIS Directive national authorities and/or national cybersecurity incident  response teams (CSIRTs). In addition, experts agree that security measures and risk  management are good in the telecom sector.  On the other hand, there are mixed opinions on the sufficiency of national authorities’  resources. Moreover, there are concerns about collaboration at national level between telecom  security authorities and data protection authorities, and between telecom operators and  operators of essential services.

The authority has sufficient cybersecurity expertise.  The authority has sufficient resources.  The authority offers useful implementation guidelines.  There is a culture of risk management in the telecom sector.  Security measures taken in the telecom sector are appropriate.  The right incidents are being reported to authorities.  Incident reporting has been useful in improving cybersecurity.  Collaboration between national telecom security authority and telecom sector is good.  Collaboration between telecom security authority and NIS Directive authority and/or national CSIRT is good.  Collaboration between telecom security authority and data protection authorities is good.  Collaboration between telecom providers is good.  Collaboration between telecom providers and operators of essential services (energy, finance, etc) is good.  Strongly agree Agree Disagree Strongly disagree Don't know, no opinion%  % % % % % % % % % % %  ASSESSMENT OF EU TELECOM SECURITY LEGISLATION  July 2021  10  2.1.2.  Positive impact of the legislation  EU telecom security legislation has achieved a culture of risk management  EU legislation has increased the level  of maturity in telecoms security in  many countries  There is a culture of risk management across EU Member  States and the security measures taken are considered  appropriate. The survey results underpin this opinion as 84%  of participants agreed that there is a culture of risk  management in the telecommunications sector.  Security measures are generally  appropriate  Only about 9% of the respondents disagreed with this  statement. More than half of the respondents who disagreed  with the appropriateness of security measures were CSIRT  representatives.  Figure 4: Security measures taken in the telecom sector are appropriate  However, legislation is complex and guidance is missing  National legislation is complex Experts found legislation definitions, obligations and terms  rather incoherent or unclear. They noted that permissive  definitions or a lack thereof under the old EU regulatory  framework allowed different interpretations at national level,  which could hinder the operation of providers that are present  in more than one Member State.  The most commonly invoked example was that of an  ‘incident’10. One of the interviewees commented that incidents  ‘are seen and interpreted differently by many companies’.  Closely related to this was the uncertainty around the reporting  thresholds and the treatment of digital service providers,  domain name systems and Internet exchange points (IXPs).  One of the experts noted that the last two services could  potentially be within the scope of both the EECC and the NIS  Directive.  10 ‘Incidents’ were not defined in the Telecom Framework Directive, which may have contributed to the problem. The EECC  introduces the definition of a ‘security incident’ in Article 2(42): “security incident” means an event having an actual adverse  effect on the security of electronic communications networks or services’.  ASSESSMENT OF EU TELECOM SECURITY LEGISLATION  July 2021  11  In some countries, this is compensated  by guidelines  However, in some cases, no additional materials are provided  to service providers. In addition, based on the findings of the  survey, one quarter of the respondents thought that the  guidelines provided by NRAs are not useful enough as they  are considered too high level and lack operational and  technical details.  Overlapping obligations and  requirements have been reported  In some countries, service providers are supervised by and are  forced to collaborate with more than one authority regarding  network security, for instance the NRA and a cybersecurity  agency.  It is not always clear which specific  authority a certain service provider  falls under  For example, in some cases, telecommunications operators  are also IXPs, which raises the question of whether their IXP  operations fall within the remit of the NRA (EECC) or the  competent authority under the NIS Directive.  2.1.3.  Capabilities and powers of national authorities  85% of the survey respondents agreed  that the NRA has sufficient power  In addition, some respondents highlighted the continuous  adaptation of the NRA’s capabilities to technical changes.  However, many stakeholders were  concerned about the scarcity of  resources and expertise  37% of the survey respondents indicated that authorities’ lack  of resources is an issue and 40% found that NRAs have  insufficient expertise.  Resource sharing and collaboration  between authorities helps  For example, NRAs can receive support from national CSIRTs  or other security services, such as crisis centres and  intelligence services.  2.1.4.  Incident reporting and audits  Generally, national-level incident  reporting is working well. It has also  been useful in improving cybersecurity  69% of the online survey respondents agreed or strongly agreed  that the right incidents are reported to authorities. Only a small  percentage of respondents disagreed with this statement and  20% of respondents had no opinion on the topic.  However, some incidents are not being  reported or are missing essential  details  Three main reasons were identified by the respondents:   diverse interpretation of incidents within the scope,   reporting rules focus on the duration of service interruption  and, as a result, certain incidents may not be reported (e.g.  data leaks), and   lack of trust between the authorities and telecom providers.  Incident-reporting obligations and  processes may be fragmented  Some respondents highlighted that there may be reporting  obligations to multiple authorities, or the root cause of an incident  may not be easy to define, which results in the same incident  being reported to more than one authority.  A noteworthy example of good practice is the universal reporting  tool developed by the Danish Centre for Cyber Security (CFCS),  which sends the report to the relevant authority.  ASSESSMENT OF EU TELECOM SECURITY LEGISLATION  July 2021  12  It is uncommon to receive feedback on  reported incidents  As a result, the interviewees sometimes viewed the incident-  reporting obligations as an ‘administrative burden’. The  interviewees noted that receiving feedback would significantly  increase the utility of reporting.  Concern: frequency of audits varies considerably  Some countries carry out 10–15 audits per year, while others conduct more than 250. In general, the view is  that authorities have enough power to conduct or order audits, monitor procedures, perform supervision and  collect the necessary information.  2.1.5.  Collaboration at national level  National-level collaboration is working well. Figure 5 presents the general findings on  collaboration between stakeholders. This is followed by presentation of some of the highlights of  the online survey and the interviews.  Figure 5: Collaboration between the following stakeholders is good  Collaboration between authorities at national level is improving  In most Member States, competent  authorities recognised the increasing  importance of joint work  Collaboration between different telecommunications-related  authorities is mostly considered to be good. There is also the  intention to combine the capabilities and expertise of the  different authorities, and confidence that this can be achieved.  Some challenges have been identified Challenges exist as a result of the different focuses and  approaches of the different authorities involved. For example,  while some stakeholders noted that collaborations between  NRAs and CSIRTs are fruitful when they do occur, others  claimed that such cooperation is still limited.  Other stakeholders noted the problem of overlaps in  responsibilities, which sometimes occurs between NRAs and  other relevant authorities. Nevertheless, the stakeholders  surveyed expressed their commitment to resolving any such  overlaps.  ASSESSMENT OF EU TELECOM SECURITY LEGISLATION  July 2021  13  Collaboration between national authorities and telecom providers is good  Major telecommunication service  providers and the NRAs communicate on  a regular basis  The regularity of the cooperation varies: from cooperation  ‘based on necessity’ to ‘monthly meetings with the  competent authorities’ about specific topics (e.g.  implementation of the 5G Toolbox).  Some interesting examples of good  practice have been reported in select  Member States  For example, in Portugal, a collaboration platform  coordinated by the National Communications Authority  (ANACOM) has been set up for telecom operators’ security  experts, where they can share and discuss their main  issues.  Building and maintaining trust is key Some stakeholders declared that the relationship between  telecom operators and the authorities may not be fully  transparent, as the operators are usually careful with the  information they share.  The majority of the authorities recognised the importance of  building trust. They reported making significant efforts to  improve collaboration by increasing the level of  transparency in their decision-making.  Collaboration between telecom service providers is good  Telecom service providers have  expressed a desire to increase the level  of security-related cooperation  Apart from bilateral exchanges, some service providers  collaborate in informal groups or communities, where they  share information on security topics.  In some countries, there are formalised national cooperation  groups, which are sometimes even led by the relevant  authority.  The quality of such collaboration varies In some countries, telecom service providers actively  cooperate to solve major security incidents. However, in  other countries they do not, reportedly because of ‘strong  competition’.  ASSESSMENT OF EU TELECOM SECURITY LEGISLATION  July 2021  14  2.2.  ASSESSMENT OF TELECOM LEGISLATION AT EU LEVEL  2.2.1.  Summary  In summary, experts gave positive feedback on:   the added value of the Article 13a Expert Group (now called ECASEC); and   ENISA’s role in supporting the implementation of EU telecom security legislation, as  well as ENISA’s technical guidelines.  On the other hand, experts highlighted issues with harmonisation and consistency. They did not  agree that national capabilities in telecom security are comparable across the EU. In addition,  experts expressed concerns about the consistency of telecom security requirements across the  EU, as well as the consistency between EU telecom security legislation and the NIS Directive.  Figure 6: EU level – harmonisation and collaboration  4  2  2  2  20  29  29  31  33  11  33  51  38  62  58  38  43  40  49  24  9  18  9  2  9  2  7  16  7  2  16  22  36  36  42  9  11  24  24  0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100  Technically the telecom security requirements are similar across the EU.  The national capabilities on telecom security are comparable across the EU.  EU telecom security legislation is consistent with the NIS Directive.  EU collaboration between telecom providers is good (EU ISACs, industry groups, e.g.)  Across the EU collaboration between the telecom security authorities and the authorities for the NIS Directive, the NIS Cooperation group is good.  ENISA is successful in supporting the implementation of telecom security legislation across the EU.  ENISA guidelines on telecom security policy are useful (e.g. Article 13a guidelines).  ENISA is effective in facilitating harmonization and collaboration across the EU.  The ENISA Article 13a expert group brings added value.  Strongly agree Agree Disagree Strongly disagree Don't know, no opinion  % % % % % % % % % % %  ASSESSMENT OF EU TELECOM SECURITY LEGISLATION  July 2021  15  2.2.2.  Harmonisation of implementation across the EU  Article 13a was considered rather general  in scope  Surveyed experts reported that this freedom of interpretation  of Article 13a has led to dissimilar telecommunication  security requirements across the Member States.  Article 13a Working Group guidelines  have helped to an extent  However, one of the experts interviewed noted that there was  ‘no official endorsement from the side of the Commission,  which leads to unharmonised processes in Member States’.  Therefore, beyond legal requirements, some experts argued  that it would be beneficial to standardise the implementation  too. This would be particularly helpful to cross-border  operators.  Figure 7: National capabilities on telecom sector security are comparable across the EU  2.2.3.  Collaboration across the EU  EU-level collaboration is generally considered to be good, but it appears to have limited  exposure. Many stakeholders could not answer the question on whether EU collaboration is  good or had no opinion on the matter.  Figure 8: EU level collaboration is good between the following stakeholders  ASSESSMENT OF EU TELECOM SECURITY LEGISLATION  July 2021  16  Most respondents had no opinion on collaboration between the NRAs, the NIS Directive  competent authorities and the NIS Directive authorities. This suggests that there is a need to  establish better links between these two groups of authorities.  Most respondents considered EU-level collaboration between telecom providers to be good  This may result from operations in  multiple Member States  Strong EU-level collaboration between telecom providers may  be connected to the fact that some major providers operate in  multiple Member States, which makes it important for them to  cooperate and harmonise processes.  34% of respondents could not answer the  question, or had no opinion  Those respondents were mainly CSIRT and NRA  representatives.  2.2.4.  ENISA and Article 13a Expert Group  Role of Article 13a (now ECASEC) Expert Group described as ‘extremely beneficial’  Nevertheless, areas for improvement  have been identified  Some telecom service providers did not find the work of the  Article 13a Expert Group sufficiently transparent.  Some respondents thought that there needs to be stronger  collaboration between the Article 13a Expert Group and the  NIS Cooperation Group.  Despite its achievements, the Article 13a  (now ECASEC) Expert Group does not  have a legal status  Some stakeholders also noted that, despite their usefulness,  there has been no official approval of the Article 13a technical  guidelines (now the revised ECASEC guidelines) by the  European Commission. The stakeholders added that this  results in unharmonised procedures.  ENISA plays a valuable role, but there is room for improvement  Positive feedback concerned facilitation  of knowledge sharing, incorporation of  legislation and establishment of EU-wide  guidelines  82% of participants surveyed agreed that ENISA is successful  in supporting the implementation of telecommunications  security legislation, 87% agreed that the guidelines provided  by ENISA are useful and 67% agreed that ENISA is effective  in facilitating harmonisation and collaboration across the EU.  It was also claimed that ENISA is especially good at bringing  together the different Member States. 74% of survey  participants thought that the Article 13a (now ECASEC)  Expert Group brings added value.  ENISA’s guidelines are at too high a level Some stakeholders expressed the need for more operational  and technical guidance.  ENISA’s powers and human resources  are insufficient  Some stakeholders expressed concerns that ENISA might  lack sufficient human resources to manage the more  technical and operational tasks requested by many Member  States.

GOOD PRACTICE EXAMPLES  The experts gave examples of good practice during this assessment, either via the online  survey or during the telephone interviews. Some of these suggestions are provided in the  following sections.  Guidelines to assist the sector with implementing primary legislation  Resource and capability sharing  Single incident-reporting platform  The Portuguese NRA, ANACOM, had introduced some additional secondary legislation to  support telecom providers regarding regulatory interpretation and thus create a basis for  more agile responses and approaches. Each telecom operator has to have an employee  who is responsible for telecommunication regulation and security. In addition, each  telecommunication operator has to have a contact point who is available 24/7; this is an  operational position. A collaboration platform is also coordinated by ANACOM, where  stakeholders can share and discuss security issues.  Resource sharing within the public sector. For inspections, the Belgian NRA, BIPT, can  obtain help from other departments within the organisation, such as the controls-related  department or the legal department. When specific cyber capabilities are needed, the Belgian  NRA can obtain support from the national CSIRT or other security services, such as the crisis  centre and intelligence services. In cases of both internal and cross-stakeholder types of  collaborations and dynamic resource allocation, the effectiveness of task and responsibility  fulfilment has been enhanced.  Resource sharing between the public and private sectors. The National Cyber Security  Centre in Ireland has an extensive cooperation network with the private sector (e.g. with  Amazon and Microsoft) and the partners provide technical assistance.  Combining responsibilities and competences for more streamlined operations. In  Finland, Traficom combines the competences of the NRA, CSIRT and cybersecurity agency to  maximise the available resources and streamline the execution of tasks.  To address the issue of reporting incidents to multiple authorities, the Danish CFCS has  developed a universal reporting tool, which is more efficient at sending reports to whichever  authorities need to be informed.  ASSESSMENT OF EU TELECOM SECURITY LEGISLATION  July 2021  19  Collaborative approach towards the private sector  Collaboration through common projects  The Radiocommunications Agency Netherlands uses a collaborative approach to build trust  with telecommunication service providers. It tends to avoid the use of fines as a means of  control because it considers it more important to create a learning curve, create the right  mindset and help service providers improve their cybersecurity and risk-management  processes.  The Belgian Institute for Postal Services and Telecommunications tries to carry out  inspections and audits in a cooperative way (e.g. providing regular communication and  feedback), as, ultimately, it has the same objective as the telecommunication service  providers, which is to increase security in Belgium. It noted that those in security teams may  find this process annoying initially; however, they realise that the reports help them to obtain  resources and organisational support for their projects and improve their security standing.  Project-based collaboration is a good way to build trust. Belgium provided an example of such a  process. In the context of the NIS Directive, there was a need for an incident notification  platform. The Belgian Institute for Postal Services and Telecommunications offered the use of  its own telecommunication incident notification platform to avoid the need for all authorities to  develop their own. It worked closely with the Centre for Cyber Security Belgium to share its  incident notification platform and practices. This helped to build trust and improve collaboration  between the different authorities involved.  ASSESSMENT OF EU TELECOM SECURITY LEGISLATION  July 2021  20  4. CHALLENGES AND  RECOMMENDATIONS  This section gives an overview of the perceived future challenges for the sector and lists several  recommendations for ENISA and the national authorities.  4.1.  CHALLENGES FOR THE SECTOR  The key challenges for the EU telecom sector are:   next-generation networks, such as network function virtualisation (NFV) and 5G   cybersecurity skills shortages   dependencies on vendors and suppliers.  These challenges are described in more detail below.  Complexity of new technologies  such as NFV and 5G  The most frequently mentioned challenge was adaptation to and  implications of the use of next-generation network technology, such as  Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and 5G.  5G not only constitutes a technology change. It also introduces new  business models, new vendors and network architecture changes.  One expert noted: ‘New types of technologies and new types of  services are gaining ground, such as machine-to-machine (M2M) and  over-the-top (OTT), which brings up different types of security issues.’  Shortages of cybersecurity skills 89% of the online survey respondents identified the availability of  cybersecurity skills as one of the biggest challenges in the sector.  Some stakeholders reported that this skills shortage is affecting their  core operations. Without the required technical expertise, many  security challenges become even harder to tackle. For example, even  if a public authority has the power to impose specific measures,  exercising this power (e.g. effective monitoring) becomes very difficult  without the right expertise.  Security gaps in the supply  chain  Some of the main challenges highlighted were supplier dependence,  lack of security requirements for suppliers, outsourcing and geopolitical  issues.  According to the online survey and the interviews, many telecom  service providers move parts of their operations outside their own  countries because of more favourable legislative or business  environments.  This makes it difficult to oversee or influence critical security factors,  and it introduces geopolitics into the security aspect of the supply  chain.  ASSESSMENT OF EU TELECOM SECURITY LEGISLATION  July 2021  21  4.2.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ENISA AND THE NATIONAL AUTHORITIES  Experts made several recommendations for ENISA and the national authorities.  Implement new legislation,  regulations and related  guidelines in a timely and  harmonised manner  Timely implementation of the EECC, the EU 5G Toolbox and any  related recommendations was identified as the main short-term goal.  Experts stressed the need for simplicity and harmonised approaches.  The Article 13a Expert Group (now ECASEC) was seen as making a  positive contribution to this harmonisation.  A priority topic going forward for the Article 13a Expert Group (now  ECASEC) and the 5G Toolbox is supply chain security and risks.  Developing EU-level standardisation has also been identified as  important.  Increase collaboration between  private and public sectors – at  both EU level and national level  Experts would like to see better and earlier involvement of the private  sector, including at the earliest stage of policymaking. This includes  providing the private sector with more exposure to ENISA’s work. This  would contribute to the private sector’s understanding of its own  obligations and the steps it needs to take to fulfil them.  The majority of authorities also recognised the need for deeper  collaboration between private and public sectors and reported that  considerable efforts are being made to build trust.  Provide more technical  guidelines and share them with  stakeholders as soon as  possible  Technical guidelines provided by ENISA and national authorities are  considered useful. However, stakeholders noted that they would find  it beneficial to have more detailed guidelines that break the legislation  down into specific operational requirements.  Telecom providers expressed the need for such guidelines to be  made available as soon as possible to facilitate the smooth  implementation of legislative requirements.  Review incident-reporting focus  areas, carefully define  thresholds and avoid obligation  overlaps  Avoiding unclear and overlapping obligations on telecom providers  from different authorities was one of the key recommendations. For  example, as in the Danish (CFCS) good practice example, this could  be achieved by creating a single reporting platform where telecom  providers could upload their reports, which could then be accessed by  relevant authorities.  When defining reporting thresholds, stakeholders recommended  considering the inclusion of other aspects of network integrity besides  focusing on the duration of service interruption. Experts also stated  that they would like to see harmonised reporting thresholds across  the EU, based on services’ characteristics.  Provide regular and detailed  feedback on reported incidents  Telecom providers expressed the need for regular and detailed  feedback on the incidents they report. They reasoned that such  feedback could contribute to creating a learning environment.  ASSESSMENT OF EU TELECOM SECURITY LEGISLATION  July 2021  22  5. CONCLUSIONS  In this report, we have provided an overview of an assessment of the EU telecom security  legislation that was carried out in 2020. In this section, we list the main conclusions and  recommendations.  5.1.  CONCLUSIONS FROM THE SURVEY AND INTERVIEWS  1. EU telecom security legislation has a positive impact. Based on the responses  from our stakeholders, security provisions in the EU regulatory framework, specifically  in the Telecom Framework Directive, have successfully contributed to a high level of  cybersecurity in the telecommunications sector. Indeed, most respondents were of the  view that, in general, there is a culture of risk management across EU Member States  and the security measures taken are appropriate.  2. The legislative framework is complex. Notwithstanding the above, some  stakeholders find national legislation rather complex. Moreover, some of the experts  surveyed reported that the generality of Article 13a of the Telecom Framework  Directive has led to dissimilar security requirements across the Member States.  3. Authorities have powers, but few resources. The powers of the national telecom  security authorities are considered sufficient, but there are concerns about scarcity of  resources and expertise.  4. Incident reporting could be improved. In general, national-level incident reporting is  working well, but there is room for improvement. Apart from the scarcity of feedback on  reported incidents, doubts sometimes arise over which authority a specific incident  should be reported to, which results in telecom operators occasionally reporting the  same incident to more than one authority.  5. Collaboration at national and EU levels is good. In the latter context, stakeholders  recognised the positive contribution of ENISA and the Article 13a (ECASEC) Expert  Group. Nevertheless, some challenges were identified, such as the issue of  involvement of the private sector in policymaking at both national and EU levels and  the relatively low exposure of the private sector to existing EU-level collaboration.  5.2.  RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE EXPERTS  The experts we engaged with also made recommendations for ENISA and the national  authorities.  1. Prioritise the implementation of new policies and legislation. To keep fostering the  culture of risk management, timely implementation of the EECC, the EU 5G Toolbox  and any related recommendations was identified as the main short-term goal.  2. Address skills shortages with resource sharing and collaboration. To address  cybersecurity skills shortages, it is important to explore resource and capability  sharing. Several resource- and capability-sharing models have been identified to  address this, for example resource sharing among public sector stakeholders and  compensating resource shortages with private sector collaborations.  3. More technical guidance for service providers. While the stakeholders described  the outputs of ENISA and the Article 13a (ECASEC) Expert Group as ‘extremely  beneficial’, they also expressed the need for more detailed guidelines that break down  ASSESSMENT OF EU TELECOM SECURITY LEGISLATION  July 2021  23  the legislation into specific operational requirements. At national level, this report also  provides examples of good practice to assist with the interpretation of primary  legislation, such as the use of supplementary regulatory instruments and guidelines,  and the provision of more direct assistance – such as collaboration groups or contact  points.  4. Improving and streamlining incident reporting. In addition to clarifying incident-  reporting obligations at national level, this report highlights some examples of good  practice to address the problem of telecom operators reporting the same incident to  more than one authority. Moreover, to improve incident reporting, it is important that  the authorities provide feedback in response to the submitted reports.  5. Better engagement with the private sector. Regarding both national- and EU-level  collaboration, stakeholders would like to see better and earlier involvement of the  private sector, including at the earliest stage of policymaking. There may also be a  need to increase the level of dissemination of information to the private sector to  increase exposure to EU-level collaboration. Finally, the majority of the authorities  recognised the importance of building trust between them and the private sector  entities they supervise.  We would like to repeat our expressions of gratitude for the valuable feedback provided by the  experts who were surveyed and interviewed. We look forward to continuing to work with the  sector and the national authorities to address the issues identified in the assessment, and we  will follow up on the recommendations made.

This culminated in the NIS Cooperation Group issuing the EU 5G Cybersecurity Risk  Mitigation Toolbox in January 20204 (EU 5G Toolbox).   The European Commission has been reviewing the Network and Information Systems  Directive5 (NIS Directive) and, on 16 December 2020, made a proposal for its  amendment6 (NIS2 proposal), which would bring EU telecom security rules under the  NIS Directive.  In light of these policy changes, ENISA carried out an assessment of the implementation of EU  telecom security policy, to inform policy makers in the Commission and in the Member States,  as well as experts from the sector, about challenges, gaps and possible improvements. This  paper contains the highlights of this assessment. We summarize our findings here and we refer  the reader to the body of the paper for more details.  This assessment of the implementation of EU telecom security legislation focuses on:  1. Implementation at national level, including the relevant national telecom security  legislation, the powers and capabilities of the national authorities, and collaboration  and information sharing at national level.  2. Implementation at EU level, including the harmonisation across the EU, the  collaboration between the different Member States, and ENISA’s role.  The assessment was carried out by interviewing and surveying a balanced group of experts  from the public and private sectors, including the national authorities responsible for telecom  security, the national authorities responsible for the NIS Directive, and experts from the EU  telecom sector (see Figures ES1 and ES2).  1  Directive (EU) 2018/1972 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 establishing the  European Electronic Communications Code, OJ L 321, 17.12.2018, p. 36.  2  Directive 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory  framework for electronic communications networks and services, OJ L 108, 24.4.2002, p. 33.  3  Commission Recommendation (EU) 2019/534 of 26 March 2019 – Cybersecurity of 5G networks, OJ L 88, 29.3.2019,  p. 42.  4  Cybersecurity of 5G networks EU Toolbox of risk mitigating measures, available at https://digital- strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/cybersecurity-5g-networks-eu-toolbox-risk-mitigating-measures.  5  Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 concerning measures for a high  common level of security of network and information systems across the Union, OJ L 194, 19.7.2016, p. 1.  6  Proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2020 on measures for a high  common level of cybersecurity across the Union, repealing Directive (EU) 2016/1148, COM(2020) 823 final, 16.12.2020.  https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/cybersecurity-5g-networks-eu-toolbox-risk-mitigating-measures https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/cybersecurity-5g-networks-eu-toolbox-risk-mitigating-measures  ASSESSMENT OF EU TELECOM SECURITY LEGISLATION  July 2021  3  Figure ES1: Participation in the online survey Figure ES2: Participation in the telephone interviews  We highlight the findings from the assessment7:  1.

ASSESSMENT OF EU TELECOM SECURITY LEGISLATION  July 2021  4  The experts who were interviewed and surveyed also provided recommendations for ENISA,  Commission, and the national authorities in the EU Member States:  1. Prioritise the implementation of new policies. In the short term, the priority is to  implement the EECC, the EU 5G Toolbox and the related recommendations.  2. More resource sharing and collaboration. To address cybersecurity skills shortages,  it is important to explore resource and capability sharing not only between authorities in  the same country and between authorities across the EU, but also between authorities  and providers, depending on the topic.  3. More technical guidance for service providers. While ENISA’s role and the work of  the ENISA ECASEC Expert Group were valued, experts from the sector asked for  more technical and operational guidelines.  4. Better incident reporting. To improve incident reporting, it is important that authorities  provide feedback in response to incident reports. In addition, definitions of what should  be reported and the thresholds for reporting should be clarified.  5. More trust and engagement between public and private sectors. Trust between  authorities and providers, as well as engagement with the private sector, are important,  including in the early stages of policymaking.  As mentioned, at the end of 2020 the Commission put forward its NIS2 proposal. The NIS2  proposal constitutes part of a broader EU cybersecurity strategy8, which addresses, among  other things, the next steps in 5G security policy and updates the existing critical infrastructure  protection legislation with a proposal for a directive on the resilience of critical entities9. Under  the NIS2 proposal, the EU telecom security provisions would be brought under the NIS  Directive. We look forward to supporting these policy discussions between the European  Commission, the EU Member States and the European Parliament.  8 European Commission, ‘New EU cybersecurity strategy and new rules to make physical and digital critical entities more  resilient’, press release, 16 December 2020 (https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_2391).  9 Proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2020 on the resilience of critical  entities, COM(2020) 829 final, 16.12.2020.  https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_2391  ASSESSMENT OF EU TELECOM SECURITY LEGISLATION  July 2021  5  TABLE OF CONTENTS  1.

INTRODUCTION  In 2020, ENISA carried out an assessment of the implementation of EU telecom security policy  across the EU. The aim was to provide policymakers with input on a number of recent policy  changes and reviews, such as the new EECC (whose Article 40 replaced Article 13a of the  Telecom Framework Directive), the review of the NIS Directive and the review of the  Commission Recommendation on Cybersecurity of 5G networks.  This assessment was carried out by interviewing and surveying a large and balanced group of  experts working in the EU telecom sector, experts working at telecommunications national  regulatory authorities (NRAs) and experts working at national authorities for the NIS Directive.  The body of this report contains the main results of this assessment.  1.1.  SCOPE  The scope of this assessment includes the security provisions of the EU legislative framework  for electronic communications (namely, Article 13a of the Telecom Framework Directive), the  new security provisions (Article 40) under the EECC, other relevant EU policies related to  telecom security, and national policies and legislation incorporating EU legislation adopted in  the EU Member States.  1.2.  TARGET AUDIENCE  The target audience of this report are policymakers at EU and national levels and telecom  security and policy/legislation experts.  1.3.  METHODOLOGY  An online survey was used to gather expert input. The survey was completed by a mixed group  of 45 experts from across the EU, including experts working in the telecom sector and experts  working at the national authorities. In addition, 21 telephone interviews were conducted with the  experts to explore the key issues in more detail. Figures 1 and 2 show how each group was  represented in the survey and interviews, respectively.

FINDINGS  This section presents the findings of the assessment. They are discussed at two levels:  1. National level. Implementation of telecommunications security legislation at national  level, including its impact, powers and capabilities of NRAs, incident reporting and  national-level collaboration.  2. EU level. Operation of telecommunications security legislation at EU level, including  harmonisation, EU-level collaboration and work of the Article 13a (now ECASEC)  Expert Group and ENISA.  2.1.  ASSESSMENT OF TELECOM LEGISLATION AT NATIONAL LEVEL  2.1.1.  Summary  Overall, collaboration at national level is considered to be strong, especially between national  telecom security authorities and the telecom sector, and between national telecom security  authorities and NIS Directive national authorities and/or national cybersecurity incident  response teams (CSIRTs). In addition, experts agree that security measures and risk  management are good in the telecom sector.  On the other hand, there are mixed opinions on the sufficiency of national authorities’  resources. Moreover, there are concerns about collaboration at national level between telecom  security authorities and data protection authorities, and between telecom operators and  operators of essential services.

The authority has sufficient cybersecurity expertise.  The authority has sufficient resources.  The authority offers useful implementation guidelines.  There is a culture of risk management in the telecom sector.  Security measures taken in the telecom sector are appropriate.  The right incidents are being reported to authorities.  Incident reporting has been useful in improving cybersecurity.  Collaboration between national telecom security authority and telecom sector is good.  Collaboration between telecom security authority and NIS Directive authority and/or national CSIRT is good.  Collaboration between telecom security authority and data protection authorities is good.  Collaboration between telecom providers is good.  Collaboration between telecom providers and operators of essential services (energy, finance, etc) is good.

Positive impact of the legislation  EU telecom security legislation has achieved a culture of risk management  EU legislation has increased the level  of maturity in telecoms security in  many countries  There is a culture of risk management across EU Member  States and the security measures taken are considered  appropriate. The survey results underpin this opinion as 84%  of participants agreed that there is a culture of risk  management in the telecommunications sector.  Security measures are generally  appropriate  Only about 9% of the respondents disagreed with this  statement. More than half of the respondents who disagreed  with the appropriateness of security measures were CSIRT  representatives.  Figure 4: Security measures taken in the telecom sector are appropriate  However, legislation is complex and guidance is missing  National legislation is complex Experts found legislation definitions, obligations and terms  rather incoherent or unclear. They noted that permissive  definitions or a lack thereof under the old EU regulatory  framework allowed different interpretations at national level,  which could hinder the operation of providers that are present  in more than one Member State.  The most commonly invoked example was that of an  ‘incident’10. One of the interviewees commented that incidents  ‘are seen and interpreted differently by many companies’.  Closely related to this was the uncertainty around the reporting  thresholds and the treatment of digital service providers,  domain name systems and Internet exchange points (IXPs).  One of the experts noted that the last two services could  potentially be within the scope of both the EECC and the NIS  Directive.  10 ‘Incidents’ were not defined in the Telecom Framework Directive, which may have contributed to the problem. The EECC  introduces the definition of a ‘security incident’ in Article 2(42): “security incident” means an event having an actual adverse  effect on the security of electronic communications networks or services’.  ASSESSMENT OF EU TELECOM SECURITY LEGISLATION  July 2021  11  In some countries, this is compensated  by guidelines  However, in some cases, no additional materials are provided  to service providers. In addition, based on the findings of the  survey, one quarter of the respondents thought that the  guidelines provided by NRAs are not useful enough as they  are considered too high level and lack operational and  technical details.  Overlapping obligations and  requirements have been reported  In some countries, service providers are supervised by and are  forced to collaborate with more than one authority regarding  network security, for instance the NRA and a cybersecurity  agency.  It is not always clear which specific  authority a certain service provider  falls under  For example, in some cases, telecommunications operators  are also IXPs, which raises the question of whether their IXP  operations fall within the remit of the NRA (EECC) or the  competent authority under the NIS Directive.  2.1.3.  Capabilities and powers of national authorities  85% of the survey respondents agreed  that the NRA has sufficient power  In addition, some respondents highlighted the continuous  adaptation of the NRA’s capabilities to technical changes.  However, many stakeholders were  concerned about the scarcity of  resources and expertise  37% of the survey respondents indicated that authorities’ lack  of resources is an issue and 40% found that NRAs have  insufficient expertise.  Resource sharing and collaboration  between authorities helps  For example, NRAs can receive support from national CSIRTs  or other security services, such as crisis centres and  intelligence services.  2.1.4.  Incident reporting and audits  Generally, national-level incident  reporting is working well. It has also  been useful in improving cybersecurity  69% of the online survey respondents agreed or strongly agreed  that the right incidents are reported to authorities. Only a small  percentage of respondents disagreed with this statement and  20% of respondents had no opinion on the topic.  However, some incidents are not being  reported or are missing essential  details  Three main reasons were identified by the respondents:   diverse interpretation of incidents within the scope,   reporting rules focus on the duration of service interruption  and, as a result, certain incidents may not be reported (e.g.  data leaks), and   lack of trust between the authorities and telecom providers.  Incident-reporting obligations and  processes may be fragmented  Some respondents highlighted that there may be reporting  obligations to multiple authorities, or the root cause of an incident  may not be easy to define, which results in the same incident  being reported to more than one authority.  A noteworthy example of good practice is the universal reporting  tool developed by the Danish Centre for Cyber Security (CFCS),  which sends the report to the relevant authority.  ASSESSMENT OF EU TELECOM SECURITY LEGISLATION  July 2021  12  It is uncommon to receive feedback on  reported incidents  As a result, the interviewees sometimes viewed the incident-  reporting obligations as an ‘administrative burden’. The  interviewees noted that receiving feedback would significantly  increase the utility of reporting.  Concern: frequency of audits varies considerably  Some countries carry out 10–15 audits per year, while others conduct more than 250. In general, the view is  that authorities have enough power to conduct or order audits, monitor procedures, perform supervision and  collect the necessary information.  2.1.5.  Collaboration at national level  National-level collaboration is working well. Figure 5 presents the general findings on  collaboration between stakeholders. This is followed by presentation of some of the highlights of  the online survey and the interviews.  Figure 5: Collaboration between the following stakeholders is good  Collaboration between authorities at national level is improving  In most Member States, competent  authorities recognised the increasing  importance of joint work  Collaboration between different telecommunications-related  authorities is mostly considered to be good. There is also the  intention to combine the capabilities and expertise of the  different authorities, and confidence that this can be achieved.  Some challenges have been identified Challenges exist as a result of the different focuses and  approaches of the different authorities involved. For example,  while some stakeholders noted that collaborations between  NRAs and CSIRTs are fruitful when they do occur, others  claimed that such cooperation is still limited.  Other stakeholders noted the problem of overlaps in  responsibilities, which sometimes occurs between NRAs and  other relevant authorities. Nevertheless, the stakeholders  surveyed expressed their commitment to resolving any such  overlaps.  ASSESSMENT OF EU TELECOM SECURITY LEGISLATION  July 2021  13  Collaboration between national authorities and telecom providers is good  Major telecommunication service  providers and the NRAs communicate on  a regular basis  The regularity of the cooperation varies: from cooperation  ‘based on necessity’ to ‘monthly meetings with the  competent authorities’ about specific topics (e.g.  implementation of the 5G Toolbox).  Some interesting examples of good  practice have been reported in select  Member States  For example, in Portugal, a collaboration platform  coordinated by the National Communications Authority  (ANACOM) has been set up for telecom operators’ security  experts, where they can share and discuss their main  issues.  Building and maintaining trust is key Some stakeholders declared that the relationship between  telecom operators and the authorities may not be fully  transparent, as the operators are usually careful with the  information they share.  The majority of the authorities recognised the importance of  building trust. They reported making significant efforts to  improve collaboration by increasing the level of  transparency in their decision-making.  Collaboration between telecom service providers is good  Telecom service providers have  expressed a desire to increase the level  of security-related cooperation  Apart from bilateral exchanges, some service providers  collaborate in informal groups or communities, where they  share information on security topics.  In some countries, there are formalised national cooperation  groups, which are sometimes even led by the relevant  authority.  The quality of such collaboration varies In some countries, telecom service providers actively  cooperate to solve major security incidents. However, in  other countries they do not, reportedly because of ‘strong  competition’.  ASSESSMENT OF EU TELECOM SECURITY LEGISLATION  July 2021  14  2.2.  ASSESSMENT OF TELECOM LEGISLATION AT EU LEVEL  2.2.1.  Summary  In summary, experts gave positive feedback on:   the added value of the Article 13a Expert Group (now called ECASEC); and   ENISA’s role in supporting the implementation of EU telecom security legislation, as  well as ENISA’s technical guidelines.  On the other hand, experts highlighted issues with harmonisation and consistency. They did not  agree that national capabilities in telecom security are comparable across the EU. In addition,  experts expressed concerns about the consistency of telecom security requirements across the  EU, as well as the consistency between EU telecom security legislation and the NIS Directive.  Figure 6: EU level – harmonisation and collaboration  4  2  2  2  20  29  29  31  33  11  33  51  38  62  58  38  43  40  49  24  9  18  9  2  9  2  7  16  7  2  16  22  36  36  42  9  11  24  24  0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100  Technically the telecom security requirements are similar across the EU.  The national capabilities on telecom security are comparable across the EU.  EU telecom security legislation is consistent with the NIS Directive.  EU collaboration between telecom providers is good (EU ISACs, industry groups, e.g.)  Across the EU collaboration between the telecom security authorities and the authorities for the NIS Directive, the NIS Cooperation group is good.  ENISA is successful in supporting the implementation of telecom security legislation across the EU.  ENISA guidelines on telecom security policy are useful (e.g. Article 13a guidelines).  ENISA is effective in facilitating harmonization and collaboration across the EU.  The ENISA Article 13a expert group brings added value.  Strongly agree Agree Disagree Strongly disagree Don't know, no opinion  % % % % % % % % % % %  ASSESSMENT OF EU TELECOM SECURITY LEGISLATION  July 2021  15  2.2.2.  Harmonisation of implementation across the EU  Article 13a was considered rather general  in scope  Surveyed experts reported that this freedom of interpretation  of Article 13a has led to dissimilar telecommunication  security requirements across the Member States.  Article 13a Working Group guidelines  have helped to an extent  However, one of the experts interviewed noted that there was  ‘no official endorsement from the side of the Commission,  which leads to unharmonised processes in Member States’.  Therefore, beyond legal requirements, some experts argued  that it would be beneficial to standardise the implementation  too. This would be particularly helpful to cross-border  operators.  Figure 7: National capabilities on telecom sector security are comparable across the EU  2.2.3.  Collaboration across the EU  EU-level collaboration is generally considered to be good, but it appears to have limited  exposure. Many stakeholders could not answer the question on whether EU collaboration is  good or had no opinion on the matter.  Figure 8: EU level collaboration is good between the following stakeholders  ASSESSMENT OF EU TELECOM SECURITY LEGISLATION  July 2021  16  Most respondents had no opinion on collaboration between the NRAs, the NIS Directive  competent authorities and the NIS Directive authorities. This suggests that there is a need to  establish better links between these two groups of authorities.  Most respondents considered EU-level collaboration between telecom providers to be good  This may result from operations in  multiple Member States  Strong EU-level collaboration between telecom providers may  be connected to the fact that some major providers operate in  multiple Member States, which makes it important for them to  cooperate and harmonise processes.  34% of respondents could not answer the  question, or had no opinion  Those respondents were mainly CSIRT and NRA  representatives.  2.2.4.  ENISA and Article 13a Expert Group  Role of Article 13a (now ECASEC) Expert Group described as ‘extremely beneficial’  Nevertheless, areas for improvement  have been identified  Some telecom service providers did not find the work of the  Article 13a Expert Group sufficiently transparent.  Some respondents thought that there needs to be stronger  collaboration between the Article 13a Expert Group and the  NIS Cooperation Group.  Despite its achievements, the Article 13a  (now ECASEC) Expert Group does not  have a legal status  Some stakeholders also noted that, despite their usefulness,  there has been no official approval of the Article 13a technical  guidelines (now the revised ECASEC guidelines) by the  European Commission. The stakeholders added that this  results in unharmonised procedures.  ENISA plays a valuable role, but there is room for improvement  Positive feedback concerned facilitation  of knowledge sharing, incorporation of  legislation and establishment of EU-wide  guidelines  82% of participants surveyed agreed that ENISA is successful  in supporting the implementation of telecommunications  security legislation, 87% agreed that the guidelines provided  by ENISA are useful and 67% agreed that ENISA is effective  in facilitating harmonisation and collaboration across the EU.  It was also claimed that ENISA is especially good at bringing  together the different Member States. 74% of survey  participants thought that the Article 13a (now ECASEC)  Expert Group brings added value.  ENISA’s guidelines are at too high a level Some stakeholders expressed the need for more operational  and technical guidance.  ENISA’s powers and human resources  are insufficient  Some stakeholders expressed concerns that ENISA might  lack sufficient human resources to manage the more  technical and operational tasks requested by many Member  States.

GOOD PRACTICE EXAMPLES  The experts gave examples of good practice during this assessment, either via the online  survey or during the telephone interviews. Some of these suggestions are provided in the  following sections.  Guidelines to assist the sector with implementing primary legislation  Resource and capability sharing  Single incident-reporting platform  The Portuguese NRA, ANACOM, had introduced some additional secondary legislation to  support telecom providers regarding regulatory interpretation and thus create a basis for  more agile responses and approaches. Each telecom operator has to have an employee  who is responsible for telecommunication regulation and security. In addition, each  telecommunication operator has to have a contact point who is available 24/7; this is an  operational position. A collaboration platform is also coordinated by ANACOM, where  stakeholders can share and discuss security issues.  Resource sharing within the public sector. For inspections, the Belgian NRA, BIPT, can  obtain help from other departments within the organisation, such as the controls-related  department or the legal department. When specific cyber capabilities are needed, the Belgian  NRA can obtain support from the national CSIRT or other security services, such as the crisis  centre and intelligence services. In cases of both internal and cross-stakeholder types of  collaborations and dynamic resource allocation, the effectiveness of task and responsibility  fulfilment has been enhanced.  Resource sharing between the public and private sectors. The National Cyber Security  Centre in Ireland has an extensive cooperation network with the private sector (e.g. with  Amazon and Microsoft) and the partners provide technical assistance.  Combining responsibilities and competences for more streamlined operations. In  Finland, Traficom combines the competences of the NRA, CSIRT and cybersecurity agency to  maximise the available resources and streamline the execution of tasks.  To address the issue of reporting incidents to multiple authorities, the Danish CFCS has  developed a universal reporting tool, which is more efficient at sending reports to whichever  authorities need to be informed.  ASSESSMENT OF EU TELECOM SECURITY LEGISLATION  July 2021  19  Collaborative approach towards the private sector  Collaboration through common projects  The Radiocommunications Agency Netherlands uses a collaborative approach to build trust  with telecommunication service providers. It tends to avoid the use of fines as a means of  control because it considers it more important to create a learning curve, create the right  mindset and help service providers improve their cybersecurity and risk-management  processes.  The Belgian Institute for Postal Services and Telecommunications tries to carry out  inspections and audits in a cooperative way (e.g. providing regular communication and  feedback), as, ultimately, it has the same objective as the telecommunication service  providers, which is to increase security in Belgium. It noted that those in security teams may  find this process annoying initially; however, they realise that the reports help them to obtain  resources and organisational support for their projects and improve their security standing.  Project-based collaboration is a good way to build trust. Belgium provided an example of such a  process. In the context of the NIS Directive, there was a need for an incident notification  platform. The Belgian Institute for Postal Services and Telecommunications offered the use of  its own telecommunication incident notification platform to avoid the need for all authorities to  develop their own. It worked closely with the Centre for Cyber Security Belgium to share its  incident notification platform and practices. This helped to build trust and improve collaboration  between the different authorities involved.  ASSESSMENT OF EU TELECOM SECURITY LEGISLATION  July 2021  20  4. CHALLENGES AND  RECOMMENDATIONS  This section gives an overview of the perceived future challenges for the sector and lists several  recommendations for ENISA and the national authorities.  4.1.  CHALLENGES FOR THE SECTOR  The key challenges for the EU telecom sector are:   next-generation networks, such as network function virtualisation (NFV) and 5G   cybersecurity skills shortages   dependencies on vendors and suppliers.  These challenges are described in more detail below.  Complexity of new technologies  such as NFV and 5G  The most frequently mentioned challenge was adaptation to and  implications of the use of next-generation network technology, such as  Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and 5G.  5G not only constitutes a technology change. It also introduces new  business models, new vendors and network architecture changes.  One expert noted: ‘New types of technologies and new types of  services are gaining ground, such as machine-to-machine (M2M) and  over-the-top (OTT), which brings up different types of security issues.’  Shortages of cybersecurity skills 89% of the online survey respondents identified the availability of  cybersecurity skills as one of the biggest challenges in the sector.  Some stakeholders reported that this skills shortage is affecting their  core operations. Without the required technical expertise, many  security challenges become even harder to tackle. For example, even  if a public authority has the power to impose specific measures,  exercising this power (e.g. effective monitoring) becomes very difficult  without the right expertise.  Security gaps in the supply  chain  Some of the main challenges highlighted were supplier dependence,  lack of security requirements for suppliers, outsourcing and geopolitical  issues.  According to the online survey and the interviews, many telecom  service providers move parts of their operations outside their own  countries because of more favourable legislative or business  environments.  This makes it difficult to oversee or influence critical security factors,  and it introduces geopolitics into the security aspect of the supply  chain.  ASSESSMENT OF EU TELECOM SECURITY LEGISLATION  July 2021  21  4.2.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ENISA AND THE NATIONAL AUTHORITIES  Experts made several recommendations for ENISA and the national authorities.  Implement new legislation,  regulations and related  guidelines in a timely and  harmonised manner  Timely implementation of the EECC, the EU 5G Toolbox and any  related recommendations was identified as the main short-term goal.  Experts stressed the need for simplicity and harmonised approaches.  The Article 13a Expert Group (now ECASEC) was seen as making a  positive contribution to this harmonisation.  A priority topic going forward for the Article 13a Expert Group (now  ECASEC) and the 5G Toolbox is supply chain security and risks.  Developing EU-level standardisation has also been identified as  important.  Increase collaboration between  private and public sectors – at  both EU level and national level  Experts would like to see better and earlier involvement of the private  sector, including at the earliest stage of policymaking. This includes  providing the private sector with more exposure to ENISA’s work. This  would contribute to the private sector’s understanding of its own  obligations and the steps it needs to take to fulfil them.  The majority of authorities also recognised the need for deeper  collaboration between private and public sectors and reported that  considerable efforts are being made to build trust.  Provide more technical  guidelines and share them with  stakeholders as soon as  possible  Technical guidelines provided by ENISA and national authorities are  considered useful. However, stakeholders noted that they would find  it beneficial to have more detailed guidelines that break the legislation  down into specific operational requirements.  Telecom providers expressed the need for such guidelines to be  made available as soon as possible to facilitate the smooth  implementation of legislative requirements.  Review incident-reporting focus  areas, carefully define  thresholds and avoid obligation  overlaps  Avoiding unclear and overlapping obligations on telecom providers  from different authorities was one of the key recommendations. For  example, as in the Danish (CFCS) good practice example, this could  be achieved by creating a single reporting platform where telecom  providers could upload their reports, which could then be accessed by  relevant authorities.  When defining reporting thresholds, stakeholders recommended  considering the inclusion of other aspects of network integrity besides  focusing on the duration of service interruption. Experts also stated  that they would like to see harmonised reporting thresholds across  the EU, based on services’ characteristics.  Provide regular and detailed  feedback on reported incidents  Telecom providers expressed the need for regular and detailed  feedback on the incidents they report. They reasoned that such  feedback could contribute to creating a learning environment.  ASSESSMENT OF EU TELECOM SECURITY LEGISLATION  July 2021  22  5. CONCLUSIONS  In this report, we have provided an overview of an assessment of the EU telecom security  legislation that was carried out in 2020. In this section, we list the main conclusions and  recommendations.  5.1.  CONCLUSIONS FROM THE SURVEY AND INTERVIEWS  1. EU telecom security legislation has a positive impact. Based on the responses  from our stakeholders, security provisions in the EU regulatory framework, specifically  in the Telecom Framework Directive, have successfully contributed to a high level of  cybersecurity in the telecommunications sector. Indeed, most respondents were of the  view that, in general, there is a culture of risk management across EU Member States  and the security measures taken are appropriate.  2. The legislative framework is complex. Notwithstanding the above, some  stakeholders find national legislation rather complex. Moreover, some of the experts  surveyed reported that the generality of Article 13a of the Telecom Framework  Directive has led to dissimilar security requirements across the Member States.  3. Authorities have powers, but few resources. The powers of the national telecom  security authorities are considered sufficient, but there are concerns about scarcity of  resources and expertise.  4. Incident reporting could be improved. In general, national-level incident reporting is  working well, but there is room for improvement. Apart from the scarcity of feedback on  reported incidents, doubts sometimes arise over which authority a specific incident  should be reported to, which results in telecom operators occasionally reporting the  same incident to more than one authority.  5. Collaboration at national and EU levels is good. In the latter context, stakeholders  recognised the positive contribution of ENISA and the Article 13a (ECASEC) Expert  Group. Nevertheless, some challenges were identified, such as the issue of  involvement of the private sector in policymaking at both national and EU levels and  the relatively low exposure of the private sector to existing EU-level collaboration.  5.2.  RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE EXPERTS  The experts we engaged with also made recommendations for ENISA and the national  authorities.  1. Prioritise the implementation of new policies and legislation. To keep fostering the  culture of risk management, timely implementation of the EECC, the EU 5G Toolbox  and any related recommendations was identified as the main short-term goal.  2. Address skills shortages with resource sharing and collaboration. To address  cybersecurity skills shortages, it is important to explore resource and capability  sharing. Several resource- and capability-sharing models have been identified to  address this, for example resource sharing among public sector stakeholders and  compensating resource shortages with private sector collaborations.  3. More technical guidance for service providers. While the stakeholders described  the outputs of ENISA and the Article 13a (ECASEC) Expert Group as ‘extremely  beneficial’, they also expressed the need for more detailed guidelines that break down  ASSESSMENT OF EU TELECOM SECURITY LEGISLATION  July 2021  23  the legislation into specific operational requirements. At national level, this report also  provides examples of good practice to assist with the interpretation of primary  legislation, such as the use of supplementary regulatory instruments and guidelines,  and the provision of more direct assistance – such as collaboration groups or contact  points.  4. Improving and streamlining incident reporting. In addition to clarifying incident-  reporting obligations at national level, this report highlights some examples of good  practice to address the problem of telecom operators reporting the same incident to  more than one authority. Moreover, to improve incident reporting, it is important that  the authorities provide feedback in response to the submitted reports.  5. Better engagement with the private sector. Regarding both national- and EU-level  collaboration, stakeholders would like to see better and earlier involvement of the  private sector, including at the earliest stage of policymaking. There may also be a  need to increase the level of dissemination of information to the private sector to  increase exposure to EU-level collaboration. Finally, the majority of the authorities  recognised the importance of building trust between them and the private sector  entities they supervise.  We would like to repeat our expressions of gratitude for the valuable feedback provided by the  experts who were surveyed and interviewed. We look forward to continuing to work with the  sector and the national authorities to address the issues identified in the assessment, and we  will follow up on the recommendations made.

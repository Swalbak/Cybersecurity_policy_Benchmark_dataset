This analysis aims to  indicate the main trends in the expeditious development of CTI by  providing relevant references and summarizing the next steps required  to advance this topic during the coming years.  In January 2020, ENISA organized its CTI-EU community-bonding event.  At this event, various presentations demonstrated the current state of  play of CTI at commercial, institutional and user levels. Presentations,  discussions and CTI vendor demonstrations addressed the status of  products, approaches and practices and indicate existing issues. It is  evident that CTI has achieved a sufficient maturity and critical mass  of CTI-related material is now available, e.g. through current practices,  tools and processes.  It seems that the next challenge in CTI will be to digest, consolidate  and disseminate existing practices to achieve more extensive use in a  cost-efficient and synergetic manner. The main opportunities in this  respect lie in sharing non-competitive CTI practices, requirements, tools  and information. Apart from this, identifying new stakeholders entering  the CTI business - both producers and consumers – will enhance  capabilities, identify standard CTI requirements and establish CTI sharing  capabilities in a timely manner. Through both its CTI-EU event and  cooperation with various EU stakeholders, ENISA plans to strengthen  synergies and disseminate CTI good practices.  _Developments in the area of CTI  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/2019-cti-eu/2019-cti-eu-bonding-eu-cyber-threat-intelligence  3  _CTI tools, material and practices  Commission Horizon 2020 research and framework_  Various CTI-related H2020 projects have been completed or are  still in progress. They have already consumed significant funds  and delivered a variety of tools and practices for producing,  consuming and using CTI.  Practices of standardisation bodies, international,  organisations, governments, industry, academia  and individual users_ A variety of good practices have been  developed covering: CTI methods, frameworks and process  models1,2,3 maturity issues,  requirements, surveys of use,  evaluation of tools8,9,10, approaches to developing CTI11,12 ,etc.  Open-source CTI offerings_ Various open-source feeds13  and tools supporting OpenCTI14, are important for producers and  consumers, allowing for free access to valuable CTI at low cost.  Open-source CTI tools (and practices)_ Numerous open-  source tools, practices and articles have been published15,16, that  provide practical approaches to CTI analysis and dissemination  by using open-source tools.17,18,19  4  _CTI training opportunities  CYBRARY_ Introduction to Cyber Threat  Intelligence.21  INSIKT_ Learning more about the “Cyber Threat  Intelligence Certification Protocols”.22  SANS_ FOR578: Cyber Threat Intelligence.23  FIRST.org_ Cyber Threat Intelligence Symposium.24  Gov.uk_Cyber_ Threat Intelligence Training  (CRTIA).25  ENISA-FORTH_ NIS (Network and Information  Security) Summer School – Cyber Threat Intelligence  Training.26  Overview  5  ENISA-FORTH Summer School 2019   CTI-EU Community Event 2020   https://nis-summer-school.enisa.europa.eu/2019/index.html https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/2019-cti-eu/2019-cti-eu-bonding-eu-cyber-threat-intelligence  6  Overview  _Gaps in available CTI material and  practices  Despite the higher maturity levels achieved in CTI practices and tools  and the provision and consumption of CTI, there are still gaps in CTI, in  particular regarding various use-cases, sectoral CTI, and CTI types  (operational, tactical, strategic), among others. Such a significant gap has  been identified in discussion within ENISA CTI forum concerning the  availability of up-to-date CTI from attacks on critical sectors and critical  services. It has been agreed that CTI elements (e.g. tools, techniques and  procedures or TTPs) included in various international good practices and  frameworks (e.g. ATT&CK 28  ) need to evolve to include intelligence from a  wider spectrum of attacks. Particularly pressing are the CTI elements of  various sectors and service-provisioning infrastructures and offerings.  An example of this is the lack of emphasis on attacks on cloud-  computing. 29  Similar requests may emerge from infrastructures that are  either emerging (e.g. 5G 30  ), or are of specialized nature yet play an  essential role in critical industrial systems for example industrial control  systems (ICSs) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)  systems). 31  Although existing frameworks may contain various elements used in  TTPs targeting such systems, their applicability in various sectors will  need to be expanded to take account of the peculiarities of TTPs, such as  the abuse of available application programming interfaces (APIs) and  exploitation of core assets. Apart from TTPs, elements that will require  further consideration are guidance on prevention, detection and  mitigation practices for these sectors.  7  This will facilitate the development of the necessary capabilities and  enable the use of CTI specifically crafted for these sectors. The main  barrier to the dissemination of actionable CTI for various platform types  and infrastructures is the lapse time between an incident, producing  related CTI and populating this information to open-source tools.  Tighter coordination and cooperation among the parties involved will  reduce the time before CTI is made available to the wider user  community. Building trust among participating entities is key to the  accelerating the CTI supply chain. Identifying relevant players and  mobilising the CTI community are important to facilitate these  interactions.  Another barrier to building the necessary capabilities is the availability  and consumption of CTI within various cybersecurity management  activities. Examples include cybersecurity crisis management, incident  management, incident response, threat hunting and vulnerability  management. This deficiency was assessed in the previous ENISA Threat  Landscape (ETL) report 32  by means of asynchronous cycles among  cybersecurity disciplines and continues to persist.  Concluding this section, one should note that the deficiencies described  are not due to a lack of CTI knowledge per se but rather to the lengthy  cross- and intra-sector communication and coordination cycles for  exchanging CTI knowledge.  8  _Issues emerging from building a CTI  infrastructure  CTI is offered in some broad categories according to users’ requirements  for CTI, namely as operational, tactical and strategic. Existing commercial  offerings consisting of tools for collection, maintenance, analysis and  dissemination of CTI, CTI feeds, threat intelligence platforms (TIPs), etc.,  support some of these CTI types. However, there is no one-size-fits-all  approach.  Existing offerings concentrate on operational and tactical  CTI, while strategic CTI is mostly offered independently.  However, the boundaries between CTI are rather blurred. This has the  effect that, when a CTI consumer wishes to build up a capability and the  corresponding environment to manage CTI, selecting suitable elements  is not straightforward. This is mainly because CTI service provisioning  and the existing CTI-tool landscape is somewhat fragmented. In  attempting to build up such an environment, CTI users will need to do so  by selecting a ‘best of breed’ system from existing offerings. Their  selection has to fulfil CTI requirements and the CTI practices and  processes applied, while taking into the account their current and  prospective CTI maturity objectives.  Overview  Although some criteria/requirements for selecting TIPs have been  developed 33  for various CTI user profiles, similar requirements will be  necessary for further CTI products, services and tools. Ideally, such  requirements will focus on various levels of user maturity, levels of  expenditure and types of CTI. Similar criteria/requirements are necessary  for various other elements of a CTI infrastructure, such as tools, good  practices, sharing platforms, etc.  In the long run, OpenCTI 14  may be a good solution for addressing the  issues caused by the fragmentation of CTI offerings, given its inherent  capability to integrate CTI sources of various types into a single tooling  environment.  In the coming year, ENISA and CTI stakeholders will put  some effort into assessing the CTI infrastructure  requirements and checking how they can be fulfilled by  existing CTI products. This will begin with an attempt to  establish a CTI infrastructure for ENISA’s internal needs for  developing a CTI platform for strategic CTI.  9  10  Overview  The incorporation of CTI into key cybersecurity disciplines has already  been identified as an issue by members of the CTI community. This is  particularly the case in security management activities and components  that are related to highly dynamic environments with increased  exposure, such as user devices (e.g. USIMS, security tokens, mobile  devices, industrial systems, e-health devices, etc.). Other related  disciplines that may significantly benefit from CTI are certification  activities, crisis management practices, cyber-forensics and incident  response, among others.  ENISA recognizes 35  the need for the inclusion of CTI in the area of  certification. In 2020, ENISA established an ad-hoc working group  aiming to integrate risk management and CTI with practices for  identifying assurance levels.  In particular, the CSA states that ‘The assurance level shall be  commensurate with the level of the risk associated with the intended  use of the ICT product, ICT service or ICT process, in terms of the  probability and impact of an incident’ (Art. 52(1)).  This makes it evident that CTI needs to flow into the certification process  using an assurance level evaluation. Although, parts of CTI are envisaged  in certification standards 36  by using an ‘attacker profile’, this concept  comprises a small part of available CTI.  _Leveraging CTI in related cybersecurity  disciplines  11  The work performed by ENISA’s ad-hoc working group consists of  combining information from risk and threat assessments (CTI) to group  protection requirements appropriately and map them on to various  assurance levels. The mapping will be based on various risk levels that  emerge from the threat exposure of assets and, at the same time, give  rise to proposals for the number and strength of mitigation controls.  These controls will drive the selection of security functions that will be  assigned to multiple assurance levels and will be subject to  implementation by the various targets of certification (ToCs).  ENISA’s work on this topic is being undertaken with the  support of an expert group, combining risk management,  CTI and certification skills. The work started in April 2020  and will be completed in the third quarter of 2020. The  results of this work will be published by ENISA.  12  Overview  From a representative CTI survey 7 , numerous interesting conclusions on  the current uptake of CTI practices and tools can be drawn. Among other  things, the survey reflects the current state-of-play of CTI capabilities, the  types of CTI used types of CTI used among stakeholders, the interplay of  CTI practices with other processes in organisations and the use-cases of  CTI tools.  In this discussion, the results of the survey are extrapolated to the  experiences gained by ENISA within its own (strategic) CTI activities and  the feedback from various CTI stakeholders within the EU and European  CTI forums 36  . In this context, the focus is on identifying requirements,  collecting information, producing strategic CTI, use of tools and practices  and integration with other relevant processes. In this regard, we would  like to highlight the following points.   One of the main conclusion from this report is that semi-automation  of CTI production is an important tool: while automation of  information ingestion is increasing – despite an increase in CTI  consumption by vendors – manual activities are still building the core  of organisations’ CTI production.   Information aggregation, analysis and dissemination activities are  managed using widely available tools such as spreadsheets, mail  and open-source management platforms, which is indicative of the  efficiency of low-cost solutions.  _Results of a comprehensive CTI survey  13   The importance of defining CTI requirements is understood by the CTI  user-community. This is in response to the repeated pleas of CTI  experts 5,6  about recognising the significance of CTI requirements and  shows that the CTI community has taken their advice. It is also interesting  to see that a significant amount of CTI requirements reflects the needs of  business and executives. This is an indication that CTI is becoming part of  decision making at business and management levels.   A combination of consumption and production of CTI is the prevailing  method for building up an internal CTI knowledge base. An increase in  organisations’ own CTI production is the main trend, especially for CTI  derived from their own analysis of raw data and contextualised threat  alerts. Consumption from publicly available sources is becoming a trend,  considering the growing use of available CTI (open-source CTI feeds as  indicated in the point below).   Open-source information gathering is the most widely used ingestion  method, followed by threat feeds from CTI vendors. This is a clear  upwards trend in 2020, indicating that CTI users are investing in their own  capabilities to produce CTI that complies with their requirements.   Threat detection is assessed as the main use case for CTI. Although  indictors of compromise (IoCs) are still the most important elements of  CTI in threat detection and threat response, threat behaviour and  adversary tactics (TTPs), seem to be responsible for upwards trends in  the use of CTI in organisations.   Measuring the effectiveness of CTI is still a difficult task, and only a  small percentage of CTI users (4%) implement processes to measure CTI  efficiency. It is argued, that although tooling may add value in CTI  analysis, the analyst’s skills are most important for successful  implementation of CTI. An interesting finding regarding the level of  satisfaction is the low rating given to the value of machine learning  functions.  14  Overview  Having regard to all these developments in the area of CTI, the following  conclusions can be drawn. From these conclusions, some next steps are  indicated, at least from the point of view of ENISA, where CTI is going to  be strengthened in accordance with its new mandate, but also taking  into account the developments observed in its stakeholder communities,  such as Member States, the European Commission and other European  bodies, vendors and CTI end users:   Given the increasing number of EU and Member States stakeholders,  cooperation and coordination of EU-wide CTI activities is key.  While building on synergies may reduce CTI costs, it also increases  trust among CTI players, thus enabling the sharing of CTI and good  practices. ENISA will promote cooperation with various stakeholders  by initiating the identification of CTI requirements. This will include  multiple stakeholders groups within the EU ecosystem of  organisations (i.e. Commission, EU bodies, agencies and Member  States).   As the relevance of CTI for strategic and political decision-making is  understood, it is important to facilitate its connection with  geopolitical information and cyber-physical systems. This will  enable the inclusion of CTI in decision-making processes, but it will  also allow its context to be expanded to the identify hybrid threats.  _Conclusions and next steps  15   Integrating CTI with security management processes will help CTI to  proliferate in related areas and will contribute to the timely  identification, detection and prevention of threats. An immediate effect  will be to increase the agility of rather long-lasting processes (e.g.  certification, risk assessment). At the same time, CTI will facilitate  emergency decision-making (e.g. crisis management) by providing  evidence on exposure to cyber threats.   To better respond to the increasing role of CTI, ENISA will be working on  building a comprehensive CTI programme. The ENISA CTI  programme will bundle internal skills horizontally to enrol all related  stakeholders in all phases of CTI production and dissemination, and  develop a CTI infrastructure that will be used for both internal and  training purposes.   Investment in some basic CTI concepts, in particular CTI maturity and  threat hierarchies, is considered very useful for increasing the uptake  of CTI. ENISA – together with its EU partners - will invest some effort  into developing a CTI maturity model. Moreover, ENISA consolidate and  disseminate useful multi-purpose CTI material such as threat  hierarchies that can be used in other areas (e.g. certification, risk  management, sectoral landscapes, etc.).  Some of the above conclusions and next steps will be the subject of  ENISA’s work in the area of CTI during the coming years. 35  16  1.

    "original document": "ENISA ETL2020 - Cyber Threat Intelligence Overview  From January 2019 to April 2020  Cyber Threat  Intelligence  Overview ENISA Threat Landscape  Overview  2  In this report, we assess the state-of-play of cyber threat intelligence  (CTI) as a dynamic cybersecurity domain. This analysis aims to  indicate the main trends in the expeditious development of CTI by  providing relevant references and summarizing the next steps required  to advance this topic during the coming years.  In January 2020, ENISA organized its CTI-EU community-bonding event.  At this event, various presentations demonstrated the current state of  play of CTI at commercial, institutional and user levels. Presentations,  discussions and CTI vendor demonstrations addressed the status of  products, approaches and practices and indicate existing issues. It is  evident that CTI has achieved a sufficient maturity and critical mass  of CTI-related material is now available, e.g. through current practices,  tools and processes.  It seems that the next challenge in CTI will be to digest, consolidate  and disseminate existing practices to achieve more extensive use in a  cost-efficient and synergetic manner. The main opportunities in this  respect lie in sharing non-competitive CTI practices, requirements, tools  and information. Apart from this, identifying new stakeholders entering  the CTI business - both producers and consumers – will enhance  capabilities, identify standard CTI requirements and establish CTI sharing  capabilities in a timely manner. Through both its CTI-EU event and  cooperation with various EU stakeholders, ENISA plans to strengthen  synergies and disseminate CTI good practices.  _Developments in the area of CTI  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/2019-cti-eu/2019-cti-eu-bonding-eu-cyber-threat-intelligence  3  _CTI tools, material and practices  Commission Horizon 2020 research and framework_  Various CTI-related H2020 projects have been completed or are  still in progress. They have already consumed significant funds  and delivered a variety of tools and practices for producing,  consuming and using CTI.  Practices of standardisation bodies, international,  organisations, governments, industry, academia  and individual users_ A variety of good practices have been  developed covering: CTI methods, frameworks and process  models1,2,3 maturity issues,  requirements, surveys of use,  evaluation of tools8,9,10, approaches to developing CTI11,12 ,etc.  Open-source CTI offerings_ Various open-source feeds13  and tools supporting OpenCTI14, are important for producers and  consumers, allowing for free access to valuable CTI at low cost.  Open-source CTI tools (and practices)_ Numerous open-  source tools, practices and articles have been published15,16, that  provide practical approaches to CTI analysis and dissemination  by using open-source tools.17,18,19  4  _CTI training opportunities  CYBRARY_ Introduction to Cyber Threat  Intelligence.21  INSIKT_ Learning more about the “Cyber Threat  Intelligence Certification Protocols”.22  SANS_ FOR578: Cyber Threat Intelligence.23  FIRST.org_ Cyber Threat Intelligence Symposium.24  Gov.uk_Cyber_ Threat Intelligence Training  (CRTIA).25  ENISA-FORTH_ NIS (Network and Information  Security) Summer School – Cyber Threat Intelligence  Training.26  Overview  5  ENISA-FORTH Summer School 2019   CTI-EU Community Event 2020   https://nis-summer-school.enisa.europa.eu/2019/index.html https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/2019-cti-eu/2019-cti-eu-bonding-eu-cyber-threat-intelligence  6  Overview  _Gaps in available CTI material and  practices  Despite the higher maturity levels achieved in CTI practices and tools  and the provision and consumption of CTI, there are still gaps in CTI, in  particular regarding various use-cases, sectoral CTI, and CTI types  (operational, tactical, strategic), among others. Such a significant gap has  been identified in discussion within ENISA CTI forum concerning the  availability of up-to-date CTI from attacks on critical sectors and critical  services. It has been agreed that CTI elements (e.g. tools, techniques and  procedures or TTPs) included in various international good practices and  frameworks (e.g. ATT&CK 28  ) need to evolve to include intelligence from a  wider spectrum of attacks. Particularly pressing are the CTI elements of  various sectors and service-provisioning infrastructures and offerings.  An example of this is the lack of emphasis on attacks on cloud-  computing. 29  Similar requests may emerge from infrastructures that are  either emerging (e.g. 5G 30  ), or are of specialized nature yet play an  essential role in critical industrial systems for example industrial control  systems (ICSs) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)  systems). 31  Although existing frameworks may contain various elements used in  TTPs targeting such systems, their applicability in various sectors will  need to be expanded to take account of the peculiarities of TTPs, such as  the abuse of available application programming interfaces (APIs) and  exploitation of core assets. Apart from TTPs, elements that will require  further consideration are guidance on prevention, detection and  mitigation practices for these sectors.  7  This will facilitate the development of the necessary capabilities and  enable the use of CTI specifically crafted for these sectors. The main  barrier to the dissemination of actionable CTI for various platform types  and infrastructures is the lapse time between an incident, producing  related CTI and populating this information to open-source tools.  Tighter coordination and cooperation among the parties involved will  reduce the time before CTI is made available to the wider user  community. Building trust among participating entities is key to the  accelerating the CTI supply chain. Identifying relevant players and  mobilising the CTI community are important to facilitate these  interactions.  Another barrier to building the necessary capabilities is the availability  and consumption of CTI within various cybersecurity management  activities. Examples include cybersecurity crisis management, incident  management, incident response, threat hunting and vulnerability  management. This deficiency was assessed in the previous ENISA Threat  Landscape (ETL) report 32  by means of asynchronous cycles among  cybersecurity disciplines and continues to persist.  Concluding this section, one should note that the deficiencies described  are not due to a lack of CTI knowledge per se but rather to the lengthy  cross- and intra-sector communication and coordination cycles for  exchanging CTI knowledge.  8  _Issues emerging from building a CTI  infrastructure  CTI is offered in some broad categories according to users’ requirements  for CTI, namely as operational, tactical and strategic. Existing commercial  offerings consisting of tools for collection, maintenance, analysis and  dissemination of CTI, CTI feeds, threat intelligence platforms (TIPs), etc.,  support some of these CTI types. However, there is no one-size-fits-all  approach.  Existing offerings concentrate on operational and tactical  CTI, while strategic CTI is mostly offered independently.  However, the boundaries between CTI are rather blurred. This has the  effect that, when a CTI consumer wishes to build up a capability and the  corresponding environment to manage CTI, selecting suitable elements  is not straightforward. This is mainly because CTI service provisioning  and the existing CTI-tool landscape is somewhat fragmented. In  attempting to build up such an environment, CTI users will need to do so  by selecting a ‘best of breed’ system from existing offerings. Their  selection has to fulfil CTI requirements and the CTI practices and  processes applied, while taking into the account their current and  prospective CTI maturity objectives.  Overview  Although some criteria/requirements for selecting TIPs have been  developed 33  for various CTI user profiles, similar requirements will be  necessary for further CTI products, services and tools. Ideally, such  requirements will focus on various levels of user maturity, levels of  expenditure and types of CTI. Similar criteria/requirements are necessary  for various other elements of a CTI infrastructure, such as tools, good  practices, sharing platforms, etc.  In the long run, OpenCTI 14  may be a good solution for addressing the  issues caused by the fragmentation of CTI offerings, given its inherent  capability to integrate CTI sources of various types into a single tooling  environment.  In the coming year, ENISA and CTI stakeholders will put  some effort into assessing the CTI infrastructure  requirements and checking how they can be fulfilled by  existing CTI products. This will begin with an attempt to  establish a CTI infrastructure for ENISA’s internal needs for  developing a CTI platform for strategic CTI.  9  10  Overview  The incorporation of CTI into key cybersecurity disciplines has already  been identified as an issue by members of the CTI community. This is  particularly the case in security management activities and components  that are related to highly dynamic environments with increased  exposure, such as user devices (e.g. USIMS, security tokens, mobile  devices, industrial systems, e-health devices, etc.). Other related  disciplines that may significantly benefit from CTI are certification  activities, crisis management practices, cyber-forensics and incident  response, among others.  ENISA recognizes 35  the need for the inclusion of CTI in the area of  certification. In 2020, ENISA established an ad-hoc working group  aiming to integrate risk management and CTI with practices for  identifying assurance levels.  In particular, the CSA states that ‘The assurance level shall be  commensurate with the level of the risk associated with the intended  use of the ICT product, ICT service or ICT process, in terms of the  probability and impact of an incident’ (Art. 52(1)).  This makes it evident that CTI needs to flow into the certification process  using an assurance level evaluation. Although, parts of CTI are envisaged  in certification standards 36  by using an ‘attacker profile’, this concept  comprises a small part of available CTI.  _Leveraging CTI in related cybersecurity  disciplines  11  The work performed by ENISA’s ad-hoc working group consists of  combining information from risk and threat assessments (CTI) to group  protection requirements appropriately and map them on to various  assurance levels. The mapping will be based on various risk levels that  emerge from the threat exposure of assets and, at the same time, give  rise to proposals for the number and strength of mitigation controls.  These controls will drive the selection of security functions that will be  assigned to multiple assurance levels and will be subject to  implementation by the various targets of certification (ToCs).  ENISA’s work on this topic is being undertaken with the  support of an expert group, combining risk management,  CTI and certification skills. The work started in April 2020  and will be completed in the third quarter of 2020. The  results of this work will be published by ENISA.  12  Overview  From a representative CTI survey 7 , numerous interesting conclusions on  the current uptake of CTI practices and tools can be drawn. Among other  things, the survey reflects the current state-of-play of CTI capabilities, the  types of CTI used types of CTI used among stakeholders, the interplay of  CTI practices with other processes in organisations and the use-cases of  CTI tools.  In this discussion, the results of the survey are extrapolated to the  experiences gained by ENISA within its own (strategic) CTI activities and  the feedback from various CTI stakeholders within the EU and European  CTI forums 36  . In this context, the focus is on identifying requirements,  collecting information, producing strategic CTI, use of tools and practices  and integration with other relevant processes. In this regard, we would  like to highlight the following points.   One of the main conclusion from this report is that semi-automation  of CTI production is an important tool: while automation of  information ingestion is increasing – despite an increase in CTI  consumption by vendors – manual activities are still building the core  of organisations’ CTI production.   Information aggregation, analysis and dissemination activities are  managed using widely available tools such as spreadsheets, mail  and open-source management platforms, which is indicative of the  efficiency of low-cost solutions.  _Results of a comprehensive CTI survey  13   The importance of defining CTI requirements is understood by the CTI  user-community. This is in response to the repeated pleas of CTI  experts 5,6  about recognising the significance of CTI requirements and  shows that the CTI community has taken their advice. It is also interesting  to see that a significant amount of CTI requirements reflects the needs of  business and executives. This is an indication that CTI is becoming part of  decision making at business and management levels.   A combination of consumption and production of CTI is the prevailing  method for building up an internal CTI knowledge base. An increase in  organisations’ own CTI production is the main trend, especially for CTI  derived from their own analysis of raw data and contextualised threat  alerts. Consumption from publicly available sources is becoming a trend,  considering the growing use of available CTI (open-source CTI feeds as  indicated in the point below).   Open-source information gathering is the most widely used ingestion  method, followed by threat feeds from CTI vendors. This is a clear  upwards trend in 2020, indicating that CTI users are investing in their own  capabilities to produce CTI that complies with their requirements.   Threat detection is assessed as the main use case for CTI. Although  indictors of compromise (IoCs) are still the most important elements of  CTI in threat detection and threat response, threat behaviour and  adversary tactics (TTPs), seem to be responsible for upwards trends in  the use of CTI in organisations.   Measuring the effectiveness of CTI is still a difficult task, and only a  small percentage of CTI users (4%) implement processes to measure CTI  efficiency. It is argued, that although tooling may add value in CTI  analysis, the analyst’s skills are most important for successful  implementation of CTI. An interesting finding regarding the level of  satisfaction is the low rating given to the value of machine learning  functions.  14  Overview  Having regard to all these developments in the area of CTI, the following  conclusions can be drawn. From these conclusions, some next steps are  indicated, at least from the point of view of ENISA, where CTI is going to  be strengthened in accordance with its new mandate, but also taking  into account the developments observed in its stakeholder communities,  such as Member States, the European Commission and other European  bodies, vendors and CTI end users:   Given the increasing number of EU and Member States stakeholders,  cooperation and coordination of EU-wide CTI activities is key.  While building on synergies may reduce CTI costs, it also increases  trust among CTI players, thus enabling the sharing of CTI and good  practices. ENISA will promote cooperation with various stakeholders  by initiating the identification of CTI requirements. This will include  multiple stakeholders groups within the EU ecosystem of  organisations (i.e. Commission, EU bodies, agencies and Member  States).   As the relevance of CTI for strategic and political decision-making is  understood, it is important to facilitate its connection with  geopolitical information and cyber-physical systems. This will  enable the inclusion of CTI in decision-making processes, but it will  also allow its context to be expanded to the identify hybrid threats.  _Conclusions and next steps  15   Integrating CTI with security management processes will help CTI to  proliferate in related areas and will contribute to the timely  identification, detection and prevention of threats. An immediate effect  will be to increase the agility of rather long-lasting processes (e.g.  certification, risk assessment). At the same time, CTI will facilitate  emergency decision-making (e.g. crisis management) by providing  evidence on exposure to cyber threats.   To better respond to the increasing role of CTI, ENISA will be working on  building a comprehensive CTI programme. The ENISA CTI  programme will bundle internal skills horizontally to enrol all related  stakeholders in all phases of CTI production and dissemination, and  develop a CTI infrastructure that will be used for both internal and  training purposes.   Investment in some basic CTI concepts, in particular CTI maturity and  threat hierarchies, is considered very useful for increasing the uptake  of CTI. ENISA – together with its EU partners - will invest some effort  into developing a CTI maturity model. Moreover, ENISA consolidate and  disseminate useful multi-purpose CTI material such as threat  hierarchies that can be used in other areas (e.g. certification, risk  management, sectoral landscapes, etc.).  Some of the above conclusions and next steps will be the subject of  ENISA’s work in the area of CTI during the coming years. 35  16  1.

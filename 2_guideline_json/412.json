Conclusions 16  Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2017  04  Executive Summary  Electronic trust services are a range of services around digital signatures, digital certificates, electronic seals,  timestamps, etc. which are used in electronic transactions, to make them secure. eIDAS1, an EU regulation, is the EU  wide legal framework ensuring interoperability and security of these electronic trust services across the EU. One of  the goals of eIDAS is to ensure that electronic transactions can have the same legal standing as traditional paper  based transactions. eIDAS is important for the European digital market because it allows businesses and citizens to  work and use services across the EU. The eIDAS regulation was adopted in July 2014 and came into force in 2016.  Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation sets security requirements for trust service providers. National supervisory bodies  have to supervise the trust service providers in their country to ensure that they fulfil these requirements.  Cooperation and agreement on how to do this in practice is important not only to create a level playing field for  providers operating out of different EU countries, but also to protect transactions based on these services. If there  is, for instance, a cyber-attack on a trust service provider in one Member State, then this could have an impact on  organizations in other parts of the EU who rely on the provider’s trust services.  An important part of Article 19 is the mandatory security breach notification requirements: Trust service providers  must notify the national supervisory body about security breaches, if there is a significant impact on the trust  service(s) they provide. Article 19 requires national supervisory bodies to inform each other and ENISA if there is  cross-border impact. Annually, the national supervisory bodies send annual summary reports about the notified  breaches to ENISA and the European Commission. This document, the Annual Report Trust Services Security  Incidents 2017, marks the second round of security incident reporting for the EU’s trust services sector  For 2017, the national supervisory bodies reported 13 security breaches with a significant impact on trust services.  We can draw the following conclusions:   Notification increase: The number of notified security breaches increased significantly, in comparison to the  previous year. This is not a sign of decreasing security, but rather shows that the implementation of the  breach reporting requirements is maturing. Trust service providers are more aware of their breach reporting  obligations and are becoming more familiar with the procedure. This leads to more notifications to the  supervisory bodies.   E-signatures and e-seals most affected: Almost half of the notified breaches, 43%, involve certificates for  electronic signatures and electronic seals.   Most common causes are system failures, third party failures: System failures, third party failures are both  responsible for 36% of the breaches. Human errors are more rare (21%). Only 7% of the breaches are caused  by malicious actions.   Many security breaches had cross-border impact: Almost half of the notified breaches, 46%, had an impact  across borders. This shows that indeed the EU trust services sector is cross-border. Many providers (and  their suppliers) are offering services across the EU. Half those were severe, i.e. 50% the cross-border  incidents had the highest severity rating (5- disastrous).   A third of the breaches were due to ROCA: A number of notified breaches had the same underlying cause  (the ROCA case).  The general conclusion is that, particularly for security supervision of trust services, cross-border collaboration and  information exchange between EU Member States are very important and are starting to produce concrete results  1 Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust  services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC, can be consulted at https://eur- lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj  Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2017  05  that are of value to the community. The eIDAS regulation, and Article 19 in particular, provides the legal basis for  collaboration and information exchange between the supervisory bodies. Detailed discussions about security issues  and supervision of the sector take place inside the ENISA Article 19 expert group, which is an informal group of  experts from national supervisory bodies focusing on the practical implementation of Article 19.  Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2017  06  1. Introduction  According to Article 19 of the eIDAS Regulation, Electronic Trust Service Providers in the EU have to notify the  national supervisory bodies in their country about security incidents. Annually the supervisory bodies send  summaries of these incident reports to ENISA. Subsequently ENISA publishes an aggregated overview of these  security incidents. This document gives an aggregate overview of the reported security incidents.  This annual report marks the second round of security incident reporting in the EU’s trust services sector, covering  the security incidents of 2017.  This document only contains aggregated and anonymized information about incidents and does not include details  about individual countries or individual trust service providers. Detailed discussions about the reported security  incidents take place in the ENISA Article 19 expert group, which is an informal group of experts from national  supervisory bodies focusing on the practical implementation of Article 19.  Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2017  07  2. Background  In this section, we explain in more detail the background and policy context of this annual report.  The eIDAS regulation and Article 19  The eIDAS regulation was adopted in July 2014 and came into force in 2016. It is a legal framework that ensures  interoperability of electronic trust services across the EU, creating a single market for such services. One of the goals  of eIDAS is to ensure that electronic transactions have the same legal standing as traditional paper based  transactions, allowing organizations to move away from expensive and cumbersome paper-based processes.  eIDAS is important for the European digital market because it allows businesses and citizens to use online and digital  services across the EU, without the need to obtain a new electronic identity or trust service product each time. The  idea is that, for example, a digital signature from a Spanish citizen, created with an Austrian smartcard, can be  validated and accepted by, say, a Greek company.  Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation, contains the security requirements for trust service providers and the security  breach notification requirements. In a nutshell, Article 19 requires that trust service providers assess risks, take  appropriate security measures, and notify security incidents to the supervisory body.  Article 19 also puts  information sharing obligations on supervisory authorities vis-a-vis other supervisory bodies in the EU.  Cooperation  and agreement between EU member states on how to implement Article 19 and how to do security supervision is  very important not only to create a level playing field across the EU, but also to avoid fraud and cyber-attacks. The  Diginotar case of 20112 offers a good example of how a single security incident at one European certificate authority  had an impact across borders, even globally.  Legal text of eIDAS Article 19  We include the text of Article 19 verbatim for the sake of reference:  Article 19: Security requirements applicable to trust service providers  Qualified and non-qualified trust service providers shall take appropriate technical and  organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the security of the trust services they  provide. Having regard to the latest technological developments, those measures shall ensure  that the level of security is commensurate to the degree of risk. In particular, measures shall be  taken to prevent and minimise the impact of security incidents and inform stakeholders of the  adverse effects of any such incidents.  2. Qualified and non-qualified trust service providers shall, without undue delay but in any event  within 24 hours after having become aware of it, notify the supervisory body and, where  applicable, other relevant bodies, such as the competent national body for information security  or the data protection authority, of any breach of security or loss of integrity that has a  significant impact on the trust service provided or on the personal data maintained therein.  Where the breach of security or loss of integrity is likely to adversely affect a natural or legal  person to whom the trusted service has been provided, the trust service provider shall also notify  the natural or legal person of the breach of security or loss of integrity without undue delay.  2 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/operation-black-tulip  Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2017  08  Where appropriate, in particular if a breach of security or loss of integrity concerns two or more  Member States, the notified supervisory body shall inform the supervisory bodies in other  Member States concerned and ENISA.  The notified supervisory body shall inform the public or require the trust service provider to do  so, where it determines that disclosure of the breach of security or loss of integrity is in the public  interest.  3. The supervisory body shall provide ENISA once a year with a summary of notifications of  breach of security and loss of integrity received from trust service providers.”  We also quote a part of Article 17 (6) of the eIDAS regulation, which asks supervisory bodies to provide the  Commission with a summary of the notified breaches:  By 31 March each year, each supervisory body shall submit to the Commission a report on its  previous calendar year’s main activities together with a summary of breach notifications  received from trust service providers in accordance with Article 19(2).  Finally we report preamble 39 of the eIDAS regulation which explains that one of the reasons for annual summary  reporting to ENISA and the Commission is to assess the effectiveness of the breach reporting mechanism itself:  To enable the Commission and the Member States to assess the effectiveness of the breach  notification mechanism introduced by this Regulation, supervisory bodies should be requested  to provide summary information to the Commission and to European Union Agency for Network  and Information Security (ENISA).  Incident reporting flows in Article 19  Article 19 requires trust service providers to assess risks, take appropriate security measures to mitigate and notify  the supervisory bodies of security breaches with a significant impact on the trust services. It requires the supervisory  body to inform other Member States and ENISA when a breach concerns other Member States. Moreover, each year  supervisory bodies have to provide ENISA and the European Commission with a summary of breach notifications of  received from their trust service providers. The diagram below shows the full picture and the different reporting  flows. We explain the arrows step-by-step:  Trust service  provider  National  supervisory  body  National supervisory bodies abroad, EC  and ENISA  1  5  Public  Notification  Informing  Summary reporting  4  1  Other relevant  authorities  3  Customer  affected  2  Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2017  09  Figure 1: Overview of reporting flows in Article 19  1. At step 1 (see arrow 1 in the diagram) the trust service provider notifies the national supervisory body of a  security breach with a significant impact on the trust service provided or on the personal data maintained  therein. This must happen without undue delay, and within 24 hours after the trust service provider became  aware of the security breach. The provider needs to notify also to other relevant authorities, such as e.g. the  national data protection authority (DPA), the national competent authority for information security, etc.,  where applicable.  2. The trust service provider also notifies the natural or legal person to whom the trust service was provided,  i.e. the customer affected by the security incident, without undue delay (arrow 2).  3. If disclosure of the breach is in the public interest then the supervisory body may decide to Inform the public  or require the trust service provider to do so (arrow 3).  4. The national supervisory body informs relevant supervisory bodies abroad and ENISA, when a security  incident involves two or more Member States (arrow 4).  5. Annually the national supervisory body sends a summary reporting to ENISA and the Commission (arrow 5).  Security incident reporting  In 2014, after eIDAS was adopted, and under the auspices of the European Commission, ENISA formed an expert  group with experts from competent authorities and national supervisory bodies to agree on the technical and  practical details of implementing Article 19. In 2015 this group reached agreement about a non-binding technical  document describing an incident reporting framework implementing Article 19 in practice3. The group also agreed  to use the reporting tool (called CIRAS-T) developed by ENISA to facilitate the annual summary reporting. Below we  briefly explain the key parts and terminology of the overall incident reporting framework.  2.4.1 Services in scope of reporting  In scope of reporting are qualified and non-qualified trust-service providers offering the following services:   creation, verification, and validation of electronic signatures, electronic seals or electronic time stamps,  electronic registered delivery services and certificates related to those services   creation, verification and validation of certificates for website authentication   preservation of electronic signatures, seals or certificates related to those services, as defined in Article 3 of the  eIDAS regulation, as an electronic service normally for remuneration  2.4.2 Security incidents  eIDAS and Article 19 mentions security incidents, breaches of security, loss of integrity, breach notifications. In the  rest of this document, in line with the terminology used in the above-mentioned incident reporting framework, we  abbreviate and use the term security incident to encompass both breaches of security and loss of integrity:  Security incident: A breach of security or loss of integrity with an impact on the security of the trust service provided.  For instance, the flooding of a server room due to heavy rains, causing downtime of an online validation service  offered by the trust service provider, would be a security incident.  2.4.3 Reportable security incidents  Security incidents, which have to be notified to the supervisory body are those incidents, which had a significant  impact on the trust service provided or on the personal data maintained therein. Each country takes a different  3 The “Incident reporting framework for eIDAS Article 19“ is available at https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/article19- incident-reporting-framework  Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2017  10  national approach to this, based on national circumstances, depending on national circumstances, the sector, the  size of the population, etc.  2.4.4 Annual summary reporting threshold  While national reporting thresholds are different in each country, the Article 19 expert group agreed on a threshold  for annual summary reporting, to ensure consistency in the annual summary reporting across the EU. The agreed  threshold is based on the severity scale, which is introduced in the incident reporting framework. This severity scale  has 5 levels:  1. No impact  2. Insignificant impact: provider assets were affected but no impact on core services  3. Significant impact: part of the customers/services is affected  4. Severe impact: large part of the customers/services is affected  5. Disastrous: the entire organisation, all services, all certificates are affected  The members of the Article 19 expert group agreed that security incidents rated at level 3 or higher should be  included in the annual summary reporting to ENISA and the Commission.  Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2017  11  3. Analysis of reported security incidents  For the annual summary reporting for 2017, 13 security incidents with significant impact were reported to ENISA  and the Commission4.  This is only the second round of annual summary reporting, because eIDAS came into force just recently, on the 1st  of July 2016. For comparison, in the first year of annual summary reporting, covering (half of 2016), only one incident  was reported.  Trust services affected  Most incidents (43%) affected the creation of certificates for electronic signatures and electronic seals. The second  category of services affected were the online certificates revocation services (CRL and OSCP) with 22%, and the  online verification services with 21%.  4 Note that one additional security incident was reported, but excluded from the analysis, because it had no impact.  43%  22%  21%  7% 7%  Trust services affected by security incidents  Creation of e-signatures and e-seals  Certificate revocation lists  Verification of signatures  or seals  Revocation of  certificates for e- signatures or e-seals Qualified  e-signature devices  Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2017  12  Root causes of security incidents  The most common root causes of security incidents were system failures (36%) and third party failures (36%).  Malicious actions were rarely the cause of incidents (just 7% of the incidents).  This graph is evidence of a larger trend in the root causes of the security incidents as system failures is the main  one in the telecom sector5 as well.  Severity of security incidents  Approximately half of the reported security incidents (46%) were either severe or disastrous.  5 ENISA  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/annual-report-telecom-security-incidents-2017  21%  7%  36%  36%  Root causes of TSP security incidents  Human error  Malicious actions  System failures  Third party failures  54% 23%  23%  Severity of TSP security incidents  3- significant  4- severe  5-disastrous  Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2017  13  Security incidents with cross border impact  Almost half of the security incidents (46%) had impact across borders, in other EU Member States.  This is not  surprising if one considers the nature of the trust services and the single market. Supervisory Bodies (SBs) informed  other Member States (MS) by initiating the cross-border incident notification procedure.  Half of the incidents with cross-border impact were rated as disastrous (level 5). This highlights the importance of  cross-border collaboration and information sharing. Incidents without cross-border impact were, generally speaking,  less severe.  46%  54%  Cross border impact TSP security incidents  cross border impact  no cross border impact  50%50%  Cross border impact  3-significant impact  4-severe impact  5-disastrous impact  71%  29%  No cross border impact  3-significant impact  4-severe impact  5-disastrous impact  Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2017  14  4. Examples of reported security incidents  In this section, we give some specific (anonymized) examples of reported security incidents. We also indicate the  severity level that was indicated by the national supervisory body as part of the annual summary reporting to ENISA  and the European Commission.   Malware compromised email addresses (severity level 3- significant): The computer of an employee of a  trust service provider was infected by malware, via an email attachment. The malware used a word  document containing a macro. The attacker downloaded a list of account email addresses and tried to  retrieve authentication information from the provider’s customers via spear-phishing. The provider reacted  by resetting the passwords of all employees, improved the authentication process for employees and  launched an awareness and education campaign for its employees.   Unavailability of Revocation Services  (severity level 3- significant): A trust service provider’s revocation  services were unreachable for 3 hours. This was caused due to a human error in the configuration of domain  name records. The trust service provider informed the public. Afterwards the provider acknowledged the  need to improve the process for detecting and resolving IT issues. The provider also analyzed the redundancy  of the links for the operation of the revocation services.   Certificate serial number errors (severity level 3- significant): A trust provider inserted incorrect certificate  serial numbers in the certificates, due to a software bug. The bug was not detected due to insufficient testing.  Hundreds of certificates had to be revoked as a result. The provider informed all affected customers.  Afterwards the provider fixed the software bug and improved the testing processes.   Services offline (severity level 3- significant):  A trust service provider experienced multiple problems with  installing a new internet connection.  As a result, its customer service and all internet-facing services offered  by the trust service provider were unavailable for hours. The provider notified the customers of the problem  via email. As an immediate action the trust service provider rolled back to its previous internet connection.   Unavailability of time stamping service (severity level 4- severe): A trust provider experienced a hardware  failure in one of the components underpinning it’s time stamping server. This blocked the creation of  timestamps. The provider disconnected the faulty system and informed its customers about the service  unavailability. After the hardware fault was resolved and the service was restored, the provider investigated  the case by analyzing event logs. The trust service provider also analyzed a number of failure scenarios for  unforeseen circumstances like these and improved their failover procedures.  The ROCA case  We discuss the ROCA vulnerability6 in more detail, because it was a case with implications across Europe, widely  discussed in press and media, and because the ROCA vulnerability was the underlying cause for a number of security  breach notifications from trust service providers. From the total of 13 incidents included in the annual reports, 5  security incidents were related to ROCA.  6 ROCA (Return of Coppersmith Attack) is a vulnerability discovered by academic researchers in a cryptographic library, used in  a wide range of cryptographic chips and was publicly disclosed in October 2017. The issue was that the library generated RSA  key pairs in such a way that an attacker could compute the corresponding private key from the corresponding public key. In  many settings and implementations of RSA the public key is published or widely known, but the private key is supposed to  remain a secret. More info see  https://crocs.fi.muni.cz/public/papers/rsa_ccs17  Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2017  15  It is good to highlight here that ROCA was a vulnerability that triggered the revocation of cryptographic keys and  certificates by trust service providers, but there are (to our knowledge) no successful attacks or exploitations of this  vulnerability (yet), besides proof of concept attacks.  The impact of ROCA was different across the EU, depending on the usage scenario and the number of customers  involved. This means that ROCA was mitigated by trust service providers in different ways. In some cases trust  providers had to revoke a small number of certificates, while in other cases, large numbers of customers were  affected, requiring even coordination by national authorities to manage the situation. Overall, across the EU, trust  service providers, revoked, approximately, 18 million vulnerable certificates.  Some ROCA related incidents were not even notified to the supervisory body because the impact was insignificant.  The severity of the ROCA-related incidents in the annual summary reporting varied: 60% was rated at severity level  5-disastrous, 40% at severity level 3-significant (see the chart below).  We give some examples of incidents caused by ROCA and their impact severity:   Small number of revocations (severity 3- significant): In one country a trust service provider had to revoke  a small number of impacted certificates.   Update of eID cards (severity 5- disastrous): In one country the ROCA vulnerability was found to be present  in hundreds of thousands of national e-ID smartcards, issued over the last 3 years. As a mitigation the  national authorities decided to close the public key database in order to protect against a potential future  attack. All affected electronic identity cards were suspended. The affected citizens had to update their  electronic identity documents remotely or at specific service points.   Electronic signatures affected (severity 5- disastrous): In one country only the qualified electronic signature  part of the national eID cards was affected by ROCA. The national authority decided to revoke hundreds of  thousands of certificates and issued new certificates with a longer (RSA 3072 bit) key pair. Additionally ROCA  triggered a transition from RSA to ECDSA, and the usage of Extended Access Control (EAC) to secure remote  issuance of qualified certificates.  40%  60%  Severity rating ROCA related incidents  3-significant  4-severe  5-disastrous  Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2017  16  5. Conclusions  This document, the Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2017, aggregates and analyses the annual  summary reports from EU Member States about security breaches notified by trust service providers. We can draw  the following conclusions:   The number of notified security breaches increased significantly, in comparison to the previous year. This  should not be interpreted as a sign of decreasing security. Also in the first years of security incident reporting  in the telecom sector there was a gradual increase of the number of reported incidents, because it takes  some time for service providers to become familiar with the breach reporting obligations and the procedure.   Almost half of the notified breaches, 43%, involve certificates for electronic signatures and electronic seals.   System failures, third party failures and human errors are the main root causes. Only 7% of the breaches are  caused by malicious actions.   Almost half of the notified breaches, 46%, had an impact across borders. This shows that indeed the EU trust  services sector is to a large extent cross-border with suppliers and providers offering services across the EU.   Half of the incidents were rated as having a severe (level 4) or disastrous impact (level 5). Half of the cross-  border incidents were rated has having a disastrous impact (level 5).   A number of notified breaches had the same underlying cause, i.e. the ROCA case.  The general conclusions we can draw from this is that cross-border collaboration and information exchange are very  important when it comes to supervision and ensuring the security of trust services in the EU. eIDAS provides the  legal basis for collaboration and information exchange mechanisms between supervisory bodies. The sooner  organizations learn about threats and incidents, the sooner they can decide the best course for mitigation. Good  information exchange about threats and incidents makes mitigation easier.

Conclusions 16  Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2017  04  Executive Summary  Electronic trust services are a range of services around digital signatures, digital certificates, electronic seals,  timestamps, etc. which are used in electronic transactions, to make them secure. eIDAS1, an EU regulation, is the EU  wide legal framework ensuring interoperability and security of these electronic trust services across the EU. One of  the goals of eIDAS is to ensure that electronic transactions can have the same legal standing as traditional paper  based transactions. eIDAS is important for the European digital market because it allows businesses and citizens to  work and use services across the EU. The eIDAS regulation was adopted in July 2014 and came into force in 2016.  Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation sets security requirements for trust service providers. National supervisory bodies  have to supervise the trust service providers in their country to ensure that they fulfil these requirements.  Cooperation and agreement on how to do this in practice is important not only to create a level playing field for  providers operating out of different EU countries, but also to protect transactions based on these services. If there  is, for instance, a cyber-attack on a trust service provider in one Member State, then this could have an impact on  organizations in other parts of the EU who rely on the provider’s trust services.  An important part of Article 19 is the mandatory security breach notification requirements: Trust service providers  must notify the national supervisory body about security breaches, if there is a significant impact on the trust  service(s) they provide. Article 19 requires national supervisory bodies to inform each other and ENISA if there is  cross-border impact. Annually, the national supervisory bodies send annual summary reports about the notified  breaches to ENISA and the European Commission. This document, the Annual Report Trust Services Security  Incidents 2017, marks the second round of security incident reporting for the EU’s trust services sector  For 2017, the national supervisory bodies reported 13 security breaches with a significant impact on trust services.  We can draw the following conclusions:   Notification increase: The number of notified security breaches increased significantly, in comparison to the  previous year. This is not a sign of decreasing security, but rather shows that the implementation of the  breach reporting requirements is maturing. Trust service providers are more aware of their breach reporting  obligations and are becoming more familiar with the procedure. This leads to more notifications to the  supervisory bodies.   E-signatures and e-seals most affected: Almost half of the notified breaches, 43%, involve certificates for  electronic signatures and electronic seals.   Most common causes are system failures, third party failures: System failures, third party failures are both  responsible for 36% of the breaches. Human errors are more rare (21%). Only 7% of the breaches are caused  by malicious actions.   Many security breaches had cross-border impact: Almost half of the notified breaches, 46%, had an impact  across borders. This shows that indeed the EU trust services sector is cross-border. Many providers (and  their suppliers) are offering services across the EU. Half those were severe, i.e. 50% the cross-border  incidents had the highest severity rating (5- disastrous).   A third of the breaches were due to ROCA: A number of notified breaches had the same underlying cause  (the ROCA case).  The general conclusion is that, particularly for security supervision of trust services, cross-border collaboration and  information exchange between EU Member States are very important and are starting to produce concrete results  1 Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust  services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC, can be consulted at https://eur- lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj  Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2017  05  that are of value to the community. The eIDAS regulation, and Article 19 in particular, provides the legal basis for  collaboration and information exchange between the supervisory bodies. Detailed discussions about security issues  and supervision of the sector take place inside the ENISA Article 19 expert group, which is an informal group of  experts from national supervisory bodies focusing on the practical implementation of Article 19.  Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2017  06  1. Introduction  According to Article 19 of the eIDAS Regulation, Electronic Trust Service Providers in the EU have to notify the  national supervisory bodies in their country about security incidents. Annually the supervisory bodies send  summaries of these incident reports to ENISA. Subsequently ENISA publishes an aggregated overview of these  security incidents. This document gives an aggregate overview of the reported security incidents.  This annual report marks the second round of security incident reporting in the EU’s trust services sector, covering  the security incidents of 2017.  This document only contains aggregated and anonymized information about incidents and does not include details  about individual countries or individual trust service providers. Detailed discussions about the reported security  incidents take place in the ENISA Article 19 expert group, which is an informal group of experts from national  supervisory bodies focusing on the practical implementation of Article 19.  Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2017  07  2. Background  In this section, we explain in more detail the background and policy context of this annual report.  The eIDAS regulation and Article 19  The eIDAS regulation was adopted in July 2014 and came into force in 2016. It is a legal framework that ensures  interoperability of electronic trust services across the EU, creating a single market for such services. One of the goals  of eIDAS is to ensure that electronic transactions have the same legal standing as traditional paper based  transactions, allowing organizations to move away from expensive and cumbersome paper-based processes.  eIDAS is important for the European digital market because it allows businesses and citizens to use online and digital  services across the EU, without the need to obtain a new electronic identity or trust service product each time. The  idea is that, for example, a digital signature from a Spanish citizen, created with an Austrian smartcard, can be  validated and accepted by, say, a Greek company.  Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation, contains the security requirements for trust service providers and the security  breach notification requirements. In a nutshell, Article 19 requires that trust service providers assess risks, take  appropriate security measures, and notify security incidents to the supervisory body.  Article 19 also puts  information sharing obligations on supervisory authorities vis-a-vis other supervisory bodies in the EU.  Cooperation  and agreement between EU member states on how to implement Article 19 and how to do security supervision is  very important not only to create a level playing field across the EU, but also to avoid fraud and cyber-attacks. The  Diginotar case of 20112 offers a good example of how a single security incident at one European certificate authority  had an impact across borders, even globally.  Legal text of eIDAS Article 19  We include the text of Article 19 verbatim for the sake of reference:  Article 19: Security requirements applicable to trust service providers  Qualified and non-qualified trust service providers shall take appropriate technical and  organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the security of the trust services they  provide. Having regard to the latest technological developments, those measures shall ensure  that the level of security is commensurate to the degree of risk. In particular, measures shall be  taken to prevent and minimise the impact of security incidents and inform stakeholders of the  adverse effects of any such incidents.  2. Qualified and non-qualified trust service providers shall, without undue delay but in any event  within 24 hours after having become aware of it, notify the supervisory body and, where  applicable, other relevant bodies, such as the competent national body for information security  or the data protection authority, of any breach of security or loss of integrity that has a  significant impact on the trust service provided or on the personal data maintained therein.  Where the breach of security or loss of integrity is likely to adversely affect a natural or legal  person to whom the trusted service has been provided, the trust service provider shall also notify  the natural or legal person of the breach of security or loss of integrity without undue delay.  2 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/operation-black-tulip  Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2017  08  Where appropriate, in particular if a breach of security or loss of integrity concerns two or more  Member States, the notified supervisory body shall inform the supervisory bodies in other  Member States concerned and ENISA.  The notified supervisory body shall inform the public or require the trust service provider to do  so, where it determines that disclosure of the breach of security or loss of integrity is in the public  interest.  3. The supervisory body shall provide ENISA once a year with a summary of notifications of  breach of security and loss of integrity received from trust service providers.”  We also quote a part of Article 17 (6) of the eIDAS regulation, which asks supervisory bodies to provide the  Commission with a summary of the notified breaches:  By 31 March each year, each supervisory body shall submit to the Commission a report on its  previous calendar year’s main activities together with a summary of breach notifications  received from trust service providers in accordance with Article 19(2).  Finally we report preamble 39 of the eIDAS regulation which explains that one of the reasons for annual summary  reporting to ENISA and the Commission is to assess the effectiveness of the breach reporting mechanism itself:  To enable the Commission and the Member States to assess the effectiveness of the breach  notification mechanism introduced by this Regulation, supervisory bodies should be requested  to provide summary information to the Commission and to European Union Agency for Network  and Information Security (ENISA).  Incident reporting flows in Article 19  Article 19 requires trust service providers to assess risks, take appropriate security measures to mitigate and notify  the supervisory bodies of security breaches with a significant impact on the trust services. It requires the supervisory  body to inform other Member States and ENISA when a breach concerns other Member States. Moreover, each year  supervisory bodies have to provide ENISA and the European Commission with a summary of breach notifications of  received from their trust service providers. The diagram below shows the full picture and the different reporting  flows. We explain the arrows step-by-step:  Trust service  provider  National  supervisory  body  National supervisory bodies abroad, EC  and ENISA  1  5  Public  Notification  Informing  Summary reporting  4  1  Other relevant  authorities  3  Customer  affected  2  Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2017  09  Figure 1: Overview of reporting flows in Article 19  1. At step 1 (see arrow 1 in the diagram) the trust service provider notifies the national supervisory body of a  security breach with a significant impact on the trust service provided or on the personal data maintained  therein. This must happen without undue delay, and within 24 hours after the trust service provider became  aware of the security breach. The provider needs to notify also to other relevant authorities, such as e.g. the  national data protection authority (DPA), the national competent authority for information security, etc.,  where applicable.  2. The trust service provider also notifies the natural or legal person to whom the trust service was provided,  i.e. the customer affected by the security incident, without undue delay (arrow 2).  3. If disclosure of the breach is in the public interest then the supervisory body may decide to Inform the public  or require the trust service provider to do so (arrow 3).  4. The national supervisory body informs relevant supervisory bodies abroad and ENISA, when a security  incident involves two or more Member States (arrow 4).  5. Annually the national supervisory body sends a summary reporting to ENISA and the Commission (arrow 5).  Security incident reporting  In 2014, after eIDAS was adopted, and under the auspices of the European Commission, ENISA formed an expert  group with experts from competent authorities and national supervisory bodies to agree on the technical and  practical details of implementing Article 19. In 2015 this group reached agreement about a non-binding technical  document describing an incident reporting framework implementing Article 19 in practice3. The group also agreed  to use the reporting tool (called CIRAS-T) developed by ENISA to facilitate the annual summary reporting. Below we  briefly explain the key parts and terminology of the overall incident reporting framework.  2.4.1 Services in scope of reporting  In scope of reporting are qualified and non-qualified trust-service providers offering the following services:   creation, verification, and validation of electronic signatures, electronic seals or electronic time stamps,  electronic registered delivery services and certificates related to those services   creation, verification and validation of certificates for website authentication   preservation of electronic signatures, seals or certificates related to those services, as defined in Article 3 of the  eIDAS regulation, as an electronic service normally for remuneration  2.4.2 Security incidents  eIDAS and Article 19 mentions security incidents, breaches of security, loss of integrity, breach notifications. In the  rest of this document, in line with the terminology used in the above-mentioned incident reporting framework, we  abbreviate and use the term security incident to encompass both breaches of security and loss of integrity:  Security incident: A breach of security or loss of integrity with an impact on the security of the trust service provided.  For instance, the flooding of a server room due to heavy rains, causing downtime of an online validation service  offered by the trust service provider, would be a security incident.  2.4.3 Reportable security incidents  Security incidents, which have to be notified to the supervisory body are those incidents, which had a significant  impact on the trust service provided or on the personal data maintained therein. Each country takes a different  3 The “Incident reporting framework for eIDAS Article 19“ is available at https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/article19- incident-reporting-framework  Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2017  10  national approach to this, based on national circumstances, depending on national circumstances, the sector, the  size of the population, etc.  2.4.4 Annual summary reporting threshold  While national reporting thresholds are different in each country, the Article 19 expert group agreed on a threshold  for annual summary reporting, to ensure consistency in the annual summary reporting across the EU. The agreed  threshold is based on the severity scale, which is introduced in the incident reporting framework. This severity scale  has 5 levels:  1. No impact  2. Insignificant impact: provider assets were affected but no impact on core services  3. Significant impact: part of the customers/services is affected  4. Severe impact: large part of the customers/services is affected  5. Disastrous: the entire organisation, all services, all certificates are affected  The members of the Article 19 expert group agreed that security incidents rated at level 3 or higher should be  included in the annual summary reporting to ENISA and the Commission.  Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2017  11  3. Analysis of reported security incidents  For the annual summary reporting for 2017, 13 security incidents with significant impact were reported to ENISA  and the Commission4.  This is only the second round of annual summary reporting, because eIDAS came into force just recently, on the 1st  of July 2016. For comparison, in the first year of annual summary reporting, covering (half of 2016), only one incident  was reported.  Trust services affected  Most incidents (43%) affected the creation of certificates for electronic signatures and electronic seals. The second  category of services affected were the online certificates revocation services (CRL and OSCP) with 22%, and the  online verification services with 21%.  4 Note that one additional security incident was reported, but excluded from the analysis, because it had no impact.  43%  22%  21%  7% 7%  Trust services affected by security incidents  Creation of e-signatures and e-seals  Certificate revocation lists  Verification of signatures  or seals  Revocation of  certificates for e- signatures or e-seals Qualified  e-signature devices  Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2017  12  Root causes of security incidents  The most common root causes of security incidents were system failures (36%) and third party failures (36%).  Malicious actions were rarely the cause of incidents (just 7% of the incidents).  This graph is evidence of a larger trend in the root causes of the security incidents as system failures is the main  one in the telecom sector5 as well.  Severity of security incidents  Approximately half of the reported security incidents (46%) were either severe or disastrous.  5 ENISA  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/annual-report-telecom-security-incidents-2017  21%  7%  36%  36%  Root causes of TSP security incidents  Human error  Malicious actions  System failures  Third party failures  54% 23%  23%  Severity of TSP security incidents  3- significant  4- severe  5-disastrous  Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2017  13  Security incidents with cross border impact  Almost half of the security incidents (46%) had impact across borders, in other EU Member States.  This is not  surprising if one considers the nature of the trust services and the single market. Supervisory Bodies (SBs) informed  other Member States (MS) by initiating the cross-border incident notification procedure.  Half of the incidents with cross-border impact were rated as disastrous (level 5). This highlights the importance of  cross-border collaboration and information sharing. Incidents without cross-border impact were, generally speaking,  less severe.  46%  54%  Cross border impact TSP security incidents  cross border impact  no cross border impact  50%50%  Cross border impact  3-significant impact  4-severe impact  5-disastrous impact  71%  29%  No cross border impact  3-significant impact  4-severe impact  5-disastrous impact  Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2017  14  4. Examples of reported security incidents  In this section, we give some specific (anonymized) examples of reported security incidents. We also indicate the  severity level that was indicated by the national supervisory body as part of the annual summary reporting to ENISA  and the European Commission.   Malware compromised email addresses (severity level 3- significant): The computer of an employee of a  trust service provider was infected by malware, via an email attachment. The malware used a word  document containing a macro. The attacker downloaded a list of account email addresses and tried to  retrieve authentication information from the provider’s customers via spear-phishing. The provider reacted  by resetting the passwords of all employees, improved the authentication process for employees and  launched an awareness and education campaign for its employees.   Unavailability of Revocation Services  (severity level 3- significant): A trust service provider’s revocation  services were unreachable for 3 hours. This was caused due to a human error in the configuration of domain  name records. The trust service provider informed the public. Afterwards the provider acknowledged the  need to improve the process for detecting and resolving IT issues. The provider also analyzed the redundancy  of the links for the operation of the revocation services.   Certificate serial number errors (severity level 3- significant): A trust provider inserted incorrect certificate  serial numbers in the certificates, due to a software bug. The bug was not detected due to insufficient testing.  Hundreds of certificates had to be revoked as a result. The provider informed all affected customers.  Afterwards the provider fixed the software bug and improved the testing processes.   Services offline (severity level 3- significant):  A trust service provider experienced multiple problems with  installing a new internet connection.  As a result, its customer service and all internet-facing services offered  by the trust service provider were unavailable for hours. The provider notified the customers of the problem  via email. As an immediate action the trust service provider rolled back to its previous internet connection.   Unavailability of time stamping service (severity level 4- severe): A trust provider experienced a hardware  failure in one of the components underpinning it’s time stamping server. This blocked the creation of  timestamps. The provider disconnected the faulty system and informed its customers about the service  unavailability. After the hardware fault was resolved and the service was restored, the provider investigated  the case by analyzing event logs. The trust service provider also analyzed a number of failure scenarios for  unforeseen circumstances like these and improved their failover procedures.  The ROCA case  We discuss the ROCA vulnerability6 in more detail, because it was a case with implications across Europe, widely  discussed in press and media, and because the ROCA vulnerability was the underlying cause for a number of security  breach notifications from trust service providers. From the total of 13 incidents included in the annual reports, 5  security incidents were related to ROCA.  6 ROCA (Return of Coppersmith Attack) is a vulnerability discovered by academic researchers in a cryptographic library, used in  a wide range of cryptographic chips and was publicly disclosed in October 2017. The issue was that the library generated RSA  key pairs in such a way that an attacker could compute the corresponding private key from the corresponding public key. In  many settings and implementations of RSA the public key is published or widely known, but the private key is supposed to  remain a secret. More info see  https://crocs.fi.muni.cz/public/papers/rsa_ccs17  Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2017  15  It is good to highlight here that ROCA was a vulnerability that triggered the revocation of cryptographic keys and  certificates by trust service providers, but there are (to our knowledge) no successful attacks or exploitations of this  vulnerability (yet), besides proof of concept attacks.  The impact of ROCA was different across the EU, depending on the usage scenario and the number of customers  involved. This means that ROCA was mitigated by trust service providers in different ways. In some cases trust  providers had to revoke a small number of certificates, while in other cases, large numbers of customers were  affected, requiring even coordination by national authorities to manage the situation. Overall, across the EU, trust  service providers, revoked, approximately, 18 million vulnerable certificates.  Some ROCA related incidents were not even notified to the supervisory body because the impact was insignificant.  The severity of the ROCA-related incidents in the annual summary reporting varied: 60% was rated at severity level  5-disastrous, 40% at severity level 3-significant (see the chart below).  We give some examples of incidents caused by ROCA and their impact severity:   Small number of revocations (severity 3- significant): In one country a trust service provider had to revoke  a small number of impacted certificates.   Update of eID cards (severity 5- disastrous): In one country the ROCA vulnerability was found to be present  in hundreds of thousands of national e-ID smartcards, issued over the last 3 years. As a mitigation the  national authorities decided to close the public key database in order to protect against a potential future  attack. All affected electronic identity cards were suspended. The affected citizens had to update their  electronic identity documents remotely or at specific service points.   Electronic signatures affected (severity 5- disastrous): In one country only the qualified electronic signature  part of the national eID cards was affected by ROCA. The national authority decided to revoke hundreds of  thousands of certificates and issued new certificates with a longer (RSA 3072 bit) key pair. Additionally ROCA  triggered a transition from RSA to ECDSA, and the usage of Extended Access Control (EAC) to secure remote  issuance of qualified certificates.  40%  60%  Severity rating ROCA related incidents  3-significant  4-severe  5-disastrous  Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2017  16  5. Conclusions  This document, the Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2017, aggregates and analyses the annual  summary reports from EU Member States about security breaches notified by trust service providers. We can draw  the following conclusions:   The number of notified security breaches increased significantly, in comparison to the previous year. This  should not be interpreted as a sign of decreasing security. Also in the first years of security incident reporting  in the telecom sector there was a gradual increase of the number of reported incidents, because it takes  some time for service providers to become familiar with the breach reporting obligations and the procedure.   Almost half of the notified breaches, 43%, involve certificates for electronic signatures and electronic seals.   System failures, third party failures and human errors are the main root causes. Only 7% of the breaches are  caused by malicious actions.   Almost half of the notified breaches, 46%, had an impact across borders. This shows that indeed the EU trust  services sector is to a large extent cross-border with suppliers and providers offering services across the EU.   Half of the incidents were rated as having a severe (level 4) or disastrous impact (level 5). Half of the cross-  border incidents were rated has having a disastrous impact (level 5).   A number of notified breaches had the same underlying cause, i.e. the ROCA case.  The general conclusions we can draw from this is that cross-border collaboration and information exchange are very  important when it comes to supervision and ensuring the security of trust services in the EU. eIDAS provides the  legal basis for collaboration and information exchange mechanisms between supervisory bodies. The sooner  organizations learn about threats and incidents, the sooner they can decide the best course for mitigation. Good  information exchange about threats and incidents makes mitigation easier.

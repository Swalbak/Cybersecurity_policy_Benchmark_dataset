Hardening applications on workstations is an important part of reducing this risk.  This publication provides recommendations on hardening Microsoft 365, Office 2021, Office 2019 and Office 2016  applications. Before implementing the recommendations in this publication, testing should be undertaken to ensure  the potential for unintended negative impacts on business processes is reduced as much as possible.  The Group Policy Administrative Templates for Microsoft 365, Office 2021, Office 2019 and Office 2016 can be obtained  from Microsoft. Once downloaded, the ADMX and associated ADML files can be placed in  %SystemDrive%\\Windows\\SYSVOL\\domain\\Policies\\PolicyDefinitions on the Domain Controller and they will be  automatically loaded in the Group Policy Management Editor. For cloud-based policy configurations, equivalents are  available in Microsoft 365 Apps admin centre for many of the Group Policy settings. Finally, as Group Policy settings for  Microsoft Office are periodically updated by Microsoft, care should be taken to ensure the latest version is always used.  High priorities  The following recommendations, listed in alphabetical order, should be treated as high priorities when hardening  Microsoft Office deployments.  Attack Surface Reduction  Attack Surface Reduction (ASR), a security feature of Microsoft Windows 10, forms part of Microsoft Defender Exploit  Guard. It is designed to combat the threat of malware exploiting legitimate functionality in Microsoft Office  applications. In order to use ASR, Microsoft Defender Antivirus must be configured as the primary real-time antivirus  scanning engine on workstations.  ASR offers a number of Microsoft Office-related attack surface reduction rules, these include:   Block executable content from email client and webmail  BE9BA2D9-53EA-4CDC-84E5-9B1EEEE46550   Block all Office applications from creating child processes  D4F940AB-401B-4EFC-AADC-AD5F3C50688A   Block Office applications from creating executable content  3B576869-A4EC-4529-8536-B80A7769E899   Block Office applications from injecting code into other processes  75668C1F-73B5-4CF0-BB93-3ECF5CB7CC84  Hardening Microsoft 365,  Office 2021, Office 2019  and Office 2016  First published: December 2016  Last updated: January 2022  https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=49030 https://config.office.com/ https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction?view=o365-worldwide  2   Block Win32 API calls from Office macro  92E97FA1-2EDF-4476-BDD6-9DD0B4DDDC7B   Block Office communication application from creating child processes  26190899-1602-49E8-8B27-EB1D0A1CE869.  Organisations should either implement ASR using Microsoft Defender Antivirus or use third party antivirus solutions  that offer similar functionality to those provided by ASR. For older versions of Microsoft Windows, alternative measures  will need to be implemented to mitigate certain threats addressed by ASR, such as the likes of Dynamic Data Exchange  (DDE) attacks.  For organisations using Microsoft Defender Antivirus, the following Group Policy setting can be implemented to enforce  the above ASR rules.

Unfortunately, adversaries can use this  functionality to embed malicious Flash content in Microsoft Office documents as part of spear phishing campaigns. To  reduce this risk, activation of Flash content should be blocked in Microsoft Office documents.  The following Group Policy setting can be implemented to block the use of Flash in Microsoft Office.  Group Policy Setting Recommended Option  Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\MS Security Guide  Block Flash activation in Office documents Block all activation  Latest version  Newer versions of Microsoft Office offer significant improvements in security features, functionality and stability. It is  often the lack of improved security features that allows an adversary to easily compromise older versions of Microsoft  Office. To reduce this risk, the latest supported version of Microsoft Office (Microsoft 365 or Office 2021) should be  used.  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/security-updates/securityadvisories/2017/4053440 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/security-updates/securityadvisories/2017/4053440  3  Loading external content  Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) is a protocol used for transferring data between applications. For example, using  external data sources to automatically update content in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. Unfortunately, adversaries can  use DDE functionality, and other methods of loading external content, for malicious purposes. To reduce this risk,  organisations should disable the ability to load data from external data sources in Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word.  The following registry entries can be implemented using Group Policy preferences to assist in the prevention of loading  malicious data from external data sources when using Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word.  Registry Entry Recommended Option  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Excel\\Security  DataConnectionWarnings REG_DWORD 0x00000002 (2)  RichDataConnectionWarnings REG_DWORD 0x00000002 (2)  WorkbookLinkWarnings REG_DWORD 0x00000002 (2)  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Word\\Security  AllowDDE REG_DWORD 0x00000000 (0)  The following Group Policy settings can be implemented to assist in the prevention of loading malicious data from  external data sources when using Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word.

Macros are powerful tools that can be easily created by novice users to greatly improve their  productivity. However, an adversary can also create macros to perform a variety of malicious activities, such as assisting  to compromise workstations in order to exfiltrate or deny access to sensitive information. To reduce this risk,  organisations should either disable or secure their use of Microsoft Office macros.  For information on securing the use of Microsoft Office macros see the Microsoft Office Macro Security publication.  Object Linking and Embedding packages  Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) packages allow for content from other applications to be embedded into Microsoft  Excel spreadsheets, Microsoft PowerPoint presentations and Microsoft Word documents. Unfortunately, like Microsoft  Office macros, adversaries can use OLE packages to execute malicious code. To reduce this risk, organisations should  prevent the activation of OLE packages in Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint and Microsoft Word.  The following registry entries can be implemented using Group Policy preferences to prevent the activation of OLE  packages in Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint and Microsoft Word.  Registry Entry Recommended Value  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Excel\\Security  PackagerPrompt REG_DWORD 0x00000002 (2)  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\PowerPoint\\Security  PackagerPrompt REG_DWORD 0x00000002 (2)  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Word\\Security  PackagerPrompt REG_DWORD 0x00000002 (2)  Patching security vulnerabilities  To address security vulnerabilities identified in Microsoft Office, Microsoft regularly releases patches. If patches are not  applied in an appropriate timeframe it can allow an adversary to easily compromise workstations. To reduce this risk,  patches should be applied in an appropriate timeframe as determined by the severity of security vulnerabilities they  address and any mitigating measures already in place.  For more information on determining the severity of security vulnerabilities and appropriate timeframes for applying  patches see the Assessing Security Vulnerabilities and Applying Patches  publication.  Medium priorities  The following recommendations, listed in alphabetical order, should be treated as medium priorities when hardening  Microsoft Office deployments.  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/system-hardening-and-administration/system-hardening/microsoft-office-macro-security https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/system-hardening-and-administration/system-administration/assessing-security-vulnerabilities-and-applying-patches  5  ActiveX  While ActiveX controls can be used for legitimate business purposes to provide additional functionality for Microsoft  Office, they can also be used by an adversary to gain unauthorised access to sensitive information or to execute  malicious code. To reduce this risk, ActiveX controls should be disabled for Microsoft Office.  The following Group Policy setting can be implemented to disable the use of ActiveX controls in Microsoft Office.  Group Policy Setting Recommended Option  User Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Microsoft Office 2016\\Security Settings  Disable All ActiveX Enabled  Add-ins  While add-ins can be used for legitimate business purposes to provide additional functionality for Microsoft Office, they  can also be used by an adversary to gain unauthorised access to sensitive information or to execute malicious code. To  reduce this risk, add-in use should be managed.  The following Group Policy settings can be implemented to manage add-ins in Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint,  Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio and Microsoft Word.

By default, users will be warned when file content or MIME type doesn’t match the file  extension; however, users can still allow such files to open. As such, it is important that only Microsoft Excel files that  pass integrity checks are allowed to be opened. To reduce this risk, Extension Hardening functionality should be  enabled for Microsoft Excel.  The following Group Policy setting can be implemented to enable Extension Hardening functionality in Microsoft Excel.  Group Policy Setting Recommended Option  User Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Microsoft Excel 2016\\Excel Options\\Security  Force file extension to match file type Enabled  Always match file type  File Type Blocking  File Type Blocking can be used to block insecure file types such as legacy, binary and beta file types from opening in  Microsoft Office. By failing to block such file types, an adversary can exploit vulnerabilities in these file types to execute  malicious code on workstations. To reduce this risk, insecure file types should be prevented from opening in Microsoft  Office.  The following Group Policy settings can be implemented to block specified file types in Microsoft Excel, Microsoft  PowerPoint, Microsoft Visio and Microsoft Word.

By  default, Microsoft Office files that fail OFV checking will be opened in Protected View, with users given the option to  enable editing. Alternatively, OFV can be configured to open Microsoft Office files in Protected View in an enforced  read-only state or simply block them from opening. If Microsoft Office is configured to disable OFV, users may be  unaware that they are opening a Microsoft Office file that may be malicious in nature. To reduce this risk, OFV  functionality should be enabled for Microsoft Office.  The following Group Policy settings can be implemented to enable OFV functionality in Microsoft Excel, Microsoft  PowerPoint and Microsoft Word.  10  Group Policy Settings Recommended Option  User Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Microsoft Excel 2016\\Excel Options\\Security  Turn off file validation Disabled  User Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Microsoft PowerPoint 2016\\PowerPoint Options\\Security  Turn off file validation Disabled  User Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Microsoft Word 2016\\Word Options\\Security  Turn off file validation Disabled  Running external programs  Microsoft PowerPoint offers the ability to assign the ‘Run Program’ functionality to action buttons. In doing so, clicking  on an action button would automatically execute the assigned program without prompting. This functionality could be  leveraged by an adversary to execute a malicious program or leverage other legitimate programs to further a targeted  cyber intrusion. To reduce this risk, the ability to run external programs using action buttons should be disabled.  The following Group Policy setting can be implemented to disable the ability to use action buttons to run external  programs in Microsoft PowerPoint.  Group Policy Settings Recommended Option  User Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Microsoft PowerPoint 2016\\PowerPoint Options\\Security  Run Programs disable (don’t run any programs)  Protected View  Protected View can be used to open Microsoft Office files from untrusted locations in a sandboxed environment. By  default, Protected View is enabled for Microsoft Office files that have been downloaded from the internet, opened  from a defined unsafe location or opened as an attachment from Microsoft Outlook. However, organisations can  choose to disable Protected View for any or all of these scenarios. If so, an adversary could exploit any of these avenues  to deliver a malicious Microsoft Office file to a user’s workstation. To reduce this risk, Protected View should be  enabled for Microsoft Office.  The following Group Policy settings can be implemented to enable Protected View functionality in Microsoft Excel,  Microsoft PowerPoint and Microsoft Word.

An  adversary can exploit this trust by modifying trusted documents to contain malicious code. To reduce this risk, trusted  documents should be disabled for Microsoft Office.  The following Group Policy settings can be implemented to disable the use of trusted documents in Microsoft Excel,  Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Visio and Microsoft Word.  12  Group Policy Settings Recommended Option  User Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Microsoft Excel 2016\\Excel Options\\Security\\Trust Center  Turn off trusted documents Enabled  Turn off Trusted Documents on the network Enabled  User Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Microsoft PowerPoint 2016\\PowerPoint Options\\Security\\  Trust Center  Turn off trusted documents Enabled  Turn off Trusted Documents on the network Enabled  User Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Microsoft Visio 2016\\Visio Options\\Security\\Trust Center  Turn off trusted documents Enabled  Turn off Trusted Documents on the network Enabled  User Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Microsoft Word 2016\\Word Options\\Security\\Trust Center  Turn off trusted documents Enabled  Turn off Trusted Documents on the network Enabled  Low priorities  The following recommendations, listed in alphabetical order, should be treated as low priorities when hardening  Microsoft Office deployments.  Hidden markup  To assist users in collaborating on the development of Microsoft Office files, Microsoft Office allows users to track  changes relating to insertions, deletions and formatting of content, as well as providing the ability to make comments.  Users may choose to either view or hide these markups. If markup content is hidden, users may be unaware that  sensitive changes or comments may still be included when Microsoft Office files are distributed to external parties or  released into the public domain. To reduce this risk, users should be made aware of hidden markup in Microsoft Office  files.  The following Group Policy settings can be implemented to make users aware of hidden markup in Microsoft  PowerPoint and Microsoft Word files.  Group Policy Settings Recommended Option  User Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Microsoft PowerPoint 2016\\PowerPoint Options\\Security  13  Make hidden markup visible Enabled  User Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Microsoft Word 2016\\Word Options\\Security  Make hidden markup visible Enabled  Reporting information  Microsoft Office contains in-built functionality, namely the Office Feedback Tool, which allows users to provide  feedback, including screenshots, to Microsoft. This information if captured by an adversary could expose sensitive  information on workstations such as file names, directory names, versions of installed applications or content open in  other applications. This information could subsequently be used by an adversary to tailor malicious code to target  specific workstations or users. To reduce this risk, functionality in Microsoft Office that allows reporting of information  to Microsoft should be disabled.  The following Group Policy settings can be implemented to prevent users reporting information to Microsoft.  Group Policy Setting Recommended Option  User Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Microsoft Office 2016\\Privacy\\Trust Center  Allow including screenshot with Office Feedback Disabled  Automatically receive small updates to improve  reliability  Disabled  Configure the type of diagnostic data sent by Office to  Microsoft  Enabled  Type of diagnostic data: Basic  Disable Opt-in Wizard on first run Enabled  Enable Customer Experience Improvement Program Disabled  Send Office Feedback Disabled  Send personal information Disabled  Further information  The Information Security Manual is a cyber security framework that organisations can apply to protect their systems  and data from cyber threats.

For information on securing the use of Microsoft Office macros see the Microsoft Office Macro Security publication.  Object Linking and Embedding packages  Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) packages allow for content from other applications to be embedded into Microsoft  Excel spreadsheets, Microsoft PowerPoint presentations and Microsoft Word documents. Unfortunately, like Microsoft  Office macros, adversaries can use OLE packages to execute malicious code. To reduce this risk, organisations should  prevent the activation of OLE packages in Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint and Microsoft Word.  The following registry entries can be implemented using Group Policy preferences to prevent the activation of OLE  packages in Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint and Microsoft Word.  Registry Entry Recommended Value  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Excel\\Security  PackagerPrompt REG_DWORD 0x00000002 (2)  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\PowerPoint\\Security  PackagerPrompt REG_DWORD 0x00000002 (2)  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Word\\Security  PackagerPrompt REG_DWORD 0x00000002 (2)  Patching security vulnerabilities  To address security vulnerabilities identified in Microsoft Office, Microsoft regularly releases patches. If patches are not  applied in an appropriate timeframe it can allow an adversary to easily compromise workstations. To reduce this risk,  patches should be applied in an appropriate timeframe as determined by the severity of security vulnerabilities they  address and any mitigating measures already in place.  For more information on determining the severity of security vulnerabilities and appropriate timeframes for applying  patches see the Assessing Security Vulnerabilities and Applying Patches  publication.  Medium priorities  The following recommendations, listed in alphabetical order, should be treated as medium priorities when hardening  Microsoft Office deployments.  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/system-hardening-and-administration/system-hardening/microsoft-office-macro-security https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/system-hardening-and-administration/system-administration/assessing-security-vulnerabilities-and-applying-patches  5  ActiveX  While ActiveX controls can be used for legitimate business purposes to provide additional functionality for Microsoft  Office, they can also be used by an adversary to gain unauthorised access to sensitive information or to execute  malicious code. To reduce this risk, ActiveX controls should be disabled for Microsoft Office.  The following Group Policy setting can be implemented to disable the use of ActiveX controls in Microsoft Office.  Group Policy Setting Recommended Option  User Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Microsoft Office 2016\\Security Settings  Disable All ActiveX Enabled  Add-ins  While add-ins can be used for legitimate business purposes to provide additional functionality for Microsoft Office, they  can also be used by an adversary to gain unauthorised access to sensitive information or to execute malicious code. To  reduce this risk, add-in use should be managed.  The following Group Policy settings can be implemented to manage add-ins in Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint,  Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio and Microsoft Word.

By default, users will be warned when file content or MIME type doesn’t match the file  extension; however, users can still allow such files to open. As such, it is important that only Microsoft Excel files that  pass integrity checks are allowed to be opened. To reduce this risk, Extension Hardening functionality should be  enabled for Microsoft Excel.  The following Group Policy setting can be implemented to enable Extension Hardening functionality in Microsoft Excel.  Group Policy Setting Recommended Option  User Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Microsoft Excel 2016\\Excel Options\\Security  Force file extension to match file type Enabled  Always match file type  File Type Blocking  File Type Blocking can be used to block insecure file types such as legacy, binary and beta file types from opening in  Microsoft Office. By failing to block such file types, an adversary can exploit vulnerabilities in these file types to execute  malicious code on workstations. To reduce this risk, insecure file types should be prevented from opening in Microsoft  Office.  The following Group Policy settings can be implemented to block specified file types in Microsoft Excel, Microsoft  PowerPoint, Microsoft Visio and Microsoft Word.

By  default, Microsoft Office files that fail OFV checking will be opened in Protected View, with users given the option to  enable editing. Alternatively, OFV can be configured to open Microsoft Office files in Protected View in an enforced  read-only state or simply block them from opening. If Microsoft Office is configured to disable OFV, users may be  unaware that they are opening a Microsoft Office file that may be malicious in nature. To reduce this risk, OFV  functionality should be enabled for Microsoft Office.  The following Group Policy settings can be implemented to enable OFV functionality in Microsoft Excel, Microsoft  PowerPoint and Microsoft Word.  10  Group Policy Settings Recommended Option  User Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Microsoft Excel 2016\\Excel Options\\Security  Turn off file validation Disabled  User Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Microsoft PowerPoint 2016\\PowerPoint Options\\Security  Turn off file validation Disabled  User Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Microsoft Word 2016\\Word Options\\Security  Turn off file validation Disabled  Running external programs  Microsoft PowerPoint offers the ability to assign the ‘Run Program’ functionality to action buttons. In doing so, clicking  on an action button would automatically execute the assigned program without prompting. This functionality could be  leveraged by an adversary to execute a malicious program or leverage other legitimate programs to further a targeted  cyber intrusion. To reduce this risk, the ability to run external programs using action buttons should be disabled.  The following Group Policy setting can be implemented to disable the ability to use action buttons to run external  programs in Microsoft PowerPoint.  Group Policy Settings Recommended Option  User Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Microsoft PowerPoint 2016\\PowerPoint Options\\Security  Run Programs disable (don’t run any programs)  Protected View  Protected View can be used to open Microsoft Office files from untrusted locations in a sandboxed environment. By  default, Protected View is enabled for Microsoft Office files that have been downloaded from the internet, opened  from a defined unsafe location or opened as an attachment from Microsoft Outlook. However, organisations can  choose to disable Protected View for any or all of these scenarios. If so, an adversary could exploit any of these avenues  to deliver a malicious Microsoft Office file to a user’s workstation. To reduce this risk, Protected View should be  enabled for Microsoft Office.  The following Group Policy settings can be implemented to enable Protected View functionality in Microsoft Excel,  Microsoft PowerPoint and Microsoft Word.

An  adversary can exploit this trust by modifying trusted documents to contain malicious code. To reduce this risk, trusted  documents should be disabled for Microsoft Office.  The following Group Policy settings can be implemented to disable the use of trusted documents in Microsoft Excel,  Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Visio and Microsoft Word.  12  Group Policy Settings Recommended Option  User Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Microsoft Excel 2016\\Excel Options\\Security\\Trust Center  Turn off trusted documents Enabled  Turn off Trusted Documents on the network Enabled  User Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Microsoft PowerPoint 2016\\PowerPoint Options\\Security\\  Trust Center  Turn off trusted documents Enabled  Turn off Trusted Documents on the network Enabled  User Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Microsoft Visio 2016\\Visio Options\\Security\\Trust Center  Turn off trusted documents Enabled  Turn off Trusted Documents on the network Enabled  User Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Microsoft Word 2016\\Word Options\\Security\\Trust Center  Turn off trusted documents Enabled  Turn off Trusted Documents on the network Enabled  Low priorities  The following recommendations, listed in alphabetical order, should be treated as low priorities when hardening  Microsoft Office deployments.  Hidden markup  To assist users in collaborating on the development of Microsoft Office files, Microsoft Office allows users to track  changes relating to insertions, deletions and formatting of content, as well as providing the ability to make comments.  Users may choose to either view or hide these markups. If markup content is hidden, users may be unaware that  sensitive changes or comments may still be included when Microsoft Office files are distributed to external parties or  released into the public domain. To reduce this risk, users should be made aware of hidden markup in Microsoft Office  files.  The following Group Policy settings can be implemented to make users aware of hidden markup in Microsoft  PowerPoint and Microsoft Word files.  Group Policy Settings Recommended Option  User Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Microsoft PowerPoint 2016\\PowerPoint Options\\Security  13  Make hidden markup visible Enabled  User Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Microsoft Word 2016\\Word Options\\Security  Make hidden markup visible Enabled  Reporting information  Microsoft Office contains in-built functionality, namely the Office Feedback Tool, which allows users to provide  feedback, including screenshots, to Microsoft. This information if captured by an adversary could expose sensitive  information on workstations such as file names, directory names, versions of installed applications or content open in  other applications. This information could subsequently be used by an adversary to tailor malicious code to target  specific workstations or users. To reduce this risk, functionality in Microsoft Office that allows reporting of information  to Microsoft should be disabled.  The following Group Policy settings can be implemented to prevent users reporting information to Microsoft.  Group Policy Setting Recommended Option  User Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Microsoft Office 2016\\Privacy\\Trust Center  Allow including screenshot with Office Feedback Disabled  Automatically receive small updates to improve  reliability  Disabled  Configure the type of diagnostic data sent by Office to  Microsoft  Enabled  Type of diagnostic data: Basic  Disable Opt-in Wizard on first run Enabled  Enable Customer Experience Improvement Program Disabled  Send Office Feedback Disabled  Send personal information Disabled  Further information  The Information Security Manual is a cyber security framework that organisations can apply to protect their systems  and data from cyber threats.

This Regulation strengthens the provisions  for interoperability and mutual recognition of electronic identification schemes across borders,  enhances current rules for electronic signatures and provides a legal framework for other types of  trust services (electronic seals, electronic delivery services, electronic documents, time stamping  services and web site authentication).  At the same time, in the field of promoting a Single Market for cybersecurity products, the cyber  security strategy underlines the importance of CSCG and ENISA, by stating: “the Commission will  support the development of security standards”; “Such work should build on the on-going  standardisation work of the European Standardisation Organisations (CEN, CENELEC and ETSI), of the  Cybersecurity Coordination Group (CSCG) as well as on the expertise of ENISA, the Commission and  other relevant players”.  This paper explains why standards are important for cyber security, specifically in the area of  electronic identification and trust services providers. A number of challenges associated with the  definition and deployment of standards in the area of cyber security are discussed. This is followed by  a brief overview of several key EU initiatives in this area.  The paper also discusses concrete standardisation activities associated with electronic IDs and trust  service providers, providing an overview of standards developed under the mandate m460 from the  European Commission and others, related to eIDAS Regulation. It concludes with a proposal of a  standard on cryptographic suites for electronic signatures and infrastructures, put forward by ENISA  and related to the ETSI TS 119 312.  1 https://www.eid-stork.eu/  https://www.eid-stork.eu/  Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers  Inventory of activities  Version 1.0, December 2014  Page  iv  Table of Contents  Executive summary iii  1 Introduction 1  2 Importance of standards in information security 2  3 Standardisation challenges in Cyber Security 3  3.1 Organisational challenges 3  3.2 Areas of standardisation 3  3.3 Lack of agility 3  3.4 Competing sets of standards 4  3.5 Economic considerations 4  3.6 Lack of awareness 4  4 Cyber security strategy of the European Union 5  5 Cyber Security Coordination Group 7  6 Strategy towards standardisation options 8  7 Standardisation activities in the area of Electronic Signatures and Trust Service  Providers 9  8 Proposal for replacement of ETSI TS 119 312 13  Annex 1 – Proposal for replacement of ETSI TS 119 312 15  Annex 2 – References 24  Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers  Inventory of activities  Version 1.0, December 2014  Page  1  1 Introduction  In the Cyber Security Strategy of the EU 2 , the European Union reaffirms the importance of all  stakeholders in the current Internet governance model and supports the multi-stakeholder  governance approach. Indeed, the multi-stakeholder approach is fundamental to the development of  successful standards, particularly in the area of cyber security where public sector requirements are  implemented to a large extent by private sector service providers.  In the field of promoting a Single Market for cybersecurity products, the cyber security strategy  underlines the importance of the Cybersescurity Coordination Group3 and ENISA. It states, among  others, that: “the Commission will support the development of security standards”; “Such work should  build on the on-going standardisation work of the European Standardisation Organisations (CEN,  CENELEC and ETSI), of the Cybersecurity Coordination Group (CSCG) as well as on the expertise of  ENISA, the Commission and other relevant players”.  A number of EU governments are now promoting the broader adoption and use of standards. A good  example is a standardisation policy for software interoperability, data and document formats in  government IT specifications, published by the UK government.4 Standards also play an important role  in the EU’s Digital Agenda. Quoting the then European Commission’s Vice President Neelie Kroes, they  “create competition, lead to innovation, and save money”.  Within the private sector, industrial interest in standardisation activities in the area of NIS tends to be  driven by areas of work that are in line with the core interests of product developers or service  providers. Aligning public sector goals with standardisation priorities of the private sector remains  challenging.  Where information security is concerned, there is clearly room for improvement in identifying and  responding to evolving risks and technology developments. In particular, the time lag between the  appearance of a new technology or technically driven business model and the availability of applicable  standards is still too long.  2 http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667  3 http://www.cencenelec.eu/standards/Sectors/DefenceSecurityPrivacy/Security/Pages/Cybersecurity.aspx  4 Like https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-principles  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667 http://www.cencenelec.eu/standards/Sectors/DefenceSecurityPrivacy/Security/Pages/Cybersecurity.aspx https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-principles  Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers  Inventory of activities  Version 1.0, December 2014  Page  2  2 Importance of standards in information security  There are many reasons why standards have an important role to play in improving approaches to  information security that involve different geographical regions or different communities. Some of the  more important reasons include:  • Improving efficiency and effectiveness of key processes.  • Facilitating systems integration and interoperability  • Enabling different products or methods to be compared in a meaningful manner.  • Providing a means for users to assess new products or services.  • Structuring the approach to deploying new technologies or business models.  • Simplification of complex environments.  • Promoting economic growth.  Standardising processes and procedures is an essential part of achieving successful cooperation in a  cross-border or cross-community multi-vendor environment. Without such standardisation,  communication is likely to be inefficient and could result in a process that is ineffective. An illustrative  example is provided by the way in which different countries would react to a significant cyber incident.  Here, in line with the principle of subsidiarity and the need to preserve sovereign state control,  decision making is made in a distributed environment and the processes that support this process  must be optimal. Standardised operating procedures could help ensure that various countries can  interact with each other according to one set of predefined and agreed procedures.  Similarly, specifications such as ISO 27001  encourage the adoption of a standard organization  structure, which makes it easier for customers to understand how processes work and also reduces  the costs of auditing and due diligence. This is largely due to the fact that these organisational  standards provide a blue-print for setting up a management system for security, but also for a blue- print for auditing and checking compliance of an organisation to security best practices.  Standards play a key role in ensuring that security products can be put together into systems capable  of detecting and responding to real events. In particular, standard interfaces and protocols make  systems integration much simpler and allow products to interoperate in heterogeneous  environments. Standardisation of testing methods also makes it possible to compare security products  in a meaningful manner (‘benchmarking’) and provide a means for the end user to assess new products  or services. The level of compatibility of cryptographic modules with the FIPS 140-2 standard  (which  is used to accredit such products) for instance is used to assess the ability of such products to meet  certain security requirements.  By structuring the approach to deploying new technologies or business models, standards help to  reduce the complexity of the business environments that deploy them, which in turn makes it easier  to secure the resulting environment. Although there is also an argument against standardisation in  this respect, notably that any vulnerabilites associated with such systems will also be ‘standardised’,  making it possible to conduct attacks against large numbers of systems in a short timescale. The usual  way of dealing with this however is not to avoid standardisation but to ensure that the defences used  to protect information systems are not critically dependent on a single system or type of system – this  is the principle of defence in depth.  Last but not least, the use of standards encourages information exchange among developers and it is  likely to result in greater competition among product developers.  All these factors have a great impact on the overall preparedness of the governments to the cyber  threat. Standardised technologies and approaches enhance harmonisation among cooperating  countries, ensure a larger pool of experts available and higher level of knowledge of systems deployed.  Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers  Inventory of activities  Version 1.0, December 2014  Page  3  3 Standardisation challenges in Cyber Security  Despite the fact that an appropriate use of standards is clearly beneficial to achieving a strong  approach to security in a cross-border environment, there are also many challenges to achieving this  in practice.  3.1 Organisational challenges  Over the last ten years a plethora of SDOs (Standard Development Organisations) have been created.  In many occasions these organisations have been initiated by industry (e.g. Oasis, W3C, Open Data  Center, IETF, Adobe, ITIL and many others) to a certain extent as a reaction of the industry to the large  investment in terms of time and people required by ‘traditional’ SDOs (such as ETSI, CEN-CENELEC,  ISO, ITU) and partially the result of convergence where standardisation fora that traditionally focused  on a specific sector (e.g. IEEE) found applicability in many different business sectors. The number of  SDOs and the number of published standards has increased, which can be a source of confusion to  end users.  3.2 Areas of standardisation  Industrial interest in standardisation activities in the area of NIS tends to be driven by areas of work  that lay in line with the core interests of service providers (for example authentication, billing, etc.).  Although an increased general interest in the area of privacy is observed, specific interest of industry  is expected to become lower since privacy enhancing technologies are perceived as being in conflict  with commercial expectations.  At the time of writing, there is no single, continuous “line of standards” related to cyber security, but  rather a number of discrete areas which are the subject of standardisation:  • Technical standards  • Metrics (related mostly to business continuity)  • Definitions  • Organisational aspects  Some areas could be potentially considered as over-standardised. There are several standards on  information security governance and risk management.  In some areas standards are lacking, for example there are relatively few standards that deal with  compliance to privacy and data protection legislation. Similarly, there are not many standards covering  service levels, or more broadly, service agreements and service contracts, terms of use and conditions,  et cetera. A quick look across the different offerings of cloud providers will show that every provider  has a different lengthy legal text describing the terms of use and exceptions to obligations.  3.3 Lack of agility  Designing and agreeing standards is a lengthy process, measured in years. The IT landscape on the  other hand evolves rapidly and, in order to remain useful, standards need to evolve at a comparable  pace. Failure to do so will result in standards that are either obsolete or only partially applicable to  real life environments.  One solution to this issue could be sought in the direction of using ‘good practices’ as precursors for  standards. Good practicesare generally subjected to change control procedures that are much less  stringent than those applied to candidate standards and could therefore be developed to maturity  more quickly. Good practices that are sufficiently mature could then be used as a basis for a  corresponding standard.  Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers  Inventory of activities  Version 1.0, December 2014  Page  4  With regard to standards, a ‘fast track’ mechanism could be developed and agreed among interested  parties, to be able to publish non-controversial standards in a quicker manner.  3.4 Competing sets of standards  In some areas of information security there are several different groups of standards that are defined.  To some extent, these standards are competing with each other for adoption and it is often difficult  for the end user to judge which standards are the best choice for their particular requirements.  Occasionally, it is necessary to mix and match standards from different families in order to achieve the  goal. When implementing Public key Infrastructure (PKI) for instance, it is not unusual to see  organisations adopt such a combination of standards (for example X.509 (ITU) for the certificate  format, PKIX (IETF) standards for core PKI and PKCS (RSA) standards for interfacing to secure devices).  3.5 Economic considerations  Although some providers see their use of recognised standards as a unique selling point, there are  also many cases of vendors who have a dominant position, who insist on their own proprietary  standards and fail to constructively support and implement standards for their products. For instance,  the fact that every mobile phone vendor uses different charger plugs is annoying for consumers, and  it is wasteful in terms of resources. In order to resolve this situation, the EU followed up an industry  initiative  to adopt a single standard universal mobile phone charger plug.  Companies with a dominant position have few incentives to adopt interoperable standards, because  it would only reinforce the position of competitors. For a dominant vendor there are advantages to  using proprietary standards, because they lock-in the customer. Lock-in means that:  • The customer cannot buy or integrate with compatible products from competitors, which  generates more revenue for the provider.  • It is hard for customers to switch to another supplier, because they cannot easily move  their data and processes to a competitor.  3.6 Lack of awareness  Despite the clear disadvantages associated with the use of proprietary standards, there are still many  examples of cases where customers (especially in this context we consider as ‘customers’ national  authorities, governmental organisations, etc.) fail to demand open standards. This may well be due to  a lack of awareness of the existence of such standards.  Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers  Inventory of activities  Version 1.0, December 2014  Page  5  4 Cyber security strategy of the European Union  The European Commission published the Cybersecurity strategy of the European Union5 on 4 February  2013. This strategy provides a harmonised framework for the evolution of three different aspects of  cyber security, which until recently had been evolving independently. In so doing, the Commission  recognised and responded to the need to bring different communities together to improve the  approach to cyber security across the EU and laid the foundations for a more coordinated approach.  The Cyber Security Strategy of the EU also includes a proposal for a Directive on Network and  Information Security (NIS) requiring the Member States (MS) to have minimum NIS capabilities in  place, to cooperate and exchange information within a dedicated network and requiring the private  sector to adopt NIS enhancing actions.  • The EU reaffirms the importance of commercial and non-governmental entities, involved  in the day-to-day management of Internet standards  • A prime focus should be to create incentives to carry out appropriate risk management  and adopt security standards and solutions, as well as possibly establish voluntary EU- wide certification schemes building on existing schemes in the EU and internationally  • the Commission will support the development of security standards and assist with EU- wide voluntary certification schemes in the area of cloud computing  Under strategic objective 4, the Commission asks ENISA to ‘develop, in cooperation with relevant  national competent authorities, relevant stakeholders, International and European standardisation  bodies and the European Commission Joint Research Centre, technical guidelines and  recommendations for the adoption of NIS standards and good practices in the public and private  sectors.’  This is a timely recommendation as the new ENISA mandate gives the Agency a more proactive role in  this area. The task assigned to ENISA by the new ENISA regulation in this area is to ‘support research  and development and standardisation, by facilitating the establishment and take up of European and  international standards for risk management and for the security of electronic products, networks and  services’.  There are also recommendations for public and private stakeholders. In particular ‘The Commission  invites public and private stakeholders to:  • Stimulate the development and adoption of industry-led security standards, technical  norms and security-by-design and privacy-by-design principles by ICT product  manufacturers and service providers, including cloud providers; new generations of  software and hardware should be equipped with stronger, embedded and user-friendly  security features.  • Develop industry-led standards for companies' performance on cybersecurity and improve  the information available to the public by developing security labels or kite marks helping  the consumer navigate the market.  • An important part of the cyber security strategy is the proposal for a Network and  Information Security (NIS) Directive. This Directive asks the Member States to support  standardisation in the area of NIS:  • Given the global nature of NIS problems, there is a need for closer international  cooperation to improve security standards and information exchange, and promote a  common global approach to NIS issues.  5 http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667  Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers  Inventory of activities  Version 1.0, December 2014  Page  6  • Standardisation of security requirements is a market-driven process. To ensure a  convergent application of security standards, Member States should encourage  compliance or conformity with specified standards to ensure a high level of security at  Union level. To this end, it might be necessary to draft harmonised standards.  Article 16 on standardisation states the following:  • …..Member States shall encourage the use of standards and/or specifications to networks  and information security.  • The Commission shall draw up, by means of implementing acts a list of the standards  referred to in paragraph 1. The list shall be published in the Official Journal of the European  Union  Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers  Inventory of activities  Version 1.0, December 2014  Page  7  5 Cyber Security Coordination Group  In 2011, following a request of the Commission, the Standards Development Organizations (SDOs)  CEN, CENELEC and ETSI have created the CEN‐CENELEC‐ETSI ‘Cyber Security Coordination Group’  (CSCG) for strategic advice in the field of IT security, Network and Information Security and cyber  security. The main objectives of the CSCG are to  • Establish a European standardisation roadmap in the above mentioned areas  • Act as the main contact point for all questions by EU institutions related to standardisation  issues  • Define and propose to the Commission a cooperation strategy between the EU and the  US for the establishment of a framework, relating to standardisation of cyber security.  The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) has participated and  contributed to the activities of the CSCG since its launch. A first white paper was addressed by the  members of CSCG to the Commission with strategic advice on the priorities for R&D of EU funded  research in the area and how to optimise EU research with mandates for cyber security  standardisation.  Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers  Inventory of activities  Version 1.0, December 2014  Page  8  6 Strategy towards standardisation options  One of the issues that the European Union needs to address is the strategy towards standardisation  in the area of ICT. The current approach is not consistent and lacks a unified vision. In this light the EC  has taken an initiative in 2011 in order to promote a coordinated approach at EU level. For this purpose  the Commission (DG CONNECT) supported also by ENISA has identified possible alternatives and  options briefly summarized below.6 High level strategic options for recommendations on security  standards could be:  1. General recommendations  They can only be applied to specific cases, otherwise they are not considered by any communities, no  more than very generic recommendations on security in general.  2. Recommendations targeting organizations (such as ISO 27000 for the management of  information security or ISO 31000 for risk assessment within organizations)  Very costly and possibly limiting innovations. This option has a lot of potential if implemented in a  correct (and acceptable by industry) way. A European framework for standards would be ‘nice to have’  on one hand, but on the other would be very costly, would require a lot of resources (in terms of  research and following-up related activities). However, the adoption of standards could be enforced  by the European legislation and national competent authorities (for example requiring defined  standards to be applied in order to get authorization to perform certain activities, like provision of ICT  services).  3. Specific recommendations for products / services with dedicated standards (similar to  Common Criteria)  Complicated approach presenting (among others) a problem in the definition of specific products or  services. In the world where most ICT services are converging, identifying a ‘class’ of products is a  challenge.  4. Recommendations on functions / products / services using a mash-up approach  Such a “mash-up\" approach could be an ad hoc solution, where functions, products, services would  need to be selected following an appropriate process  At the EU level it is important to take advantage of Framework Programs of EU funded R&D (FP7) by  funding flagship project/initiatives with clear standardization objectives. The additional benefit of this  approach is that by definition these research projects have strong industrial participation that could  be also ‘channeled’ towards strategic standardization initiatives. For example in the area of Attribute  Based Credentials (ABC) the Commission is funding an interesting Integrated Project that makes use  of IPRs of US based companies (mainly MS and Intel). Even in such (difficult) cases all efforts should  be made for strategic contributions at ETSI.  6 Strategic options for recommendations on the introduction of security standards, draft, European Commission,  December 2011  Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers  Inventory of activities  Version 1.0, December 2014  Page  9  7 Standardisation activities in the area of Electronic Signatures and Trust  Service Providers  In order to create a rationalised framework of the existing European eSignature standardisation  deliverables, supporting also the realisation of the items of the Action Plan related to eSignature and  future adoption of the Regulation on eIDs and TSPs (now known under number 910/2014), the  Commission issued standardisation mandate (m460) to CEN and ETSI in 2010. In July 2012 these two  standardisation bodies  jointly published the \"Rationalised Framework for electronic signature\"7.  The tables below constitute an inventory of standardisation activities in the areas covered by the  adopted eIDAS Regulation.

The goal of this standard is to provide guidance on  which algorithms and key sizes should be used for the creation of electronic signatures. It has been  the subject of modifications and updates during the years. The current ETSI document in some places  shows a lack of adaptation to the current developments.  In 2013 ENISA has published a report “Algorithms, Key Sizes and Parameters”8 (“ENISA document”) in  which sufficient cryptographic solutions to use at the moment of publication are discussed. This  document can be related to the ETSI TS 119 312. In order to support the standardisation in the field  of electronic identification and trust service providers, having regard to the developed capabilities of  ENISA, the Agency has commented on the TS 119 312 in 2014 and hereby proposes a new, unified  version of the possible standard (in Annex 1). The rationale for changes and for the new version is as  explained below.   The document provides now three lists:  o Algorithms and key sizes to be used for the creation of electronic signatures  o Algorithms and key sizes still in use, but to be phased out  o Algorithms and key sizes not to be used anymore   A new SHA-3 standard 9  was added to the document, addressing also the French 10  and  German11 agencies recommendations   Security requirements at the 128-bit level has been homogenized, following, in particular, the  recommendations of the ENISA document. One typical consequence is the removal for the  white list of the hash functions on 224 bits.   Extendable hash functions, which are included in the SHA-3 standard, were added. Such  functions deserve consideration because they simplify the description of padding schemes  such as the full-domain-hash and PSS. Indeed, these schemes require such functions and  before their inclusion in the SHA-3 standard, therefore it was necessary to explain how they  can be derived from ordinary hash functions.   Section on RSA has been modified in order to remove some technical inconsistencies, to take  into account the shared prime factors attacks. A proposal has been made that the public  exponent should be prime, which has no effect on the most common choice e=65537.   It was proposed to remove DSA from the standard due to the absence of a security proof  and  also to the attack of Vaudenay from PKC 200312. This is in line with the ENISA document, which  recommends to prefer Schnorr algorithm to DSA. Instead, EC-Schnorr was added.  8 Reference XXX  9 Draft FIPS Publication 202 (2014).

A paper of Sutherland13 was considered,  which improves the construction of CM-curves.   Description and presentation of the numerous EC-DSA variants was simplified.   PCKS#1 v 1.5 was removed from the document, in line with the ENISA document.   Introduction of the full domain hash padding was added to the document.14   In the proposal of the new document, the use of Nextprime in parameter generation was  added. For efficiency reasons, Nextprime is usually based on pseudo-primality tests.15  13  Andrew V. Sutherland, Computing Hilbert class polynomials with the Chinese remainder theorem.

Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers  Inventory of activities  Version 1.0, December 2014  Page  15  Annex 1 – Proposal for replacement of ETSI TS 119 312  1 Expected security level  As generally recommended by the academic cryptography, the minimum security level for medium or  long-term security corresponds to 128-bit symmetric keys. With this key size, exhaustive search  remains out of range for at least 50 years, even assuming that Moore’s law continues during the full  50 years period with a doubling of computing power for unit cost every year.  In addition, cryptographic schemes offering some formal security argument should be preferred to  schemes whose security is only based on the fact that they have not yet been attacked.  However, this disregards the possibility of quantum computers becoming available during this  timeframe. To account for this possibility, the recommended key size is 256 bits.  For shorter-term security, a 100-bit key is sufficient. Thus, it might be considered for short-term  interoperability purposes.  NOTE 1: This security level is required to resist adversaries. To protect against bad random events that  may occur naturally but cannot be manipulated by an adversary, requirements are less drastic.  Typically, for aircrafts, it is often required that the probability of a catastrophic event should remain  below 10-9 per hour. As a consequence, after taking into account the long time period and the large  number of users, a probability threshold of 2-80 per individual event is sufficient for the purpose of the  document.  2 Hash Functions  Hash functions are keyless cryptographic primitives that need to satisfy several security properties. In  particular, they should resist pre-image and collision attacks. Collision resistance is the strongest of  the two requirements and, due to a generic birthday paradox attack, it requires the output of the  function to be at least twice as big as the desired security level. For 128-bit security, the minimal  output size is 256 bits.  In addition, the recommended hash functions are well known and have shown resistance against the  best cryptanalytic effort of the academic cryptographic community.  The following table includes three lists of hash functions. The first list contains recommended  algorithm. The second list contains algorithms that might be usable in specific applications. These  algorithms are not recommended either because of their output size or because preferable  alternatives are recommended. The third list is a blacklist of algorithms that should no longer be used.  This list is not exhaustive; it only mentions frequently encountered hash functions, which are not  considered secure with current standards.

The recommended algorithms SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512 and SHA-512/256 are part of this family.  SHA-256 can be used for messages with length up to 264-1 bits.  SHA-384, SHA-512 and SHA-512/256 apply to messages with length up to 2128-1 bits.  The output size of the message digest, i.e. of the hash function output, is 256 bits for SHA-256 and  SHA-512/256, 384 bits for SHA-384 and 512 bits for SHA-512.  All these algorithms shall be implemented as defined in FIPS Publication 180-4.  NOTE 1: Whenever possible, SHA-512/256 should be preferred to SHA-256, due to its larger inner state  and its apparently higher security margins.  NOTE 2: FIPS Publication 180-4 also specifies SHA-1, SHA-224 and SHA-512/224, which are not part of  the recommended list of hash functions.  2.1.2 SHA-3 family  The SHA-3 family of algorithms is described in DRAFT FIPS Publication 202.  The recommended algorithms SHA3-256, SHA3-384 and SHA3-512 are part of this family.  SHA-3 algorithms do not have a limit on the length of input messages.  The output size of the message digest is 256 bits for SHA3-256, 384 bits for SHA3-384 and 512 bits for  SHA3-512.  All these algorithms shall be implemented as defined in DRAFT FIPS Publication 202.  NOTE: DRAFT FIPS Publication 202 also specify SHA3-224, which is not part of the recommended list  of hash functions.  2.1.3 SHA-3 extendable output functions  In addition to the SHA-3 algorithms, DRAFT FIPS Publication 202 also specifies two extendable hash  functions SHAKE-128 and SHAKE-256.  These algorithms can be used whenever longer message digest are requested. In particular, they are  well suited for use with the Full-Domain Hash signature padding.  SHAKE-128 and SHAKE-256 shall be implemented as defined in DRAFT FIPS Publication 202.  Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers  Inventory of activities  Version 1.0, December 2014  Page  17  NOTE 1: Using SHAKE-128 for output length up to 256 bits is not recommended. Using SHAKE-256 for  output length up to 512 bits is not recommened.  NOTE 2: Using SHAKE on the same message to produce two digests of different sizes must be avoided  at all costs. Indeed, in this case, the shorter digest is a truncation of the longest one. This can lead to  various attacks against cryptographic protocols.  As explained in Appendix A of DRAFT FIPS Publication 202, to avoid this problem, tags can be added  into the input message to indicate the use and length of the output (in order to provide a form of  domain separation).  3 Signature Suites  A signature suite is a public key cryptosystem that can be used to sign or verify arbitrary messages,  possibly with a length limit. For efficiency, it combines a hash function that is used to represent the  given message by a much shorter digest and a public key algorithm for signing and verifying. This  document includes two large families of signature suites, one based on RSA and the hardness of  factoring and the other based on the discrete logarithm problem.  Every signature scheme consists of three algorithms, one for generating public/private key-pairs, one  for signing an element of the message set and one for verifying the signature of such an element.  These algorithms include calls to hash functions and the security and validity of signatures are deeply  linked to the hash function that is used. Implementers should ensure that attackers cannot manipulate  the users into using weak hash functions when signing messages.  The signature algorithm of a given suite takes as input a private key and a message, it outputs a  signature; the verification algorithm takes as input the corresponding public key, the message and  signature to verify, it outputs Valid or Invalid.  NOTE: There also exists a different flavor of signature schemes, signature with message recovery,  which are not considered in this document.  3.1 RSA Signatures  RSA signature suites include two main components: a basic signature scheme and a padding method.  The basic signature scheme is a public key cryptosystem that can be used to sign or verify special  messages that follow a uniform probability distribution in the set of integers modulo the RSA modulus.  This scheme cannot be directly used to sign arbitrary messages. For this purpose, it needs to be  integrated into a signature suite by adding a padding method.  3.1.1 Basic signature scheme  The RSA algorithm is a trapdoor one-way function whose security requires large and hard-to-factor  numbers. An RSA key pair is constructed by first selecting a public exponent e larger than 216, odd and  preferably prime. Then, two large primes p and q, such that p-1 and q-1 are coprime to e, are selected.  The product N=pq is then computed.  The public key of the algorithm is the pair (N,e).  The private key of the algorithm is the pair (N,d) where d is the smallest representative of the inverse  of e modulo (p-1)(q-1).  Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers  Inventory of activities  Version 1.0, December 2014  Page  18  The signature algorithm takes a uniformly selected random element m from the interval [1,N-1] and  outputs md modulo N.  The verification algorithm takes an element m and a signature s, it outputs Valid when m=se modulo  N and Invalid otherwise.  NOTE: The modulus N is said to be an n-bit number if and only if, 2n-1 ≤ N < 2n. To construct an n-bit  RSA key, each of the two primes p and q should be selected in the interval [2(n-1)/2;2n/2[. Ideally, one  should select p and q uniformly at random in the interval. However, since this distribution is not so  easy to sample efficiently, it is considered acceptable practice to select for each the first prime  following a randomly selected element of the interval, i.e., p=Nextprime(u) and q=Nextprime(v).  It is extremely important to start for two uncorrelated values u and v. Otherwise, the process is flawed  and N can often be factored.  TYPICAL ERROR: One typical mistake is to let p=Nextprime(u) and q=Nextprime(p+1), then N is trivially  factored. Similarly, if p and q are too close from each other factoring N is also easy. For this reason, it  is sometimes recommended to check that the distance between p and q is not too small. However,  the probability that this happens when the primes are correctly generated is well below the probability  of 2-80 that is accepted for non-adversarial errors. As a consequence, there is no need to implement  this test. Indeed, it only protects against one of the many implementation errors that are possible.  RSA key-size:  • For short-term security, corresponding to the 100-bit security level, the RSA key should  have at least 2048 bits.  • For longer-term security, corresponding to the 128-bit security level, the RSA key should  have at least 3072 bits.  • The 256-bit security level required to protect against quantum computers cannot be  achieved with RSA, due to the quantum polynomial time factoring algorithm of Shor.  3.1.2 Padding methods  As explained above, the basic RSA signature scheme cannot be used directly to sign arbitrary  messages. The main reason is that, due to the multiplicativity of RSA, it would not be secure. Indeed,  with the basic scheme, the signature of a product of two numbers is just the product of the two  signatures.  To avoid this attack, messages to be signed should first be transformed into numbers modulo N in a  way that prevents an attack for being able to efficiently construct multiplicative relations between  these numbers. This transformation is called a padding method.  3.1.2.1 Full domain hash  The simplest method to prepare a message M for RSA signature is simply to hash it, i.e. to compute  m=H(M) and then apply the basic RSA signature to m.  However, if H is a usual hash function with short output, this is not secure. For security, one needs to  use a hash function with a large output. This is the full domain hash.  In theoretical papers, one simply assumes that the hash function H outputs digests which are integers  in [1;N-1]. For practical purposes, three variations are possible:  • Choose H0 that outputs bitstrings of the length of N, and define  H(M)=H0(mincount||H0(M)), where mincount is the smallest possible counter value such  that H(M) belongs to [1;N-1]. This corresponds to the theoretical model but does not  permit constant time implementation.  Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers  Inventory of activities  Version 1.0, December 2014  Page  19  • Choose H that outputs bitstrings shorter than N by one bit. The distribution is no longer  uniform. The full domain hash is not proven in this case but no attack is known.  • Choose H0 that outputs bitstrings longer than N by a margin of the order of the security  level and let H(M)=H0(N||M) modulo N. The output of H becomes close to uniform. One  might also consider the simpler variation H(M)=H0(M) modulo N. However, potentially,  the reduction modulo N could cause collision search to become easier, even if it is unclear  how this would apply in the context of RSA. Adding N into the hash computation prevents  attacks based on Vaudenay’s DSA attack.  In the three variations, the hash function with a long output can be derived from an extendable hash  function, preferably using a message header to ensure domain separation.  NOTE: In order for the security proof of full domain hash RSA to be tight, one need to make sure than  the public RSA exponent e is smaller than N1/4.  3.1.2.2 PSS encoding  By contrast with the full domain hash method, this padding technique is probabilistic. As a  consequence, if the same message is signed twice, it will lead to different signatures. Depending on  the application, this can be either an advantage or a drawback.  In addition to the hash function H (with fixed size), PSS encoding also requires a mask generating  function G. Note that G is, in fact, a variable output length function adapted to N.  PSS encoding:   Input: message M, salt size sLen, desired output length nBits   Output: encoding to be signed by the basic RSA scheme   Let m=H(M) of size hLen   If nBits < hLen + sLen + 2 then Abort   Generate random string salt of size sLen   Let M’= 0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||m||salt (concatenation of 8 zero bytes, m and salt)   Let h=H(M’) of size hLen   Let DB = 0||…||0||1||salt, with the number of zeroes chosen to make the length of DB equal  to nLen-hLen-1, where nLen is nBits/8 rounded up.   Compute dbmask=G(h) with variable output size set to nBits-hLen-1   Let maskedDB= DB XOR dbmask and clear the 8nLen-nBits higher order bits of maskedDB.   Let encoding= maskedDB||h||0xbc  The signature itself is simply the encoding raised to the private exponent modulo N.  During verification, the signature is raised to the public exponent and the output is considered as an  encoding to be verified.  PSS encoding verification:   Input: message M, salt size sLen, desired output length nBits   Output: encoding to be verified   Let m=H(M) of size hLen   If nBits < hLen + sLen + 2 then Abort   Parse encoding into maskedDB || h || Oxbc. Abort if failure   Check that the 8nLen-nBits higher order bits of maskedDB are zeroes   Compute dbmask=G(h) with variable output size set to nBits-hLen-1  Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers  Inventory of activities  Version 1.0, December 2014  Page  20   Let DB= maskedDB XOR dbmask and clear the 8nLen-nBits higher order bits of DB.   Parse DB as 0||…||0||1||salt, abort if it fails.   Let M’= 0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||m||salt (concatenation of 8 zero bytes, m and salt)   Let h’=H(M’) of size hLen   If h=h’ accept signature  3.2 Discrete logarithm-based signatures  3.2.1 Possible discrete logarithm groups  3.2.1.1 Finite fields  Historically, the first groups considered for discrete logarithm based encryption and signature where  the multiplication groups of integers modulo a prime p, GF(p).  Other finite fields, in particular GF(2m), were also considered. However, the fields GF(2m) have recently  been shown to be insecure for cryptographic purposes.  In addition to GF(p), other fields GF(pk) for intermediate values of p and k could be considered.  However, these are not standardized and rarely used in applications.  As a consequence, in this document, prime fields GF(p) are considered as potential candidates for  discrete logarithm based signatures.  For these fields, the key sizes should be chosen with the same rules as for RSA,  namely:  • For short-term security, corresponding to the 100-bit security level, the prime p should  have at least 2048 bits.  • For longer-term security, corresponding to the 128-bit security level, the prime p should  have at least 3072 bits.  • The 256-bit security level required to protect against quantum computers cannot be  achieved with discrete logarithms, due to the quantum polynomial time discrete  logarithm algorithm of Shor.  NOTE: Whenever possible, elliptic curve discrete logarithm signatures should preferred to finite field  discrete logarithm signatures.  3.2.1.2 Elliptic curves over finite fields  Another possibility is to use the group of points of an elliptic curve defined over a finite field. Here,  only fields of the form GF(p) or GF(2m) are considered. The main advantage of elliptic curves is that  they permit to choose much smaller key sizes, which very positively impacts their performance.  For elliptic curves, the general rules for key sizes are :  • For short-term security, corresponding to the 100-bit security level, the number of points  on the curve should have at least 200 bits.  • For longer-term security, corresponding to the 128-bit security level, the number of points  on the curve should have at least 256 bits.  • The 256-bit security level required to protect against quantum computers cannot be  achieved with discrete logarithms, even on elliptic curves, due to the quantum polynomial  time discrete logarithm algorithm of Shor.

Since  it’s possible to choose groups that are either written multiplicatively (finite fields) or additively (elliptic  curves), the equations would, in theory, have to be written twice. For compactness, since elliptic  curves are the preferred choice, only the additive description is given.  Global Parameters:  Description of the group, order q and generator G. (By construction qG=0)  Hash function H, with consistent security level.  Key pairs:  Secret key integer d in [1;q-1]. Public Key Q=dG.  3.2.2.1 DSA style  The ECDSA signature on a string M works as follows:  1. Select a random integer k in [1; q-1]  2. Compute (x1, y1)=kG, lift x1 to its smallest positive representative integer.  3. Compute r=x1 mod q, if r=0 restart  4. Compute k-1 mod q  5. Let e=H(M), where e is an integer obtained by converting the bitstring H(M)  6. Let s= k-1(e+dr) mod q, if s=0 restart  7. Output the signature (r,s)  The verification of a ECDSA signature works as follows given M, r and s as input:  1. Check that both r and s are in [1; q-1]  2. Let e=H(M)  3. Let w=s-1 mod q  4. Compute u1=ew mod q and u2=rw mod q  5. Let X=u1 G+u2 Q  6. If X=0, reject signature, otherwise write X=(x1,y1)  7. Compute x1 mod q, accept signature if r= x1 mod q, reject otherwise  For plain DSA, the adaptation to additive notation is done in the straightforward way. There is an  additional difference, instead of letting x1 denote the point abscissa, it represents the group element  itself as an integer.  There are variations of ECDSA with similar properties, such as EC-GDSA, EC-KCDSA, …  NOTE: There exists an attack by Vaudenay against DSA signature that derives from the fact that  collisions on H(M) mod q are enough to forge signatures and are much easier to produce if the  adversary has full control of the parameter generation process. This attack can be mitigated by a  careful validation of the public parameters.  3.2.2.2 Schnorr style  The Schnorr signature on a string M works as follows:  1. Select a random integer k in [1; q]  2. Let R=kG  3. Let e=H(M || R), where M||R indicates that a string representing the point R is appended in  a non-ambiguous representation to the message M.  4. Let s= k+de mod q, if s=0 restart  5. Output the signature (R, s)  Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers  Inventory of activities  Version 1.0, December 2014  Page  22  The verification of a Schnorr signature works as follows given M, R and s as input:  1. Check that R is a point on the curve  2. Let e=H(M || R)  3. If R+eQ=sG accept signature else reject  Thanks to the inclusion of the point R into the hash function computation, Schnorr signatures are more  robust and easier to prove than their DSA counterparts. In particular, they are not vulnerable to  Vaudenay’s attack.  Wherever possible, Schnorr signatures should be preferred to DSA signatures.  4 Generating keys and parameters  4.1 RSA  RSA key pair is constructed by first selecting a public exponent e larger than 216, odd and preferably  prime. Then, two large primes p and q, such that p-1 and q-1 are coprime to e, are selected. The  product N=pq is then computed. Moreover, for tightness of the full domain hash, it is recommended  that e<N1/4.  Typically, one chooses e=65537.  NOTE: For signature schemes, the restriction e>216 is not essential. However, since the same key  generators are used both for encryption and signature scheme, it is preferable to keep this restriction  here.  Recommended method for generating the primes p and q:   Call the randomness generator to produce a seed S of length at least equal to the desired  security level in bits.   Let counter=0 be a fixed length counter (4 bytes are enough)   Let n be the desired bit size of N (for simplicity assume that n is even)   Repeat:  o p0=G(counter||S) where G is a variable output function on n/2 bits  o If p0 < 2(n-1)/2, increment counter and loop  o p=Nextprime(p0)  o If p>2n/2, increment counter and loop  o If e divides (p-1), increment counter and loop [if e is not a prime, replace this test by  gcd(e,p-1) different from 1]   Increment counter   Repeat:  o q0=G(counter||S)  o If q0 < 2(n-1)/2, increment counter and loop  o q=Nextprime(q0)  o If q>2n/2, increment counter and loop  o If e divides (q-1), increment counter and loop [if e is not a prime, replace this test by  gcd(e,q-1) different from 1]   Let N=pq and d = e-1 mod (p-1)(q-1)  The goal of tying the generation of p and q together (from a single seed S) is to prevent factoring  attacks on keys that share a common factor.  Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers  Inventory of activities  Version 1.0, December 2014  Page  23  4.2 Elliptic Curves  For elliptic curve based signatures, the choice of an elliptic curve is usually a system wide parameter.  As a consequence, to avoid any suspicion that the curve has been chosen in a adversarial manner by  the managing authority, it is important to give the elliptic curve together with a certificate that allow  users to replicate the parameter generation.  For using elliptic curve over prime fields GF(p), suggested parameter generation algorithm is  presented for this case.  Recommended method for generating GF(p) and elliptic curve E:   Input : seed S of length at least equal to the desired security level in bits.   Let counter=0 be a fixed length counter (4 bytes are enough)   Let n be the desired bit size of p   Repeat:  o p0=G(counter||S) where G is a variable output function on n bits  o If p0 < 2(n-1), increment counter and loop  o p=Nextprime(p0)  o If p>2n, increment counter and loop   Increment counter   Repeat:  o a=G(counter||S) mod p, increment counter, b= G(counter||S) mod p  o Count the number of points q on the elliptic curve y^2=x^3+a x+b (mod p)  o Test whether q is prime, if not increment counter and loop   Increment counter   Repeat:  o x0=G(counter||S) mod p  o if x0^3+a x0+b is a square mod p, let y0 be the square root in the interval [1,(p-1)/2]   Output: S (to permit verification), p, q and the basepoint (x0,y0)  NOTE: This generation method protects against selecting weak curves from a very small subset of all  elliptic curves. It does not protect against an adversarial parameter generation authority that knows  an attack that works against a small but not negligible fraction of curves. For example, if the authority  knows how to attack 1 curve in 109, it chooses many values of S until such a curve is obtained.  To protect against this, it is possible to determine the seed S in a way that cannot be manipulated by  a single dishonest authority. For example, shared generation of S between several authorities can be  used. Alternatively, one may announced in advance the process that will be followed to generate S  and make sure that process is auditable and hard to tamper with. Typically, taking the hash of all stock  values in some fixed market and format at a future date is a possible (but cumbersome) option.

This Regulation strengthens the provisions  for interoperability and mutual recognition of electronic identification schemes across borders,  enhances current rules for electronic signatures and provides a legal framework for other types of  trust services (electronic seals, electronic delivery services, electronic documents, time stamping  services and web site authentication).  At the same time, in the field of promoting a Single Market for cybersecurity products, the cyber  security strategy underlines the importance of CSCG and ENISA, by stating: “the Commission will  support the development of security standards”; “Such work should build on the on-going  standardisation work of the European Standardisation Organisations (CEN, CENELEC and ETSI), of the  Cybersecurity Coordination Group (CSCG) as well as on the expertise of ENISA, the Commission and  other relevant players”.  This paper explains why standards are important for cyber security, specifically in the area of  electronic identification and trust services providers. A number of challenges associated with the  definition and deployment of standards in the area of cyber security are discussed. This is followed by  a brief overview of several key EU initiatives in this area.  The paper also discusses concrete standardisation activities associated with electronic IDs and trust  service providers, providing an overview of standards developed under the mandate m460 from the  European Commission and others, related to eIDAS Regulation. It concludes with a proposal of a  standard on cryptographic suites for electronic signatures and infrastructures, put forward by ENISA  and related to the ETSI TS 119 312.  1 https://www.eid-stork.eu/  https://www.eid-stork.eu/  Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers  Inventory of activities  Version 1.0, December 2014  Page  iv  Table of Contents  Executive summary iii  1 Introduction 1  2 Importance of standards in information security 2  3 Standardisation challenges in Cyber Security 3  3.1 Organisational challenges 3  3.2 Areas of standardisation 3  3.3 Lack of agility 3  3.4 Competing sets of standards 4  3.5 Economic considerations 4  3.6 Lack of awareness 4  4 Cyber security strategy of the European Union 5  5 Cyber Security Coordination Group 7  6 Strategy towards standardisation options 8  7 Standardisation activities in the area of Electronic Signatures and Trust Service  Providers 9  8 Proposal for replacement of ETSI TS 119 312 13  Annex 1 – Proposal for replacement of ETSI TS 119 312 15  Annex 2 – References 24  Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers  Inventory of activities  Version 1.0, December 2014  Page  1  1 Introduction  In the Cyber Security Strategy of the EU 2 , the European Union reaffirms the importance of all  stakeholders in the current Internet governance model and supports the multi-stakeholder  governance approach. Indeed, the multi-stakeholder approach is fundamental to the development of  successful standards, particularly in the area of cyber security where public sector requirements are  implemented to a large extent by private sector service providers.  In the field of promoting a Single Market for cybersecurity products, the cyber security strategy  underlines the importance of the Cybersescurity Coordination Group3 and ENISA. It states, among  others, that: “the Commission will support the development of security standards”; “Such work should  build on the on-going standardisation work of the European Standardisation Organisations (CEN,  CENELEC and ETSI), of the Cybersecurity Coordination Group (CSCG) as well as on the expertise of  ENISA, the Commission and other relevant players”.  A number of EU governments are now promoting the broader adoption and use of standards. A good  example is a standardisation policy for software interoperability, data and document formats in  government IT specifications, published by the UK government.4 Standards also play an important role  in the EU’s Digital Agenda. Quoting the then European Commission’s Vice President Neelie Kroes, they  “create competition, lead to innovation, and save money”.  Within the private sector, industrial interest in standardisation activities in the area of NIS tends to be  driven by areas of work that are in line with the core interests of product developers or service  providers. Aligning public sector goals with standardisation priorities of the private sector remains  challenging.  Where information security is concerned, there is clearly room for improvement in identifying and  responding to evolving risks and technology developments. In particular, the time lag between the  appearance of a new technology or technically driven business model and the availability of applicable  standards is still too long.  2 http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667  3 http://www.cencenelec.eu/standards/Sectors/DefenceSecurityPrivacy/Security/Pages/Cybersecurity.aspx  4 Like https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-principles  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667 http://www.cencenelec.eu/standards/Sectors/DefenceSecurityPrivacy/Security/Pages/Cybersecurity.aspx https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-principles  Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers  Inventory of activities  Version 1.0, December 2014  Page  2  2 Importance of standards in information security  There are many reasons why standards have an important role to play in improving approaches to  information security that involve different geographical regions or different communities. Some of the  more important reasons include:  • Improving efficiency and effectiveness of key processes.  • Facilitating systems integration and interoperability  • Enabling different products or methods to be compared in a meaningful manner.  • Providing a means for users to assess new products or services.  • Structuring the approach to deploying new technologies or business models.  • Simplification of complex environments.  • Promoting economic growth.  Standardising processes and procedures is an essential part of achieving successful cooperation in a  cross-border or cross-community multi-vendor environment. Without such standardisation,  communication is likely to be inefficient and could result in a process that is ineffective. An illustrative  example is provided by the way in which different countries would react to a significant cyber incident.  Here, in line with the principle of subsidiarity and the need to preserve sovereign state control,  decision making is made in a distributed environment and the processes that support this process  must be optimal. Standardised operating procedures could help ensure that various countries can  interact with each other according to one set of predefined and agreed procedures.  Similarly, specifications such as ISO 27001  encourage the adoption of a standard organization  structure, which makes it easier for customers to understand how processes work and also reduces  the costs of auditing and due diligence. This is largely due to the fact that these organisational  standards provide a blue-print for setting up a management system for security, but also for a blue- print for auditing and checking compliance of an organisation to security best practices.  Standards play a key role in ensuring that security products can be put together into systems capable  of detecting and responding to real events. In particular, standard interfaces and protocols make  systems integration much simpler and allow products to interoperate in heterogeneous  environments. Standardisation of testing methods also makes it possible to compare security products  in a meaningful manner (‘benchmarking’) and provide a means for the end user to assess new products  or services. The level of compatibility of cryptographic modules with the FIPS 140-2 standard  (which  is used to accredit such products) for instance is used to assess the ability of such products to meet  certain security requirements.  By structuring the approach to deploying new technologies or business models, standards help to  reduce the complexity of the business environments that deploy them, which in turn makes it easier  to secure the resulting environment. Although there is also an argument against standardisation in  this respect, notably that any vulnerabilites associated with such systems will also be ‘standardised’,  making it possible to conduct attacks against large numbers of systems in a short timescale. The usual  way of dealing with this however is not to avoid standardisation but to ensure that the defences used  to protect information systems are not critically dependent on a single system or type of system – this  is the principle of defence in depth.  Last but not least, the use of standards encourages information exchange among developers and it is  likely to result in greater competition among product developers.  All these factors have a great impact on the overall preparedness of the governments to the cyber  threat. Standardised technologies and approaches enhance harmonisation among cooperating  countries, ensure a larger pool of experts available and higher level of knowledge of systems deployed.  Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers  Inventory of activities  Version 1.0, December 2014  Page  3  3 Standardisation challenges in Cyber Security  Despite the fact that an appropriate use of standards is clearly beneficial to achieving a strong  approach to security in a cross-border environment, there are also many challenges to achieving this  in practice.  3.1 Organisational challenges  Over the last ten years a plethora of SDOs (Standard Development Organisations) have been created.  In many occasions these organisations have been initiated by industry (e.g. Oasis, W3C, Open Data  Center, IETF, Adobe, ITIL and many others) to a certain extent as a reaction of the industry to the large  investment in terms of time and people required by ‘traditional’ SDOs (such as ETSI, CEN-CENELEC,  ISO, ITU) and partially the result of convergence where standardisation fora that traditionally focused  on a specific sector (e.g. IEEE) found applicability in many different business sectors. The number of  SDOs and the number of published standards has increased, which can be a source of confusion to  end users.  3.2 Areas of standardisation  Industrial interest in standardisation activities in the area of NIS tends to be driven by areas of work  that lay in line with the core interests of service providers (for example authentication, billing, etc.).  Although an increased general interest in the area of privacy is observed, specific interest of industry  is expected to become lower since privacy enhancing technologies are perceived as being in conflict  with commercial expectations.  At the time of writing, there is no single, continuous “line of standards” related to cyber security, but  rather a number of discrete areas which are the subject of standardisation:  • Technical standards  • Metrics (related mostly to business continuity)  • Definitions  • Organisational aspects  Some areas could be potentially considered as over-standardised. There are several standards on  information security governance and risk management.  In some areas standards are lacking, for example there are relatively few standards that deal with  compliance to privacy and data protection legislation. Similarly, there are not many standards covering  service levels, or more broadly, service agreements and service contracts, terms of use and conditions,  et cetera. A quick look across the different offerings of cloud providers will show that every provider  has a different lengthy legal text describing the terms of use and exceptions to obligations.  3.3 Lack of agility  Designing and agreeing standards is a lengthy process, measured in years. The IT landscape on the  other hand evolves rapidly and, in order to remain useful, standards need to evolve at a comparable  pace. Failure to do so will result in standards that are either obsolete or only partially applicable to  real life environments.  One solution to this issue could be sought in the direction of using ‘good practices’ as precursors for  standards. Good practicesare generally subjected to change control procedures that are much less  stringent than those applied to candidate standards and could therefore be developed to maturity  more quickly. Good practices that are sufficiently mature could then be used as a basis for a  corresponding standard.  Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers  Inventory of activities  Version 1.0, December 2014  Page  4  With regard to standards, a ‘fast track’ mechanism could be developed and agreed among interested  parties, to be able to publish non-controversial standards in a quicker manner.  3.4 Competing sets of standards  In some areas of information security there are several different groups of standards that are defined.  To some extent, these standards are competing with each other for adoption and it is often difficult  for the end user to judge which standards are the best choice for their particular requirements.  Occasionally, it is necessary to mix and match standards from different families in order to achieve the  goal. When implementing Public key Infrastructure (PKI) for instance, it is not unusual to see  organisations adopt such a combination of standards (for example X.509 (ITU) for the certificate  format, PKIX (IETF) standards for core PKI and PKCS (RSA) standards for interfacing to secure devices).  3.5 Economic considerations  Although some providers see their use of recognised standards as a unique selling point, there are  also many cases of vendors who have a dominant position, who insist on their own proprietary  standards and fail to constructively support and implement standards for their products. For instance,  the fact that every mobile phone vendor uses different charger plugs is annoying for consumers, and  it is wasteful in terms of resources. In order to resolve this situation, the EU followed up an industry  initiative  to adopt a single standard universal mobile phone charger plug.  Companies with a dominant position have few incentives to adopt interoperable standards, because  it would only reinforce the position of competitors. For a dominant vendor there are advantages to  using proprietary standards, because they lock-in the customer. Lock-in means that:  • The customer cannot buy or integrate with compatible products from competitors, which  generates more revenue for the provider.  • It is hard for customers to switch to another supplier, because they cannot easily move  their data and processes to a competitor.  3.6 Lack of awareness  Despite the clear disadvantages associated with the use of proprietary standards, there are still many  examples of cases where customers (especially in this context we consider as ‘customers’ national  authorities, governmental organisations, etc.) fail to demand open standards. This may well be due to  a lack of awareness of the existence of such standards.

This strategy provides a harmonised framework for the evolution of three different aspects of  cyber security, which until recently had been evolving independently. In so doing, the Commission  recognised and responded to the need to bring different communities together to improve the  approach to cyber security across the EU and laid the foundations for a more coordinated approach.  The Cyber Security Strategy of the EU also includes a proposal for a Directive on Network and  Information Security (NIS) requiring the Member States (MS) to have minimum NIS capabilities in  place, to cooperate and exchange information within a dedicated network and requiring the private  sector to adopt NIS enhancing actions.  • The EU reaffirms the importance of commercial and non-governmental entities, involved  in the day-to-day management of Internet standards  • A prime focus should be to create incentives to carry out appropriate risk management  and adopt security standards and solutions, as well as possibly establish voluntary EU- wide certification schemes building on existing schemes in the EU and internationally  • the Commission will support the development of security standards and assist with EU- wide voluntary certification schemes in the area of cloud computing  Under strategic objective 4, the Commission asks ENISA to ‘develop, in cooperation with relevant  national competent authorities, relevant stakeholders, International and European standardisation  bodies and the European Commission Joint Research Centre, technical guidelines and  recommendations for the adoption of NIS standards and good practices in the public and private  sectors.’  This is a timely recommendation as the new ENISA mandate gives the Agency a more proactive role in  this area. The task assigned to ENISA by the new ENISA regulation in this area is to ‘support research  and development and standardisation, by facilitating the establishment and take up of European and  international standards for risk management and for the security of electronic products, networks and  services’.  There are also recommendations for public and private stakeholders. In particular ‘The Commission  invites public and private stakeholders to:  • Stimulate the development and adoption of industry-led security standards, technical  norms and security-by-design and privacy-by-design principles by ICT product  manufacturers and service providers, including cloud providers; new generations of  software and hardware should be equipped with stronger, embedded and user-friendly  security features.  • Develop industry-led standards for companies' performance on cybersecurity and improve  the information available to the public by developing security labels or kite marks helping  the consumer navigate the market.  • An important part of the cyber security strategy is the proposal for a Network and  Information Security (NIS) Directive. This Directive asks the Member States to support  standardisation in the area of NIS:  • Given the global nature of NIS problems, there is a need for closer international  cooperation to improve security standards and information exchange, and promote a  common global approach to NIS issues.  5 http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667  Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers  Inventory of activities  Version 1.0, December 2014  Page  6  • Standardisation of security requirements is a market-driven process. To ensure a  convergent application of security standards, Member States should encourage  compliance or conformity with specified standards to ensure a high level of security at  Union level. To this end, it might be necessary to draft harmonised standards.  Article 16 on standardisation states the following:  • …..Member States shall encourage the use of standards and/or specifications to networks  and information security.  • The Commission shall draw up, by means of implementing acts a list of the standards  referred to in paragraph 1. The list shall be published in the Official Journal of the European  Union  Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers  Inventory of activities  Version 1.0, December 2014  Page  7  5 Cyber Security Coordination Group  In 2011, following a request of the Commission, the Standards Development Organizations (SDOs)  CEN, CENELEC and ETSI have created the CEN‐CENELEC‐ETSI ‘Cyber Security Coordination Group’  (CSCG) for strategic advice in the field of IT security, Network and Information Security and cyber  security. The main objectives of the CSCG are to  • Establish a European standardisation roadmap in the above mentioned areas  • Act as the main contact point for all questions by EU institutions related to standardisation  issues  • Define and propose to the Commission a cooperation strategy between the EU and the  US for the establishment of a framework, relating to standardisation of cyber security.  The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) has participated and  contributed to the activities of the CSCG since its launch. A first white paper was addressed by the  members of CSCG to the Commission with strategic advice on the priorities for R&D of EU funded  research in the area and how to optimise EU research with mandates for cyber security  standardisation.  Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers  Inventory of activities  Version 1.0, December 2014  Page  8  6 Strategy towards standardisation options  One of the issues that the European Union needs to address is the strategy towards standardisation  in the area of ICT. The current approach is not consistent and lacks a unified vision. In this light the EC  has taken an initiative in 2011 in order to promote a coordinated approach at EU level. For this purpose  the Commission (DG CONNECT) supported also by ENISA has identified possible alternatives and  options briefly summarized below.6 High level strategic options for recommendations on security  standards could be:  1. General recommendations  They can only be applied to specific cases, otherwise they are not considered by any communities, no  more than very generic recommendations on security in general.  2. Recommendations targeting organizations (such as ISO 27000 for the management of  information security or ISO 31000 for risk assessment within organizations)  Very costly and possibly limiting innovations. This option has a lot of potential if implemented in a  correct (and acceptable by industry) way. A European framework for standards would be ‘nice to have’  on one hand, but on the other would be very costly, would require a lot of resources (in terms of  research and following-up related activities). However, the adoption of standards could be enforced  by the European legislation and national competent authorities (for example requiring defined  standards to be applied in order to get authorization to perform certain activities, like provision of ICT  services).  3. Specific recommendations for products / services with dedicated standards (similar to  Common Criteria)  Complicated approach presenting (among others) a problem in the definition of specific products or  services. In the world where most ICT services are converging, identifying a ‘class’ of products is a  challenge.  4. Recommendations on functions / products / services using a mash-up approach  Such a “mash-up\" approach could be an ad hoc solution, where functions, products, services would  need to be selected following an appropriate process  At the EU level it is important to take advantage of Framework Programs of EU funded R&D (FP7) by  funding flagship project/initiatives with clear standardization objectives. The additional benefit of this  approach is that by definition these research projects have strong industrial participation that could  be also ‘channeled’ towards strategic standardization initiatives. For example in the area of Attribute  Based Credentials (ABC) the Commission is funding an interesting Integrated Project that makes use  of IPRs of US based companies (mainly MS and Intel). Even in such (difficult) cases all efforts should  be made for strategic contributions at ETSI.  6 Strategic options for recommendations on the introduction of security standards, draft, European Commission,  December 2011  Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers  Inventory of activities  Version 1.0, December 2014  Page  9  7 Standardisation activities in the area of Electronic Signatures and Trust  Service Providers  In order to create a rationalised framework of the existing European eSignature standardisation  deliverables, supporting also the realisation of the items of the Action Plan related to eSignature and  future adoption of the Regulation on eIDs and TSPs (now known under number 910/2014), the  Commission issued standardisation mandate (m460) to CEN and ETSI in 2010. In July 2012 these two  standardisation bodies  jointly published the \"Rationalised Framework for electronic signature\"7.  The tables below constitute an inventory of standardisation activities in the areas covered by the  adopted eIDAS Regulation. Most of these standards are in a phase of development or update, their  publication is expected between 2015 and 2016.

The goal of this standard is to provide guidance on  which algorithms and key sizes should be used for the creation of electronic signatures. It has been  the subject of modifications and updates during the years. The current ETSI document in some places  shows a lack of adaptation to the current developments.  In 2013 ENISA has published a report “Algorithms, Key Sizes and Parameters”8 (“ENISA document”) in  which sufficient cryptographic solutions to use at the moment of publication are discussed. This  document can be related to the ETSI TS 119 312. In order to support the standardisation in the field  of electronic identification and trust service providers, having regard to the developed capabilities of  ENISA, the Agency has commented on the TS 119 312 in 2014 and hereby proposes a new, unified  version of the possible standard (in Annex 1). The rationale for changes and for the new version is as  explained below.   The document provides now three lists:  o Algorithms and key sizes to be used for the creation of electronic signatures  o Algorithms and key sizes still in use, but to be phased out  o Algorithms and key sizes not to be used anymore   A new SHA-3 standard 9  was added to the document, addressing also the French 10  and  German11 agencies recommendations   Security requirements at the 128-bit level has been homogenized, following, in particular, the  recommendations of the ENISA document. One typical consequence is the removal for the  white list of the hash functions on 224 bits.   Extendable hash functions, which are included in the SHA-3 standard, were added. Such  functions deserve consideration because they simplify the description of padding schemes  such as the full-domain-hash and PSS. Indeed, these schemes require such functions and  before their inclusion in the SHA-3 standard, therefore it was necessary to explain how they  can be derived from ordinary hash functions.   Section on RSA has been modified in order to remove some technical inconsistencies, to take  into account the shared prime factors attacks. A proposal has been made that the public  exponent should be prime, which has no effect on the most common choice e=65537.   It was proposed to remove DSA from the standard due to the absence of a security proof  and  also to the attack of Vaudenay from PKC 200312. This is in line with the ENISA document, which  recommends to prefer Schnorr algorithm to DSA. Instead, EC-Schnorr was added.  8 Reference XXX  9 Draft FIPS Publication 202 (2014).

A paper of Sutherland13 was considered,  which improves the construction of CM-curves.   Description and presentation of the numerous EC-DSA variants was simplified.   PCKS#1 v 1.5 was removed from the document, in line with the ENISA document.   Introduction of the full domain hash padding was added to the document.14   In the proposal of the new document, the use of Nextprime in parameter generation was  added. For efficiency reasons, Nextprime is usually based on pseudo-primality tests.15  13  Andrew V. Sutherland, Computing Hilbert class polynomials with the Chinese remainder theorem.

Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers  Inventory of activities  Version 1.0, December 2014  Page  15  Annex 1 – Proposal for replacement of ETSI TS 119 312  1 Expected security level  As generally recommended by the academic cryptography, the minimum security level for medium or  long-term security corresponds to 128-bit symmetric keys. With this key size, exhaustive search  remains out of range for at least 50 years, even assuming that Moore’s law continues during the full  50 years period with a doubling of computing power for unit cost every year.  In addition, cryptographic schemes offering some formal security argument should be preferred to  schemes whose security is only based on the fact that they have not yet been attacked.  However, this disregards the possibility of quantum computers becoming available during this  timeframe. To account for this possibility, the recommended key size is 256 bits.  For shorter-term security, a 100-bit key is sufficient. Thus, it might be considered for short-term  interoperability purposes.  NOTE 1: This security level is required to resist adversaries. To protect against bad random events that  may occur naturally but cannot be manipulated by an adversary, requirements are less drastic.  Typically, for aircrafts, it is often required that the probability of a catastrophic event should remain  below 10-9 per hour. As a consequence, after taking into account the long time period and the large  number of users, a probability threshold of 2-80 per individual event is sufficient for the purpose of the  document.  2 Hash Functions  Hash functions are keyless cryptographic primitives that need to satisfy several security properties. In  particular, they should resist pre-image and collision attacks. Collision resistance is the strongest of  the two requirements and, due to a generic birthday paradox attack, it requires the output of the  function to be at least twice as big as the desired security level. For 128-bit security, the minimal  output size is 256 bits.  In addition, the recommended hash functions are well known and have shown resistance against the  best cryptanalytic effort of the academic cryptographic community.  The following table includes three lists of hash functions. The first list contains recommended  algorithm. The second list contains algorithms that might be usable in specific applications. These  algorithms are not recommended either because of their output size or because preferable  alternatives are recommended. The third list is a blacklist of algorithms that should no longer be used.  This list is not exhaustive; it only mentions frequently encountered hash functions, which are not  considered secure with current standards.

The recommended algorithms SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512 and SHA-512/256 are part of this family.  SHA-256 can be used for messages with length up to 264-1 bits.  SHA-384, SHA-512 and SHA-512/256 apply to messages with length up to 2128-1 bits.  The output size of the message digest, i.e. of the hash function output, is 256 bits for SHA-256 and  SHA-512/256, 384 bits for SHA-384 and 512 bits for SHA-512.  All these algorithms shall be implemented as defined in FIPS Publication 180-4.  NOTE 1: Whenever possible, SHA-512/256 should be preferred to SHA-256, due to its larger inner state  and its apparently higher security margins.  NOTE 2: FIPS Publication 180-4 also specifies SHA-1, SHA-224 and SHA-512/224, which are not part of  the recommended list of hash functions.  2.1.2 SHA-3 family  The SHA-3 family of algorithms is described in DRAFT FIPS Publication 202.  The recommended algorithms SHA3-256, SHA3-384 and SHA3-512 are part of this family.  SHA-3 algorithms do not have a limit on the length of input messages.  The output size of the message digest is 256 bits for SHA3-256, 384 bits for SHA3-384 and 512 bits for  SHA3-512.  All these algorithms shall be implemented as defined in DRAFT FIPS Publication 202.  NOTE: DRAFT FIPS Publication 202 also specify SHA3-224, which is not part of the recommended list  of hash functions.  2.1.3 SHA-3 extendable output functions  In addition to the SHA-3 algorithms, DRAFT FIPS Publication 202 also specifies two extendable hash  functions SHAKE-128 and SHAKE-256.  These algorithms can be used whenever longer message digest are requested. In particular, they are  well suited for use with the Full-Domain Hash signature padding.  SHAKE-128 and SHAKE-256 shall be implemented as defined in DRAFT FIPS Publication 202.  Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers  Inventory of activities  Version 1.0, December 2014  Page  17  NOTE 1: Using SHAKE-128 for output length up to 256 bits is not recommended. Using SHAKE-256 for  output length up to 512 bits is not recommened.  NOTE 2: Using SHAKE on the same message to produce two digests of different sizes must be avoided  at all costs. Indeed, in this case, the shorter digest is a truncation of the longest one. This can lead to  various attacks against cryptographic protocols.  As explained in Appendix A of DRAFT FIPS Publication 202, to avoid this problem, tags can be added  into the input message to indicate the use and length of the output (in order to provide a form of  domain separation).  3 Signature Suites  A signature suite is a public key cryptosystem that can be used to sign or verify arbitrary messages,  possibly with a length limit. For efficiency, it combines a hash function that is used to represent the  given message by a much shorter digest and a public key algorithm for signing and verifying. This  document includes two large families of signature suites, one based on RSA and the hardness of  factoring and the other based on the discrete logarithm problem.  Every signature scheme consists of three algorithms, one for generating public/private key-pairs, one  for signing an element of the message set and one for verifying the signature of such an element.  These algorithms include calls to hash functions and the security and validity of signatures are deeply  linked to the hash function that is used. Implementers should ensure that attackers cannot manipulate  the users into using weak hash functions when signing messages.  The signature algorithm of a given suite takes as input a private key and a message, it outputs a  signature; the verification algorithm takes as input the corresponding public key, the message and  signature to verify, it outputs Valid or Invalid.  NOTE: There also exists a different flavor of signature schemes, signature with message recovery,  which are not considered in this document.  3.1 RSA Signatures  RSA signature suites include two main components: a basic signature scheme and a padding method.  The basic signature scheme is a public key cryptosystem that can be used to sign or verify special  messages that follow a uniform probability distribution in the set of integers modulo the RSA modulus.  This scheme cannot be directly used to sign arbitrary messages. For this purpose, it needs to be  integrated into a signature suite by adding a padding method.  3.1.1 Basic signature scheme  The RSA algorithm is a trapdoor one-way function whose security requires large and hard-to-factor  numbers. An RSA key pair is constructed by first selecting a public exponent e larger than 216, odd and  preferably prime. Then, two large primes p and q, such that p-1 and q-1 are coprime to e, are selected.  The product N=pq is then computed.  The public key of the algorithm is the pair (N,e).  The private key of the algorithm is the pair (N,d) where d is the smallest representative of the inverse  of e modulo (p-1)(q-1).  Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers  Inventory of activities  Version 1.0, December 2014  Page  18  The signature algorithm takes a uniformly selected random element m from the interval [1,N-1] and  outputs md modulo N.  The verification algorithm takes an element m and a signature s, it outputs Valid when m=se modulo  N and Invalid otherwise.  NOTE: The modulus N is said to be an n-bit number if and only if, 2n-1 ≤ N < 2n. To construct an n-bit  RSA key, each of the two primes p and q should be selected in the interval [2(n-1)/2;2n/2[. Ideally, one  should select p and q uniformly at random in the interval. However, since this distribution is not so  easy to sample efficiently, it is considered acceptable practice to select for each the first prime  following a randomly selected element of the interval, i.e., p=Nextprime(u) and q=Nextprime(v).  It is extremely important to start for two uncorrelated values u and v. Otherwise, the process is flawed  and N can often be factored.  TYPICAL ERROR: One typical mistake is to let p=Nextprime(u) and q=Nextprime(p+1), then N is trivially  factored. Similarly, if p and q are too close from each other factoring N is also easy. For this reason, it  is sometimes recommended to check that the distance between p and q is not too small. However,  the probability that this happens when the primes are correctly generated is well below the probability  of 2-80 that is accepted for non-adversarial errors. As a consequence, there is no need to implement  this test. Indeed, it only protects against one of the many implementation errors that are possible.  RSA key-size:  • For short-term security, corresponding to the 100-bit security level, the RSA key should  have at least 2048 bits.  • For longer-term security, corresponding to the 128-bit security level, the RSA key should  have at least 3072 bits.  • The 256-bit security level required to protect against quantum computers cannot be  achieved with RSA, due to the quantum polynomial time factoring algorithm of Shor.  3.1.2 Padding methods  As explained above, the basic RSA signature scheme cannot be used directly to sign arbitrary  messages. The main reason is that, due to the multiplicativity of RSA, it would not be secure. Indeed,  with the basic scheme, the signature of a product of two numbers is just the product of the two  signatures.  To avoid this attack, messages to be signed should first be transformed into numbers modulo N in a  way that prevents an attack for being able to efficiently construct multiplicative relations between  these numbers. This transformation is called a padding method.  3.1.2.1 Full domain hash  The simplest method to prepare a message M for RSA signature is simply to hash it, i.e. to compute  m=H(M) and then apply the basic RSA signature to m.  However, if H is a usual hash function with short output, this is not secure. For security, one needs to  use a hash function with a large output. This is the full domain hash.  In theoretical papers, one simply assumes that the hash function H outputs digests which are integers  in [1;N-1]. For practical purposes, three variations are possible:  • Choose H0 that outputs bitstrings of the length of N, and define  H(M)=H0(mincount||H0(M)), where mincount is the smallest possible counter value such  that H(M) belongs to [1;N-1]. This corresponds to the theoretical model but does not  permit constant time implementation.  Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers  Inventory of activities  Version 1.0, December 2014  Page  19  • Choose H that outputs bitstrings shorter than N by one bit. The distribution is no longer  uniform. The full domain hash is not proven in this case but no attack is known.  • Choose H0 that outputs bitstrings longer than N by a margin of the order of the security  level and let H(M)=H0(N||M) modulo N. The output of H becomes close to uniform. One  might also consider the simpler variation H(M)=H0(M) modulo N. However, potentially,  the reduction modulo N could cause collision search to become easier, even if it is unclear  how this would apply in the context of RSA. Adding N into the hash computation prevents  attacks based on Vaudenay’s DSA attack.  In the three variations, the hash function with a long output can be derived from an extendable hash  function, preferably using a message header to ensure domain separation.  NOTE: In order for the security proof of full domain hash RSA to be tight, one need to make sure than  the public RSA exponent e is smaller than N1/4.  3.1.2.2 PSS encoding  By contrast with the full domain hash method, this padding technique is probabilistic. As a  consequence, if the same message is signed twice, it will lead to different signatures. Depending on  the application, this can be either an advantage or a drawback.  In addition to the hash function H (with fixed size), PSS encoding also requires a mask generating  function G. Note that G is, in fact, a variable output length function adapted to N.  PSS encoding:   Input: message M, salt size sLen, desired output length nBits   Output: encoding to be signed by the basic RSA scheme   Let m=H(M) of size hLen   If nBits < hLen + sLen + 2 then Abort   Generate random string salt of size sLen   Let M’= 0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||m||salt (concatenation of 8 zero bytes, m and salt)   Let h=H(M’) of size hLen   Let DB = 0||…||0||1||salt, with the number of zeroes chosen to make the length of DB equal  to nLen-hLen-1, where nLen is nBits/8 rounded up.   Compute dbmask=G(h) with variable output size set to nBits-hLen-1   Let maskedDB= DB XOR dbmask and clear the 8nLen-nBits higher order bits of maskedDB.   Let encoding= maskedDB||h||0xbc  The signature itself is simply the encoding raised to the private exponent modulo N.  During verification, the signature is raised to the public exponent and the output is considered as an  encoding to be verified.  PSS encoding verification:   Input: message M, salt size sLen, desired output length nBits   Output: encoding to be verified   Let m=H(M) of size hLen   If nBits < hLen + sLen + 2 then Abort   Parse encoding into maskedDB || h || Oxbc. Abort if failure   Check that the 8nLen-nBits higher order bits of maskedDB are zeroes   Compute dbmask=G(h) with variable output size set to nBits-hLen-1  Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers  Inventory of activities  Version 1.0, December 2014  Page  20   Let DB= maskedDB XOR dbmask and clear the 8nLen-nBits higher order bits of DB.   Parse DB as 0||…||0||1||salt, abort if it fails.   Let M’= 0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||m||salt (concatenation of 8 zero bytes, m and salt)   Let h’=H(M’) of size hLen   If h=h’ accept signature  3.2 Discrete logarithm-based signatures  3.2.1 Possible discrete logarithm groups  3.2.1.1 Finite fields  Historically, the first groups considered for discrete logarithm based encryption and signature where  the multiplication groups of integers modulo a prime p, GF(p).  Other finite fields, in particular GF(2m), were also considered. However, the fields GF(2m) have recently  been shown to be insecure for cryptographic purposes.  In addition to GF(p), other fields GF(pk) for intermediate values of p and k could be considered.  However, these are not standardized and rarely used in applications.  As a consequence, in this document, prime fields GF(p) are considered as potential candidates for  discrete logarithm based signatures.  For these fields, the key sizes should be chosen with the same rules as for RSA,  namely:  • For short-term security, corresponding to the 100-bit security level, the prime p should  have at least 2048 bits.  • For longer-term security, corresponding to the 128-bit security level, the prime p should  have at least 3072 bits.  • The 256-bit security level required to protect against quantum computers cannot be  achieved with discrete logarithms, due to the quantum polynomial time discrete  logarithm algorithm of Shor.  NOTE: Whenever possible, elliptic curve discrete logarithm signatures should preferred to finite field  discrete logarithm signatures.  3.2.1.2 Elliptic curves over finite fields  Another possibility is to use the group of points of an elliptic curve defined over a finite field. Here,  only fields of the form GF(p) or GF(2m) are considered. The main advantage of elliptic curves is that  they permit to choose much smaller key sizes, which very positively impacts their performance.  For elliptic curves, the general rules for key sizes are :  • For short-term security, corresponding to the 100-bit security level, the number of points  on the curve should have at least 200 bits.  • For longer-term security, corresponding to the 128-bit security level, the number of points  on the curve should have at least 256 bits.  • The 256-bit security level required to protect against quantum computers cannot be  achieved with discrete logarithms, even on elliptic curves, due to the quantum polynomial  time discrete logarithm algorithm of Shor.  Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers  Inventory of activities  Version 1.0, December 2014  Page  21  3.2.2 Signing Equations  Once a group is chosen, the way signatures can be computed and verified needs to be described. Since  it’s possible to choose groups that are either written multiplicatively (finite fields) or additively (elliptic  curves), the equations would, in theory, have to be written twice. For compactness, since elliptic  curves are the preferred choice, only the additive description is given.  Global Parameters:  Description of the group, order q and generator G. (By construction qG=0)  Hash function H, with consistent security level.  Key pairs:  Secret key integer d in [1;q-1]. Public Key Q=dG.  3.2.2.1 DSA style  The ECDSA signature on a string M works as follows:  1. Select a random integer k in [1; q-1]  2. Compute (x1, y1)=kG, lift x1 to its smallest positive representative integer.  3. Compute r=x1 mod q, if r=0 restart  4. Compute k-1 mod q  5. Let e=H(M), where e is an integer obtained by converting the bitstring H(M)  6. Let s= k-1(e+dr) mod q, if s=0 restart  7. Output the signature (r,s)  The verification of a ECDSA signature works as follows given M, r and s as input:  1. Check that both r and s are in [1; q-1]  2. Let e=H(M)  3. Let w=s-1 mod q  4. Compute u1=ew mod q and u2=rw mod q  5. Let X=u1 G+u2 Q  6. If X=0, reject signature, otherwise write X=(x1,y1)  7. Compute x1 mod q, accept signature if r= x1 mod q, reject otherwise  For plain DSA, the adaptation to additive notation is done in the straightforward way. There is an  additional difference, instead of letting x1 denote the point abscissa, it represents the group element  itself as an integer.  There are variations of ECDSA with similar properties, such as EC-GDSA, EC-KCDSA, …  NOTE: There exists an attack by Vaudenay against DSA signature that derives from the fact that  collisions on H(M) mod q are enough to forge signatures and are much easier to produce if the  adversary has full control of the parameter generation process. This attack can be mitigated by a  careful validation of the public parameters.  3.2.2.2 Schnorr style  The Schnorr signature on a string M works as follows:  1. Select a random integer k in [1; q]  2. Let R=kG  3. Let e=H(M || R), where M||R indicates that a string representing the point R is appended in  a non-ambiguous representation to the message M.  4. Let s= k+de mod q, if s=0 restart  5. Output the signature (R, s)  Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers  Inventory of activities  Version 1.0, December 2014  Page  22  The verification of a Schnorr signature works as follows given M, R and s as input:  1. Check that R is a point on the curve  2. Let e=H(M || R)  3. If R+eQ=sG accept signature else reject  Thanks to the inclusion of the point R into the hash function computation, Schnorr signatures are more  robust and easier to prove than their DSA counterparts. In particular, they are not vulnerable to  Vaudenay’s attack.  Wherever possible, Schnorr signatures should be preferred to DSA signatures.  4 Generating keys and parameters  4.1 RSA  RSA key pair is constructed by first selecting a public exponent e larger than 216, odd and preferably  prime. Then, two large primes p and q, such that p-1 and q-1 are coprime to e, are selected. The  product N=pq is then computed. Moreover, for tightness of the full domain hash, it is recommended  that e<N1/4.  Typically, one chooses e=65537.  NOTE: For signature schemes, the restriction e>216 is not essential. However, since the same key  generators are used both for encryption and signature scheme, it is preferable to keep this restriction  here.  Recommended method for generating the primes p and q:   Call the randomness generator to produce a seed S of length at least equal to the desired  security level in bits.   Let counter=0 be a fixed length counter (4 bytes are enough)   Let n be the desired bit size of N (for simplicity assume that n is even)   Repeat:  o p0=G(counter||S) where G is a variable output function on n/2 bits  o If p0 < 2(n-1)/2, increment counter and loop  o p=Nextprime(p0)  o If p>2n/2, increment counter and loop  o If e divides (p-1), increment counter and loop [if e is not a prime, replace this test by  gcd(e,p-1) different from 1]   Increment counter   Repeat:  o q0=G(counter||S)  o If q0 < 2(n-1)/2, increment counter and loop  o q=Nextprime(q0)  o If q>2n/2, increment counter and loop  o If e divides (q-1), increment counter and loop [if e is not a prime, replace this test by  gcd(e,q-1) different from 1]   Let N=pq and d = e-1 mod (p-1)(q-1)  The goal of tying the generation of p and q together (from a single seed S) is to prevent factoring  attacks on keys that share a common factor.  Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers  Inventory of activities  Version 1.0, December 2014  Page  23  4.2 Elliptic Curves  For elliptic curve based signatures, the choice of an elliptic curve is usually a system wide parameter.  As a consequence, to avoid any suspicion that the curve has been chosen in a adversarial manner by  the managing authority, it is important to give the elliptic curve together with a certificate that allow  users to replicate the parameter generation.  For using elliptic curve over prime fields GF(p), suggested parameter generation algorithm is  presented for this case.  Recommended method for generating GF(p) and elliptic curve E:   Input : seed S of length at least equal to the desired security level in bits.   Let counter=0 be a fixed length counter (4 bytes are enough)   Let n be the desired bit size of p   Repeat:  o p0=G(counter||S) where G is a variable output function on n bits  o If p0 < 2(n-1), increment counter and loop  o p=Nextprime(p0)  o If p>2n, increment counter and loop   Increment counter   Repeat:  o a=G(counter||S) mod p, increment counter, b= G(counter||S) mod p  o Count the number of points q on the elliptic curve y^2=x^3+a x+b (mod p)  o Test whether q is prime, if not increment counter and loop   Increment counter   Repeat:  o x0=G(counter||S) mod p  o if x0^3+a x0+b is a square mod p, let y0 be the square root in the interval [1,(p-1)/2]   Output: S (to permit verification), p, q and the basepoint (x0,y0)  NOTE: This generation method protects against selecting weak curves from a very small subset of all  elliptic curves. It does not protect against an adversarial parameter generation authority that knows  an attack that works against a small but not negligible fraction of curves. For example, if the authority  knows how to attack 1 curve in 109, it chooses many values of S until such a curve is obtained.  To protect against this, it is possible to determine the seed S in a way that cannot be manipulated by  a single dishonest authority. For example, shared generation of S between several authorities can be  used. Alternatively, one may announced in advance the process that will be followed to generate S  and make sure that process is auditable and hard to tamper with. Typically, taking the hash of all stock  values in some fixed market and format at a future date is a possible (but cumbersome) option.

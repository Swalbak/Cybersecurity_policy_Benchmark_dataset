A cyber incident is an unwanted or unexpected  cyber security event, or a series of such events, that have a significant probability of compromising  business operations.1  Australian organisations are targeted by malicious cyber adversaries. The Australian Cyber Security  Centre’s (ACSC) assessment is malicious cyber activity against Australia’s national and economic  interests is increasing in frequency, scale, and sophistication. As adversaries become more adept,  the likelihood and severity of cyber attacks is also increasing due to the interconnectivity and  availability of information technology platforms, devices and systems exposed to the internet.  To illustrate the volume of cyber incidents occurring in Australia, the ACSC responded to over 1500 cyber  security incidents between 1 July 2020 and 30 June 2021.2 While many of the incidents reported to the  ACSC could have been avoided or mitigated by good cyber security practices, such as implementation  of ASD’s Essential Eight security controls, risks will still remain when organisations operate online.  Managing responses to cyber incidents is the responsibility of each affected organisation.  All organisations should have a cyber incident response plan to ensure an effective response and  prompt recovery in the event security controls don’t prevent an incident occurring. This plan should  be tested and regularly reviewed.  To be effective, a cyber incident response plan should align with the organisation’s incident,  emergency, crisis and business continuity arrangements, as well as jurisdictional and national cyber  and emergency arrangements. It should support personnel to fulfil their roles by outlining their  responsibilities and all legal and regulatory obligations.  While organisations are responsible for managing incidents affecting their business, Australia’s Cyber  Incident Management Arrangements (CIMA) outline the inter-jurisdictional coordination arrangements  and principles for Australian governments’ cooperation in response to national cyber incidents.3  Purpose The Cyber Incident Response Plan (CIRP) Template and the Cyber Incident Response Readiness  Checklist (Appendix B) are intended to be used as a starting point for organisations to develop their  own plan and readiness checklist.  Each organisation’s CIRP and checklist need to be tailored according to their unique operating  environment, priorities, resources and obligations.  In addition to a CIRP, organisations can develop more detailed, day-to-day procedures to supplement  the cyber incident response plan. This could include more detailed playbooks to aid the response to  common incident types, such as ransomware or data breaches, and standard operating procedures  (SOPs) to respond to incidents affecting specific assets.

Incidents could be detected in several ways, including, but not limited to:  •  Self-detected incidents (e.g. Intrusion Detection and Prevention systems)  •  Notifications received from service providers or vendors  •  Notifications received from trusted third parties such as the ACSC.  11.1. Incident Classification Include your organisation’s framework and decision making process for classifying a cyber incident.  This can assist with prioritising resources. Classification factors could include:  •  Effects of the incident (confidentiality, integrity and availability of information and systems)  •  Stakeholders affected (internal and external)  •  Incident type  •  Impact on the business and community.  For example:  Incident Classification Descriptions  Critical  • Over 80% of staff (or several critical staff/teams) unable to work  • Critical systems offline  • High risk to/definite breach of sensitive client or personal data  • Financial impact greater than $100,000  • Severe reputational damage – likely to impact business long term  High  • 50% of staff unable to work  • Non critical systems affected  • Risk of breach of personal or sensitive data  • Financial impact greater than $50,000  • Potential serious reputational damage  Cyber Incident Response Plan  |  Guidance 23  Cyber Incident Response Plan  11.  Detection,  Investigation, Analysis  and Activation  11.1. Incident Classification (cont…)  For information about the ACSC Incident Categorisation Matrix see Appendix K.  11.2. Cyber Incident Response Team (CIRT) Activation Include your organisation’s decision making framework for activating the CIRT.  (Note: Some smaller incidents may be manageable without activation of the CIRT).  This could align with the Incident Classification framework.  11.2.1 Logistics and Communications  Include core logistical and communications protocols, mechanisms to support incident response.  For example:  •  Operations Room/Security Operations Centre (SOC) location and setup  • Equipment required for offsite incident response  •  Communications technologies such as phone/teleconference/online dial-in details,  out-of-band communications (e.g. Slack or other similar applications).  Incident Classification Descriptions  Medium  • 20% of staff unable to work  • Small number of non-critical systems affected  • Possible breach of small amounts of non-sensitive data  • Financial impact greater than $25,000  • Low risk to reputation  Low  • <10% of non-critical staff affected temporarily (short term)  • Minimal, if any, impact  • One or two non-sensitive/non-critical machines affected  • No breach of data  • Negligible risk to reputation  Incident  Classification Action Triggers and/or thresholds for  escalation and de-escalation Minimum level  authority  Critical De-escalate to High  High  Escalate to Critical  De-escalate to Medium  Medium  Escalate to High  De-escalate to Low  Low Escalate to Medium SOC determines the incident  may impact BAU activity  SOC Team Lead  Cyber Incident Response Plan  |  Guidance24  Cyber Incident Response Plan  11.3. Investigation Questions To guide your incident response efforts and understanding of the scope and impact of the incident,  develop a list of investigation questions. Not all questions may be answerable with the data available  and questions may change as your investigation progresses.  Possible investigation questions include:  •  What was the initial intrusion vector?  •  What post-exploitation activity occurred? Have accounts been compromised? What level of privilege?  •  Does the actor have persistence on the network or device?  •  Is lateral movement suspected or known? Where has the actor laterally moved to and how?  •  How is the actor maintaining command and control?  •  Has data been accessed or exfiltrated and, if so, what kind of data?  11.4. Escalation and De-escalation Include the escalation and de-escalation triggers and/or thresholds, and decision making authorities.  You could include this in a table, for example:  Cyber Incident Response Plan  |  Guidance 25  Cyber Incident Response Plan  12.  Containment,  Evidence Collection  and Remediation  12.1. Containment Refer to your organisation’s separate detailed SOPs about containing the incident according  to the incident type.  Containment actions are implemented in order to minimise the damage, prevent the incident  from spreading or escalating, and prevent the attacker from destroying evidence of their attack.  When planning containment actions, consider:  •  Any additional impacts there could be to systems/services  •  Time and resources required to contain the incident  •  Effectiveness of the containment solution (e.g. partial vs full containment)  •  Duration that the solution will remain in place (e.g. temporary vs permanent solution).  12.2. Documentation Include your organisations process for documenting the incident, responsible personnel,  recipients and timeframes. Refer to Appendix D for a Situation Report template and Appendix E  for an Incident Log template.  Situation reports may contain the following information:  •  Incident date and time  •  Status of the incident  •  Incident type and classification  •  Scope and Impact  •  Severity  •  External assistance required  •  Actions taken to resolve the incident  •  Contact details for incident manager and key CIRT personnel  •  Date and time of the next update.  12.3. Evidence Collection and Preservation Include your organisation’s processes for collecting, preserving, handling and storing evidence,  responsible personnel, recipients and timeframes. As this can be complex you may need to seek advice  from digital forensic professionals, legal or law enforcement.  Cyber Incident Response Plan  |  Guidance26  Cyber Incident Response Plan  When gathering evidence, maintain a detailed log that clearly documents how all evidence has been  collected. This should include who collected or handled the evidence, the time and date (including  time zone) evidence was collected and handled, and the details of each item collected (including the  physical location, serial number, model number, hostname, media access control (MAC) address,  IP address and hash values). See Appendix F for a template.  Examples of commonly collected evidence include:  •  Disk/hard drive/host images  •  Network packet captures and flows  •  IP addresses  •  Log files  •  Network diagrams  • Configuration files  •  Databases  •  IR/investigation notes  •  Screenshots  •  Social media posts  •  CCTV, video and audio recordings  •  Documents detailing the monetary cost  of remediation or loss of business activity•  Memory/RAM images  12.4. Remediation Action Plan Include your organisation’s process for developing and implementing a Remediation Action Plan  to resolve the incident, following successful containment and evidence collection. See Appendix G  for a template.  When developing the Remediation Action Plan, consider:  •  What actions are required to resolve the incident?  •  What resources are required to resolve the incident (if not already included in the CIRT)?  – Are there additional external resources you may require?  •  Who is responsible for remediation actions?  •  What systems/services should be prioritised?  •  What systems/services will be affected during the remediation process?  – How will these systems be affected?  •  What is the expected resolution time?  12.3. Evidence Collection and Preservation (cont…)  Cyber Incident Response Plan  |  Guidance 27  Cyber Incident Response Plan  13. Recovery Include your organisation’s process for developing, authorising and executing an agreed recovery plan.  The recovery plan should detail the approach to recovering IT and/or OT networks, systems and  applications once containment and remediation is complete.  When developing the Recovery Plan, consider:  •  How systems will be restored to normal operation and expected timeframes?  •  How systems will be monitored to ensure they are no longer compromised and are functioning  as expected?  •  How identified vulnerabilities will be managed to prevent similar incidents?  13.1. Stand Down Include your organisation’s decision making process for standing down the CIRT and SEMT.  Include your process for completing an incident report, including recipients and timeframes.  Consider creating an incident report template as an appendix to the CIRP.  People Roles, responsibilities, accountabilities, skills  Process Plans, policies, procedures, protocols, processes, templates, arrangements  Organisation Structures, culture, jurisdictional arrangements  Support Infrastructure, facilities, maintenance  Technology Equipment, systems, standards, security, inter-operability  Training Qualifications/skill levels, identification of required courses  * Exercise Management  This only applies to exercises  Exercise development, structure, management, conduct  Cyber Incident Response Plan  |  Guidance28  Cyber Incident Response Plan  14.  Learn and  Improve  Include your organisation’s approach to learn from the incident and improve.  14.1. Post Incident Review A Post Incident Review (PIR) is a detailed review conducted after an organisation has experienced  a cyber security incident. It can include a hot debrief which is held immediately after an organisation  has recovered its networks and systems from a cyber security incident and a formal debrief held after  the incident report has been completed, such as within two weeks.  Key questions to consider in your PIR:  •  What were the root causes of the incident and any incident response issues?  •  Could the incident have been prevented? How?  •  What worked well in the response to the incident?  •  How can our response be improved for future incidents?  Refer to Appendix H for more detailed questions to consider in your PIR.  Recommendations that arise from the review can be documented in a corresponding Action Register.  Refer to Appendix I for an Action Register template.  14.1.1 PPOSTTE Model  The PPOSTTE model can assist to reflect on key elements of the incident response.  Cyber Incident Response Plan  |  Guidance 29  Cyber Incident Response Plan  14.2. Update and Test Cyber Incident Response Plan The PIR may result in changes to your CIRP, Playbooks and Templates. Changes should be  communicated to the relevant personnel.  Significant changes may require the CIRP and Playbooks to be tested. Regular testing is important to  ensure these documents remain current and are familiar to the relevant personnel. Testing methods  could include discussion or functional exercises.  14.3. Training Include your organisation’s training activities to support personnel named in the CIRP to perform  their roles.  The PIR may identify training needs for staff involved in incident response or cyber security  awareness training for all staff.  Consider how your organisation will support your staff through training activities.  Cyber Incident Response Plan  APPENDICES  Cyber Incident Response Plan  |  Guidance30  Cyber Incident Response Plan  |  Guidance 31  Cyber Incident Response Plan  Appendix A  Terminology and Definitions  Use of consistent and pre-defined terminology to describe incidents and their effects can be helpful  during a response. In your CIRP, include commonly used terms used in your organisation. ACSC defines  cyber threats, events, alerts and incidents as follows:  Cyber threat A cyber threat is any circumstance or event with the potential to harm systems or information.  Other threats are listed on cyber.gov.au. Organisations can include a list of cyber threats of concern.  The ACSC Annual Cyber Threat Report (2021) outlines the following threat environment and key cyber  security trends:  •  COVID-19 themed malicious activity  • Ransomware  including phishing emails and scams  •  Software supply chain compromise  •  Exploitation of security vulnerabilities  •  Cybercrime  •  Business Email Compromise  Cyber security event A cyber security event is an occurrence of a system, service or network state indicating a possible  breach of security policy, failure of safeguards or a previously unknown situation that may be  relevant to security.  A cyber security event has the potential to become, but is not confirmed to be, a cyber incident.  Examples of cyber security events include (but are not limited to):  •  A user has disabled the antivirus on their computer  •  A user has deleted or modified system files  •  A user restarted a server  •  Unauthorised access to a server or system.  Cyber security alert A cyber security alert is a notification generated in response to a deviation from normal behaviour.  Cyber security alerts are used to highlight cyber security events.  Cyber incident A cyber incident is an unwanted or unexpected cyber security event, or a series of such events,  that have a significant probability of compromising business operations. A cyber incident requires  corrective action.  Examples of cyber security incidents include (but are not limited to):  •  Denial-of-service attacks (DoS)  •  Unauthorised access or attempts to access a system  •  Compromise of sensitive information  •  Virus or malware outbreak (including ransomware).  https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/threats/large-organisations-and-infrastructure  Cyber Incident Response Plan  |  Guidance32  Cyber Incident Response Plan  PREPARATION  Your organisation has a cyber security policy or strategy that outlines your organisation’s approach  to prevention, preparedness, detection, response, recovery, review and improvement.  •  For example, does your organisation have a position on paying ransom, reporting incidents to  government, publicly acknowledging cyber incidents, sharing information about incidents with  trusted industry and government partners?  A Cyber Incident Response Plan has been developed, which:  •  Aligns with your organisation’s operating environment and other processes, including emergency  management and business continuity processes.  •  Has been reviewed or tested in an exercise to ensure it remains current and responsible personnel  are aware of their roles, responsibilities and processes.  •  Has prepared templates for information gathering, situation reports and other relevant events.  Staff involved in managing an incident have received incident response training.  Up-to-date hard copy versions of the Cyber Incident Response Plan and playbooks are stored  in a secure location (in case of electronic or hardware failure) and are accessible to authorised  staff members.  Specific playbooks to supplement the Cyber Incident Response Plan have been developed that  provide clear guidance for response actions to common incidents, roles and responsibilities.  A Cyber Incident Response Team (CIRT) and a Senior Executive Management Team (SEMT)  – or equivalents – have been formed to manage the response, with approved authorities.  All relevant IT and OT Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are documented and have  been reviewed or tested in an exercise to ensure they remain current and responsible personnel  are aware of their roles, responsibilities and processes.  Appendix B  Cyber Incident Response  Readiness Checklist  This checklist is to aid your organisation’s initial assessment of its readiness to respond to a cyber  security incident. This checklist is not an exhaustive list of all readiness activities.  Cyber Incident Response Plan  |  Guidance 33  Cyber Incident Response Plan  Cyber Incident Response  Readiness Checklist  Arrangements for service providers, including cloud and software as a service, to provide and retain  logs have been established and tested to ensure these include useful data and can be provided in a  timely manner.  Log retention for critical systems have been configured adequately and tested to confirm that  they capture useful data. Refer to the ACSC publications including Windows Event Logging and  Forwarding for specific guidance.  Your organisation has internal or third party arrangements and capabilities to detect  and analyse incidents. If these capabilities are outsourced, your organisation has an active  service agreement/contract.  Critical assets (data, applications and systems) have been identified and documented.  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been developed, and roles and responsibilities  assigned for use of facilities and communications technologies in response to cyber incidents,  and these resources are confirmed as available. This includes alternative/back-up ICT-based  channels.  Incident logging/records and tracking technologies used to manage a response are confirmed  as available and have been tested.  Role cards have been developed for each person involved in the CIRT and the SEMT.  Individual actions will depend on the type and severity of the incident. Example role card  is available at Appendix J.  Your organisation has internal or third party arrangements and capabilities to monitor threats.  Situational awareness information is collected from internal and external data sources, including:  •  Local system and network traffic and activity logs  •  News feeds concerning ongoing political, social, or economic activities that might  impact incident activity  •  External feeds on incident trends, new attack vectors, current attack indicators and new mitigation  strategies and technologies.  https://www.cyber.gov.au/publications https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/publications/windows-event-logging-and-forwarding https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/publications/windows-event-logging-and-forwarding  Cyber Incident Response Plan  |  Guidance34  Cyber Incident Response Plan  Cyber Incident Response  Readiness Checklist  DETECTION, INVESTIGATION, ANALYSIS AND ACTIVATION  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been developed, and roles and responsibilities assigned for:  Detection mechanisms typically include scanning, sensing and logging mechanisms which can be  used to identify potential cyber security events and incidents. Monitoring processes could include  the identification of unusual patterns of behaviour and logging that facilitates investigation and  preserves forensic evidence. Monitoring processes would consider the broad set of events, ranging  from the physical hardware layer to higher order business activities such as payments and changes  to user access. Common monitoring techniques include:  •  Network and user profiling that establishes a baseline of normal activity which, when combined  with logging and alerting mechanisms, can enable detection of anomalous activity;  •  Scanning for unauthorised hardware, software and changes to configurations;  •  Sensors that provide an alert when a measure breaches a defined threshold(s) (e.g. device,  server and network activity);  •  Logging and alerting of access to sensitive data or unsuccessful logon attempts to identify  potential unauthorised access; and  •  Users with privileged access accounts subject to a greater level of monitoring in light of the  heightened risks involved.  Incident detection, including self-detected incidents, notifications received from service providers  or vendors, and notifications received from trusted third parties (e.g. ACSC).  Incident analysis, including how incidents are to be categorised, classified and prioritised, and  controls related to how data is stored and transmitted (i.e. if out-of-band transmission is required).  Activating a Cyber Incident Response Team (CIRT) to manage critical incidents, with roles and  responsibilities assigned.  Activating a Senior Executive Management Team (SEMT) to manage critical incidents,  with roles and responsibilities assigned.  CONTAINMENT, EVIDENCE COLLECTION AND REMEDIATION  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), playbooks and templates, have been developed, and roles  and responsibilities assigned for containment, evidence collection and remediation. These can be  included as appendices to the Cyber Incident Response Plan.  A secure location is available for storing data captured during an incident, which could be used  as evidence of the incident and the adversary’s tradecraft, and ready to be provided to third-party  stakeholders if needed.  4 APRA Prudential Practice Guide CPG 234 Information Security.  Cyber Incident Response Plan  |  Guidance 35  Cyber Incident Response Plan  Cyber Incident Response  Readiness Checklist  COMMUNICATIONS  Policy, plans, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and templates have been developed to support  communicating with:  –  Internal stakeholders (e.g. Board, staff)  –  External stakeholders (e.g. stakeholders to assist with the response and stakeholders  with an interest in the response).  Policy, plans, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and templates for media and communications  professionals have been developed, and roles and responsibilities assigned, to support public and  media messaging.  You organisation has assigned a public and media spokesperson, who is supported by subject  matter experts.  Staff have been trained to implement the communications processes and execute their roles  and responsibilities.  Staff who are not involved in managing incidents are cognisant of your organisation’s policy and  processes and their responsibilities when an incident occurs (e.g. exercising discretion, using  approved talking points, referring enquiries to the designated officer).  INCIDENT NOTIFICATION AND REPORTING  Processes, roles,responsibilities and contact details are assigned and documented to support the  organisation to meet its legal and regulatory requirements on cyber incident notification, reporting  and response. This includes the processes for obtaining authority to release and share information.  Processes are documented for insurance requirements.  POST INCIDENT REVIEW  A process is documented to conduct Post Incident Reviews (PIR) following conclusion of an incident  and PIR reports with recommendations are submitted to management for endorsement.  A process is documented to ensure actions following incidents and/or exercises are tracked and  completed (e.g. Action Register).  Cyber Incident Response Plan  |  Guidance36  Cyber Incident Response Plan  Appendix C  ACSC Incident Triage Questions  Where applicable, personnel reporting cyber security incidents to the ACSC on behalf of their  organisation should try to have information available to answer the following questions:  •  Who is reporting the incident? (include their position e.g. CISO, ITSA, SOC Manager etc.)  •  Who/what is the affected organisation/entity?  •  What type of incident is being reported? (e.g. ransomware, denial of service, data exposure, malware)  •  Is the incident still active?  •  When was the incident first identified?  •  Are you reporting for ACSC awareness or is ACSC assistance required?  – If ACSC assistance is required, what assistance is needed?  •  What type of system or network has been affected?  –  Information Technology (IT)  •  Corporate systems/networks, databases, servers, VOIP systems.  –  Operational Technology (OT)  •  SCADA, Remote sensors, BMS/BAS, logic controllers.  •  What was observed (the sequence of events)? E.g. was lateral movement observed?  – Date/Time  – Effect/Event  •  Who or what identified the problem?  •  Has a data breach occurred?  –  What type of information was exposed?  • What impact will this have on the organisation?  •  What impact (if any) will the breach have on public safety or services?  – What volume of records/data was exposed?  – Was it a misconfiguration/error, or was a malicious exfiltration or theft of data identified?  –  Has it been reported to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC)?  •  If not, organisations need to consider if mandatory reporting obligations apply under  the Notifiable Data Breach (NDB) scheme  •  What actions have been taken to rectify the issue?  –  Does the organisation/entity have internal or external IT and/or cyber security incident  response providers?  –  Are services/business as usual operations interrupted?  •  If so, how long do they expect before they are back at normal operating capability?  •  Will you be communicating publicly about the incident and engaging with media?  –  If so, please notify the ACSC beforehand if you will be referencing the ACSC.

The content of the review will vary for each organisation, but primarily focuses  on establishing learnings and providing recommended actions to mitigate future incidents. The  purpose of this document is to provide organisations that have experienced a cyber security incident  with tools and techniques to conduct a PIR in order to identify areas to improve their cyber security  posture.  How to use the guide The guide contains high level steps recommended for organisations to follow after experiencing a  cyber security incident. The guide should be used as a resource, and will need to be further tailored by  organisations to suit and meet their individual requirements. The templates are generic documents,  and will need to be tailored to suit specific organisational requirements.  This guide and the templates were informed by private industry and government resources.  Post Incident Review Steps  Step 1 – Hold incident debriefs Post incident debriefs are useful for capturing observations from personnel directly involved in  managing a cyber security incident and identifying actions to improve how the organisation managed  the response, as well as how the incident could have been prevented.  There are two types of debriefs organisations may hold after experiencing a cyber security incident:  a hot debrief and a formal debrief (or cold debrief).  A hot debrief is held immediately after an organisation has recovered its networks and systems from  a cyber security incident  The benefits of holding a hot debrief include:  •  The team involved in responding to the incident is available to provide instant feedback and lessons  learned.  •  Any urgent issues identified during the incident can be addressed immediately.  •  Personnel involved in the incident are more likely to recall information and detail as it is still fresh  in their minds.  Cyber Incident Response Plan  |  Guidance42  A formal debrief is held days to weeks after an organisation has recovered its networks and systems  after a cyber security incident.  The benefits of holding a formal debrief include:  •  It provides an opportunity for an organisation to discuss the cyber security incident in detail after it  is resolved to gather key insights, learnings and opportunities for improvement.  •  It enables time between the incident and debrief, providing time for emotions to settle, particularly  for stressful incidents.  •  It ensures all key personnel required for the discussion are present, especially senior management  who will need to drive the implementation of actions.  The material below provides high-level guidance on how organisations can hold both types of debrief.  Hot debrief guidance Time:  30 minutes – 1 hour*  *Timing may depend on the complexity of the incident and the personnel involved.  Aim:  The aim of the hot debrief is to review the incident, receive feedback on personnel observations and  insights, and identify any urgent issues requiring immediate action.  Participants:  The debrief should be led by a manager who was involved during the incident, supported by a scribe  whose role is to document attendance, key insights and immediate actions. It is recommended that  debrief participants include all personnel involved during the detection, response and recovery  phases of the incident, and upper management are excluded (i.e. CEOs and general managers).  This will ensure personnel involved in the incident can speak openly without fear of repercussion.  Content:  The manager could guide discussion using the following questions:  1. What went well?  2. What could personnel and teams do differently next time to improve?  3.  What action has been taken to remediate immediate risk? Are there any further issues that require  immediate resolution?  Note, it is essential for the manager to remain objective during the discussion, and treat the incident  as a learning point for all involved, without attributing blame to an individual or a team.  Conclusion:  At the end of the debrief, the manager should provide a summary of the discussions to participants  who can confirm whether the key issues and actions were captured. The manager should explain  the next steps, following the debrief, and the expected timeframes for these.  Cyber Incident Response Plan  Cyber Incident Response Plan  |  Guidance 43  Formal debrief guidance  Time:  1–2 hours.  Aim:  The aim of the formal debrief is to review the incident, validate what worked and produce actions  and assigned responsibilities to improve the current arrangements.  Participants:  The debrief should be led by a facilitator who asks key questions, supported by a scribe to document  key insights and actions.  It is recommended that debrief participants include:  • technical personnel who were involved in detecting, responding to, and resolving the incident  •  non-technical personnel who were involved during the incident (at minimum – one staff member  from each function)  • communications/media personnel involved in the incident.  Content:  Questions to consider in the debrief can be found at the Post Incident Review Analysis Template.  The facilitator can use this document to lead the conversation with the participants, while the scribe  documents the discussion directly into the Analysis template. The scribe can also use the Action  Register Template to document any actions resulting from the discussion.  Conclusion:  At the end of the debrief, a decision should be made about whether additional discussions are required,  or if finalisation of the incident documents can be completed. If email correspondence is selected  to disseminate the documents, an action officer will need to be identified for completing them and  circulating them to staff for endorsement.  Step 2 – Complete incident documentation  Based on the findings of the debriefs, the action officer should complete a draft of the Post Incident  Review Analysis and the Action Register, and circulate them to the personnel involved in the hot debrief  for their feedback and endorsement. Note, it is important that the Action Register details an assigned  lead (action officer) for closing out each action.  Once feedback is received and incorporated, the documents should be sent to an executive staff  member (a CEO or general manager, or equivalent) for endorsement. The executive staff member may  advise on their expectations on the frequency of progress reporting of agreed actions, and nominate  a staff member to lead the reporting/tracking.  Step 3 – Incident tracking and reporting  The identified actions should be tracked and reported at agreed frequencies by the nominated  staff member.

Provides high level areas for improvement.  •  Protection – Identifies the protection mechanisms that were in place at the time of the incident and  their effectiveness. Establishes how to improve the protection of our systems and networks.  •  Detection – Establishes how to reduce the time to identify an incident is occurring. Addresses what  detection mechanisms were in place, and how those mechanisms can be improved.  •  Response – Identifies improvements for the incident response.  •  Recovery – Addresses improvements for incident recovery (i.e. how to recover from an incident faster).

Depending on the severity of the incident, the ACSC has a suite of capabilities  that it may deploy to support the affected parties. However, ACSC determines which capabilities are appropriate  and available given competing priorities. Organisations must not rely on the ACSC for their own ability to respond  to cyber incidents in an appropriate and timely manner.

    "original document": "ACSC Emergency Response Guide  CYBER INCIDENT  RESPONSE PLAN GUIDANCE  Cyber Incident Response Plan  |  Guidance2  Context The Australian Government defines cyber security as measures used to protect the confidentiality,  integrity and availability of systems and information. A cyber incident is an unwanted or unexpected  cyber security event, or a series of such events, that have a significant probability of compromising  business operations.1  Australian organisations are targeted by malicious cyber adversaries. The Australian Cyber Security  Centre’s (ACSC) assessment is malicious cyber activity against Australia’s national and economic  interests is increasing in frequency, scale, and sophistication. As adversaries become more adept,  the likelihood and severity of cyber attacks is also increasing due to the interconnectivity and  availability of information technology platforms, devices and systems exposed to the internet.  To illustrate the volume of cyber incidents occurring in Australia, the ACSC responded to over 1500 cyber  security incidents between 1 July 2020 and 30 June 2021.2 While many of the incidents reported to the  ACSC could have been avoided or mitigated by good cyber security practices, such as implementation  of ASD’s Essential Eight security controls, risks will still remain when organisations operate online.  Managing responses to cyber incidents is the responsibility of each affected organisation.  All organisations should have a cyber incident response plan to ensure an effective response and  prompt recovery in the event security controls don’t prevent an incident occurring. This plan should  be tested and regularly reviewed.  To be effective, a cyber incident response plan should align with the organisation’s incident,  emergency, crisis and business continuity arrangements, as well as jurisdictional and national cyber  and emergency arrangements. It should support personnel to fulfil their roles by outlining their  responsibilities and all legal and regulatory obligations.  While organisations are responsible for managing incidents affecting their business, Australia’s Cyber  Incident Management Arrangements (CIMA) outline the inter-jurisdictional coordination arrangements  and principles for Australian governments’ cooperation in response to national cyber incidents.3  Purpose The Cyber Incident Response Plan (CIRP) Template and the Cyber Incident Response Readiness  Checklist (Appendix B) are intended to be used as a starting point for organisations to develop their  own plan and readiness checklist.  Each organisation’s CIRP and checklist need to be tailored according to their unique operating  environment, priorities, resources and obligations.  In addition to a CIRP, organisations can develop more detailed, day-to-day procedures to supplement  the cyber incident response plan. This could include more detailed playbooks to aid the response to  common incident types, such as ransomware or data breaches, and standard operating procedures  (SOPs) to respond to incidents affecting specific assets.

Investigation Questions To guide your incident response efforts and understanding of the scope and impact of the incident,  develop a list of investigation questions. Not all questions may be answerable with the data available  and questions may change as your investigation progresses.  Possible investigation questions include:  •  What was the initial intrusion vector?  •  What post-exploitation activity occurred? Have accounts been compromised? What level of privilege?  •  Does the actor have persistence on the network or device?  •  Is lateral movement suspected or known? Where has the actor laterally moved to and how?  •  How is the actor maintaining command and control?  •  Has data been accessed or exfiltrated and, if so, what kind of data?  11.4. Escalation and De-escalation Include the escalation and de-escalation triggers and/or thresholds, and decision making authorities.  You could include this in a table, for example:  Cyber Incident Response Plan  |  Guidance 25  Cyber Incident Response Plan  12.  Containment,  Evidence Collection  and Remediation  12.1. Containment Refer to your organisation’s separate detailed SOPs about containing the incident according  to the incident type.  Containment actions are implemented in order to minimise the damage, prevent the incident  from spreading or escalating, and prevent the attacker from destroying evidence of their attack.  When planning containment actions, consider:  •  Any additional impacts there could be to systems/services  •  Time and resources required to contain the incident  •  Effectiveness of the containment solution (e.g. partial vs full containment)  •  Duration that the solution will remain in place (e.g. temporary vs permanent solution).  12.2. Documentation Include your organisations process for documenting the incident, responsible personnel,  recipients and timeframes. Refer to Appendix D for a Situation Report template and Appendix E  for an Incident Log template.  Situation reports may contain the following information:  •  Incident date and time  •  Status of the incident  •  Incident type and classification  •  Scope and Impact  •  Severity  •  External assistance required  •  Actions taken to resolve the incident  •  Contact details for incident manager and key CIRT personnel  •  Date and time of the next update.  12.3. Evidence Collection and Preservation Include your organisation’s processes for collecting, preserving, handling and storing evidence,  responsible personnel, recipients and timeframes. As this can be complex you may need to seek advice  from digital forensic professionals, legal or law enforcement.  Cyber Incident Response Plan  |  Guidance26  Cyber Incident Response Plan  When gathering evidence, maintain a detailed log that clearly documents how all evidence has been  collected. This should include who collected or handled the evidence, the time and date (including  time zone) evidence was collected and handled, and the details of each item collected (including the  physical location, serial number, model number, hostname, media access control (MAC) address,  IP address and hash values). See Appendix F for a template.  Examples of commonly collected evidence include:  •  Disk/hard drive/host images  •  Network packet captures and flows  •  IP addresses  •  Log files  •  Network diagrams  • Configuration files  •  Databases  •  IR/investigation notes  •  Screenshots  •  Social media posts  •  CCTV, video and audio recordings  •  Documents detailing the monetary cost  of remediation or loss of business activity•  Memory/RAM images  12.4. Remediation Action Plan Include your organisation’s process for developing and implementing a Remediation Action Plan  to resolve the incident, following successful containment and evidence collection. See Appendix G  for a template.  When developing the Remediation Action Plan, consider:  •  What actions are required to resolve the incident?  •  What resources are required to resolve the incident (if not already included in the CIRT)?  – Are there additional external resources you may require?  •  Who is responsible for remediation actions?  •  What systems/services should be prioritised?  •  What systems/services will be affected during the remediation process?  – How will these systems be affected?  •  What is the expected resolution time?  12.3. Evidence Collection and Preservation (cont…)  Cyber Incident Response Plan  |  Guidance 27  Cyber Incident Response Plan  13. Recovery Include your organisation’s process for developing, authorising and executing an agreed recovery plan.  The recovery plan should detail the approach to recovering IT and/or OT networks, systems and  applications once containment and remediation is complete.  When developing the Recovery Plan, consider:  •  How systems will be restored to normal operation and expected timeframes?  •  How systems will be monitored to ensure they are no longer compromised and are functioning  as expected?  •  How identified vulnerabilities will be managed to prevent similar incidents?  13.1. Stand Down Include your organisation’s decision making process for standing down the CIRT and SEMT.  Include your process for completing an incident report, including recipients and timeframes.  Consider creating an incident report template as an appendix to the CIRP.

Learn and  Improve  Include your organisation’s approach to learn from the incident and improve.  14.1. Post Incident Review A Post Incident Review (PIR) is a detailed review conducted after an organisation has experienced  a cyber security incident. It can include a hot debrief which is held immediately after an organisation  has recovered its networks and systems from a cyber security incident and a formal debrief held after  the incident report has been completed, such as within two weeks.  Key questions to consider in your PIR:  •  What were the root causes of the incident and any incident response issues?  •  Could the incident have been prevented? How?  •  What worked well in the response to the incident?  •  How can our response be improved for future incidents?  Refer to Appendix H for more detailed questions to consider in your PIR.  Recommendations that arise from the review can be documented in a corresponding Action Register.  Refer to Appendix I for an Action Register template.  14.1.1 PPOSTTE Model  The PPOSTTE model can assist to reflect on key elements of the incident response.  Cyber Incident Response Plan  |  Guidance 29  Cyber Incident Response Plan  14.2. Update and Test Cyber Incident Response Plan The PIR may result in changes to your CIRP, Playbooks and Templates. Changes should be  communicated to the relevant personnel.  Significant changes may require the CIRP and Playbooks to be tested. Regular testing is important to  ensure these documents remain current and are familiar to the relevant personnel. Testing methods  could include discussion or functional exercises.  14.3. Training Include your organisation’s training activities to support personnel named in the CIRP to perform  their roles.  The PIR may identify training needs for staff involved in incident response or cyber security  awareness training for all staff.  Consider how your organisation will support your staff through training activities.  Cyber Incident Response Plan  APPENDICES  Cyber Incident Response Plan  |  Guidance30  Cyber Incident Response Plan  |  Guidance 31  Cyber Incident Response Plan  Appendix A  Terminology and Definitions  Use of consistent and pre-defined terminology to describe incidents and their effects can be helpful  during a response. In your CIRP, include commonly used terms used in your organisation. ACSC defines  cyber threats, events, alerts and incidents as follows:  Cyber threat A cyber threat is any circumstance or event with the potential to harm systems or information.  Other threats are listed on cyber.gov.au. Organisations can include a list of cyber threats of concern.  The ACSC Annual Cyber Threat Report (2021) outlines the following threat environment and key cyber  security trends:  •  COVID-19 themed malicious activity  • Ransomware  including phishing emails and scams  •  Software supply chain compromise  •  Exploitation of security vulnerabilities  •  Cybercrime  •  Business Email Compromise  Cyber security event A cyber security event is an occurrence of a system, service or network state indicating a possible  breach of security policy, failure of safeguards or a previously unknown situation that may be  relevant to security.  A cyber security event has the potential to become, but is not confirmed to be, a cyber incident.  Examples of cyber security events include (but are not limited to):  •  A user has disabled the antivirus on their computer  •  A user has deleted or modified system files  •  A user restarted a server  •  Unauthorised access to a server or system.  Cyber security alert A cyber security alert is a notification generated in response to a deviation from normal behaviour.  Cyber security alerts are used to highlight cyber security events.  Cyber incident A cyber incident is an unwanted or unexpected cyber security event, or a series of such events,  that have a significant probability of compromising business operations. A cyber incident requires  corrective action.  Examples of cyber security incidents include (but are not limited to):  •  Denial-of-service attacks (DoS)  •  Unauthorised access or attempts to access a system  •  Compromise of sensitive information  •  Virus or malware outbreak (including ransomware).  https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/threats/large-organisations-and-infrastructure  Cyber Incident Response Plan  |  Guidance32  Cyber Incident Response Plan  PREPARATION  Your organisation has a cyber security policy or strategy that outlines your organisation’s approach  to prevention, preparedness, detection, response, recovery, review and improvement.  •  For example, does your organisation have a position on paying ransom, reporting incidents to  government, publicly acknowledging cyber incidents, sharing information about incidents with  trusted industry and government partners?  A Cyber Incident Response Plan has been developed, which:  •  Aligns with your organisation’s operating environment and other processes, including emergency  management and business continuity processes.  •  Has been reviewed or tested in an exercise to ensure it remains current and responsible personnel  are aware of their roles, responsibilities and processes.  •  Has prepared templates for information gathering, situation reports and other relevant events.  Staff involved in managing an incident have received incident response training.  Up-to-date hard copy versions of the Cyber Incident Response Plan and playbooks are stored  in a secure location (in case of electronic or hardware failure) and are accessible to authorised  staff members.  Specific playbooks to supplement the Cyber Incident Response Plan have been developed that  provide clear guidance for response actions to common incidents, roles and responsibilities.  A Cyber Incident Response Team (CIRT) and a Senior Executive Management Team (SEMT)  – or equivalents – have been formed to manage the response, with approved authorities.  All relevant IT and OT Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are documented and have  been reviewed or tested in an exercise to ensure they remain current and responsible personnel  are aware of their roles, responsibilities and processes.  Appendix B  Cyber Incident Response  Readiness Checklist  This checklist is to aid your organisation’s initial assessment of its readiness to respond to a cyber  security incident. This checklist is not an exhaustive list of all readiness activities.  Cyber Incident Response Plan  |  Guidance 33  Cyber Incident Response Plan  Cyber Incident Response  Readiness Checklist  Arrangements for service providers, including cloud and software as a service, to provide and retain  logs have been established and tested to ensure these include useful data and can be provided in a  timely manner.  Log retention for critical systems have been configured adequately and tested to confirm that  they capture useful data. Refer to the ACSC publications including Windows Event Logging and  Forwarding for specific guidance.  Your organisation has internal or third party arrangements and capabilities to detect  and analyse incidents. If these capabilities are outsourced, your organisation has an active  service agreement/contract.  Critical assets (data, applications and systems) have been identified and documented.  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been developed, and roles and responsibilities  assigned for use of facilities and communications technologies in response to cyber incidents,  and these resources are confirmed as available. This includes alternative/back-up ICT-based  channels.  Incident logging/records and tracking technologies used to manage a response are confirmed  as available and have been tested.  Role cards have been developed for each person involved in the CIRT and the SEMT.  Individual actions will depend on the type and severity of the incident. Example role card  is available at Appendix J.  Your organisation has internal or third party arrangements and capabilities to monitor threats.  Situational awareness information is collected from internal and external data sources, including:  •  Local system and network traffic and activity logs  •  News feeds concerning ongoing political, social, or economic activities that might  impact incident activity  •  External feeds on incident trends, new attack vectors, current attack indicators and new mitigation  strategies and technologies.  https://www.cyber.gov.au/publications https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/publications/windows-event-logging-and-forwarding https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/publications/windows-event-logging-and-forwarding  Cyber Incident Response Plan  |  Guidance34  Cyber Incident Response Plan  Cyber Incident Response  Readiness Checklist  DETECTION, INVESTIGATION, ANALYSIS AND ACTIVATION  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been developed, and roles and responsibilities assigned for:  Detection mechanisms typically include scanning, sensing and logging mechanisms which can be  used to identify potential cyber security events and incidents. Monitoring processes could include  the identification of unusual patterns of behaviour and logging that facilitates investigation and  preserves forensic evidence. Monitoring processes would consider the broad set of events, ranging  from the physical hardware layer to higher order business activities such as payments and changes  to user access. Common monitoring techniques include:  •  Network and user profiling that establishes a baseline of normal activity which, when combined  with logging and alerting mechanisms, can enable detection of anomalous activity;  •  Scanning for unauthorised hardware, software and changes to configurations;  •  Sensors that provide an alert when a measure breaches a defined threshold(s) (e.g. device,  server and network activity);  •  Logging and alerting of access to sensitive data or unsuccessful logon attempts to identify  potential unauthorised access; and  •  Users with privileged access accounts subject to a greater level of monitoring in light of the  heightened risks involved.  Incident detection, including self-detected incidents, notifications received from service providers  or vendors, and notifications received from trusted third parties (e.g. ACSC).  Incident analysis, including how incidents are to be categorised, classified and prioritised, and  controls related to how data is stored and transmitted (i.e. if out-of-band transmission is required).  Activating a Cyber Incident Response Team (CIRT) to manage critical incidents, with roles and  responsibilities assigned.  Activating a Senior Executive Management Team (SEMT) to manage critical incidents,  with roles and responsibilities assigned.  CONTAINMENT, EVIDENCE COLLECTION AND REMEDIATION  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), playbooks and templates, have been developed, and roles  and responsibilities assigned for containment, evidence collection and remediation. These can be  included as appendices to the Cyber Incident Response Plan.  A secure location is available for storing data captured during an incident, which could be used  as evidence of the incident and the adversary’s tradecraft, and ready to be provided to third-party  stakeholders if needed.  4 APRA Prudential Practice Guide CPG 234 Information Security.  Cyber Incident Response Plan  |  Guidance 35  Cyber Incident Response Plan  Cyber Incident Response  Readiness Checklist  COMMUNICATIONS  Policy, plans, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and templates have been developed to support  communicating with:  –  Internal stakeholders (e.g. Board, staff)  –  External stakeholders (e.g. stakeholders to assist with the response and stakeholders  with an interest in the response).  Policy, plans, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and templates for media and communications  professionals have been developed, and roles and responsibilities assigned, to support public and  media messaging.  You organisation has assigned a public and media spokesperson, who is supported by subject  matter experts.  Staff have been trained to implement the communications processes and execute their roles  and responsibilities.  Staff who are not involved in managing incidents are cognisant of your organisation’s policy and  processes and their responsibilities when an incident occurs (e.g. exercising discretion, using  approved talking points, referring enquiries to the designated officer).  INCIDENT NOTIFICATION AND REPORTING  Processes, roles,responsibilities and contact details are assigned and documented to support the  organisation to meet its legal and regulatory requirements on cyber incident notification, reporting  and response. This includes the processes for obtaining authority to release and share information.  Processes are documented for insurance requirements.  POST INCIDENT REVIEW  A process is documented to conduct Post Incident Reviews (PIR) following conclusion of an incident  and PIR reports with recommendations are submitted to management for endorsement.  A process is documented to ensure actions following incidents and/or exercises are tracked and  completed (e.g. Action Register).  Cyber Incident Response Plan  |  Guidance36  Cyber Incident Response Plan  Appendix C  ACSC Incident Triage Questions  Where applicable, personnel reporting cyber security incidents to the ACSC on behalf of their  organisation should try to have information available to answer the following questions:  •  Who is reporting the incident? (include their position e.g. CISO, ITSA, SOC Manager etc.)  •  Who/what is the affected organisation/entity?  •  What type of incident is being reported?

The content of the review will vary for each organisation, but primarily focuses  on establishing learnings and providing recommended actions to mitigate future incidents. The  purpose of this document is to provide organisations that have experienced a cyber security incident  with tools and techniques to conduct a PIR in order to identify areas to improve their cyber security  posture.  How to use the guide The guide contains high level steps recommended for organisations to follow after experiencing a  cyber security incident. The guide should be used as a resource, and will need to be further tailored by  organisations to suit and meet their individual requirements. The templates are generic documents,  and will need to be tailored to suit specific organisational requirements.  This guide and the templates were informed by private industry and government resources.  Post Incident Review Steps  Step 1 – Hold incident debriefs Post incident debriefs are useful for capturing observations from personnel directly involved in  managing a cyber security incident and identifying actions to improve how the organisation managed  the response, as well as how the incident could have been prevented.  There are two types of debriefs organisations may hold after experiencing a cyber security incident:  a hot debrief and a formal debrief (or cold debrief).  A hot debrief is held immediately after an organisation has recovered its networks and systems from  a cyber security incident  The benefits of holding a hot debrief include:  •  The team involved in responding to the incident is available to provide instant feedback and lessons  learned.  •  Any urgent issues identified during the incident can be addressed immediately.  •  Personnel involved in the incident are more likely to recall information and detail as it is still fresh  in their minds.  Cyber Incident Response Plan  |  Guidance42  A formal debrief is held days to weeks after an organisation has recovered its networks and systems  after a cyber security incident.  The benefits of holding a formal debrief include:  •  It provides an opportunity for an organisation to discuss the cyber security incident in detail after it  is resolved to gather key insights, learnings and opportunities for improvement.  •  It enables time between the incident and debrief, providing time for emotions to settle, particularly  for stressful incidents.  •  It ensures all key personnel required for the discussion are present, especially senior management  who will need to drive the implementation of actions.  The material below provides high-level guidance on how organisations can hold both types of debrief.  Hot debrief guidance Time:  30 minutes – 1 hour*  *Timing may depend on the complexity of the incident and the personnel involved.  Aim:  The aim of the hot debrief is to review the incident, receive feedback on personnel observations and  insights, and identify any urgent issues requiring immediate action.  Participants:  The debrief should be led by a manager who was involved during the incident, supported by a scribe  whose role is to document attendance, key insights and immediate actions. It is recommended that  debrief participants include all personnel involved during the detection, response and recovery  phases of the incident, and upper management are excluded (i.e. CEOs and general managers).  This will ensure personnel involved in the incident can speak openly without fear of repercussion.  Content:  The manager could guide discussion using the following questions:  1. What went well?  2. What could personnel and teams do differently next time to improve?  3.  What action has been taken to remediate immediate risk? Are there any further issues that require  immediate resolution?  Note, it is essential for the manager to remain objective during the discussion, and treat the incident  as a learning point for all involved, without attributing blame to an individual or a team.  Conclusion:  At the end of the debrief, the manager should provide a summary of the discussions to participants  who can confirm whether the key issues and actions were captured. The manager should explain  the next steps, following the debrief, and the expected timeframes for these.  Cyber Incident Response Plan  Cyber Incident Response Plan  |  Guidance 43  Formal debrief guidance  Time:  1–2 hours.  Aim:  The aim of the formal debrief is to review the incident, validate what worked and produce actions  and assigned responsibilities to improve the current arrangements.  Participants:  The debrief should be led by a facilitator who asks key questions, supported by a scribe to document  key insights and actions.  It is recommended that debrief participants include:  • technical personnel who were involved in detecting, responding to, and resolving the incident  •  non-technical personnel who were involved during the incident (at minimum – one staff member  from each function)  • communications/media personnel involved in the incident.  Content:  Questions to consider in the debrief can be found at the Post Incident Review Analysis Template.  The facilitator can use this document to lead the conversation with the participants, while the scribe  documents the discussion directly into the Analysis template. The scribe can also use the Action  Register Template to document any actions resulting from the discussion.  Conclusion:  At the end of the debrief, a decision should be made about whether additional discussions are required,  or if finalisation of the incident documents can be completed. If email correspondence is selected  to disseminate the documents, an action officer will need to be identified for completing them and  circulating them to staff for endorsement.  Step 2 – Complete incident documentation  Based on the findings of the debriefs, the action officer should complete a draft of the Post Incident  Review Analysis and the Action Register, and circulate them to the personnel involved in the hot debrief  for their feedback and endorsement. Note, it is important that the Action Register details an assigned  lead (action officer) for closing out each action.  Once feedback is received and incorporated, the documents should be sent to an executive staff  member (a CEO or general manager, or equivalent) for endorsement. The executive staff member may  advise on their expectations on the frequency of progress reporting of agreed actions, and nominate  a staff member to lead the reporting/tracking.  Step 3 – Incident tracking and reporting  The identified actions should be tracked and reported at agreed frequencies by the nominated  staff member.

I.e. loss of systems  Brief summary What happened?  Incident Analysis  The Incident Analysis is broken into the following categories:  •  Incident timeline – Summary of what happened and when. Provides high level areas for improvement.  •  Protection – Identifies the protection mechanisms that were in place at the time of the incident and  their effectiveness. Establishes how to improve the protection of our systems and networks.  •  Detection – Establishes how to reduce the time to identify an incident is occurring. Addresses what  detection mechanisms were in place, and how those mechanisms can be improved.  •  Response – Identifies improvements for the incident response.  •  Recovery – Addresses improvements for incident recovery (i.e. how to recover from an incident faster).

When did your organisation identify that an incident was occurring?  Date and time  of incident response  Date and time  of incident recovery  Who discovered the incident  first and how?  Or who was alerted to it first? How did the discovery or alert happen?  Was the incident reported  externally? If yes, when?  For example, did your organisation report it to the ACSC?  Who supported resolving  the incident? When did they  provide support?  List the names of personnel involved in resolving the incident, and the time  (and date if not all on the same day) they joined in.  What activities were  conducted to resolve the  incident? When were they  conducted and what was  their impact?

Are there any ways  to improve the  ‘time-to-detection’?  How could your organisation reduce that time?  Are there any indicators  that can be used to detect  similar incidents in the  future?  Are there any additional  tools or resources that are  required in the future to  detect similar incidents?  Is there anything (from a detection perspective) that will help mitigate  future incidents?  Technology? Human resources with specific skills? Etc.

How was the incident  resolved?  What needed to happen for the issue to be resolved?  What obstacles were  faced when responding  to the incident?  Were any business policies  and/or procedures used in  responding to the incident?  For example, does your organisation have an Incident Response Plan,  and was this followed?  Were those business policies  and/or procedures effective?  Did they work? Why/why not?  What delays and obstacles  were experienced when  responding?  Were there any escalation  points?  Were there any escalation points that the incident went through?  If there were escalation  points, did they hamper the  response OR were they at  the appropriate level?  For example, having to escalate to a Chief Operating Officer (COO) to take  action on an ongoing incident had severe timeline impacts on responding  to an active incident.  How well did the  information sharing and  communications work  within your organisation?  What worked well/what did not work well. How could it be improved?  Was there any information that was needed sooner?  How did your organisation communicate within the IR team, across  jurisdictions, across time zones, legal teams, external comms teams, etc.?

Depending on the severity of the incident, the ACSC has a suite of capabilities  that it may deploy to support the affected parties. However, ACSC determines which capabilities are appropriate  and available given competing priorities. Organisations must not rely on the ACSC for their own ability to respond  to cyber incidents in an appropriate and timely manner.

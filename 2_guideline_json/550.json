The majority of these cables are usually laid  underground, for esthetic reasons and to improve their security.  In the last years, ENISA has noticed a large amount of Internet outages due to cable cuts. The source  cause can be linked either to malicious actions or to accidental (unvoluntary) events. Thus, a fair  amount of unvoluntary disruption can be attributed to underground excavation performed during a  civil work, due to a lack of information regarding the presence of underground cables at the dig site.  Certain Member States (MS) of the European Union – namely Belgium, Denmark, France, Netherlands,  Sweden, and the United Kingdom – have developed specific tools to prevent the disruption of  underground electronic communication infrastructure. These tools, whose use can be either  mandatory or voluntary, foster the collaboration between infrastructure owners and excavators:  infrastructure owners can declare their underground assets and share the information with the  excavator before any planned civil work.  This document analyses existing initiatives deployed by selected MS. Information collected through a  survey is analysed to understand the choices made for the development and management of such  tools, the technical implementation, the operational usage of the tool, its financing, and security  aspects linked to the misuse of information. In particular, confidentiality is a key parameter that need  to be tackled before launching any new initiative.  The document then explores the advantages of an automated information exchange tool in the  protection of underground infrastructure. It summarizes the principle results found during the survey  and explores possible improvement and future developments.  This document aims to provide recommendations to Member States (MS) that wish to protect their  underground electronic communications infrastructure against disruption due to civil works. This  document shall help MS to assess their need to deploy an automated information system for damage  prevention, and eventually assist them in the development of such tool through the following  recommendations:   MS should analyse the reasons behind cable cuts   MS should evaluate the benefits of an automated information exchange tool to protect  underground infrastructure   MS developing an automated information exchange tool should rely on existing tools and  experience   All stakeholders need to collaborate to define the principles of the automated information  exchange tool to protect underground assets   MS should promote the use of their automated information exchange tool to protect their  underground infrastructure   MS should evaluate the security policy for operating and managing their automated  information exchange tool   MS should evaluate the sustainability of their automated information exchange tool  Finally, this document emphasizes how automatic information exchange tools are a valuable tool to  protect underground electronic communication infrastructure against outages due to digging.

Network access can be vital for the proper operation of services of high importance.  For example, access to emergency services, energy, utility SCADA network…  Damages caused to the network infrastructure (such as cables, ducts, manholes, masts, towers, in- building installations) is a cause of unwanted disruption of electronic communications services. In its  previous Annual Incident Reports1 (from 2011 to 2013), ENISA has identified cable cuts as one of the  most frequent causes of outage in public electronic communications networks or services in the EU.  Cable cuts can occur due to intentional human activities such as stealing of cables for metals, sabotage  act, terrorist attacks, etc. However, it should be pointed out that the majority of such incidents  happens unintentionally, as a result of human error (in most cases a third party is involved). Cable cuts  often occur during civil works due to the fact that excavators usually do not possess sufficient  information about the existing underground infrastructure and/or about the exact location of  underground assets in the area of civil works.  1.1 Scope of the document  Several Member States of the European Union (hereafter – MS) have launched initiatives to protect  their underground assets, in order to prevent any disruption due to civil works. These MS have  deployed information systems to facilitate timely exchange of information about the existing  underground infrastructure between underground infrastructure owners and excavators.  This study investigates a selection of existing initiatives across the European Union (EU). It analyses  experience and good practices of the MS that are using such a tool. The scope of this document is to  understand how deployment of an automated information system can protect underground  electronic communications infrastructure, and provide guidance accordingly.  This guide on Protection of Underground Electronic Communications Infrastructure is one of the  deliverables (Work Package 3.2 – Deliverable 1) foreseen in the ENISA Work Programme 2014 under  the Work Stream ‘Support cooperation”2. It provides an analysis of annual 2013 incident reports and  provides recommendations on addressing significant incidents linked to cable cuts.  1.2 Target audience  The main target audience of this document are Member States which would like to deploy an  automated information system to prevent damages due to civil work on the underground electronic  communication infrastructure.  The document is written for decision makers and public institutions in charge of defining  functionalities of such information systems and/or developing technical specifications (ex: NRAs,  ministries responsible for electronic communications…).  Moreover, this document may be of interest for the owners of underground electronic  communications assets, not limited to telecom providers (governmental, public and private  organizations may also possess underground cables). Civil work enterprises can also get an overview  on their role, as they should actively contribute to the protection of the underground infrastructure.  1 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports  2  ENISA Work Programme 2014, http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/work- programme-2014, in particular, pp. 43-44  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/work-programme-2014 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/work-programme-2014  Protection of Underground Electronic Communications Infrastructure  The use of automated information system for damage prevention against civil work  December 2014  Page 2  1.3 Methodology  The primary sources of information for this document are desktop research activities and interviews  with experts from MS that already have, or are planning to have in the near future, an information  system for underground infrastructure damage prevention (Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Netherlands,  Sweden). For that purpose, the study uses the questionnaire presented in Annex A.  In order to consolidate findings, additional interviews have been carried out with experts from MS  organizations operating electronic broadband infrastructure mapping projects and with experts in  infrastructure mapping and cable protection from four MS institutions (Belgium, Denmark,  Netherlands, Sweden) operating such systems and from relevant legal acts of Member States (cf.  References).  The methodology aims at understanding how such an automated information system can help in  protecting underground infrastructure. For that purpose, the answers from the interviews have been  compiled under different topics in order to understand the choices made in existing tools. For each  topic, the reasons behind these choices are analysed. The characteristics shared by existing tools and  their differences are also highlighted. The interviews also provide an overview on current challenges  and future evolutions, from the perspective of the entity managing the tool.  1.4 EU Policy  Article 13a, from Directive 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council3 on a common  regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services as amended by Directive  2009/140/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council4, requires that “Member States shall  ensure that undertakings providing public communications networks or publicly available electronic  communications services take appropriate technical and organisational measures to appropriately  manage the risks posed to security of networks and services […] and […] take all appropriate steps to  guarantee the integrity of their networks, and thus ensure the continuity of supply of services  provided over those networks”. Thus, the provisions of Article 13a of Framework Directive are fully  applicable to protect the underground infrastructure of electronic communications networks. For that  purpose, the use of an automated information system to protect underground infrastructure can be  considered as a measure to fulfil the requirements of Article 13a of Framework Directive.  The second EU legislative act in relation with the subject investigated in this document is Directive  2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council5 establishing an Infrastructure for Spatial  Information in the European Community (INSPIRE6). The aim of the INSPIRE Directive is to create a  spatial data infrastructure to support EU environmental policies and policies or activities which may  have an impact on the environment. The goal is to help make spatial or geographical information more  accessible and interoperable for a wide range of purposes supporting sustainable development.  The INSPIRE Directive establishes rules and conditions related to the creation of infrastructures for  spatial information operated by the Member States for collecting, storing, accessing and sharing  spatial information in a digitalized format. Spatial data of utility facilities are under the scope of the  INSPIRE Directive; sewage, waste management, energy supply and water supply are clearly listed in  Annex III of the INSPIRE Directive. Though it was proposed to include electronic communications  3 http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/140framework_5.pdf  4 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:337:0037:0069:EN:PDF  5 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L:2007:108:FULL&from=EN  6 http://inspire.ec.europa.eu  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:337:0037:0069:EN:PDF http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L:2007:108:FULL&from=EN http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/  Protection of Underground Electronic Communications Infrastructure  The use of automated information system for damage prevention against civil work  December 2014  Page 3  infrastructures into the INSPIRE Directive, at this moment, it is out of this legislation: the majority of  Member States do not apply the INSPIRE provisions to map electronic communication infrastructure.  However, the INSPIRE Directive includes useful aspects concerning data collection and publication. A  few MS are thinking about integrating these aspects into their projects for underground electronic  communication infrastructure protection. For instance, the Belgium Flemish Region’s information  system for underground infrastructure protection will utilize INSPIRE provisions regarding  underground infrastructure spatial data presentation.  1.5 Outline of the document  The structure of the document is as follows:  Chapter 2 details the existing initiatives in the EU and analyses them from several point of view:  development and management, technical implementation, operational usage of the tool, financing,  and security aspects linked to the misuse of information about underground infrastructure.  Chapter 3 analyses the survey. It focuses on the advantages of the tools, the main results withdrawn  from the survey and explores possible improvements and future developments.  Chapter 4 proposes a list of recommendations toward Member States who are considering the  deployment of an automated information exchange to protect their underground electronic  communication infrastructure, and for stakeholders interested in such tool (infrastructure owners,  civil workers…).  Chapter 5 concludes.  Protection of Underground Electronic Communications Infrastructure  The use of automated information system for damage prevention against civil work  December 2014  Page 4  2 Overview of existing initiatives  All MSs regulate civil works by relevant rules/legal acts in order to protect public interests and  individual rights, such as environment and ground resource protection, existing property protection,  etc. Any entity intending to perform the civil works on/under the soil should follow these rules.  In most cases these rules require obtaining relevant permissions which are usually granted by public  authorities and/or private entities possessing the land and/ or infrastructure on/under/above the land  where civil works will take place. These rules are often laid down in several legal acts and in order to  be authorized to perform civil works in a certain land area, the entity should apply to several public  authorities and private entities for the relevant permissions. For example, owners of underwater  cables are required to declare the location of their cable if they pose a risk to shipping.  This process is often time-consuming, since it is required to collect all the relevant information from  land/infrastructure owners, as well as the information about all applicable terms, conditions and  restrictions, which delays civil works. Any measure facilitating the receipt of timely and reliable  information about underground infrastructures should reduce the delays of civil works and  administrative burden.  Thus, for these purposes some MS have established “one-stop” application procedures to issue all the  permissions and provide all the related information (e.g. terms, conditions and restrictions) for civil  works. Desktop research revealed that several MSs implement automated information systems whose  primary purpose is underground infrastructure protection.

Yet, they can act as an enabler toward the development of a tool for the protection of  underground eCom infrastructure.  Table 1 may not be exhaustive, due to a lack of publicly available information on the subject.  Moreover, several initiatives may currently be under development in Member States not referenced  in this document. Thus, the reader is encouraged to communicate to ENISA information about systems  and initiatives not covered in this document.  2.1 Development and management  Interviews revealed that currently operating automated information systems in MS for underground  infrastructures protection (hereafter – information systems) are managed by public institutions,  though a few respondents indicated that, before launching these information systems, there existed  private sector initiatives (systems) for sharing information held by infrastructures owners about  underground infrastructures. Respondents also mentioned that those private sector initiatives based  on information systems operated quite well, but, as a second step to improve underground  infrastructures protection, MS established new systems operated by public institutions.  These systems were launched at about the same time in all interviewed MS – in the second half of the  first decade of the 21st century (ranging from 2005 to 2009). This is probably due to the fact that by  that time MS already had finished digitalisation of their maps and the availability of digital maps were  the prerequisite for the development of information systems intended for excavators and  underground infrastructures owners. Indeed, all respondents highlighted that a Land Registry digital  map is a core element of their systems (national cadastre offices possess national digital maps, that  can be obtained for a fee).  Information systems have been operated by various types of public institutions:   By the national cadastre offices for one respondent (Netherlands),   By an agency responsible for the development of the Geographical Data Infrastructure, that  realizes solutions for other government agencies, businesses and citizens, for one respondant  (Belgium),   By the electronic communications NRA for one respondent (Sweden),   By a ministry not responsible for electronic communications for one respondent (Denmark).  Three of the four interviewees responded that their systems had been established and operated  following dedicated legislative acts, which also defined their institutional tasks and responsibilities  concerning the management of those systems (DK, BE, NL). One of the four respondents pointed out  that the information system had been launched and operated not subject to any legal act (SE). That  project initially was driven by the general objective to strengthen critical infrastructure protection; for  that purpose, the interviewee highlights their very important decision to launch an early and broad  call for all stakeholders to get involved.  Table 2 compares the advantages of the structure and the challenges to overcome depending on the  type of organization managing the system.  13 http://www.broadbandmapping.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014-03-24_Broadband-mapping-study-draft- final_report_v01.pdf  http://www.broadbandmapping.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014-03-24_Broadband-mapping-study-draft-final_report_v01.pdf http://www.broadbandmapping.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014-03-24_Broadband-mapping-study-draft-final_report_v01.pdf  Protection of Underground Electronic Communications Infrastructure  The use of automated information system for damage prevention against civil work  December 2014  Page 6  Done in...

All MSs investigated have launched web-based portals which provide a single application for the  receipt of all the relevant information and permissions for civil works. These different applications  share common functionalities:   Infrastructure owners can declare their underground assets and contact information through  the Internet. They can be informed of planned civil work in areas where they declared  underground assets.   Excavator accesses system via Internet, registers with it providing contact information, and,  using graphical interface tools, draws on a digital map the area where he intends to perform  excavation or other kind of ground works.  Figure 1 presents the web interface used by a) KLIP (BE) and b), c) Ledningskollen (SE) . Such an  interface is usually very intuitive in order to facilitate the usage of the tool by non-expert users. In  Ledningskollen, users can choose between two views: orthophoto or cadastral map. During the  interview, it was explained that users prefer the orthophoto view, which makes it easier to distinguish  landmarks.

Due to the complexities of such systems, every tool investigated runs several different software  programmes. Indeed, such a system consists of a web-based portal containing graphic data (digital  map), a database of underground infrastructure owners, user access interfaces, user authentication…  Respondents pointed out that they utilized several kinds of software: commercial, open source, home  made. Graphical data formats vary as well. Some information systems utilize raster graphical  presentation method, whereas others employ vector methods.  The survey highlights several constraints to consider before and during the deployment of the tool:   Respondents indicate that it is important to agree among all stakeholders on information  system functionalities and data formats to provide to and retrieve from the information  system.   All respondents pointed out the importance of the system to be user-friendly. To achieve this,  all owners continuously upgrade their systems, implement new functionalities which save end  user's time, provide a more clear information, enable access for devices with all kinds of  operational systems, including mobile devices.   All respondents highlighted that final decisions on data formats and other terms and  conditions of provision of information about underground infrastructures to information  system was done after intensive consultations with all stakeholders (programmers, system  owners, underground infrastructure owners, excavators, public organizations and  institutions).   In order to minimize manual work required to upload/download to/from information systems,  institutions operating these systems have been developing/upgrading application  programming interfaces (APIs). For example, underground infrastructure owners, utilizing  Protection of Underground Electronic Communications Infrastructure  The use of automated information system for damage prevention against civil work  December 2014  Page 8  APIs, connect their Geographical Information System (GIS) to information system for  underground infrastructure protection which allows to automatically update information  system database with the updated data from the GIS of infrastructure owner or enables to  generate fully automatically responses to excavators requests to provide information.  2.3 Operational usage of the tool  2.3.1 Purpose of the tool  Considering that automated information systems are currently the most advanced systems which  significantly contribute to underground infrastructure damage protection, this chapter overviews the  examples of such systems already operating in a few MSs. In the investigated cases, the demand for  such systems were put forward by various stakeholders including underground infrastructure owners,  excavators, governmental institutions, and municipalities.  It should be noted that interviewed respondents confirmed that their owned automated information  systems had been developed for the primary purpose of reduction of the number of underground  infrastructures damages. Their systems cover all kinds of underground assets: utility facilities such as  sewage, waste management, energy supply, water supply and electronic communications  infrastructures such as cables, pipes, ducts, and manholes.  Hence, such tools provide an automatic way to identifiy owners of underground infrastructure in areas  of planned civil work and protect underground infrastructure by providing:   To the excavator: the list of infrastructure owners with underground assets in areas of planned  civil works.   To underground infrastructure owners: notifications of planned civil work in areas where they  possess underground infrastructure.  2.3.2 For underground infrastructure owners  As mentioned above, digital maps with databases, which contain information about underground  infrastructure and their owners (including contact information) are key elements in the currently  operating information systems dedicated for underground infrastructure damage prevention.  In most cases, legislative acts oblige infrastructure owners to provide data about their underground  assets to information systems. Legal acts describe who, what, when and how this should be provided:   According to some MS legislations, every private or public organization that possesses  underground cables and pipes has to provide the information about areas with cables and  pipes (BE, NL).   A respondent from one MS indicated that the provision of information about underground  infrastructure to information system is obligatory only for legal entities.   In certain cases, privately-owned last mile lines placed in a private land are excluded from the  scope of legislation (DK).   Legal acts also provide other exclusions, for example, military and police underground assets  are out of scope of legal acts (DK, BE).  On the other hand, one interviewed MS uses a voluntary approach for infrastructure owners to join  the information system and finds this approach successful (at this moment more than 600  underground infrastructure owners have joined the system. It was also noticed that more than 100  new owners join the system each year)(SE). However, the respondent pointed out that there are a lot  of small infrastructure owners that still have not joined Ledningskollen due to several possible reasons.  One reason could be that such infrastructure owner only possess a small amount of underground fibre  Protection of Underground Electronic Communications Infrastructure  The use of automated information system for damage prevention against civil work  December 2014  Page 9  optic in rural areas, and therefore think that they can notice and have control of everyone trying to  dig in the area.  a) LER (DK) b) Ledningskollen (SE)  Figure 2 – Declaration of underground assets by the infrastructure owner  Figure 2 presents the interface of a) LER (DK) and b) Ledningskollen (SE), used by infrastructure owners  to declare their underground assets in a pre-defined geographical area. Information stored by the  system include the geographical area and the details of the contact person for this area.  2.3.3 For civil workers  Employing these systems, excavators have the possibility to send requests via the Internet to obtain  information about the existing underground infrastructure in the area of the planned civil works,  including information about its owners. Excavators define the area of planned civil works on a map  and the system performs the following actions:   The systems automatically identify underground infrastructure and its owners within the area  demarcated for planned civil work   Excavators receive the information about underground infrastructure locations.  o In some cases, this information is directly available in digital maps via the same  information systems.  o In other cases, excavator and infrastructure owners establish a direct contact to  protect underground assets, either by exchanging maps or via other mean (for  example, by requesting infrastructure owners to participate in excavation works in  order to show or mark their underground infrastructure on site).   Excavators also receive (via the Internet) a permission to perform civil works together with all  relevant information and restrictions, including information and restrictions regarding the  protection of existing underground infrastructure. Such permission can be transmitted either  directly by the system or by the land owner after evaluation of the requirements.  In three of the four MS studied, excavators are obliged by legal acts to submit requests to information  systems before starting excavation. In one MS, excavators voluntary use the information system. Civil  work projects request for a permission to dig by attaching the required information and documents  within a period defined by law (when applicable).  When voluntary, excavators have an incentive to use the system to demonstrate insurances that they  have taken all precautions to avoid cable cuts. For example in Sweden, insurance companies are aware  of Ledningskollen. The respondent incitates insurance companies to ask if excavators have used the  tool before digging, when handling a claim. The interview showed that some insurance companies  already do it.

Since this operator possess cables in the whole  country, it amplifies the need to use Ledningskollen.  In both cases, excavators enjoy benefits of having a single point to contact underground infrastructure  owners and intensively use these information systems. For example, in 2013 there were more than  200 000 requests in BE Flemish Region, 115 000 excavators requests in DK, 520 000 request in NL,  135 000 requests in SE.  Figure 3 presents the interface of a) LER (DK), b) Ledningskollen (SE) and c) KLIP (BE) used by excavators  to declare their civil works in a pre-defined geographical area. For that purpose, excavators can draw  the geographical area of their planned digging directly in the tool, as presented in Figure 3 a). The  system returns a list of infrastructure owners with declared underground assets in the area, as  depicted in Figure 3 b) and c).  2.3.4 Process of data exchange  The entire process of data exchange is not always fully automated. In some MS, the excavator needs  to contact the infrastructure owners identified by the tool in order to request information.  Indeed, three of four interviewed respondents pointed out that underground infrastructure owners  provided detailed information about existing underground infrastructures directly to the excavator,  without using the information system, as presented in Figure 4.  One respondent indicated that, for every single excavator’s inquiry, their system (NL) automatically  collects digital data about underground infrastructures in the requested area, draws the exact  underground infrastructure locations on a digital (topographic) map, and stores this file in its memory  until excavator retrieves it. This process is presented in Figure 5.  Protection of Underground Electronic Communications Infrastructure  The use of automated information system for damage prevention against civil work  December 2014  Page 11  As a result, in most cases the file with information about underground infrastructure in the area of  interest of the excavator can be promptly retrieved (in average, within 1 hour). Future developments  aim at optimizing this process by allowing infrastructure owners to automatically provide detailed  information about their assets directly from their GIS system.  Figure 4 – Process of information exchange: case when infrastructure owners provide information directly to excavator  Figure 5 – Process of information exchange: case when information system provides digital maps to excavator  2.3.5 Timeline of declaration  The maximum period of time within which infrastructure owners should provide detailed information  on their underground assets is defined by legislative acts or, in the case of a voluntary system, set by  the infrastructure owners individually. This maximum period is determined so that infrastructure  owner can provide accurate data without impeding the planning of a civil work project. In existing  approaches, it varies between a few days (5 to 10) to a few weeks. For example, this limit is set to 15  Database of underground  infrastructure and its owners  Digital  maps  Information  system  Information system for underground  infrastructure protection (IS)  Infrastructure owner A  Infrastructure owner B  Infrastructure owner C  1.

Nevertheless, all respondents indicated that in the majority of cases, infrastructure  owners respond to the excavator within a significantly shorter period of time (mainly within one day).  All respondents indicated that they used measures to ensure that their systems background digital  maps and databases with information about existing underground infrastructures were timely  updated. They indicated that an annual update of background digital maps was sufficient, but  information about a newly built underground infrastructure or a change of infrastructure owner, or  changes in the owner’s contact details should reach systems databases without delay in order to  ensure that excavators obtain correct information. Infrastructure owners which have their own GIS  systems manage to perform these updates automatically. One MS legal act obliges to provide such  updated information within 14 days (DK).  Figure 6 details the timeline of this declaration process. Particular attention must be given to any  change operated by the infrastructure owner in the period between the information exchange and  the actual civil work (new assets, new declaration…). Indeed, only accurate and reliable data can  protect underground infrastructure.  Figure 6 – Timeline of the declaration process  2.3.6 User support  All respondents mentioned that user support means had been implemented in their information  systems:   All institutions interviewed handle user support via e-mail.   Some provide on-line available manuals, wizards, tutorials on how to use their  systems(including films hosted on public video sharing platforms).   Some institutions have telephone inquiry services with dedicated personnel in order to  provide information to excavators and infrastructures owners how to use of their information  systems. Moreover, some institutions may limit their support via telephone by calling back  users who contacted their support via e-mail or another mean (SE).  2.4 Financing  Development of three information systems were financed by governments (in the case when those  information systems were defined by legal acts). One information system was financed by public  institutions (electronic communication NRA, Transport Administration, and the National grid).  All respondents of institutions which already had operational information system indicated that they  did not apply for EU funding for their system development, but one MS institution intending to  develop such a system pointed out that it had recently applied for the support from EU structural  funds (EE).  Interviews revealed that models of defrayment of operational expenses of information system could  be divided into two types. In one case operational expenses of the information system are covered by  excavators by charging them for utilizing this system. In the second case these expenses are covered  by governments.  Infrastructure owner  declares its underground  assets  Excavator submits a  declaration of civil work  Process of information exchange  Civil work takes place  Information must  remain accurate  Infrastructure owner can  update declared assets  Protection of Underground Electronic Communications Infrastructure  The use of automated information system for damage prevention against civil work  December 2014  Page 13  Moreover, institutions, which operate information systems and which charge fees to excavators, use  different fee calculation approaches. One approach is to impose a fixed fee for every single inquiry to  the information system. The other approach is to charge a fee depending on the area requested for  information about underground infrastructure. In this case excavator pays fixed tariff for every square  meter of the area which he requests information about.  Table 3 compares the advantages and challenges to overcome for the financing schemes covering  operational expenses in Member States with existing tools.  Usage Advantages Challenges to overcome  Free 2 MS  Good incentive to use the  system   Requires funding from one  or several entities to  guarantee the operation (ex:  government…)  Price depending on  the surface area of the  digging  1 MS  Possibility to propose a fair  price adapted to the type of  digging   Possibility of a self-financed  system   Possible loss of revenue  when “gaming the system”:  excavators request only  maps for the start and the  end of their digging   Potential risk for security if  excavators interpolate cable  path when “gaming”   Requires additional security  for payment processing  Fixed price per  request  1 MS  Possibility of a self-financed  system   Price not linked to the size of  digging: “gaming” is difficult   Requires a certain amount of  users   Requires additional security  for payment processing  Mix of different  financing schemes  Not  investigated in  the interviews   Possibility to mix several  types of financing schemes  or to adapt the price  depending on the request  (size of the enterprise, area  of digging, number of  requests per year…)   Potential possibility to  exploit the system to use the  cheapest scheme   Some information may not  be available in certain  schemes  Table 3 – Comparison of the different financing schemes used to support operation of the system  2.5 Security measures to minimize risks of misuse of information about  underground infrastructure  All respondents pointed out that information about underground infrastructure is sensitive in terms  of confidentiality (public security or business secrets). Particularly, access to precise data with its exact  location and information about its infrastructure owners, need to remain private for infrastructure  owners. Thus special measures were implemented in their information systems in order to avoid their  use for malicious purposes (such as business espionage, sabotage acts, terror attacks).  2.5.1 Authentication and access control  All respondents indicated that one of such measures utilized in their systems was admission control:   Any system user has to be authenticated to declare their assets. The request for information  may also require authentication (this is the case in all cases investigated).  Protection of Underground Electronic Communications Infrastructure  The use of automated information system for damage prevention against civil work  December 2014  Page 14   Access to the information system is organized in different ways. Some systems require user’s  registration and provides user’s account with password, others use a public security system  with certificates.   Users register themselves for a specific user profile (asset owner, civil worker…). Access to  functionalities is granted according to the rules defined in system.   Through access control rules, the system adapts its interface and functionalities to the role of  the user (underground infrastructure owner or requester…).  2.5.2 Granularity of information  All respondents also highlighted a second security measure to limit the granularity of information  stored. Namely, their information systems contain only approximate locations of underground  infrastructure and contact details of underground infrastructure owners to ensure confidentiality:   The requesters obtain only limited information about the underground infrastructure and its  owner in the area of digging. Infrastructure owners have the information about the exact  locations of their underground assets in their GIS or, for example, paper maps.   Infrastructure owners receive a request from the information system to provide information  about their assets in a particular territory to an identified requester. They may disclose  information only under agreed terms and conditions. Thus, even in case of a leak of  information from information system, the exact locations of underground infrastructure shall  remain private.  In the case of the fully automated system investigated, the information system stores files with the  exact locations of underground infrastructure until the excavator retrieves it. The maximum storage  period of this file is limited (here, 20 working days). When this period expires, the files are  automatically deleted from the system’s memory.  2.5.3 Other security measures  Finally, respondents pointed out that special attention was paid to IT security during their information  system development (programing), use and maintenance phases in order to minimize security  breaches.  2.6 Summary of usage for four existing tools  Table 4 summarizes the responses at the interviews related to the usage of four tools: KLIC (NL), KLIP  (BE), Ledningskollen (SE) and LER (DK). This table does not compare the solutions from a qualitative  point of view, since every approach is adapted to the particularities of a Member States and the needs  of stakeholders.  Members States that wish to deploy such tool may rely on this table to investigate these existing tools.  The goal is to help them understand and validate functionalities and usages of a possible future  system.

However, they did not collect quantitative  data to support their statements, since baseline situations had not been recorded and methodologies  to make a quantitative evaluation of the project success had not been developed.  Nevertheless, the respondents indicated that their information systems for underground  infrastructure protection were recognized by stakeholders as successful initiatives. The following  advantages of such national initiatives were identified:   Those projects consolidated efforts of all stakeholders: public institutions, underground  infrastructure owners, and excavators to achieve common objectives to reduce unintentional  damages of underground infrastructures during civil works.   A properly functioning, single, state-wide information system provides excavators with an  easy and quick access to information required to prevent underground infrastructure  damages during civil works.   Common rules and procedures (whether defined by legal acts or based on agreements among  stakeholders) ensure certainty for all subjects playing different roles in these initiatives.  Infrastructure owners are aware of whom, what, and when they need to provide information  about their assets. Excavators know when, how, and to whom they have to apply for  information about underground infrastructures and from whom, how, when they can obtain  it.   Graphical representation of underground infrastructures on digital maps in a user-friendly,  easy-to-understand form ensures that even non-professional excavators realise where exactly  this infrastructure is located in its civil works polygon.   APIs for connection of underground infrastructure owners and GIS with information systems  enabled automated provision of information about underground assets to the system which  minimized infrastructure owners' efforts and also decreased the time period to obtain this  information for excavators.  3.2 Main findings of the survey  Finding 1: Importance of civil work in cable cuts  Unintentional damages of underground electronic infrastructures during excavation works is one of  the most frequent causes of disruptions in public electronic communications networks or services  within EU MS. Such events can cause negative impact on several vital sectors of the society.  Finding 2: Cable cuts are often linked to the lack of information  The main reason for unintentional damages of underground infrastructure is that excavators do not  have any information about underground infrastructure in its excavation polygon, or this information  is not sufficient enough.  Finding 3: Automated information exchange can be benefical to all stakeholders  A common platform for exchange of information about the existing underground infrastructure  between its owners and excavators decreases civil work delays and also helps to prevent underground  infrastructure from damages during civil works.  Protection of Underground Electronic Communications Infrastructure  The use of automated information system for damage prevention against civil work  December 2014  Page 17  Finding 4: Existing automated information exchange systems help in preventing cable cuts  Information systems already implemented in several EU MS for automated exchange of information  about the existing underground infrastructure between its owners and excavators currently is the  most advanced means which significantly contribute to the underground infrastructure damage  protection.  Finding 5: Existing automated information exchange systems share similarities  Despite the fact that MS which had information systems applied different approaches for their system  development and operation (different financing models, obligatory or voluntary use, legal basis or  voluntary initiative,…), general architectures and operation principles of their developed information  systems were very similar.  Finding 6: Automated information exchange systems rely on digital maps  Digital maps with database which contain information about underground infrastructure and their  owners are key elements in the currently operating information systems.  Finding 7: Direct integration into the stakeholders’ own information system has benefits  APIs for automated information exchange between infrastructure owners GIS and information system  for underground infrastructures protection decrease the owners burden and reduce information  retrieval times for excavators. APIs can lead to advanced functionalities, such as automatic answers.  Finding 8: Confidentiality is important to consider before sharing information  Information about underground infrastructure is sensitive in terms of public security or business  secrets. Security measures should be implemented in information systems containing such sensitive  information in order to avoid their use for malicious purposes.  Finding 9: International collaboration is needed to protect cross-border cables  Protection of underground/underwater cross-border cables is still an open issue. Stronger  international collaboration is needed to investigate and to define common measures to protect these  assets.  3.3 Possible improvements and future developments  Answering the questions about what could be improved in their systems, respondents highlighted the  following issues.  3.3.1 Reduce the time for information exchange  The time for the excavator to collect information from all infrastructure owners in their area of digging  is still too long. This could be improved by further automating the system, implementing new  functionalities which facilitate information exchange between underground infrastructure owners  and excavators.  3.3.2 Expand the usage of the tool  Small infrastructure owners are reluctant to join information systems. Their major arguments are that  information systems are sophisticated, they do not have digitalized geo-referenced information of  their assets, and too much effort is needed to provide information.  Protection of Underground Electronic Communications Infrastructure  The use of automated information system for damage prevention against civil work  December 2014  Page 18  A few solutions have been discussed and are already implemented by some respondents:   The simplification of the tool for non-technical users.   Awareness raising and training for small cable owners and excavators.   Live support, preferably through telephone, for users who remain unfamiliar with computer  systems and/or with the declaration process.  3.3.3 Improve information exchange  Current systems operate employing raster geodata (representation) format in digital maps. Two  information system owners wish to upgrade them into vector geodata format maps considering that  this geodata format are best suited for direct data processing or aggregation.  Moreover, the majority of respondents have expressed the necessity to define common data models  to guarantee the quality of information.  3.3.4 Facilitate international collaboration  Regarding underground/underwater cross-border cables, all respondents pointed out that only part  of these assets which were within their states territories had been registered in their information  systems. They also indicated that, for the time being, there was no strong collaboration and exchange  of information between neighbouring countries about such infrastructures. Every state takes  responsibility of the protection of underground/underwater cross-border cables which are laid down  in its territory.  Finally all respondents expressed their good will to share their knowledge regarding development and  managing of information systems for underground infrastructure protection. They also indicated their  willingness to participate to an EU-wide initiative for underground infrastructure protection.  Protection of Underground Electronic Communications Infrastructure  The use of automated information system for damage prevention against civil work  December 2014  Page 19  4 Recommendations  Taking into account the findings of this study, several recommendations are proposed for MS which  are considering the implementation of measures to protect underground electronic communications  infrastructure from damages.  Recommendation 1: MS should analyse the reasons behind cable cuts  Before implementing measures to protect underground electronic communications infrastructure  from damages, MS should perform a baseline situation analysis identifying major reasons of  underground infrastructure damages.  In this assessment, MS should identify stakeholders affected by damages and evaluate their interest  to tackle this problem. This first analysis can be followed through time by performing quantitative  calculations of all involved stakeholders loses due to underground infrastructure damages.  Recommendation 2: MS should evaluate the benefits of an automated information exchange tool  to protect underground infrastructure  MS should perform a cost/benefit analysis for the projects for underground infrastructure protection.  This analysis can be backed up by the inputs from the involved stakeholders: underground  infrastructure owners, civil workers, and their electronic communication national regulatory agency,  which collects major incident due to cable cuts.  Recommendation 3: MS developing an automated information exchange tool should rely on existing  tools and experience  MS developing such information system are encouraged to contact entities responsible for the  development and management of such tool in other MS, in order to exchange and share experience.  MS should consider the principles, outcomes and results of tools already implemented in other MS.  This should facilitate the development of a solution adapted to their needs, according to their  particular structure and conditions applicable inside their territory.  Moreover, MS can also mitigate their effort by integrating this automated information exchange tool  directly in their effort to deploy INSPIRE Directive.  Recommendation 4: MS shall encourage collaboration between all stakeholders to define the  principles of the automated information exchange tool to protect underground assets  MS should encourage all stakeholders, i.e. relevant public institutions, underground infrastructure  owners, and excavators, to collaborate in order to define the principles of the automated information  exchange tool in order to protect underground assets.  Technical and organizational details of information systems should be defined during public  discussions with all relevant stakeholders, taking into account their needs as well as the national  specificity regarding underground infrastructures and civil work in the MS. It is recommended that  information system architectures and functionalities are similar to the described above information  systems, which are already implemented in a few MS.  Referring to the experience of MSs already managing such projects, we recommend not to limit the  project scope by underground electronic communications infrastructure protection. Other utilities of  infrastructure should be included since these underground infrastructures are equally affected by  unintentional damages during excavation works and it is obvious that all parties are interested to have  a single system.  Protection of Underground Electronic Communications Infrastructure  The use of automated information system for damage prevention against civil work  December 2014  Page 20  Recommendation 5: MS should promote the use of their automated information exchange tool to  protect their underground infrastructure  The project of information system development for the automated exchange of information between  underground infrastructure owners and excavators should be recommended as an effective measure  for underground infrastructure protection since such projects implemented in a few MS are  considered as successful.  Recommendation 6: MS and the involved stakeholders should evaluate the security policy for  operating and managing their automated information exchange tool  It is recommended that MS developing such tools integrate security aspects covering the operation of  the tool (for the declaration of assets and the map requests by excavators) and its management (for  the data storage and processing).  MS should define and adapt the security policy of the tool with respect to:   The operational requirements set by the stakeholders, such as infrastructure owners  (example: ensure the confidentiality of assets) and excavators (example: reliability of data).   The management of the tool such (for example: security of stored information).  Stakeholders can also develop their own internal security policies. For example, infrastructure owners  can validate the legitimacy of a request before disclosing information.  Recommendation 7: MS should evaluate the sustainability of their automated information  exchange tool  MS are recommended to evaluate the sustainability of their automated exchange tool in order to  understand its usages, its adoption by stakeholders and the results on the protection of underground  electronic communication assets. For that purpose, MS have several possibilities, such as deploying  an information exchange platform performing surveys, analysing incident reports on cable cuts…  Respondents emphasize the need to perform an evaluation at the beginning of the project and after  its deployment.  The evaluation of the sustainability shall permit MS to adapt the tool to fit the (evolving) needs of  their stakeholders. For example, it can include the development of new functionalities such as APIs to  facilitate external integration.  Protection of Underground Electronic Communications Infrastructure  The use of automated information system for damage prevention against civil work  December 2014  Page 21  5 Conclusions  This document investigates several MS initiatives for underground infrastructure (including electronic  communications infrastructures) protection. The results show that the operation of a single  automated information system for the exchange of information can prevent underground assets from  unintentional damages during civil works.  One main finding is that confidentiality is a main concern for infrastructure owners. For this reason,  the automated information exchange tool takes the form of a directory which provides excavators  with the contact information of underground asset owners in their area of digging.  Hence, these tools are likely to differ from existing infrastructure mapping tools, which may store  precise information regarding underground assets (position, type…). Yet, such infrastructure mapping  projects can still represent an enabler to protect underground electronic communication cables from  outages due to civil work.  The investigations revealed that, despite the fact that the initiatives investigated in this document  include different technical and organizational details, they share the following similarities:  1. Infrastructure owners declare their contact information for the geographical areas where the  possess underground assets.  2. Excavators declare their intention of digging in a defined geographical area.  3. The automated information exchange system acts as a liaison between the infrastructure  owners and the requester.  4. Excavators receive the maps showing the underground assets present in the area where they  intend to dig.  Finally, the usage of automatic information exchange tools proves to be a valuable tool to protect  underground electronic communication infrastructure against outages due to civil works.

The majority of these cables are usually laid  underground, for esthetic reasons and to improve their security.  In the last years, ENISA has noticed a large amount of Internet outages due to cable cuts. The source  cause can be linked either to malicious actions or to accidental (unvoluntary) events. Thus, a fair  amount of unvoluntary disruption can be attributed to underground excavation performed during a  civil work, due to a lack of information regarding the presence of underground cables at the dig site.  Certain Member States (MS) of the European Union – namely Belgium, Denmark, France, Netherlands,  Sweden, and the United Kingdom – have developed specific tools to prevent the disruption of  underground electronic communication infrastructure. These tools, whose use can be either  mandatory or voluntary, foster the collaboration between infrastructure owners and excavators:  infrastructure owners can declare their underground assets and share the information with the  excavator before any planned civil work.  This document analyses existing initiatives deployed by selected MS. Information collected through a  survey is analysed to understand the choices made for the development and management of such  tools, the technical implementation, the operational usage of the tool, its financing, and security  aspects linked to the misuse of information. In particular, confidentiality is a key parameter that need  to be tackled before launching any new initiative.  The document then explores the advantages of an automated information exchange tool in the  protection of underground infrastructure. It summarizes the principle results found during the survey  and explores possible improvement and future developments.  This document aims to provide recommendations to Member States (MS) that wish to protect their  underground electronic communications infrastructure against disruption due to civil works. This  document shall help MS to assess their need to deploy an automated information system for damage  prevention, and eventually assist them in the development of such tool through the following  recommendations:   MS should analyse the reasons behind cable cuts   MS should evaluate the benefits of an automated information exchange tool to protect  underground infrastructure   MS developing an automated information exchange tool should rely on existing tools and  experience   All stakeholders need to collaborate to define the principles of the automated information  exchange tool to protect underground assets   MS should promote the use of their automated information exchange tool to protect their  underground infrastructure   MS should evaluate the security policy for operating and managing their automated  information exchange tool   MS should evaluate the sustainability of their automated information exchange tool  Finally, this document emphasizes how automatic information exchange tools are a valuable tool to  protect underground electronic communication infrastructure against outages due to digging.

Network access can be vital for the proper operation of services of high importance.  For example, access to emergency services, energy, utility SCADA network…  Damages caused to the network infrastructure (such as cables, ducts, manholes, masts, towers, in- building installations) is a cause of unwanted disruption of electronic communications services. In its  previous Annual Incident Reports1 (from 2011 to 2013), ENISA has identified cable cuts as one of the  most frequent causes of outage in public electronic communications networks or services in the EU.  Cable cuts can occur due to intentional human activities such as stealing of cables for metals, sabotage  act, terrorist attacks, etc. However, it should be pointed out that the majority of such incidents  happens unintentionally, as a result of human error (in most cases a third party is involved). Cable cuts  often occur during civil works due to the fact that excavators usually do not possess sufficient  information about the existing underground infrastructure and/or about the exact location of  underground assets in the area of civil works.  1.1 Scope of the document  Several Member States of the European Union (hereafter – MS) have launched initiatives to protect  their underground assets, in order to prevent any disruption due to civil works. These MS have  deployed information systems to facilitate timely exchange of information about the existing  underground infrastructure between underground infrastructure owners and excavators.  This study investigates a selection of existing initiatives across the European Union (EU). It analyses  experience and good practices of the MS that are using such a tool. The scope of this document is to  understand how deployment of an automated information system can protect underground  electronic communications infrastructure, and provide guidance accordingly.  This guide on Protection of Underground Electronic Communications Infrastructure is one of the  deliverables (Work Package 3.2 – Deliverable 1) foreseen in the ENISA Work Programme 2014 under  the Work Stream ‘Support cooperation”2. It provides an analysis of annual 2013 incident reports and  provides recommendations on addressing significant incidents linked to cable cuts.  1.2 Target audience  The main target audience of this document are Member States which would like to deploy an  automated information system to prevent damages due to civil work on the underground electronic  communication infrastructure.  The document is written for decision makers and public institutions in charge of defining  functionalities of such information systems and/or developing technical specifications (ex: NRAs,  ministries responsible for electronic communications…).  Moreover, this document may be of interest for the owners of underground electronic  communications assets, not limited to telecom providers (governmental, public and private  organizations may also possess underground cables). Civil work enterprises can also get an overview  on their role, as they should actively contribute to the protection of the underground infrastructure.  1 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports  2  ENISA Work Programme 2014, http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/work- programme-2014, in particular, pp. 43-44  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/work-programme-2014 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/work-programme-2014  Protection of Underground Electronic Communications Infrastructure  The use of automated information system for damage prevention against civil work  December 2014  Page 2  1.3 Methodology  The primary sources of information for this document are desktop research activities and interviews  with experts from MS that already have, or are planning to have in the near future, an information  system for underground infrastructure damage prevention (Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Netherlands,  Sweden). For that purpose, the study uses the questionnaire presented in Annex A.  In order to consolidate findings, additional interviews have been carried out with experts from MS  organizations operating electronic broadband infrastructure mapping projects and with experts in  infrastructure mapping and cable protection from four MS institutions (Belgium, Denmark,  Netherlands, Sweden) operating such systems and from relevant legal acts of Member States (cf.  References).  The methodology aims at understanding how such an automated information system can help in  protecting underground infrastructure. For that purpose, the answers from the interviews have been  compiled under different topics in order to understand the choices made in existing tools. For each  topic, the reasons behind these choices are analysed. The characteristics shared by existing tools and  their differences are also highlighted. The interviews also provide an overview on current challenges  and future evolutions, from the perspective of the entity managing the tool.  1.4 EU Policy  Article 13a, from Directive 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council3 on a common  regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services as amended by Directive  2009/140/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council4, requires that “Member States shall  ensure that undertakings providing public communications networks or publicly available electronic  communications services take appropriate technical and organisational measures to appropriately  manage the risks posed to security of networks and services […] and […] take all appropriate steps to  guarantee the integrity of their networks, and thus ensure the continuity of supply of services  provided over those networks”. Thus, the provisions of Article 13a of Framework Directive are fully  applicable to protect the underground infrastructure of electronic communications networks. For that  purpose, the use of an automated information system to protect underground infrastructure can be  considered as a measure to fulfil the requirements of Article 13a of Framework Directive.  The second EU legislative act in relation with the subject investigated in this document is Directive  2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council5 establishing an Infrastructure for Spatial  Information in the European Community (INSPIRE6). The aim of the INSPIRE Directive is to create a  spatial data infrastructure to support EU environmental policies and policies or activities which may  have an impact on the environment. The goal is to help make spatial or geographical information more  accessible and interoperable for a wide range of purposes supporting sustainable development.  The INSPIRE Directive establishes rules and conditions related to the creation of infrastructures for  spatial information operated by the Member States for collecting, storing, accessing and sharing  spatial information in a digitalized format. Spatial data of utility facilities are under the scope of the  INSPIRE Directive; sewage, waste management, energy supply and water supply are clearly listed in  Annex III of the INSPIRE Directive. Though it was proposed to include electronic communications  3 http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/140framework_5.pdf  4 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:337:0037:0069:EN:PDF  5 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L:2007:108:FULL&from=EN  6 http://inspire.ec.europa.eu  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:337:0037:0069:EN:PDF http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L:2007:108:FULL&from=EN http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/  Protection of Underground Electronic Communications Infrastructure  The use of automated information system for damage prevention against civil work  December 2014  Page 3  infrastructures into the INSPIRE Directive, at this moment, it is out of this legislation: the majority of  Member States do not apply the INSPIRE provisions to map electronic communication infrastructure.  However, the INSPIRE Directive includes useful aspects concerning data collection and publication. A  few MS are thinking about integrating these aspects into their projects for underground electronic  communication infrastructure protection. For instance, the Belgium Flemish Region’s information  system for underground infrastructure protection will utilize INSPIRE provisions regarding  underground infrastructure spatial data presentation.  1.5 Outline of the document  The structure of the document is as follows:  Chapter 2 details the existing initiatives in the EU and analyses them from several point of view:  development and management, technical implementation, operational usage of the tool, financing,  and security aspects linked to the misuse of information about underground infrastructure.  Chapter 3 analyses the survey. It focuses on the advantages of the tools, the main results withdrawn  from the survey and explores possible improvements and future developments.  Chapter 4 proposes a list of recommendations toward Member States who are considering the  deployment of an automated information exchange to protect their underground electronic  communication infrastructure, and for stakeholders interested in such tool (infrastructure owners,  civil workers…).  Chapter 5 concludes.  Protection of Underground Electronic Communications Infrastructure  The use of automated information system for damage prevention against civil work  December 2014  Page 4  2 Overview of existing initiatives  All MSs regulate civil works by relevant rules/legal acts in order to protect public interests and  individual rights, such as environment and ground resource protection, existing property protection,  etc. Any entity intending to perform the civil works on/under the soil should follow these rules.  In most cases these rules require obtaining relevant permissions which are usually granted by public  authorities and/or private entities possessing the land and/ or infrastructure on/under/above the land  where civil works will take place. These rules are often laid down in several legal acts and in order to  be authorized to perform civil works in a certain land area, the entity should apply to several public  authorities and private entities for the relevant permissions. For example, owners of underwater  cables are required to declare the location of their cable if they pose a risk to shipping.  This process is often time-consuming, since it is required to collect all the relevant information from  land/infrastructure owners, as well as the information about all applicable terms, conditions and  restrictions, which delays civil works. Any measure facilitating the receipt of timely and reliable  information about underground infrastructures should reduce the delays of civil works and  administrative burden.  Thus, for these purposes some MS have established “one-stop” application procedures to issue all the  permissions and provide all the related information (e.g. terms, conditions and restrictions) for civil  works. Desktop research revealed that several MSs implement automated information systems whose  primary purpose is underground infrastructure protection. Table 1 presents the name of the tool and  the entity managing the tool for the following MS: Belgium, Denmark, France, Netherlands, Sweden,  and the United Kingdom.

Yet, they can act as an enabler toward the development of a tool for the protection of  underground eCom infrastructure.  Table 1 may not be exhaustive, due to a lack of publicly available information on the subject.  Moreover, several initiatives may currently be under development in Member States not referenced  in this document. Thus, the reader is encouraged to communicate to ENISA information about systems  and initiatives not covered in this document.  2.1 Development and management  Interviews revealed that currently operating automated information systems in MS for underground  infrastructures protection (hereafter – information systems) are managed by public institutions,  though a few respondents indicated that, before launching these information systems, there existed  private sector initiatives (systems) for sharing information held by infrastructures owners about  underground infrastructures. Respondents also mentioned that those private sector initiatives based  on information systems operated quite well, but, as a second step to improve underground  infrastructures protection, MS established new systems operated by public institutions.  These systems were launched at about the same time in all interviewed MS – in the second half of the  first decade of the 21st century (ranging from 2005 to 2009). This is probably due to the fact that by  that time MS already had finished digitalisation of their maps and the availability of digital maps were  the prerequisite for the development of information systems intended for excavators and  underground infrastructures owners. Indeed, all respondents highlighted that a Land Registry digital  map is a core element of their systems (national cadastre offices possess national digital maps, that  can be obtained for a fee).  Information systems have been operated by various types of public institutions:   By the national cadastre offices for one respondent (Netherlands),   By an agency responsible for the development of the Geographical Data Infrastructure, that  realizes solutions for other government agencies, businesses and citizens, for one respondant  (Belgium),   By the electronic communications NRA for one respondent (Sweden),   By a ministry not responsible for electronic communications for one respondent (Denmark).  Three of the four interviewees responded that their systems had been established and operated  following dedicated legislative acts, which also defined their institutional tasks and responsibilities  concerning the management of those systems (DK, BE, NL). One of the four respondents pointed out  that the information system had been launched and operated not subject to any legal act (SE). That  project initially was driven by the general objective to strengthen critical infrastructure protection; for  that purpose, the interviewee highlights their very important decision to launch an early and broad  call for all stakeholders to get involved.  Table 2 compares the advantages of the structure and the challenges to overcome depending on the  type of organization managing the system.  13 http://www.broadbandmapping.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014-03-24_Broadband-mapping-study-draft- final_report_v01.pdf  http://www.broadbandmapping.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014-03-24_Broadband-mapping-study-draft-final_report_v01.pdf http://www.broadbandmapping.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014-03-24_Broadband-mapping-study-draft-final_report_v01.pdf  Protection of Underground Electronic Communications Infrastructure  The use of automated information system for damage prevention against civil work  December 2014  Page 6  Done in...

All MSs investigated have launched web-based portals which provide a single application for the  receipt of all the relevant information and permissions for civil works. These different applications  share common functionalities:   Infrastructure owners can declare their underground assets and contact information through  the Internet. They can be informed of planned civil work in areas where they declared  underground assets.   Excavator accesses system via Internet, registers with it providing contact information, and,  using graphical interface tools, draws on a digital map the area where he intends to perform  excavation or other kind of ground works.  Figure 1 presents the web interface used by a) KLIP (BE) and b), c) Ledningskollen (SE) . Such an  interface is usually very intuitive in order to facilitate the usage of the tool by non-expert users. In  Ledningskollen, users can choose between two views: orthophoto or cadastral map. During the  interview, it was explained that users prefer the orthophoto view, which makes it easier to distinguish  landmarks.

Due to the complexities of such systems, every tool investigated runs several different software  programmes. Indeed, such a system consists of a web-based portal containing graphic data (digital  map), a database of underground infrastructure owners, user access interfaces, user authentication…  Respondents pointed out that they utilized several kinds of software: commercial, open source, home  made. Graphical data formats vary as well. Some information systems utilize raster graphical  presentation method, whereas others employ vector methods.  The survey highlights several constraints to consider before and during the deployment of the tool:   Respondents indicate that it is important to agree among all stakeholders on information  system functionalities and data formats to provide to and retrieve from the information  system.   All respondents pointed out the importance of the system to be user-friendly. To achieve this,  all owners continuously upgrade their systems, implement new functionalities which save end  user's time, provide a more clear information, enable access for devices with all kinds of  operational systems, including mobile devices.   All respondents highlighted that final decisions on data formats and other terms and  conditions of provision of information about underground infrastructures to information  system was done after intensive consultations with all stakeholders (programmers, system  owners, underground infrastructure owners, excavators, public organizations and  institutions).   In order to minimize manual work required to upload/download to/from information systems,  institutions operating these systems have been developing/upgrading application  programming interfaces (APIs). For example, underground infrastructure owners, utilizing  Protection of Underground Electronic Communications Infrastructure  The use of automated information system for damage prevention against civil work  December 2014  Page 8  APIs, connect their Geographical Information System (GIS) to information system for  underground infrastructure protection which allows to automatically update information  system database with the updated data from the GIS of infrastructure owner or enables to  generate fully automatically responses to excavators requests to provide information.  2.3 Operational usage of the tool  2.3.1 Purpose of the tool  Considering that automated information systems are currently the most advanced systems which  significantly contribute to underground infrastructure damage protection, this chapter overviews the  examples of such systems already operating in a few MSs. In the investigated cases, the demand for  such systems were put forward by various stakeholders including underground infrastructure owners,  excavators, governmental institutions, and municipalities.  It should be noted that interviewed respondents confirmed that their owned automated information  systems had been developed for the primary purpose of reduction of the number of underground  infrastructures damages. Their systems cover all kinds of underground assets: utility facilities such as  sewage, waste management, energy supply, water supply and electronic communications  infrastructures such as cables, pipes, ducts, and manholes.  Hence, such tools provide an automatic way to identifiy owners of underground infrastructure in areas  of planned civil work and protect underground infrastructure by providing:   To the excavator: the list of infrastructure owners with underground assets in areas of planned  civil works.   To underground infrastructure owners: notifications of planned civil work in areas where they  possess underground infrastructure.  2.3.2 For underground infrastructure owners  As mentioned above, digital maps with databases, which contain information about underground  infrastructure and their owners (including contact information) are key elements in the currently  operating information systems dedicated for underground infrastructure damage prevention.  In most cases, legislative acts oblige infrastructure owners to provide data about their underground  assets to information systems. Legal acts describe who, what, when and how this should be provided:   According to some MS legislations, every private or public organization that possesses  underground cables and pipes has to provide the information about areas with cables and  pipes (BE, NL).   A respondent from one MS indicated that the provision of information about underground  infrastructure to information system is obligatory only for legal entities.   In certain cases, privately-owned last mile lines placed in a private land are excluded from the  scope of legislation (DK).   Legal acts also provide other exclusions, for example, military and police underground assets  are out of scope of legal acts (DK, BE).  On the other hand, one interviewed MS uses a voluntary approach for infrastructure owners to join  the information system and finds this approach successful (at this moment more than 600  underground infrastructure owners have joined the system. It was also noticed that more than 100  new owners join the system each year)(SE). However, the respondent pointed out that there are a lot  of small infrastructure owners that still have not joined Ledningskollen due to several possible reasons.  One reason could be that such infrastructure owner only possess a small amount of underground fibre  Protection of Underground Electronic Communications Infrastructure  The use of automated information system for damage prevention against civil work  December 2014  Page 9  optic in rural areas, and therefore think that they can notice and have control of everyone trying to  dig in the area.  a) LER (DK) b) Ledningskollen (SE)  Figure 2 – Declaration of underground assets by the infrastructure owner  Figure 2 presents the interface of a) LER (DK) and b) Ledningskollen (SE), used by infrastructure owners  to declare their underground assets in a pre-defined geographical area. Information stored by the  system include the geographical area and the details of the contact person for this area.  2.3.3 For civil workers  Employing these systems, excavators have the possibility to send requests via the Internet to obtain  information about the existing underground infrastructure in the area of the planned civil works,  including information about its owners. Excavators define the area of planned civil works on a map  and the system performs the following actions:   The systems automatically identify underground infrastructure and its owners within the area  demarcated for planned civil work   Excavators receive the information about underground infrastructure locations.  o In some cases, this information is directly available in digital maps via the same  information systems.  o In other cases, excavator and infrastructure owners establish a direct contact to  protect underground assets, either by exchanging maps or via other mean (for  example, by requesting infrastructure owners to participate in excavation works in  order to show or mark their underground infrastructure on site).   Excavators also receive (via the Internet) a permission to perform civil works together with all  relevant information and restrictions, including information and restrictions regarding the  protection of existing underground infrastructure. Such permission can be transmitted either  directly by the system or by the land owner after evaluation of the requirements.  In three of the four MS studied, excavators are obliged by legal acts to submit requests to information  systems before starting excavation. In one MS, excavators voluntary use the information system. Civil  work projects request for a permission to dig by attaching the required information and documents  within a period defined by law (when applicable).  When voluntary, excavators have an incentive to use the system to demonstrate insurances that they  have taken all precautions to avoid cable cuts. For example in Sweden, insurance companies are aware  of Ledningskollen. The respondent incitates insurance companies to ask if excavators have used the  tool before digging, when handling a claim. The interview showed that some insurance companies  already do it.

Since this operator possess cables in the whole  country, it amplifies the need to use Ledningskollen.  In both cases, excavators enjoy benefits of having a single point to contact underground infrastructure  owners and intensively use these information systems. For example, in 2013 there were more than  200 000 requests in BE Flemish Region, 115 000 excavators requests in DK, 520 000 request in NL,  135 000 requests in SE.  Figure 3 presents the interface of a) LER (DK), b) Ledningskollen (SE) and c) KLIP (BE) used by excavators  to declare their civil works in a pre-defined geographical area. For that purpose, excavators can draw  the geographical area of their planned digging directly in the tool, as presented in Figure 3 a). The  system returns a list of infrastructure owners with declared underground assets in the area, as  depicted in Figure 3 b) and c).  2.3.4 Process of data exchange  The entire process of data exchange is not always fully automated. In some MS, the excavator needs  to contact the infrastructure owners identified by the tool in order to request information.  Indeed, three of four interviewed respondents pointed out that underground infrastructure owners  provided detailed information about existing underground infrastructures directly to the excavator,  without using the information system, as presented in Figure 4.  One respondent indicated that, for every single excavator’s inquiry, their system (NL) automatically  collects digital data about underground infrastructures in the requested area, draws the exact  underground infrastructure locations on a digital (topographic) map, and stores this file in its memory  until excavator retrieves it. This process is presented in Figure 5.  Protection of Underground Electronic Communications Infrastructure  The use of automated information system for damage prevention against civil work  December 2014  Page 11  As a result, in most cases the file with information about underground infrastructure in the area of  interest of the excavator can be promptly retrieved (in average, within 1 hour). Future developments  aim at optimizing this process by allowing infrastructure owners to automatically provide detailed  information about their assets directly from their GIS system.  Figure 4 – Process of information exchange: case when infrastructure owners provide information directly to excavator  Figure 5 – Process of information exchange: case when information system provides digital maps to excavator  2.3.5 Timeline of declaration  The maximum period of time within which infrastructure owners should provide detailed information  on their underground assets is defined by legislative acts or, in the case of a voluntary system, set by  the infrastructure owners individually. This maximum period is determined so that infrastructure  owner can provide accurate data without impeding the planning of a civil work project. In existing  approaches, it varies between a few days (5 to 10) to a few weeks. For example, this limit is set to 15  Database of underground  infrastructure and its owners  Digital  maps  Information  system  Information system for underground  infrastructure protection (IS)  Infrastructure owner A  Infrastructure owner B  Infrastructure owner C  1.

Nevertheless, all respondents indicated that in the majority of cases, infrastructure  owners respond to the excavator within a significantly shorter period of time (mainly within one day).  All respondents indicated that they used measures to ensure that their systems background digital  maps and databases with information about existing underground infrastructures were timely  updated. They indicated that an annual update of background digital maps was sufficient, but  information about a newly built underground infrastructure or a change of infrastructure owner, or  changes in the owner’s contact details should reach systems databases without delay in order to  ensure that excavators obtain correct information. Infrastructure owners which have their own GIS  systems manage to perform these updates automatically. One MS legal act obliges to provide such  updated information within 14 days (DK).  Figure 6 details the timeline of this declaration process. Particular attention must be given to any  change operated by the infrastructure owner in the period between the information exchange and  the actual civil work (new assets, new declaration…). Indeed, only accurate and reliable data can  protect underground infrastructure.  Figure 6 – Timeline of the declaration process  2.3.6 User support  All respondents mentioned that user support means had been implemented in their information  systems:   All institutions interviewed handle user support via e-mail.   Some provide on-line available manuals, wizards, tutorials on how to use their  systems(including films hosted on public video sharing platforms).   Some institutions have telephone inquiry services with dedicated personnel in order to  provide information to excavators and infrastructures owners how to use of their information  systems. Moreover, some institutions may limit their support via telephone by calling back  users who contacted their support via e-mail or another mean (SE).  2.4 Financing  Development of three information systems were financed by governments (in the case when those  information systems were defined by legal acts). One information system was financed by public  institutions (electronic communication NRA, Transport Administration, and the National grid).  All respondents of institutions which already had operational information system indicated that they  did not apply for EU funding for their system development, but one MS institution intending to  develop such a system pointed out that it had recently applied for the support from EU structural  funds (EE).  Interviews revealed that models of defrayment of operational expenses of information system could  be divided into two types. In one case operational expenses of the information system are covered by  excavators by charging them for utilizing this system. In the second case these expenses are covered  by governments.

One approach is to impose a fixed fee for every single inquiry to  the information system. The other approach is to charge a fee depending on the area requested for  information about underground infrastructure. In this case excavator pays fixed tariff for every square  meter of the area which he requests information about.  Table 3 compares the advantages and challenges to overcome for the financing schemes covering  operational expenses in Member States with existing tools.  Usage Advantages Challenges to overcome  Free 2 MS  Good incentive to use the  system   Requires funding from one  or several entities to  guarantee the operation (ex:  government…)  Price depending on  the surface area of the  digging  1 MS  Possibility to propose a fair  price adapted to the type of  digging   Possibility of a self-financed  system   Possible loss of revenue  when “gaming the system”:  excavators request only  maps for the start and the  end of their digging   Potential risk for security if  excavators interpolate cable  path when “gaming”   Requires additional security  for payment processing  Fixed price per  request  1 MS  Possibility of a self-financed  system   Price not linked to the size of  digging: “gaming” is difficult   Requires a certain amount of  users   Requires additional security  for payment processing  Mix of different  financing schemes  Not  investigated in  the interviews   Possibility to mix several  types of financing schemes  or to adapt the price  depending on the request  (size of the enterprise, area  of digging, number of  requests per year…)   Potential possibility to  exploit the system to use the  cheapest scheme   Some information may not  be available in certain  schemes  Table 3 – Comparison of the different financing schemes used to support operation of the system  2.5 Security measures to minimize risks of misuse of information about  underground infrastructure  All respondents pointed out that information about underground infrastructure is sensitive in terms  of confidentiality (public security or business secrets). Particularly, access to precise data with its exact  location and information about its infrastructure owners, need to remain private for infrastructure  owners. Thus special measures were implemented in their information systems in order to avoid their  use for malicious purposes (such as business espionage, sabotage acts, terror attacks).  2.5.1 Authentication and access control  All respondents indicated that one of such measures utilized in their systems was admission control:   Any system user has to be authenticated to declare their assets. The request for information  may also require authentication (this is the case in all cases investigated).  Protection of Underground Electronic Communications Infrastructure  The use of automated information system for damage prevention against civil work  December 2014  Page 14   Access to the information system is organized in different ways. Some systems require user’s  registration and provides user’s account with password, others use a public security system  with certificates.   Users register themselves for a specific user profile (asset owner, civil worker…). Access to  functionalities is granted according to the rules defined in system.   Through access control rules, the system adapts its interface and functionalities to the role of  the user (underground infrastructure owner or requester…).  2.5.2 Granularity of information  All respondents also highlighted a second security measure to limit the granularity of information  stored. Namely, their information systems contain only approximate locations of underground  infrastructure and contact details of underground infrastructure owners to ensure confidentiality:   The requesters obtain only limited information about the underground infrastructure and its  owner in the area of digging. Infrastructure owners have the information about the exact  locations of their underground assets in their GIS or, for example, paper maps.   Infrastructure owners receive a request from the information system to provide information  about their assets in a particular territory to an identified requester. They may disclose  information only under agreed terms and conditions. Thus, even in case of a leak of  information from information system, the exact locations of underground infrastructure shall  remain private.  In the case of the fully automated system investigated, the information system stores files with the  exact locations of underground infrastructure until the excavator retrieves it. The maximum storage  period of this file is limited (here, 20 working days). When this period expires, the files are  automatically deleted from the system’s memory.  2.5.3 Other security measures  Finally, respondents pointed out that special attention was paid to IT security during their information  system development (programing), use and maintenance phases in order to minimize security  breaches.  2.6 Summary of usage for four existing tools  Table 4 summarizes the responses at the interviews related to the usage of four tools: KLIC (NL), KLIP  (BE), Ledningskollen (SE) and LER (DK). This table does not compare the solutions from a qualitative  point of view, since every approach is adapted to the particularities of a Member States and the needs  of stakeholders.  Members States that wish to deploy such tool may rely on this table to investigate these existing tools.  The goal is to help them understand and validate functionalities and usages of a possible future  system.

However, they did not collect quantitative  data to support their statements, since baseline situations had not been recorded and methodologies  to make a quantitative evaluation of the project success had not been developed.  Nevertheless, the respondents indicated that their information systems for underground  infrastructure protection were recognized by stakeholders as successful initiatives. The following  advantages of such national initiatives were identified:   Those projects consolidated efforts of all stakeholders: public institutions, underground  infrastructure owners, and excavators to achieve common objectives to reduce unintentional  damages of underground infrastructures during civil works.   A properly functioning, single, state-wide information system provides excavators with an  easy and quick access to information required to prevent underground infrastructure  damages during civil works.   Common rules and procedures (whether defined by legal acts or based on agreements among  stakeholders) ensure certainty for all subjects playing different roles in these initiatives.  Infrastructure owners are aware of whom, what, and when they need to provide information  about their assets. Excavators know when, how, and to whom they have to apply for  information about underground infrastructures and from whom, how, when they can obtain  it.   Graphical representation of underground infrastructures on digital maps in a user-friendly,  easy-to-understand form ensures that even non-professional excavators realise where exactly  this infrastructure is located in its civil works polygon.   APIs for connection of underground infrastructure owners and GIS with information systems  enabled automated provision of information about underground assets to the system which  minimized infrastructure owners' efforts and also decreased the time period to obtain this  information for excavators.  3.2 Main findings of the survey  Finding 1: Importance of civil work in cable cuts  Unintentional damages of underground electronic infrastructures during excavation works is one of  the most frequent causes of disruptions in public electronic communications networks or services  within EU MS. Such events can cause negative impact on several vital sectors of the society.  Finding 2: Cable cuts are often linked to the lack of information  The main reason for unintentional damages of underground infrastructure is that excavators do not  have any information about underground infrastructure in its excavation polygon, or this information  is not sufficient enough.  Finding 3: Automated information exchange can be benefical to all stakeholders  A common platform for exchange of information about the existing underground infrastructure  between its owners and excavators decreases civil work delays and also helps to prevent underground  infrastructure from damages during civil works.  Protection of Underground Electronic Communications Infrastructure  The use of automated information system for damage prevention against civil work  December 2014  Page 17  Finding 4: Existing automated information exchange systems help in preventing cable cuts  Information systems already implemented in several EU MS for automated exchange of information  about the existing underground infrastructure between its owners and excavators currently is the  most advanced means which significantly contribute to the underground infrastructure damage  protection.  Finding 5: Existing automated information exchange systems share similarities  Despite the fact that MS which had information systems applied different approaches for their system  development and operation (different financing models, obligatory or voluntary use, legal basis or  voluntary initiative,…), general architectures and operation principles of their developed information  systems were very similar.  Finding 6: Automated information exchange systems rely on digital maps  Digital maps with database which contain information about underground infrastructure and their  owners are key elements in the currently operating information systems.  Finding 7: Direct integration into the stakeholders’ own information system has benefits  APIs for automated information exchange between infrastructure owners GIS and information system  for underground infrastructures protection decrease the owners burden and reduce information  retrieval times for excavators. APIs can lead to advanced functionalities, such as automatic answers.  Finding 8: Confidentiality is important to consider before sharing information  Information about underground infrastructure is sensitive in terms of public security or business  secrets. Security measures should be implemented in information systems containing such sensitive  information in order to avoid their use for malicious purposes.  Finding 9: International collaboration is needed to protect cross-border cables  Protection of underground/underwater cross-border cables is still an open issue. Stronger  international collaboration is needed to investigate and to define common measures to protect these  assets.  3.3 Possible improvements and future developments  Answering the questions about what could be improved in their systems, respondents highlighted the  following issues.  3.3.1 Reduce the time for information exchange  The time for the excavator to collect information from all infrastructure owners in their area of digging  is still too long. This could be improved by further automating the system, implementing new  functionalities which facilitate information exchange between underground infrastructure owners  and excavators.  3.3.2 Expand the usage of the tool  Small infrastructure owners are reluctant to join information systems. Their major arguments are that  information systems are sophisticated, they do not have digitalized geo-referenced information of  their assets, and too much effort is needed to provide information.  Protection of Underground Electronic Communications Infrastructure  The use of automated information system for damage prevention against civil work  December 2014  Page 18  A few solutions have been discussed and are already implemented by some respondents:   The simplification of the tool for non-technical users.   Awareness raising and training for small cable owners and excavators.   Live support, preferably through telephone, for users who remain unfamiliar with computer  systems and/or with the declaration process.  3.3.3 Improve information exchange  Current systems operate employing raster geodata (representation) format in digital maps. Two  information system owners wish to upgrade them into vector geodata format maps considering that  this geodata format are best suited for direct data processing or aggregation.  Moreover, the majority of respondents have expressed the necessity to define common data models  to guarantee the quality of information.  3.3.4 Facilitate international collaboration  Regarding underground/underwater cross-border cables, all respondents pointed out that only part  of these assets which were within their states territories had been registered in their information  systems. They also indicated that, for the time being, there was no strong collaboration and exchange  of information between neighbouring countries about such infrastructures. Every state takes  responsibility of the protection of underground/underwater cross-border cables which are laid down  in its territory.  Finally all respondents expressed their good will to share their knowledge regarding development and  managing of information systems for underground infrastructure protection. They also indicated their  willingness to participate to an EU-wide initiative for underground infrastructure protection.  Protection of Underground Electronic Communications Infrastructure  The use of automated information system for damage prevention against civil work  December 2014  Page 19  4 Recommendations  Taking into account the findings of this study, several recommendations are proposed for MS which  are considering the implementation of measures to protect underground electronic communications  infrastructure from damages.  Recommendation 1: MS should analyse the reasons behind cable cuts  Before implementing measures to protect underground electronic communications infrastructure  from damages, MS should perform a baseline situation analysis identifying major reasons of  underground infrastructure damages.  In this assessment, MS should identify stakeholders affected by damages and evaluate their interest  to tackle this problem. This first analysis can be followed through time by performing quantitative  calculations of all involved stakeholders loses due to underground infrastructure damages.  Recommendation 2: MS should evaluate the benefits of an automated information exchange tool  to protect underground infrastructure  MS should perform a cost/benefit analysis for the projects for underground infrastructure protection.  This analysis can be backed up by the inputs from the involved stakeholders: underground  infrastructure owners, civil workers, and their electronic communication national regulatory agency,  which collects major incident due to cable cuts.  Recommendation 3: MS developing an automated information exchange tool should rely on existing  tools and experience  MS developing such information system are encouraged to contact entities responsible for the  development and management of such tool in other MS, in order to exchange and share experience.  MS should consider the principles, outcomes and results of tools already implemented in other MS.  This should facilitate the development of a solution adapted to their needs, according to their  particular structure and conditions applicable inside their territory.  Moreover, MS can also mitigate their effort by integrating this automated information exchange tool  directly in their effort to deploy INSPIRE Directive.  Recommendation 4: MS shall encourage collaboration between all stakeholders to define the  principles of the automated information exchange tool to protect underground assets  MS should encourage all stakeholders, i.e. relevant public institutions, underground infrastructure  owners, and excavators, to collaborate in order to define the principles of the automated information  exchange tool in order to protect underground assets.  Technical and organizational details of information systems should be defined during public  discussions with all relevant stakeholders, taking into account their needs as well as the national  specificity regarding underground infrastructures and civil work in the MS. It is recommended that  information system architectures and functionalities are similar to the described above information  systems, which are already implemented in a few MS.  Referring to the experience of MSs already managing such projects, we recommend not to limit the  project scope by underground electronic communications infrastructure protection. Other utilities of  infrastructure should be included since these underground infrastructures are equally affected by  unintentional damages during excavation works and it is obvious that all parties are interested to have  a single system.  Protection of Underground Electronic Communications Infrastructure  The use of automated information system for damage prevention against civil work  December 2014  Page 20  Recommendation 5: MS should promote the use of their automated information exchange tool to  protect their underground infrastructure  The project of information system development for the automated exchange of information between  underground infrastructure owners and excavators should be recommended as an effective measure  for underground infrastructure protection since such projects implemented in a few MS are  considered as successful.  Recommendation 6: MS and the involved stakeholders should evaluate the security policy for  operating and managing their automated information exchange tool  It is recommended that MS developing such tools integrate security aspects covering the operation of  the tool (for the declaration of assets and the map requests by excavators) and its management (for  the data storage and processing).  MS should define and adapt the security policy of the tool with respect to:   The operational requirements set by the stakeholders, such as infrastructure owners  (example: ensure the confidentiality of assets) and excavators (example: reliability of data).   The management of the tool such (for example: security of stored information).  Stakeholders can also develop their own internal security policies. For example, infrastructure owners  can validate the legitimacy of a request before disclosing information.  Recommendation 7: MS should evaluate the sustainability of their automated information  exchange tool  MS are recommended to evaluate the sustainability of their automated exchange tool in order to  understand its usages, its adoption by stakeholders and the results on the protection of underground  electronic communication assets. For that purpose, MS have several possibilities, such as deploying  an information exchange platform performing surveys, analysing incident reports on cable cuts…  Respondents emphasize the need to perform an evaluation at the beginning of the project and after  its deployment.  The evaluation of the sustainability shall permit MS to adapt the tool to fit the (evolving) needs of  their stakeholders. For example, it can include the development of new functionalities such as APIs to  facilitate external integration.  Protection of Underground Electronic Communications Infrastructure  The use of automated information system for damage prevention against civil work  December 2014  Page 21  5 Conclusions  This document investigates several MS initiatives for underground infrastructure (including electronic  communications infrastructures) protection. The results show that the operation of a single  automated information system for the exchange of information can prevent underground assets from  unintentional damages during civil works.  One main finding is that confidentiality is a main concern for infrastructure owners. For this reason,  the automated information exchange tool takes the form of a directory which provides excavators  with the contact information of underground asset owners in their area of digging.  Hence, these tools are likely to differ from existing infrastructure mapping tools, which may store  precise information regarding underground assets (position, type…). Yet, such infrastructure mapping  projects can still represent an enabler to protect underground electronic communication cables from  outages due to civil work.  The investigations revealed that, despite the fact that the initiatives investigated in this document  include different technical and organizational details, they share the following similarities:  1. Infrastructure owners declare their contact information for the geographical areas where the  possess underground assets.  2. Excavators declare their intention of digging in a defined geographical area.  3. The automated information exchange system acts as a liaison between the infrastructure  owners and the requester.  4. Excavators receive the maps showing the underground assets present in the area where they  intend to dig.  Finally, the usage of automatic information exchange tools proves to be a valuable tool to protect  underground electronic communication infrastructure against outages due to civil works.

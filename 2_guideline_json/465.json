Summary 54  Technical guidelines for the implementation of minimum security measures for DSPs  December 2016  06  Executive Summary  Online marketplaces, online search engines and cloud computing services are considered as Digital Service Pro- viders (DSPs) in the context of the recently adopted Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and  of the Council of 6 July 2016 concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and infor- mation systems across the Union, hereafter referred to as the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive.  The NIS Directive aims to bring cybersecurity capabilities on the same level of development in all the EU Mem- ber States. Its purpose is to ensure that exchange of information and cooperation related to security amongst  Member States are efficient, including at the cross-border level1. With NIS becoming a requirement, the intro- duction of specific laws in this area across the European Union will have a significant impact to all industry sec- tors including those relating to DSP categories.  Many businesses in the Union rely on these DSPs for the provision of their services. Some digital services could  be an important resource for their users, including Operators of Essential Services (OES), and as such users  might not always have alternatives available. The security, continuity and reliability of the type of digital ser- vices referred to in this Directive are of the essence for the smooth functioning of many businesses. A disrup- tion of such a digital service could prevent the provision of other services which depend on it and could conse- quently have an impact on key economic and societal activities in the Union. Such digital services might there- fore be critical for the smooth functioning of businesses that depend on them, for the internal market and  cross- border trade across the Union2.  It is essential for all Member States to make sure that they have minimum capabilities to ensure a high level of  NIS in their territory and to improve the functioning of the internal market. Commonly defined security  measures can support harmonised security practices across EU Member States and potentially enhance the  overall level of NIS in the EU.  Therefore, ENISA has issued this report to assist Member States and DSPs in providing a common approach re- garding the security measures for DSPs. Although ENISA has already drafted a set of security objectives in the  context of cloud security in 20143, this study goes further than that by broadening the scope of its work and by  including security objectives for all three categories of digital service providers. This study lists 27 Security Ob- jectives (SOs) for DSPs. In those 27 SOs, security measures that map to the NIS Directive requirements4 are also  included.  This particular initiative has been achieved by examining current information and network security practices for  the DSPs across the EU. It has brought light to some important findings that can add to existing security objec- tives and measures in information technology infrastructures in Europe. It is recommended that stakeholders  and responsible parties analyse their information security needs in detail in order to evaluate and adapt each of  the security objectives and measures according to their specific business requirements.  1 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/directive-security-network-and-information-systems-nis-direc- tive  2 Preamble 48, Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 concerning  measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems across the Union.  3 Cloud certification schemes Meta Framework, ENISA, 2014, available at https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud- computing-certification .  4 Namely: (a) the security of systems and facilities, (b)incident handling, (c) business continuity management, (d)  monitoring, auditing and testing, (e) compliance with international standards  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/directive-security-network-and-information-systems-nis-directive https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/directive-security-network-and-information-systems-nis-directive https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification  Technical guidelines for the implementation of minimum security measures for DSPs  December 2016  07  1. Introduction  Background  1.1.1 General introduction  The world is becoming increasingly interconnected as industries continue to revolutionize and knowledge  continues to be shared. With the advent of digital services, network and information systems and services  are becoming highly crucial to the society. Thus, it is imperative that their security and reliability is signifi- cantly ensured.  In fact, if security and resilience of networks and information systems are not ensured, this can impede the  pursuit of economic activities, lead to financial losses, undermine the confidence or cause major damage to  the economy of a country. For example, network and information systems, and primarily the Internet, play  an essential role in facilitating the cross–border movement of goods, services and people. Substantial dis- ruptions of those systems, whether intentional or unintentional and regardless of where they occur, can  affect individual Member States and the Union as a whole.  Knowing how to properly address network and  information security is key to avoid any damaging effects.  DSPs operate in a fast changing environment and should ensure a level of security proportionate to the  degree of risk posed to the digital services they provide. Responsibilities in ensuring the security of network  and information systems lie to a great extent with DSPs themselves. A culture of risk management, involving  risk assessment and the implementation of security measures appropriate to the risks faced, should be pro- moted and developed through appropriate regulatory requirements, standards and commonly acceptable  industry practices.  1.1.2 Objectives  The objectives of this report are to:   Define common baseline security objectives for Digital Service Providers (DSPs).   Describe different levels of sophistication in the implementation of security objectives.   Map the security objectives against well-known industry standards, national frameworks and certi-  fication schemes.  1.1.3 Scope & Target Audience  This study analyses the security objectives by providing security measures and examples of implementation  concerning the digital service providers and in particular:   Cloud computing service providers   Online marketplaces   Online search engines  The three DSP categories are described in the NIS Directive5 as follows:  5 Preambles (15), (16) and (17) of the NIS Directive   Online marketplaces:  An online marketplace allows consumers and/or traders to conclude online sales and service con- tracts with traders, and is the final destination for the conclusion of those contracts. It does not  Technical guidelines for the implementation of minimum security measures for DSPs  December 2016  08  The articles 4(17), (18) and (19) of the NIS Directive provide the definitions of the DSPs.  Privacy is of outmost importance for the personal data being processed by DSPs but it is considered out of  scope for this particular report. This is because, there is a good deal of data protection requirements (i.e.  consent of the data subject, the purpose definition, proportionality of collected data etc.) and tools (i.e.  privacy by design, privacy impact assessment, privacy seals, notifications of the processing to and audits by  the national Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) and data breach notifications) which are examined under a  very specific piece of EU Regulation, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The identification of  the entire set of organisational and technical measures which are deemed adequate to GDPR is a subject for  thorough analysis which exceeds the boundaries of the current undertaking. For this reason, this report fo- cuses only on the objectives which are solely considered most relevant to the security element of the infor- mation systems and data maintained by the DSPs. However, some security measures described herein i.e.  encryption, secure disposal of data, media access policy etc. are extensively used to address data protection  requirements as well.  1.1.4 Document overview  The report lists and describes the high-level security objectives for the DSP categories together with the  different sophistication levels in the implementation of security measures. For each sophistication level  (basic, industry-standard and state of the art), the corresponding measures and examples are provided.  cover online services that serve only as an intermediary to third-party services where a contract  can ultimately be concluded. It therefore does not cover online services that compare the price of  particular products or services from different traders, and then redirect the user to the preferred  trader to purchase the product. Computing services provided by the online marketplace may in- clude processing of transactions, aggregations of data or profiling of users. Application stores,  which operate as online stores enabling the digital distribution of applications or software pro- grammes from third parties, are to be understood as being a type of online marketplace   Online search engines:  An online search engine should allow the user to perform searches of in principle all websites on  the basis of a query on any subject. It may alternatively be focused on websites in a particular  language. The definition of an online search engine provided in this Directive should not cover  search functions that are limited to the content of a specific website, irrespective of whether the  search function is provided by an external search engine. It should also not cover online services  that compare the price of particular products or services from different traders, and then redirect  the user to the preferred trader to purchase the product.   Cloud computing service providers:  Cloud computing services span a wide range of activities that can be delivered according to differ- ent models. For the purposes of this report, \"cloud computing services\" means services that enable  access to a scalable and elastic pool of shareable computing resources. The term \"computing re- sources\" covers resources such as networks, servers or other infrastructure, storage, applications  and services. \"Scalable\" means that, in order to handle fluctuations in demand, computing re- sources are flexibly allocated by the cloud service provider irrespective of the geographical location  of the resources.  Technical guidelines for the implementation of minimum security measures for DSPs  December 2016  09  The report also provides a mapping between security objectives, industry standards, certification schemes  and national frameworks. The goal of the mapping is to allow DSP communities to understand more easily  if their NIS requirements and security objectives meet the requirements of those frameworks.  1.1.5 Methodology  This study is based on the Cloud Certification Schemes Meta framework (CCSM) released in November 20146  by ENISA, regarding cloud service providers. This tool is a meta-framework that provides a neutral high-level  mapping from the customer's Network and Information Security requirements to security objectives in ex- isting cloud certification schemes.  Additional security objectives concerning cloud services that may have come into play since 2014 have also  been examined. The list of objectives has been validated with the ENISA Cloud Expert Group through extra  consultation and a validation workshop.  A questionnaire was developed and a publicly available online survey was launched in order to identify sev- eral security controls and measures implemented, along with good practices and standards deployed by DSP  and in particular online market places and online search engines.  The diagram below illustrates the relationship between security requirements, security objectives and se- curity measures which are key terminologies that have been used throughout the document. Further to this,  examples of these terminologies are also described below.  Figure 1: Terminology explained in a diagram extracted from “Cloud Certification Schemes Meta framework”  6 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification/cloud-certification-schemes-metaframework  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification/cloud-certification-schemes-metaframework  Technical guidelines for the implementation of minimum security measures for DSPs  December 2016  10  The report also provides a mapping between security objectives and the following industry standards, cer- tification schemes and national frameworks:   Security requirement:  Customers have security requirements. In the procurement phase customers usually check  which security requirements are met by the security objectives of the provider. This process is  often referred to as due-diligence.   Security objectives:  Providers have security objectives. Objectives are high-level goals and usually do not include  many technical details. For example, “we offer an uptime of 99.9%”, or “customer data cannot  be accessed by unauthorized personnel”. Security objectives are sometimes grouped in “security  domains” (e.g. “software security”). Security objectives are sometimes called “control objec- tives”).   Security measures:  Providers have security measures in place, to reach the security objectives. Security measures  are sometimes called “controls” or “security controls”-.   ISO/IEC 27001:2013   CSA CCM:  Cloud Controls Matrix v3.0.1   BSI C5: Cloud Computing Compliance Controls Catalogue (C5), criteria to assess the information se- curity of cloud services, version 1.0 – as of February 2016   COBIT5:  Framework for the governance and management of enterprise IT   CCS CSC: The CIS Critical Security Controls for Effective Cyber Defence, Version 6.1, August 31, 2016   OCF: CSA STAR PROGRAM & OPEN CERTIFICATION FRAMEWORK IN 2016 AND BEYOND   NIST:  Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, Version 1.0, National Institute  of Standards and Technology, February 12, 2014   PCI DSS: Payment Card Industry (PCI) Security Standards Council, Data Security Standard Require- ments and Security Assessment Procedures, Version 3.2, April 2016   CES: Cyber Essentials Scheme, Requirements for basic technical protection from cyber attacks, June  2014  Technical guidelines for the implementation of minimum security measures for DSPs  December 2016  11  2. List of security objectives and measures for DSPs  Description  For each security objective we provide:   Brief description of the security objective.   Levels of sophistication on the implementation of security measures with examples.   A mapping with industry standards, certification schemes and national frameworks  The list below, categorizes security measures into three sophistication levels. Each level contains the practices to  assess the adequacy of the design and evidence that should be provided in order to check the effective implemen- tation of the security practice. For each security objective, we have provided security measures that are either basic,  industry-standard or state of the art. Readers can refer to the table below for the definition of each of these sophis- tication levels7 and can also refer to the list below for an overview of the security levels of each objective.  SOPHISTICATION LEVEL DESCRIPTION OF SOPHISITICATION LEVELS  1 –Basic  -Basic security measures that could be implemented to reach the security objective  -Examples that basic measures are in place  2 – Industry standard  -Industry standard security measures to reach the objective and an ad-hoc review of the imple- mentation, following changes or incidents.  -Examples of industry standard measures and evidence of reviews of the implementation re- acting to changes and/or incidents.  3 – State of the art  -State of the art (advanced) security measures, and continuous monitoring of implementation,  structural review of implementation, taking into account changes, incidents, tests and exer- cises, to proactively improve the implementation of security measures  -Examples of state of the art (advanced) implementation, evidence of a structural review pro- cess, and evidence of pro-active steps to improve the implementation of security measures.  Sophistication levels are applied independently to each objective. As a result, a DSP may receive different  sophistication ratings for different objectives. It is important to realise that the sophistication levels that are  applicable to a given organisation depend on its specific characteristics such as its size or the services pro- vided. For example, for a provider with only 5 employees it may be unnecessary to have a security policy  that is fully aligned with best practice industry standards, or to have a documented formal procedure for  hiring personnel.  The practices that complete each sophistication level are selected from relevant standards, guidelines and  frameworks which have been identified during the stock taking exercise and described in the section 1.1.5.  7 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-minimum-security-measures/Article_13a_ENISA_Techni- cal_Guideline_On_Security_Measures_v2_0.pdf  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-minimum-security-measures/Article_13a_ENISA_Technical_Guideline_On_Security_Measures_v2_0.pdf https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-minimum-security-measures/Article_13a_ENISA_Technical_Guideline_On_Security_Measures_v2_0.pdf  Technical guidelines for the implementation of minimum security measures for DSPs  December 2016  12  The role of risk assessment  DSPs wishing to establish, implement, operate, monitor and continuously maintain and improve an appro- priate level of security, must also carefully and continuously consider and assess the actual level of prepar- edness and the related security risks they face.  A risk assessment should be performed throughout the system life cycle: during requirements definition,  procurement, control definition and configuration, system operations, and system close-out.  A “Risk Assessment” (RA) would be, in this context, an important step to be performed before deciding the  required sophistication levels needed by the DSP. The extent and granularity of the Risk Assessment should  take into account several factors such as the size of the organisation, the implementation cost of the  measures etc.  The risk assessment allows the DSP to define a threshold for the minimum acceptance level before the es- tablishment of a risk value and to perform the risk assessment for the assets in scope. Therefore, a risk  assessment is a key preliminary step that should be conducted in order to understand what risk level is  appropriate/acceptable for each organisation before deciding upon the required sophistication levels  needed by DSPs.  The organisation should select specific controls, measures and sophistication levels by considering and ef- fectively using the results of the risk assessment. This way, the proposed security measures could be consid- ered as an appropriate benchmark enabling the security managers to determine which specific aspects of  security require attention and priority within their respective organisations.  Establishing a security benchmark within a context that has been defined by DSP security experts is consid- ered to be a successful formula, because such a benchmark can be properly focused on DSP specific security  issues. Such benchmark can complement the outcome of the risk assessment and provide an additional input  for defining and selecting the specific controls, measures and sophistication levels for the security of the  services offered by the DSPs.  The above-described proposed approach is aligned with general risk management good practices – and  therefore will help create synergies between the risk management and the security efforts of the DSP. In  contrast with a compliance based approach, this approach is considered to be more pragmatic and efficient.  Moreover, the proposed approach is considered to be more powerful because it takes into consideration  the specific characteristics of DSPs. Therefore, it can be applied to a wide range of DSPs independently of  their size or maturity.  The use of sophistication levels allows the definition of different quality requirements for each measure.  This approach is different from a maturity level approach because, in practice, an organisation will probably  not have all its measures developed to the same level of maturity.  The identification of a suitable risk assessment methodology for DSPs is beyond the scope of this report;  therefore, it has not been described in detail. Only the relevance and usefulness of performing a suitable  risk assessment, before deciding the required sophistication levels, was highlighted (SO 02: Risk Manage- ment).

Summary  To summarise, the level of sophistication to which security measures are implemented from one organization to  another can vary for a multitude of reasons. For instance, this may depend on the industry sector, the size of the  company or the time and effort that the management can afford to invest in implementing security measures.  From the received feedback for this study, stakeholders should consider the different roles that the DSP’s play in  the online environment, and in particular how their level of criticality differs (i.e. lack of availability for a search  engine may not pose a significant risk, whereas for a different DSP, this may be more critical). As a result, some  security objectives may be prioritized over others and thus the sophistication levels may also differ.  There are high level security objectives, which are interchangeable among all three DSP categories, while a few  belong to specific DSP categories. In the following table, the common security objectives for all DSPs are marked  with a check mark. If a SO doesn’t belong to a specific DSP category, it is indicated with an xmark.

Summary 54  Technical guidelines for the implementation of minimum security measures for DSPs  December 2016  06  Executive Summary  Online marketplaces, online search engines and cloud computing services are considered as Digital Service Pro- viders (DSPs) in the context of the recently adopted Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and  of the Council of 6 July 2016 concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and infor- mation systems across the Union, hereafter referred to as the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive.  The NIS Directive aims to bring cybersecurity capabilities on the same level of development in all the EU Mem- ber States. Its purpose is to ensure that exchange of information and cooperation related to security amongst  Member States are efficient, including at the cross-border level1. With NIS becoming a requirement, the intro- duction of specific laws in this area across the European Union will have a significant impact to all industry sec- tors including those relating to DSP categories.  Many businesses in the Union rely on these DSPs for the provision of their services. Some digital services could  be an important resource for their users, including Operators of Essential Services (OES), and as such users  might not always have alternatives available. The security, continuity and reliability of the type of digital ser- vices referred to in this Directive are of the essence for the smooth functioning of many businesses. A disrup- tion of such a digital service could prevent the provision of other services which depend on it and could conse- quently have an impact on key economic and societal activities in the Union. Such digital services might there- fore be critical for the smooth functioning of businesses that depend on them, for the internal market and  cross- border trade across the Union2.  It is essential for all Member States to make sure that they have minimum capabilities to ensure a high level of  NIS in their territory and to improve the functioning of the internal market. Commonly defined security  measures can support harmonised security practices across EU Member States and potentially enhance the  overall level of NIS in the EU.  Therefore, ENISA has issued this report to assist Member States and DSPs in providing a common approach re- garding the security measures for DSPs. Although ENISA has already drafted a set of security objectives in the  context of cloud security in 20143, this study goes further than that by broadening the scope of its work and by  including security objectives for all three categories of digital service providers. This study lists 27 Security Ob- jectives (SOs) for DSPs. In those 27 SOs, security measures that map to the NIS Directive requirements4 are also  included.  This particular initiative has been achieved by examining current information and network security practices for  the DSPs across the EU. It has brought light to some important findings that can add to existing security objec- tives and measures in information technology infrastructures in Europe. It is recommended that stakeholders  and responsible parties analyse their information security needs in detail in order to evaluate and adapt each of  the security objectives and measures according to their specific business requirements.  1 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/directive-security-network-and-information-systems-nis-direc- tive  2 Preamble 48, Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 concerning  measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems across the Union.  3 Cloud certification schemes Meta Framework, ENISA, 2014, available at https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud- computing-certification .  4 Namely: (a) the security of systems and facilities, (b)incident handling, (c) business continuity management, (d)  monitoring, auditing and testing, (e) compliance with international standards  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/directive-security-network-and-information-systems-nis-directive https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/directive-security-network-and-information-systems-nis-directive https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification  Technical guidelines for the implementation of minimum security measures for DSPs  December 2016  07  1. Introduction  Background  1.1.1 General introduction  The world is becoming increasingly interconnected as industries continue to revolutionize and knowledge  continues to be shared. With the advent of digital services, network and information systems and services  are becoming highly crucial to the society. Thus, it is imperative that their security and reliability is signifi- cantly ensured.  In fact, if security and resilience of networks and information systems are not ensured, this can impede the  pursuit of economic activities, lead to financial losses, undermine the confidence or cause major damage to  the economy of a country. For example, network and information systems, and primarily the Internet, play  an essential role in facilitating the cross–border movement of goods, services and people. Substantial dis- ruptions of those systems, whether intentional or unintentional and regardless of where they occur, can  affect individual Member States and the Union as a whole.  Knowing how to properly address network and  information security is key to avoid any damaging effects.  DSPs operate in a fast changing environment and should ensure a level of security proportionate to the  degree of risk posed to the digital services they provide. Responsibilities in ensuring the security of network  and information systems lie to a great extent with DSPs themselves. A culture of risk management, involving  risk assessment and the implementation of security measures appropriate to the risks faced, should be pro- moted and developed through appropriate regulatory requirements, standards and commonly acceptable  industry practices.  1.1.2 Objectives  The objectives of this report are to:   Define common baseline security objectives for Digital Service Providers (DSPs).   Describe different levels of sophistication in the implementation of security objectives.   Map the security objectives against well-known industry standards, national frameworks and certi-  fication schemes.  1.1.3 Scope & Target Audience  This study analyses the security objectives by providing security measures and examples of implementation  concerning the digital service providers and in particular:   Cloud computing service providers   Online marketplaces   Online search engines  The three DSP categories are described in the NIS Directive5 as follows:  5 Preambles (15), (16) and (17) of the NIS Directive   Online marketplaces:  An online marketplace allows consumers and/or traders to conclude online sales and service con- tracts with traders, and is the final destination for the conclusion of those contracts. It does not  Technical guidelines for the implementation of minimum security measures for DSPs  December 2016  08  The articles 4(17), (18) and (19) of the NIS Directive provide the definitions of the DSPs.  Privacy is of outmost importance for the personal data being processed by DSPs but it is considered out of  scope for this particular report. This is because, there is a good deal of data protection requirements (i.e.  consent of the data subject, the purpose definition, proportionality of collected data etc.) and tools (i.e.  privacy by design, privacy impact assessment, privacy seals, notifications of the processing to and audits by  the national Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) and data breach notifications) which are examined under a  very specific piece of EU Regulation, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The identification of  the entire set of organisational and technical measures which are deemed adequate to GDPR is a subject for  thorough analysis which exceeds the boundaries of the current undertaking. For this reason, this report fo- cuses only on the objectives which are solely considered most relevant to the security element of the infor- mation systems and data maintained by the DSPs. However, some security measures described herein i.e.  encryption, secure disposal of data, media access policy etc. are extensively used to address data protection  requirements as well.  1.1.4 Document overview  The report lists and describes the high-level security objectives for the DSP categories together with the  different sophistication levels in the implementation of security measures. For each sophistication level  (basic, industry-standard and state of the art), the corresponding measures and examples are provided.  cover online services that serve only as an intermediary to third-party services where a contract  can ultimately be concluded. It therefore does not cover online services that compare the price of  particular products or services from different traders, and then redirect the user to the preferred  trader to purchase the product. Computing services provided by the online marketplace may in- clude processing of transactions, aggregations of data or profiling of users. Application stores,  which operate as online stores enabling the digital distribution of applications or software pro- grammes from third parties, are to be understood as being a type of online marketplace   Online search engines:  An online search engine should allow the user to perform searches of in principle all websites on  the basis of a query on any subject. It may alternatively be focused on websites in a particular  language. The definition of an online search engine provided in this Directive should not cover  search functions that are limited to the content of a specific website, irrespective of whether the  search function is provided by an external search engine. It should also not cover online services  that compare the price of particular products or services from different traders, and then redirect  the user to the preferred trader to purchase the product.   Cloud computing service providers:  Cloud computing services span a wide range of activities that can be delivered according to differ- ent models. For the purposes of this report, \"cloud computing services\" means services that enable  access to a scalable and elastic pool of shareable computing resources. The term \"computing re- sources\" covers resources such as networks, servers or other infrastructure, storage, applications  and services. \"Scalable\" means that, in order to handle fluctuations in demand, computing re- sources are flexibly allocated by the cloud service provider irrespective of the geographical location  of the resources.  Technical guidelines for the implementation of minimum security measures for DSPs  December 2016  09  The report also provides a mapping between security objectives, industry standards, certification schemes  and national frameworks. The goal of the mapping is to allow DSP communities to understand more easily  if their NIS requirements and security objectives meet the requirements of those frameworks.  1.1.5 Methodology  This study is based on the Cloud Certification Schemes Meta framework (CCSM) released in November 20146  by ENISA, regarding cloud service providers. This tool is a meta-framework that provides a neutral high-level  mapping from the customer's Network and Information Security requirements to security objectives in ex- isting cloud certification schemes.  Additional security objectives concerning cloud services that may have come into play since 2014 have also  been examined. The list of objectives has been validated with the ENISA Cloud Expert Group through extra  consultation and a validation workshop.  A questionnaire was developed and a publicly available online survey was launched in order to identify sev- eral security controls and measures implemented, along with good practices and standards deployed by DSP  and in particular online market places and online search engines.  The diagram below illustrates the relationship between security requirements, security objectives and se- curity measures which are key terminologies that have been used throughout the document. Further to this,  examples of these terminologies are also described below.  Figure 1: Terminology explained in a diagram extracted from “Cloud Certification Schemes Meta framework”  6 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification/cloud-certification-schemes-metaframework  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification/cloud-certification-schemes-metaframework  Technical guidelines for the implementation of minimum security measures for DSPs  December 2016  10  The report also provides a mapping between security objectives and the following industry standards, cer- tification schemes and national frameworks:   Security requirement:  Customers have security requirements. In the procurement phase customers usually check  which security requirements are met by the security objectives of the provider. This process is  often referred to as due-diligence.   Security objectives:  Providers have security objectives. Objectives are high-level goals and usually do not include  many technical details. For example, “we offer an uptime of 99.9%”, or “customer data cannot  be accessed by unauthorized personnel”. Security objectives are sometimes grouped in “security  domains” (e.g. “software security”). Security objectives are sometimes called “control objec- tives”).   Security measures:  Providers have security measures in place, to reach the security objectives. Security measures  are sometimes called “controls” or “security controls”-.   ISO/IEC 27001:2013   CSA CCM:  Cloud Controls Matrix v3.0.1   BSI C5: Cloud Computing Compliance Controls Catalogue (C5), criteria to assess the information se- curity of cloud services, version 1.0 – as of February 2016   COBIT5:  Framework for the governance and management of enterprise IT   CCS CSC: The CIS Critical Security Controls for Effective Cyber Defence, Version 6.1, August 31, 2016   OCF: CSA STAR PROGRAM & OPEN CERTIFICATION FRAMEWORK IN 2016 AND BEYOND   NIST:  Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, Version 1.0, National Institute  of Standards and Technology, February 12, 2014   PCI DSS: Payment Card Industry (PCI) Security Standards Council, Data Security Standard Require- ments and Security Assessment Procedures, Version 3.2, April 2016   CES: Cyber Essentials Scheme, Requirements for basic technical protection from cyber attacks, June  2014  Technical guidelines for the implementation of minimum security measures for DSPs  December 2016  11  2. List of security objectives and measures for DSPs  Description  For each security objective we provide:   Brief description of the security objective.   Levels of sophistication on the implementation of security measures with examples.   A mapping with industry standards, certification schemes and national frameworks  The list below, categorizes security measures into three sophistication levels. Each level contains the practices to  assess the adequacy of the design and evidence that should be provided in order to check the effective implemen- tation of the security practice. For each security objective, we have provided security measures that are either basic,  industry-standard or state of the art. Readers can refer to the table below for the definition of each of these sophis- tication levels7 and can also refer to the list below for an overview of the security levels of each objective.  SOPHISTICATION LEVEL DESCRIPTION OF SOPHISITICATION LEVELS  1 –Basic  -Basic security measures that could be implemented to reach the security objective  -Examples that basic measures are in place  2 – Industry standard  -Industry standard security measures to reach the objective and an ad-hoc review of the imple- mentation, following changes or incidents.  -Examples of industry standard measures and evidence of reviews of the implementation re- acting to changes and/or incidents.  3 – State of the art  -State of the art (advanced) security measures, and continuous monitoring of implementation,  structural review of implementation, taking into account changes, incidents, tests and exer- cises, to proactively improve the implementation of security measures  -Examples of state of the art (advanced) implementation, evidence of a structural review pro- cess, and evidence of pro-active steps to improve the implementation of security measures.  Sophistication levels are applied independently to each objective. As a result, a DSP may receive different  sophistication ratings for different objectives. It is important to realise that the sophistication levels that are  applicable to a given organisation depend on its specific characteristics such as its size or the services pro- vided. For example, for a provider with only 5 employees it may be unnecessary to have a security policy  that is fully aligned with best practice industry standards, or to have a documented formal procedure for  hiring personnel.  The practices that complete each sophistication level are selected from relevant standards, guidelines and  frameworks which have been identified during the stock taking exercise and described in the section 1.1.5.  7 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-minimum-security-measures/Article_13a_ENISA_Techni- cal_Guideline_On_Security_Measures_v2_0.pdf  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-minimum-security-measures/Article_13a_ENISA_Technical_Guideline_On_Security_Measures_v2_0.pdf https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-minimum-security-measures/Article_13a_ENISA_Technical_Guideline_On_Security_Measures_v2_0.pdf  Technical guidelines for the implementation of minimum security measures for DSPs  December 2016  12  The role of risk assessment  DSPs wishing to establish, implement, operate, monitor and continuously maintain and improve an appro- priate level of security, must also carefully and continuously consider and assess the actual level of prepar- edness and the related security risks they face.  A risk assessment should be performed throughout the system life cycle: during requirements definition,  procurement, control definition and configuration, system operations, and system close-out.  A “Risk Assessment” (RA) would be, in this context, an important step to be performed before deciding the  required sophistication levels needed by the DSP. The extent and granularity of the Risk Assessment should  take into account several factors such as the size of the organisation, the implementation cost of the  measures etc.  The risk assessment allows the DSP to define a threshold for the minimum acceptance level before the es- tablishment of a risk value and to perform the risk assessment for the assets in scope. Therefore, a risk  assessment is a key preliminary step that should be conducted in order to understand what risk level is  appropriate/acceptable for each organisation before deciding upon the required sophistication levels  needed by DSPs.  The organisation should select specific controls, measures and sophistication levels by considering and ef- fectively using the results of the risk assessment. This way, the proposed security measures could be consid- ered as an appropriate benchmark enabling the security managers to determine which specific aspects of  security require attention and priority within their respective organisations.  Establishing a security benchmark within a context that has been defined by DSP security experts is consid- ered to be a successful formula, because such a benchmark can be properly focused on DSP specific security  issues. Such benchmark can complement the outcome of the risk assessment and provide an additional input  for defining and selecting the specific controls, measures and sophistication levels for the security of the  services offered by the DSPs.  The above-described proposed approach is aligned with general risk management good practices – and  therefore will help create synergies between the risk management and the security efforts of the DSP. In  contrast with a compliance based approach, this approach is considered to be more pragmatic and efficient.  Moreover, the proposed approach is considered to be more powerful because it takes into consideration  the specific characteristics of DSPs. Therefore, it can be applied to a wide range of DSPs independently of  their size or maturity.  The use of sophistication levels allows the definition of different quality requirements for each measure.  This approach is different from a maturity level approach because, in practice, an organisation will probably  not have all its measures developed to the same level of maturity.  The identification of a suitable risk assessment methodology for DSPs is beyond the scope of this report;  therefore, it has not been described in detail. Only the relevance and usefulness of performing a suitable  risk assessment, before deciding the required sophistication levels, was highlighted (SO 02: Risk Manage- ment).

Summary  To summarise, the level of sophistication to which security measures are implemented from one organization to  another can vary for a multitude of reasons. For instance, this may depend on the industry sector, the size of the  company or the time and effort that the management can afford to invest in implementing security measures.  From the received feedback for this study, stakeholders should consider the different roles that the DSP’s play in  the online environment, and in particular how their level of criticality differs (i.e. lack of availability for a search  engine may not pose a significant risk, whereas for a different DSP, this may be more critical). As a result, some  security objectives may be prioritized over others and thus the sophistication levels may also differ.  There are high level security objectives, which are interchangeable among all three DSP categories, while a few  belong to specific DSP categories. In the following table, the common security objectives for all DSPs are marked  with a check mark. If a SO doesn’t belong to a specific DSP category, it is indicated with an xmark.

    "abstract": "ENISA has issued this report to assist Member States and DSPs in providing a common approach regarding the security measures for DSPs. This particular initiative has been achieved by examining current information and network security practices for the DSPs across the EU. It has brought light to some important findings that can add to existing security objectives and measures in information technology infrastructures in Europe."

The study provides a deeper insight into  NISD sectoral Incident Response capabilities, procedures, processes and tools to identify the  trends and possible gaps and overlaps.  Incident Response Capabilities (IRC) within NISD sectors is a growing concern to tackle  potential incidents which could have a major impact on European societies and citizens. To  assess IRC, the analysis framework for the research included the following aspects:   Impact of the NIS Directive on national CSIRT/IR layout and operational set-up in the NISD  sectors;   IR cooperation and operational models within the NISD sectors   IRC development in the NISD sectors   Lessons learned and recommendations.  A series of seven findings were identified while conducting the research activities.  Key Finding #1 – Member States’ organisational culture and resources tend to shape the  overall IR layout and set-up  Depending on whether a Member State’s organisational culture is centralised or decentralised,  the Incident Response layout and set-up is often structured in a similar manner, i.e. with a  central authority or instead with shared responsibilities between different actors. The main  entities in charge of Incident Response at national level, tend to be the national CSIRT and the  Operator of essential Services (OES)3. However, the mandate and the resources of the National  CSIRT or national cybersecurity authority is another important element influencing a centralised  or distributed incident response model.  Key Finding #2 – The Directive’s main positive impact was to clarify actors’ roles and  responsibilities within the IR organisation  The main positive impact of the Directive was to improve the IR organisation and governance by  clarifying actors’ roles and responsibilities. The data collected also suggest that the NISD had  an unequal effect from one country to another. Indeed, this positive impact is less visible in  Member States with a more mature layout and pre-existing national regulations to govern  incident response in NISD sectors. However, the Directive has led/is leading to the formal  identification of OES in countries who had not previously done so.  Key Finding #3 – The implementation of the NISD raises operational and regulatory  challenges for the MS regulators and competent authorities  The implementation of the Directive raises operational and regulatory challenges, in particular  for the definition of OES and competent authorities and the legal balance between sharing  1 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN#d1e1386-1-1  2 Definition in Chapter 1  3 Definition in Chapter 1  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN#d1e1386-1-1  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  5  information and respecting privacy regulations. The operational implementation of the Directive  in the Member States also highlights MS willingness to move forward since most of them  extended the number of sectors targeted and their scope.  Key Finding #4 – The success of demand or regulatory drivers for the creation of sectoral  IR entities and capabilities depends on IR layout maturity  The creation of sectoral IR entities and capabilities is driven by both operational demand and  policy regulation. A blend of bottom-up and top-down incentives could be the most efficient  driver to enhance capabilities, however an important element to take into account is the MS IR  layout maturity. In countries with a very mature or centralised IR layout, there is less need for  sectoral IRC. For all NISD sectors and/or sub-sectors, the main entities in charge of IR for 51%  of the respondents are the national CSIRT and the OES  Key Finding #5 – Sectoral CSIRTs rely on similar notification and reporting tools as  National CSIRTs but provide sector-specific knowledge and expertise to their  constituents  Both national CSIRTs and sectoral CSIRTs have developed mature reporting processes and  notification tools. The main added value of sectoral CSIRTs is to provide services specific to  their sectors’ needs, in particular a more in-depth knowledge of the threat and actor landscape,  better adapted tools and solutions and operational expertise. Sector-specific regulations which  include guidelines and requirements for reporting and management of incidents are crucial to  enhance capabilities at the sectoral level. However, there is a lack of skilled staff, making it  difficult for sectoral CSIRTs to reach full capacity.  Key Finding #6 – There is a growing number of sectoral cooperation and information-  exchange initiatives, yet they often lack visibility or resources to sustain their efficiency  There is a multiplication of information exchange tools and initiatives to facilitate cooperation at  sectoral, national, regional and EU level. These initiatives can take various forms and be more  or less formalised. This quantitative evolution is an encouraging sign but does not provide  information on the quality and outcomes of the exchanges. The long-term benefits of these  initiatives will depend on the presence of both organisational and structural elements to sustain  the efficiency of the initiatives.  Key Finding #7 – Training at sectoral level is key to foster and enhance preparedness  Training is an area of constantly growing interest for sectoral CSIRTs and for other operational  entities and it is considered as a crucial pillar of the cybersecurity value chain and IR actors’  preparedness and expertise. Interesting good practices to organise training have been gathered  by national CSIRTs, which could provide an answer to the need for skilled personnel training  opportunities.  Recommendations to ENISA   Knowledge: Collect deeper insights on both national and sectoral CSIRT maturity when the  NISD will have been fully practically implemented;   Cooperation: Bolster cross sectoral knowledge between the stakeholders;   Information sharing: Continue to collect available resources to enhance IRC & enhance  information-sharing and build a repository;  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  6   Training: Evaluate a possibility to develop a continuum for training activities which include  assessing sectors trainings needs, promoting the “train-the-trainers» approach and developing  basic sectoral trainings.  Recommendations to the IRC community (National and sectoral CSIRTs)   Transparency: Publish a clear list of the sectors covered within NISD at national level (same  as the NISD or extended);   Information sharing: Encourage the use of secure communication tools, common taxonomy  and sharing of lessons learned after incident with peers and everywhere; The responsible  disclosure of vulnerabilities should be fostered by setting incentives;   Cooperation: Build trust within communities and engage with OES and DSP;   Resources: the IR community should have adequate resources to conduct their missions.  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  7  1. OVERVIEW AND SCOPE OF  THE STUDY  1.1 CONTEXT  In 2019, ENISA is assisting European Member States (EU MS) with their Incident Response  Capabilities (IRC) by providing a state-of-the-art overview of the CSIRT landscape and  development in Europe.  This work aims to further develop and apply ENISA recommendations  for CSIRT capability development.  ENISA’s public website features both a European CSIRT inventory4 with an interactive map,  which gives an overview of the actual situation of publicly listed CSIRT teams in Europe and a  published Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 20255. These two elements  support an overall picture of current CSIRTs’ incident handling and response capabilities (IRC),  with initial facts on sectoral CSIRTs.  Following the adoption of the NIS Directive, EU Member States (MS) transposed the different  measures and guidelines into national legislation, including those focusing on OES and critical  infrastructure. For example, the NIS Directive requests MS to appoint at least one Computer  Security Incident Response Team to monitor incidents at national level and facilitate  collaboration at European level. Beyond national and/or governmental CSIRTs, operators of  essential services (OES) in the seven sectors identified in the NISD are accelerating their efforts  to build or upgrade their IRC. This effort includes the set-up of specific capabilities within the  NISD sectors and the development of sector-specific IR collaboration mechanisms and fora at  sectoral, national, EU and international level.  1.2 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY  The objective of this study is to help ENISA gain a better understanding of and draw  conclusions about the recent and current changes in the European Incident Response  landscape based on NISD requirements. This study aims to dive deeper into IRC in NISD  sectors and to study the procedures, processes and tools used either by designated CSIRTs in  particular sectors or by an entity responsible for IR in these sectors in all EU MS and collect  existing good practices from neighbouring countries.  The specific objectives of this study are:   To collect and aggregate comprehensive data on current IRC of NISD sectors;   To analyse and evaluate the recent changes since the implementation of the NIS Directive;   To identify potential gaps, overlaps and challenges in national IR procedures, processes and  tools.  To achieve these objectives a series of three research activities have been conducted in  parallel, namely desktop research of open sources, a survey of EU national and sectoral  CSIRTs (response received from 17 Member States and Norway) and complementary  interviews with sectoral IRC experts and national CSIRTs.  4 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-inventory/certs-by-country-interactive-map  5 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/study-on-csirt-landscape-and-ir-capabilities-in-europe-2025  OES in the seven  sectors identified  in the NISD are  accelerating their  efforts to build or  upgrade their  IRC.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-inventory/certs-by-country-interactive-map https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/study-on-csirt-landscape-and-ir-capabilities-in-europe-2025  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  8  Norway has also been included in the scope of the study because it provides interesting case  studies within its financial sector. The country is highly digitalised and faced important cyber-  attacks targeting their operator of essential services in the past which led them to develop  sectoral IRC before the publication of the NISD.  An overview of the methodology, an assessment and presentation of the data collection are  presented in chapter 3 and 4.  1.3 SCOPE OF THE WORK AND DEFINITIONS  This study provides data and analysis on the recent changes and evolutions of IR capabilities  (IRC) within NISD sectors in Member States (and Norway).  The study focuses on:   The impact of the NISD on the organisation and conduct (layout) of IR and on CSIRT  operational set-up in all EU MS;   The cooperation models and the capabilities (including processes, procedures and tools)  developed by MS for each NISD sector;   The way sectoral CSIRTs and other IR actors (private sector, OES) function in conjunction  with the national CSIRT in crisis/large incident situations from communication processes to  escalation procedures and incident management;   Good practices, lessons learned and key challenges in this area.  It was therefore important to agree on the definition of the key structuring concepts and  elements of the study.  The following definitions have been used in this document and shared to define the scope and  key concepts of the research:  Incident response (IR): The protection of an organisation's information by developing and  implementing an IR process (e.g. plans, defined roles, training, communications, management  oversight) in order to quickly discover an attack and effectively contain the damage, eradicate  the attacker's presence, and restore the integrity of the network and systems.6  Incident response capabilities (IRC): Incident response capabilities are the processes (e.g.  plans, defined roles, training, communications, management oversight), procedures and tools  (log analysis, Intrusion Detection Systems, Vulnerability scanners, Data Capture & Incident  Response Forensics Tools, Patch management systems, etc.) used to respond to identify,  respond and mitigate an attack, to restore continuity of service.7  Incident response models: Within the survey, a typology of four Incident Response models  have been defined:   Centralised: the national CSIRT is in charge of handling incidents across the different  sectors; it provides a centralised point for incident reporting and analysis, decision making,  response coordination, and information dissemination.   Distributed: the national CSIRT has core responsibilities to handle incidents and works with a  competent authority for each sector (e.g. national ministries or public agencies); the role of  these actors may be to facilitate incident notification and information dissemination.  6 Strategies for Incident Response and Cyber Crisis Cooperation, ENISA, August 2016.  7 Strategies for Incident Response and Cyber Crisis Cooperation, ENISA, August 2016.  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  9   Hybrid: a national CSIRT and the sectoral CSIRTs share the IR responsibilities and  operations, which may depend for example on the sector(s) impacted or the scale of the  incident.   Decentralised: a sectoral CSIRT is in charge of handling incidents in a given sector from  incident detection to response coordination and decision making, including coordinating with  other stakeholders.  National/Government (N/g) CSIRTs: Teams that serve a country’s government by helping to  protect its critical information infrastructure. N/g CSIRTs play a key role in coordinating incident  management with the relevant stakeholders at national level. They also bear responsibility for  cooperation with other countries’ national and governmental teams.8  Sectoral CSIRTs: Entities that respond to computer security or cybersecurity incidents affecting  a specific sector. Sectoral CSIRTs are usually established in NISD sectors such as Healthcare,  Public Utilities, and the Financial Sector. Unlike the National/Government CSIRTs who serve  the public sector, sectoral CSIRTs provide services to constituents from a single sector only9  (in  the context of this study, the Sectoral CSIRTs and sectors mentioned are mainly NISD sectors).  NIS Directive: The Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NISD) was  adopted by the European Parliament on 6 July 2016 and entered into force in August 2016. The  NISD provides legal measures to boost the overall level of cybersecurity in the EU.10  NISD sectors: Sectors vital for the European Union’s society and economy and heavily  dependent on ICT. Seven sectors are listed in the NIS Directive (NISD sectors), for which  Member States have been requested to identify operators of essential services (OES). The  seven sectors – and related sub-sectors - listed in the Directive11 are:   Energy (electricity, oil, gas);   Transport (air, rail, water, road);   Banking;   Financial market infrastructures;   Health sector;   Drinking water supply and distribution;   Digital Infrastructure.  Operator of Essential Services (OES): Operators of essential services are private or public  sector entities who play an important role in providing security in healthcare, transport, energy,  banking and financial market infrastructure, digital infrastructure and water supply. According to  the NIS Directive, the Member States should be responsible for determining which entities meet  the criteria of the definition of operator of essential services12.  Digital Service Provider (DSP): A digital service provider is an entity who provides one or  more of the three types of digital service:   Cloud computing services: digital services that enable access to a scalable and  elastic pool of shareable computing resources.  8 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-capabilities/baseline-capabilities  9 https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Cybersecurity/Documents/GCIv3_documents/GCI%20V3%20Reference%20model.pdf  10 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/network-and-information-security-nis-directive  11 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC  12 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-capabilities/baseline-capabilities https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Cybersecurity/Documents/GCIv3_documents/GCI%20V3%20Reference%20model.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/network-and-information-security-nis-directive https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  10   Online marketplaces: digital services that allow consumers to conclude online sales  or service contracts with traders online using computing services provided by the  online marketplace.   Online search engines: digital services that allow users to perform searches of, in  principle, all websites or websites.

METHODOLOGY AND DATA  COLLECTION  2.1 OVERVIEW OF THE METHODOLOGY  The methodology to identify, collect and analyse data on Incident Response set-up and  capabilities within the NISD sector is illustrated in the graphic below. It aggregates a succession  of steps which are presented in this chapter.  2.2 A SEVEN-STEP APPROACH  2.2.1 Step 1 – Definition of the research focus for the data collection  The research focus of the study was defined by building an analysis grid to be used to classify  the information collected on Sectoral IRC, by defining a set of analysis criteria and theme.  The list of criteria was defined according to elements of interest for ENISA and additional criteria  pertaining to the specific data sought in the context of this study (e.g. cooperation aspects,  recently created entities, etc.).  The list of criteria defined are presented in Annex 1.  Figure 2: Overview of the methodology  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  12  2.2.2 Step 2 – Desktop research in open source on NISD Sectors IRC  This step consisted in conducting a literature review and open source research to collect data  on sectoral IRC and recent trends in the field of IRC.  During this step, the research team used the pre-defined classification criteria to build an  analysis grid. The purpose of this analysis grid was to facilitate the data collection by focusing  the research work on the key topics of interest for ENISA and to present the raw data in a  structured way.  During a preliminary data collection phase, the relevant data was gathered in the data  classification grid by a first team of analysts. The preliminary data was then validated and  further enriched by a second team of analysts.  2.2.3 Step 3 – Designing and validating the survey  Publicly available information on Sectoral IRC procedures and tools was, as anticipated, not  detailed enough to provide insightful input (see part 3.1.2). It was therefore planned early on to  conduct a survey to collect comprehensive data from relevant parties.  Once the objective of the survey was defined, two categories of organisations were identified to  participate to the survey:   28 Member States’ national CSIRTs and Norway;   Additional sectoral CSIRTs from the 28MS and Norway.  Norway has also been included in the scope of the study because it provides interesting case  studies within its financial sector including FinCERT, an entity involved in the IR for Financial  sector also in other Nordic countries. The country is highly digitalised and faced important  cyber-attacks targeting their operator of essential services in the past leading to the early  creation of sectoral IRC, before the publication of the NISD.  The Project Team then drafted the survey which could be sent to both audiences considering  aspects such as data protection, privacy and legal aspects, language, size and format, and  structure.  2.2.4 Step 4 – Conducting the survey and complementary interviews  The survey was sent by ENISA to the 28 national CSIRTs and additional sectoral CSIRTs  CSIRTs that were recommended by CNW members. To maximise participation the survey  included a presentation of the study and its context.  Targeted emails were sent to relevant contacts and followed-up on, to ensure answers from a  maximum of Member States and sectors.  Following the survey, additional interviews were conducted to complement and further enrich  the data collected with the survey and desktop research with both:   National and sectoral CSIRTs who replied to the survey;   National and sectoral CSIRTs who did not reply to the survey.  A list of entities was drafted for each with a rationale for the interview which was validated by  ENISA.  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  13  Once an organisation agreed to participate in the interview, a timeslot was scheduled and a list  of 6 to 7 questions was sent to the interviewees ahead of the interview based on the answers  provided in the short questionnaire or additional element to fill in information gaps.  2.2.5 Step 5 – Collation of raw data  The raw data collected from the desktop research, the survey and the interviews, was gathered  in structured tables in a collaborative tool.  The collaborative tool allowed the aggregation of all raw data, the generation of statistics and  the identification of key input.  2.2.6 Step 6 – Analysis and identification of trends  The methodology used in this step was a qualitative use of the Delphi Method, which ensures  that the data collection team and the data analysis team benefit from and build on each other’s  expertise, and that the final analysis addresses all aspects of the request presented in a  concise, coherent and comprehensive way.  A first analysis of the raw data was made by the data collection team and the data analysis  team to develop a draft set of key findings.  Once analysis methods were applied, a first version  of the key findings of the study was drafted and subjected to validation and further discussion.  At a second stage, a virtual workshop held via videoconference was organised with members of  the ENISA Informal Expert Group on Sectoral Incident Response Capabilities13.  Once the virtual workshop was held and all final comments received, a second version of the  key findings of the study was drafted and subjected to validation and further discussion.  2.2.7 Step 7 – Final report  This final step consisted in further developing findings of specific interest to ENISA and in  drafting the final report of the study in collaboration with the member of the IEG.  2.3 OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF THE DATA & INFORMATION  AVAILABILITY  The identification of reliable and qualitative data was crucial throughout the study. For each of  the three activities conducted during the study, namely the desktop research phase, the survey  and the complementary interviews, an overall assessment the data and information availability  was conducted, and several assumptions are noteworthy.  2.3.1 Desktop research – Data collection assessment  During the open-source desktop research phase, information on IR layout and set-up were  collected for 17 out 28 Member States.   The clarity and level of information available on the national IR approach in NISD  sectors was very different from one Member States to another and not all of them had  information publicly available;   Information on procedures, processes and tools used by Sectoral IR teams were  rarely, if ever, detailed in publicly available documents;   Publicly available information about cooperation models or cross-border procedures  was not detailed;  13 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirt-cert-services/reactive-services/informal-expert-group-on-eu-ms-incident- response-development/  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirt-cert-services/reactive-services/informal-expert-group-on-eu-ms-incident-response-development/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirt-cert-services/reactive-services/informal-expert-group-on-eu-ms-incident-response-development/  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  14   Qualitative information on information exchange communities and fora were rarely, if  ever, detailed in publicly available documents.  2.3.2 Survey – data collection assessment  The survey collected answers from 24 respondents: 18 National CSIRTs and 6 Sectoral CSIRTs  from 17 Member States and Norway (knowing that the minimum planned requirement was  responses from 15 MS).   Efforts were made to cover all Member States, but the survey was conducted between  June and August, a challenging moment to find available yet relevant respondents;   A majority of respondents were National CSIRTs, resulting in the collection of input  more focused on national approaches towards IR in NISD sectors rather than  sectoral approaches and capabilities;   18 out of 24 respondents provided one or several qualitative comments through the  survey.  2.3.3 Interviews – data collection assessment  In total, 8 complementary interviews were conducted: Two with national CSIRTs representatives  and one with a Sectoral CSIRT representative who had replied to the survey. One with a  sectoral expert who did not participate to the survey and four with experts from the Informal  expert group.   Efforts were made to collect additional inputs from sectoral stakeholders. It allowed to  draft interesting case studies but not to develop an analysis at sectoral level;   The interviews allowed to get deeper insights on procedures, processes and tools  used within the interviewees’ organisation.

KEY FINDINGS  3.1 KEY FINDING #1  3.1.1 Member States’ organisational culture and resources tend to shape  IR layout and set-up  The sectoral Incident Response layout and set-up at national level across the EU is strongly  impacted by the national organisational culture of each Member State. Countries with a very  centralised state culture tend to have a centralised Incident Response model under the  supervision of the national CSIRT, whereas decentralised countries tend to have more hybrid or  decentralised models with sectoral CSIRTS in charge of Incident Response.  According to the survey and as illustrated in the graph below, the IR model is centralised or  hybrid for 90% of the respondents and 100% of countries with centralised organisational culture  have a centralised IR model.

As an example, for the energy sector:   The national CSIRT is the entity in charge or IR for the Energy sector for 8  respondents;   A Sectoral CSIRT is the entity in charge or IR for the Energy sector for 4 respondents;   The OES are the entities in charge or IR for the Energy sector for 6 respondents;   5 respondents did not provide answer to for this sector;   Both the national CSIRT and the OES are the entities in charge or IR for the Energy  sector for 1 respondent.  Based on Figure 1, all NISD sectors and/or sub-sector, the main entities in charge of incident  response for 51% of the respondent are the national CSIRT in cooperation with the OES.  Table 1: Case study - Sectoral IR layout and set-up: France vs The Netherlands  Sectoral IR layout and set-up: centralised vs Hybrid models  France The Netherlands  Organisational Culture  French governance and society have been shaped  by a centuries-old trend towards centralization,  beginning under the French monarchs and  culminating in the French Revolution and the First  Napoleonic Empire14. At the end of the 20th  century, two major decentralisation Acts were  adopted but these progressive measures are likely  to take time to change this profoundly anchored  governance culture.  Since 1848, the Netherlands has been a  decentralised unitary state. The central  government has trust in abilities of local and  regional governments. The Minister of Interior  affairs encourages decentralisation, especially with  regard to local government, and is bound to that  by the Municipalities Act (art. 117) but the central  government guarantees the unity of state. 15  Incident Response Model  Centralised: the national CSIRT is in charge of  handling incidents across the different sectors; it  provides a centralised point for incident reporting  and analysis, decision making, response  coordination, and information dissemination.  Hybrid: a national CSIRT and the sectoral CSIRTs  share the IR responsibilities and operations, which  may depend for example on the sector(s) impacted  or the scale of the incident.  National approach towards IR in NISD sectors  In 2013, a dedicated CIIP regulatory framework  was established: the “CIIP law”. The law is  destined to apply to more than 200 public and  private operators from 12 sectors already identified  as critical in France.  Security requirements will apply only to the  operators’ most “critical information systems”.  ANSSI16 sets technical and organisational rules,  mostly basic cyber hygiene measures common to  all sectors. ANSSI can impose measures in case  of a major crisis, declared by the Prime Minister. It  lays down legal basis for action in the framework  of crisis management plans17.  The Dutch envision that every sector should set-up  their own CSIRT. One of the new ambitions of their  National Cyber Security Agenda is to create a  network of cybersecurity partnerships, including  sectoral and regional CSIRTs.  NCSC-NL is the CSIRT for the central government  and critical infrastructure providers / Operators of  Essential Services (“Rijksoverheid”). Other  governmental bodies like provinces and  municipalities are responsible for their own  information security.  14 Centralization and Decentralization in French History, John Loughlin  15 https://www.oecd.org/regional/regional-policy/Netherlands-experience.pdf  16 The French national Cyber and Information security Agency  17 https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/cybersecurity-in-france/ciip-in-france/  National CSIRTs  and OES are the  entity in charge  of IR for 51% of  the respondents  https://www.oecd.org/regional/regional-policy/Netherlands-experience.pdf https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/cybersecurity-in-france/ciip-in-france/  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  17  Some sectors do not (yet) have a CSIRT but there  are Information Sharing and Analysis Centre  (ISACs) for more sectors than defined in the NISD.  Incident Response layout and operational set-up  Competent authorities in charge of Incident Response  The Agence Nationale de la Sécurité des  Systèmes d’Information or ANSSI (and more  precisely CERT-FR, the national CSIRT) is in  charge of IR for the 12 NISD sectors identified.  OES are in charge of Incident Response for the  Energy, Transport, Banking and financial services,  the Drinking water supply and distribution, and the  Financial market infrastructure sectors.  The Water, Health and Digital Infrastructure  sectors have a sectoral CSIRT.  Sectoral CSIRT roles  There are no sectoral CSIRTs in France, but  mature sectors have created sectorial cyber  expertise groups.  Sectoral CSIRTs roles depend on the sector and  maturity of the CSIRT. NCSC-NL encourages  sectoral CSIRTs to develop towards supplying all  elements of the NISD-framework.  All ISACs are  mature and have been in operation for years.  Authority to which to report incidents  For each sector, OES have to report incidents to  the national CSIRT.  For the Energy, Transport, Banking and financial  services, drinking water supply and distribution,  and Financial market infrastructure sectors,  incidents must be reported to the national CSIRT  and the sectoral competent authority.  For the Water, Health and Digital Infrastructure  sectors, incidents must be reported to the Sectoral  CSIRTs and the sectoral competent authority.  Main challenge identified for the implementation of the NIS Directive within sectors  Organisational challenge: find the right  governance model between national and sectoral  actors.  Organisational challenge: find the right  governance model between national and sectoral  actors.  Regulatory challenge: develop the right legal  framework enabling the uptake of security  requirements and the notification of incidents.  The national CSIRT’s mandates and financial resources also strongly impact the sectoral  Incident Response layout and set-up.  Within each Member State, National CSIRTs can have different mandates, among others:   Raising awareness on threats;   Identifying risks;   Protecting and hardening systems;   Deterring attacks;   Monitoring and detecting incidents;   Responding to incidents;   Recovering from incidents;   Integrating and disseminating lessons learned.  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  18  As an illustration, when building CERT-UK, the United Kingdom’s national CSIRT, the UK  Cabinet Office identified 47 possible functions of a national CSIRT, but ultimately prioritised only  four in the creation of CERT-UK18.  Another interesting case to mention is the Czech Republic layout. The Czech governmental  CERT constituency is consists of owners of important information networks and providers of  essential services (energy, etc.). The national CSIRT provides Incident handling for all other  subjects within the sectors and some private subject have their own IR teams19. Hence, there  are no sectoral CSIRTs in the Czech Republic.  The research highlighted that several national CSIRTs’ mandates do not include Incident  Response, often because of a lack of resources. National CSIRTs tend to delegate functions  such as identification of Operator of Essential Services (OES) and Incident Response activities  to sectoral authorities and sectoral CSIRTs. Additionally, even if national CSIRTs do not include  the IRC, they do include and are responsible for national Incident coordination.  Table 2: Case Study Sectoral IR layout and set-up: Portugal  Sectoral IR layout and set-up: Portugal  National CSIRT Mandate  The CERT.PT is a service integrated in the Portuguese National Cybersecurity Centre that coordinates  the response to incidents involving State entities, operators of essential services, digital service  providers and, in general, the national cyberspace, including any device belonging to a network or address  block attributed to an operator of electronic communications, institution, collective or singular person  based, or physically located, on Portuguese territory.  National CSIRT – Key resources   Resources: The National Security Cabinet provides a budget to the Portuguese national CSIRT.  The National Cybersecurity authority’s budget was not increased after the transposition of the  NISD, which led to the delegation of certain tasks and responsibilities to sectoral authorities  (such as the identification of OES).  National CSIRT services   Incident Handling Coordination   Incident Reporting   On-Site Support   CSIRT Capability Building   Security Alerts  Incident Response Model - Distributed  The Portuguese National Cybersecurity Centre  The coordination of the response to incidents can be an initiative of the Portuguese National Cybersecurity  Centre, for example in the case of a large-scale incident, or it may be requested through the established  communication channels. In case of necessity or force majeure, the Portuguese National Cybersecurity  Centre coordinates with other national authorities.  The national CSIRT is in charge of:   Sorting incident notifications and technical forensic analysis;   Coordinating with the national and international entities involved;  18http://www.digitaldebates.org/fileadmin/media/cyber/National_CSIRTs_and_Their_Role_in_Computer_Security_Incident_ Response__November_2015_--_Morgus__Skierka__Hohmann__Maurer.pdf  19 Interview with the Czech National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NÚKIB)  Sectoral IR  layout depends  strongly on the  national CSIRT  mandate and  budget  http://www.digitaldebates.org/fileadmin/media/cyber/National_CSIRTs_and_Their_Role_in_Computer_Security_Incident_Response__November_2015_--_Morgus__Skierka__Hohmann__Maurer.pdf http://www.digitaldebates.org/fileadmin/media/cyber/National_CSIRTs_and_Their_Role_in_Computer_Security_Incident_Response__November_2015_--_Morgus__Skierka__Hohmann__Maurer.pdf  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  19   Producing recommendations for the mitigation and/or resolving of incidents.  The sectoral authorities are in charge of:   Identifying OES within their sectors;   Mapping dependencies;   Supervising cybersecurity.  The sectoral CSIRTs are in charge of:   Incident Management;   Artefact analysis;   Information Assurance;   Situational awareness;   Communication/outreach.  The OES in NISD sectors are in charge of:   Taking appropriate measures to prevent incidents affecting networks and information systems;   Reporting incidents to the national CSIRT.  IR in NISD sectors – Entity in charge   The OESs’ CSIRT are in charge of IR in the Energy, Transport, Health, Drinking Water, Financial  Market and Digital Infrastructure sectors (sectoral CSIRTs are planned in the Energy and  transport sectors);   A sectoral CSIRT is in charge in the Banking sector.  Impact of the NIS Directive on IR layout  The NIS Directive led to the improvement of the CSIRT/IR national layout already in place but did not  increase the national Cybersecurity authority’s budget, which is why the identification of OES was  delegated to sectoral authorities.

This could be done by using  CSIRT maturity products20.  20 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/csirt-maturity  https://www.cncs.gov.pt/en/certpt_en/ http://www.enisa.europa.eu/csirt-maturity  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  20  3.2 KEY FINDING #2  3.2.1 The NIS Directive has improved the IR organisation and  governance by clarifying actors’ roles and responsibilities  The transposition of the NIS Directive into national legislation seems to be having a positive  impact on the Incident Response (IR) landscape at national level, contributing to improved  overall organisation and governance.  Figure 4: Main features of the changes following the NIS Directive  According to national CSIRTs, the Directive has led to a clarification of the roles and  responsibilities of the various actors involved in IR at all levels, and the ongoing implementation  is leading to significant organisational changes, including:   The formal identification of OES;   The creation of sectoral CSIRTs.  This positive impact is less visible in countries with a more mature organisational layout. The  data collected indeed suggest that the NISD had an unequal effect from one country to  another.  During the survey, respondents were asked about the impact of the NISD of the set-up of their  IR capacities on a scale from 5 (high impact) to 0 (no impact). The replies show that:   10 out of 24 respondents thought that the NISD had an important impact (5 to 3);   13 out of 24 respondents thought that the NISD had a relatively small impact (2 to 0);   1 respondent did not provide an answer.  The NISD has  had a positive  impact on the  clarification of  the roles and  responsibilities  of IR  stakeholders.  13  11  15  5  5  7  3  2  11  13  9  19  19  17  21  22  0 24  Improved organisation and clarification of the IR organisation and governance  Better or increased collaboration with private sector  Clarification of the roles and responsibilities between the different actors…  Creation of new sectoral CSIRTs within national competent authorities  Creation of new CSIRTs within public and private  OES, and/ or DSP for OES  Development of sector-specific cybersecurity  and IR procedures, processes and guidelines  Increased budget available for the development of IR capabilities  Other.

The  NISD was treated as an update to the previous law and continues the way of thinking.”  (National CSIRT)  According to the results of the survey, the countries who tend to be less impacted by the  Directive are the countries with a more mature landscape who already had a clear  governance and definition of roles and responsibilities.  The evolution of the maturity of MS IR landscape could be an interesting area to further study by  using the ENISA CSIRT Maturity Toolkit21 based on SIM3 (https://opencsirt.org/maturity/sim3/).  These mixed results highlight the fact that there are still important differences between Member  States’ cybersecurity landscape and IRC at large.  3.2.2  Lessons learned and recommendations   Based on received data, it would be interesting to have another round of analysis to evaluate  the mid- and long-term impacts of the NIS Directive on IR layout once the NISD has been  completely implemented in all the MS.  It would be useful to conduct a maturity assessment of sectoral CSIRT landscape within NISD  sectors (using ENISA CSIRT Maturity Toolkit as a basis) and to identify future changes.  21 http://enisa.europa.eu/sas-tool  “The NISD didn’t  change much,  since we were  working in the  same way  before.”  (National CSIRT)  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  5 (highly) 4 3 2 1 0 (not at all) NA  https://opencsirt.org/maturity/sim3/ http://enisa.europa.eu/sas-tool  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  22  3.3 KEY FINDING #3  3.3.1 The implementation of the Directive raises operational and  regulatory challenges and highlights MS willingness to move forward by  extending the scope and number of sectors targeted  Following the transposition of the Directive into national legislation, EU Member States are now  in the process of implementing the regulation. The two main challenges raised by respondents  and confirmed by sectoral experts are regulatory and operational.  Figure 6: Assessment of the challenges faced during the implementation of the NISD  The legal and administrative definition of what constitutes an OES can pose a challenge  for the authority in charge of defining the list of OES within the NISD Sectors. There are two  issues in defining the OES:   The legal definition and threshold/criterion of what constitutes an OES;   The administrative identity of the OES: Name, headquarter, VAT number, etc.  The threshold and criterion to identify the OES are defined by the authority which can be the  national cybersecurity authority, the sectoral authority or another competent authority. The  Directive provides an initial list of entities, but each MS has to define the thresholds and criterion  for the sectors which can be based on quantitative aspects (share of market, tons of freight,  etc.).  NISD  implementation  poses regulatory  and operational  challenges  6  8  6  8  2  10  11  10  12  12  0 12 24  Organisation challenge: find the right governance model  between national and sectoral actors  Regulatory challenge: to develop the right legal framework enabling the  uptake of security  requirements and the notification of…  Operational challenge: to establish effective  response and trusted collaboration mechanisms among sectoral actors  Capability challenge: to ensure that sectoral actors  have the necessary IR expertise and capacities  Technical challenge: to develop and/or adopt  the relevant IR tools at a sectoral level  5 (strongly agree) 4 3 2 1 (not agree at all)  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  23  Table 3: Case-study: Maritime transport OES definition & threshold (United Kingdom)  Definitions and thresholds for identification of Operators of Essential Services in the United  Kingdom maritime transport sector22  Essential service Identification Thresholds  Shipping  A shipping company which handles  (a) over 5 million tonnes of total annual freight at UK ports; and  (b) over 30% of the freight at any individual UK port which fulfils at least one of  the following criteria:  (I) handles more than 15% of UK total roll-on roll-off traffic; (II) handles more  than 15% of UK total lift-on lift-off traffic; (iii) handles more than 10% of UK  total liquid bulk traffic; or (iv) handles more than 20% of UK biomass fuel traffic;  or  A shipping company with over 30% of the annual passenger numbers at any  individual UK port which has annual passenger numbers greater than 10  million.  Provision of services  by a harbour authority  A harbour authority (as defined in section 313(1) of the Merchant Shipping Act  1995) which  (a) has annual passenger numbers greater than 10 million; or (b) fulfils at least  one of the following criteria:  (i) handles more than 15% of UK total roll-on roll-off traffic;  (ii) handles more than 15% of UK total lift-on lift-off traffic;  (iii) handles more than 10% of UK total liquid bulk traffic; or  (iv) handles more than 20% of UK biomass fuel traffic.  Provision of services  by an operator of a  port facility  (a) An operator of a port facility which handles passengers at a port which has  annual passenger numbers greater than 10 million; or  (b) An operator of a port facility at a port which fulfils at least one of the  following criteria:  (i) handles more than 15% of UK total roll-on roll-off traffic; (ii) handles more  than 15% of UK total lift-on lift-off traffic; (iii) handles more than 10% of UK  total liquid bulk traffic; or (iv) handles more than 20% of UK biomass fuel traffic;  and where that port facility operator handles the same type of freight for which  the port fulfils one of the criteria mentioned in sub-paragraphs (i)-(iv).  \"Port facility\" has the same meaning as in regulation 2 of the Port Security  Regulations 2009.  Vessel traffic services  Operator of vessel traffic services at a port which  (a) has annual passenger numbers greater than 10 million; or (b) fulfils at least  one of the following criteria:  (i) handles more than 15% of UK total roll-on roll-off traffic; (ii) handles more  than 15% of UK total lift-on lift-off traffic; (iii) handles more than 10% of UK  total liquid bulk traffic; or (iv) handles more than 20% of UK biomass fuel traffic.  \"Vessel traffic services\" has the same meaning as in regulation 2(1) of the  Merchant Shipping (Vessel Traffic Monitoring and Reporting Requirements)  Regulations 20049.  The identification of all the OES can be an operational challenge in sectors with an  extended range of suppliers and service providers. Sectors which include various public and  private actors can depend strongly on SMEs in their value chain. Should these SMEs be  targeted by a cyberattack, this could impact the entire value chain. It is therefore complex for the  22 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/506/schedule/2/made  http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/506/schedule/2/made  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  24  regulator and/or the entity in charge of listing OES (be it the national CSIRT, the Sectoral  Authority or the sectoral CSIRT) to map the dependencies and identify all the OES within the  sectors and set-up thresholds.  Finally, classifying OES can become complex in the case of large companies who have more  than one activity/branch which falls under the scope of NISD (e.g. an IXP (OES) might also  operate as a cloud provider (DSP)). This could result in a company reporting to several sectoral  authorities in a decentralised IR model, generating overlaps and duplication between the  competent authorities.  Regulatory challenge: information-sharing and incident notification  A regulatory challenge posed by the implementation of the Directive concerns information-  sharing with third countries, especially when there is not an adequate legal basis under GDPR  for such sharing. A national CSIRT analyst may find actionable information which could be of  great help for another country, but he/she may not legally be able to share this information with  that other country’s authority.  As an example, in order to mitigate relevant challenges, the transposition of the NISD into Dutch  law allows the NCSC-NL (CISRT for government and OES in the Netherlands) to share  actionable information outside of its mandate to third countries’ IR entities as long as the entity  is a CSIRT and if it is believed that the entity has the capacity to use the information and will do  so in a reasonable manner.  Moreover, it should be noted that in the case of a security breach involving personal data (as  e.g. in the bank, finance or health sector), aside reporting to the national CSIRT, the national  Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) should be notified, according to GDPR..  According to one of the interviewee, there may be a missing link between the national CSIRT  and the national Data Protection Authority, and it would be therefore interesting to think of a  communication channel between the two types of authorities covering the incidents where  personal data is part of the security breach.  Extension of the scope and number of NISD sectors  As mentioned above, the implementation of the Directive is still in progress in some Member  States, but the research highlights significant differences among national operational set-ups:  While transposing the NIS Directive into national legislation, some Member States opted for  using the 7 sectors listed in the NIS Directive (see Section 3.1 Definition) while others decided  to extend the scope and number of sectors covered:   12 out of 28 MS have extended the scope of NISD sectors and added entities not listed in  the NISD as OES.  The sectors mostly added are electronic communications/telecommunication networks (for 7 out  12 MS) and chemical Industry.  NISD  implementation  is leading to  significant  differences  among MS and,  in some MS, to  an extension of  the scope and  number of  sectors covered  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  25  Table 4: Extended scope of sectors and OES  NISD transposition into national legislation – extended scope of the sectors (examples)  Different and/or additional sectors identified  Different and/or additional categories of OES  included  Cyprus  Additional sectors considered: electronic  communications, wastewater, food, government  and national security/ emergency services and  environmental.

The bill proposes to expand to two new sets of  entities: (i) \"infrastructures of special public  interest\"; and (ii) operators with \"cyber-criticality\".  The definition of \"infrastructures in the special  public interest\" covers companies in three different  sectors: (i) defence; (ii) cultural and media sector;  and (ii) \"companies of considerable economic  importance\".

The NIS Directive is one of the three key drivers for the creation of sectoral CSIRTs, along with  lessons learned from past incidents and the lack of sector-specific knowledge of the national  CSIRT, according to the respondents.  “[The creation of the sectoral CSIRT was driven by] a need to collaborate and coordinate  Incident Response against ongoing cyberattacks” (Sectoral CSIRT)  Figure 7: Key drivers to create sectoral IR capabilities  Demand-driven  For 8 out of 24 respondents, the creation of sectoral IRC was driven by lessons learned from  past incidents while for 6 out of 24 respondents it was the lack of either sector-specific  knowledge or national CSIRT capacities. In other words, according to the survey, a bottom-up  (demand-side) incentive favoured the creation of sectoral IRC.  In some of the cases, operators of essential services (public or private entities) created a  sectoral CSIRT on their own initiative. This is also the case for non-EU sectoral CSIRTs such as  the NordicFin CERT which provides a good illustration of a cross-border sectoral IRC set up  prior to the publication of the NISD to respond to an operational need.  6  6  8  1  2  3  8  8  6  13  12  10  The implementation of the NIS Directive  The lack of sector-specific knowledge  or capacity of the National CSIRT  Lessons learnt from past incidents  The difficulties of managing the cybersecurity  incidents in the NISD sectors  The complexity of managing the high number  of OES in some of the NISD sectors  Other.

They adopted digital financial services such as  online banking, digital investment services or online provision of credit early, as illustrated in  the chart below.  According to The Bank of Finland Bulletin, “Not only have banks in the Nordic countries  invested in digitalisation; the position of new FinTech actors is also better in the Nordic region  than in many other countries.”  This growing digitalisation of the Nordic financial sectors opened new vulnerabilities to cyber  threats.  A need to collaborate to better respond to an increasing number of cyber attacks  From 2007 to 2016, Nordic countries experienced numerous attacks on their financial sector.  In 2007, Norway was targeted by their first internet banking malware attacks. Between 2008  and 2011, financial operators collaborated through both formal and informal schemes to  respond to cyber incidents. In 2012, Sveriges Riksbank (central bank of Sweden) was hit by  a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack which left its website offline for 5 hours. In  2014, a DDoS attack on seven large financial institutions in Norway resulted in suspended  services for an entire day. In Finland, at the end of 2014, three banks (Op Pohjola, Danske  Bank and Nordea) suffered DDoS attacks that rendered their online services unavailable and  for one bank prevented customers from withdrawing cash and making card payments.  Lessons learned from incident called for IR cooperation at national level  In 2012, in Norway, while the National Cyber Security Strategy was in the process of being  created, the country experienced a peak of attacks and decided to set up a national platform,  FinansCERT, dedicated to responding to cyber threats targeting the financial sector.  FinansCERT was created to formalise collaboration between relevant actors, and actively  cooperates with the national CSIRT and with the law enforcement computer crime unit.  FinansCERT Norway, based in Oslo, was operational from 2013 to 2017.  A demand from operators to create a cross-border capability to collaborate to fight  cybercrime  In 2017, the largest banks operating in the Nordic countries, namely Nordea, Danske Bank  and DNB worked on a project to set-up a single payment clearance system which would be  operated by one company for all the Nordic countries. To secure this project and face a  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  29  growing number of attacks, Danske Bank, Nordea, DNB, Sparebank 1 and Eika Group,  among other Nordic banks, decided to expand FinansCERT, to develop a collaboration  platform to the entire Nordic region: Nordic Financial CERT (NordicFin CERT).  Nordic-Fin CERT mandate  The Nordic Financial CERT aims at fortifying the Nordic community in the face of cyber risks  to customer assets and at providing a safety net for all financial institutions, big and small. It  envisions a Nordic community in which the financial sector actively and responsively  identifies, defends against and combats cyber risks. The collaboration will enable the banks  to gather the best knowledge available about fighting cybercrime in the Nordic financial  sector, and it will lead to synergies that will improve both the customers’ and the banks’  security.

As a result, their sectoral capabilities are recent or still work in progress. In those cases, the NIS  Directive and the GDPR were an opportunity to justify the need for additional resources to  increase capabilities and create sectoral CSIRTs. However a major increase of financial  resources was rarely noted according to the data collected.   It was the implementation of the NIS Directive for 6 out of 24 respondents, which was the  main driver for the creation of Sectoral capabilities.  As an illustration, Bulgaria is in the process of creating seven sectoral CSIRTs as a  consequence of the transposition of the NISD in the national legislation.  In some cases, the creation of sectoral capacities is driven by both national authorities and  operators. This is the case in The Netherlands, which features many sectoral CSIRTs although  the national CSIRT (and cybersecurity agency) also play a proactive role.  The support of national CSIRTs to the development of sectoral CSIRTs and capabilities  tends to be of great added value because it capitalises on existing expertise.  A noteworthy initiative, pre-dating the NIS Directive, is that of the Dutch NCSC, which provided  incentives and guidelines to support the creation of CSIRTs:   Guidelines to start a collective CSIRT27;   Guidelines to operationalise a CSIRT: NCSC’ CSIRT Maturity Toolkit28.  NCSC-NL also appointed a liaison officer whose mission was to follow the creation of sectoral  CSIRTs. The liaison officer came to the sectoral CSIRT’s premises 2 days a week to support  the newly created team.  27 Guidelines to start a collective CSIRT  28 https://english.ncsc.nl/get-to-work/cooperation/i-would-like-to-strengthen-my-collaboration/csirt-maturity-toolkit  The support of  national CSIRT to  develop and  enhance Sectoral  IRC is key to  capitalise on  existing  expertise  https://www.bofbulletin.fi/en/2018/2/nordic-banks-go-digital/ https://www.nordea.com/en/press-and-news/news-and-press-releases/press-releases/2017/04-10-08h00-nordic-banks-collaborate-on-fighting-cybercrime.html https://www.nordea.com/en/press-and-news/news-and-press-releases/press-releases/2017/04-10-08h00-nordic-banks-collaborate-on-fighting-cybercrime.html https://english.ncsc.nl/binaries/ncsc-en/documents/publications/2019/juli/02/ncsc-guide-collective-csirt/NCSC_Guide_Collective_CSIRT.pdf https://english.ncsc.nl/get-to-work/cooperation/i-would-like-to-strengthen-my-collaboration/csirt-maturity-toolkit  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  30  It also worth mentioning that countries with a centralised Incident Response model tend not to  have, nor to plan to develop specific sectoral CSIRT capabilities since the national CSIRT tend  to have sectoral IR teams within its structure. In these countries, IR is directly managed by the  OES and reported straight to the National CSIRT or governmental CSIRT such as in Czech  Republic (see Key Finding 1).  6 out of 24 respondents confirmed that there are no sectoral CSIRTs in their country.  “Currently we do not provide sectoral CSIRTs and there is no plan to create any” (National  CSIRT)  100% of respondents with no sectoral CSIRT have a centralised IR model with national CSIRT  as the competent authority for NISD sectors.  “We don’t tend to use sectoral CSIRTs but [the national CSIRT] ’s Engagements Team do  maintain close contact with all NISD sectors.” (National CSIRT)  3.4.2 Lessons learned and recommendations   Sectoral actors could benefit from the experience and knowledge of national and other  sectoral CSIRTs, for instance through the appointment of a liaison officer, sharing of know-  how, expert advice or tailored training.   ENISA should continue to collect available resources (guidelines and toolkits), for example by  enabling a GitHub repository.  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  31  3.5 KEY FINDING #5  3.5.1 National CSIRTs have developed mature reporting processes and  notification tools, as have sectoral CSIRTs who provide solutions  specific to their sectors’ needs  The nature of the capabilities developed and used by sectoral CSIRTs in contrast with national  CSIRTs strongly depends on the range of services that both can provide to their constituents.  According to FIRST “CSIRT Services Framework29”, CSIRTs can provides various cyber  security services and functions:  Table 6: FIRST’CSIRT Services Framework V2.0  Services Areas Services Functions  Information Security  Event Management  Monitoring and detection  Log and sensor management, Detection use  case management, Contextual data  management  Analysing Correlation  Information Security  Incident Management  Accepting information security  incident reports  Information security incident report receipt,  Information security incident report triage and  processing,  Analysing information security  incidents  Information security incident triage  (prioritization and categorization), Information  collection, Coordinate any more detailed  analysis, Information security incident root  cause analysis, Cross-incident correlation.

To provide this specific  service, both National CSIRTs and Sectoral CSIRT have developed and/or use mature  reporting processes and notification tools to allow citizens, OES and other private or public-  sector organisations to report incidents.  Notification and reporting tools of national CSIRTs and sectoral CSIRTs  According to the survey, 83% of respondents use incident notification templates and 100% have  specific information-exchange tools to enable the notification of incidents.  The reporting tools used by both national CSIRT and sectoral CSIRT identified through the  survey and the desktop research are:    Email-based reporting tools (secured and/or encrypted), Secured networks/chats, Web forms,  notification portals, collaboration portal, in-house developed tools (in-house notification portal,  customized tool based on RTIR30).  30 RTIR - Request Tracker for Incident Response (RTIR) is the premier open source incident handling system targeted for  computer security teams. We worked with over a dozen CERT and CSIRT teams around the world to help you handle the  ever-increasing volume of incident reports. RTIR builds on all the features of Request Tracker.  REPORTING TOOLS  Email-based reporting  tools (secured and/or  encrypted), Secured  networks/chats, Web  forms, notification  portals, collaboration  portal, in-house  developed tools (in-  house notification  portal).  OTHER TOOLS  Early detection  systems, monitoring  systems, Industrial  control systems,  Threat intels systems,  Malware Information  Sharing Platform  (MISP), IntelIMQ,  information sharing  platforms and tools.  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  33  The other tools identified are:   Early detection systems, monitoring systems, Industrial control systems, Threat Intel systems,  Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP)31, IntelMQ32, information sharing platforms and  tools.  Table 7: Case study: CERT-BE, Belgium  National CSIRT, dedicated notification tools for OES (Belgium)  Context  According to Belgian law, OES have to notify 3 or 4 different authorities:   The national CSIRT (CERT-BE);   The Centre for Cyber Security Belgium (CCB);   The Sectoral Authority;   GDPR Authority (in case of data leak).  A Belgian regulation states that Belgian citizens should only have to report to one authority and not  duplicate the notification to other administrative entities, which resulted in the creation of a dedicated  portal for OES to centralise notifications and systematically transfer the incident notification to the other 3  authorities.  Notification tool for OES Description  Online dedicated portal for OES  The form is accessible online on the CSIRT-DSP  website and the notification is sent directly to both  the CSIRT and the competent Authority;  Notification tool for all33 Description  Notification by email / encrypted email  A central email address is available on the CERT- BE website. The national CSIRT also offers to  send a secure message by using an encrypted  message with PGP encryption.  Exchange of information on incidents based on  Traffic Light Protocol (TLP)34  CERT.BE uses the “Traffic Light Protocol” to  facilitate and encourage the exchange of  information in a safe manner. The protocol  requires that the person sending information  assigns it a colour code. This colour indicates if  and in what ways this information may be further  disseminated. Someone who receives information  and believes that it should be further disseminated  must first ask for permission from the sender.  Online notification form  The form is accessible online on the CERT-BE  website and includes mandatory information to fill  in.  31 The MISP threat sharing platform is a free and open source software helping information sharing of threat intelligence  including cyber security indicators. A threat intelligence platform for gathering, sharing, storing and correlating Indicators of  Compromise of targeted attacks, threat intelligence, financial fraud information, vulnerability information or even counter- terrorism information.  32 IntelMQ is a solution for IT security teams for collecting and processing security feeds using a message queuing protocol  (Github definition).  33 https://www.cert.be/en/report-incident  34 https://www.cert.be/en/traffic-light-protocol-tlp  https://www.cert.be/en/report-incident https://www.cert.be/en/traffic-light-protocol-tlp  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  34  Depending on their mandate, sectoral CSIRTs tend to offer the same range of incident  reporting and notification services as the national CSIRT, including similar notification tools  and reporting processes which rely mostly on web forms and email.  Table 8: Case study: DSP-CSIRT, The Netherlands  CSIRT for Digital Service Provider, notification tools (The Netherlands)  Context  In November 2018, the NIS Directive was transposed into Dutch legislation under the Dutch law on the  protection of networks and information systems. According to this national regulation, Digital Service  providers are required to report incidents on their networks and information systems (duty to report), and  to take security measures on their networks and information systems (duty of care)35.  As a direct effect of the Directive, a CSIRT dedicated to DSP was created (CSIRT-DSP). In case of  incident, according to the Dutch law, DSPs have to report to the CSIRT-DSP and to the Competent  Authority, which, for the DSPs, is the Radio communications Agency. In order to do so, Digital Service  Providers can use three different notification tools:  Notification tools Description  An online incident report form  The form is accessible online on the CSIRT-DSP  website and the notification is directly sent to both  the CSIRT and the competent Authority;  A telephone number  A standard number is available on the CSIRT-DSP  website. However, the report over the phone will  not be shared with the competent Authority;  An e-mail  An e-mail is available on the CSIRT-DSP website.  However, the report by email will not be shared  with the competent Authority;  However, if sectoral CSIRTs appear to use reporting and notification tools and capabilities  similar to the national CSIRTs’, they also provide services more adapted to the sector’s  specificities and needs.  Sectoral CSIRT specific capabilities and services  When asked about the main added value of sectoral CSIRT, respondents to the survey and  sectoral experts raised the following:   Better knowledge of specific sectors’ threat landscape;  By working on a more focused perimeter, sectoral CSIRTs gain robust knowledge of the specific  risks and threats targeting their sectors. As an illustration, the Dutch Health sector CSIRT, Z-  CERT36, offers specialized services to healthcare institutions by publishing regular white  papers37 on the specific threats targeting hospitals.  35 https//csirtdsp.nl/en/node/1  36 https://www.z-cert.nl/  37 https://www.z-cert.nl/nieuws  https://www.z-cert.nl/ https://www.z-cert.nl/nieuws  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  35   Better knowledge of the entire sector value-chain and better relationship with vendors;  Sectoral CSIRTs tend to have more direct contact with sectoral operators. Operators can often  register as participants to sectoral CSIRTs to better benefit from said CSIRT services. Hospitals  (ranging from academic \"UMCs\", top clinical \"STZ\" to \"general\" hospitals) as well as mental  healthcare institutions (\"GGZ\") can register with Z-CERT as participants (constituency)38.   More qualitative and operational information sharing, better sharing of good practices.  Sectoral CSIRTs provide or are used as information-exchange entities either to share identified  vulnerabilities, incidents or lessons learned. Z-CERT, for instance, informs its constituency of  any vulnerabilities detected in medical devices, medical networks and medical applications. To  those participants affected by a vulnerability, Z-CERT provides advice on how best to deal with  the situation. Z-CERT also sends out alerts regarding possible threats and current attacks. Z-  CERT shares its knowledge (through the release of whitepapers, for example) with its  participants, facilitates meetings for its participants, and hosts networking events and theme  sessions39.  Sectoral capabilities maturity assessment  When assessing the maturity of the tools and processes used by national and sectoral CSIRT,  two specific factors must be taken into consideration.  First, the maturity of the CSIRT itself: a more mature (see ENISA Maturity Evaluation  Methodology for CSIRTs)40 CSIRT will tend to have better developed tools and processes than  others.  In The Netherlands, the national CSIRT appointed a liaison officer to follow the creation of the  sectoral CSIRT and support their development and maturity. According to the liaison officer:  “They [Sectoral CSIRT] are growing in staff but it is challenging to find people with cyber  security skills. Besides, we have also seen growth in services, number of staff and  expertise. Our CSIRT for Municipalities and the Health-CERT have been around a couple  years now, grow in more mature CERTs every day, and expand their services from the  traditional incident response activities to activities focused on tackling more long-term  cybersecurity problems by writing advisory products and developing threat landscapes for  their constituency.”  The shortage of skilled staff for both national and sectoral CSIRT has been identified has a  recurrent issue by IR experts.  Highly regulated sectors and maturity of IRC  Secondly, reporting processes and information exchange tend to be more mature in highly  regulated sectors. As stated in the NIS Directive, requirements for notification of incidents can  be part of normal supervisory practice in the highly regulated sectors or sectors ruled by a  supervisory mechanism.  38 https://www.z-cert.nl/en  39 https://www.z-cert.nl/en  40 ENISA Maturity Evaluation Methodology for CSIRTs  There is a  shortage of  skilled staff to  conduct IR tasks  within both  national and  sectoral CSIRTs  https://www.z-cert.nl/en https://www.z-cert.nl/en https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/study-on-csirt-maturity-evaluation-process/at_download/fullReport  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  36  For example, the financial sector has particular regulations which require the notification of  incidents impacting the network and information systems and call for specific IRC and  monitoring tools.  “Financial institutions are particularly exposed to cyber risk due to their reliance on critical  infrastructures and their dependence on highly interconnected networks. Critical financial  market infrastructures include payment and settlement systems, trading platforms, central  securities depositories, and central counterparties.”41  The Financial and banking sectors are targeted by increasingly frequent and sophisticated  cyber-attacks. According to an IMF study on cyber risks (Cyber Risk for the Financial Sector: A  Framework for Quantitative Assessment, WP/18/143, July 2018)42, cyber-attacks targeting the  financial sectors can have several effects:   Business disruptions prevent firms from operating, resulting in loss revenue;   Fraud leads to direct financial losses;   Data breaches take more time to materialize, through reputational effects as well as litigation  costs.  To tackle these risks and avoid cascading effects at European level, the European Central Bank  (ECB) conducted a thematic review on cyber security risk in 2015 (prior to the NIS Directive)  and targeted on-site inspection43. In 2016, the ECB Banking supervision has implemented a  cyber-incident reporting framework as a pilot scheme which was rolled out to the  banking institutions in 201744. All significant institutions from the 19 Eurozone countries have  to report significant cyber incidents as soon as they detect them. This enables supervisors to  identify and monitor trends in cyber incidents affecting significant institutions and to gain a  deeper knowledge of the cyber threat landscape. It also allows for a swifter reaction to a  potential crisis caused by a cyberattack45.  Table 9: Case study: TIBER-EU - threat intelligence-based ethical red-teaming framework  ECB - TIBER-EU  TIBER-EU Context and Framework  TIBER-EU is the European framework for threat intelligence-based ethical red-teaming. It is the first EU- wide guide on how authorities, entities, threat intelligence and red-team providers should work together  to test and improve the cyber resilience of entities by carrying out a controlled cyberattack.  TIBER-EU was jointly developed by the ECB and the EU national central banks, approved by the  Governing Council of the ECB and published in May 2018. It was inspired by and takes into account the  lessons learned from similar initiatives in the United Kingdom (CBEST) and the Netherlands (TIBER-NL).  The TIBER-EU framework is currently (being) implemented in Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and the  Netherlands, as well as by the ECB in its oversight capacity. Other jurisdictions are expected to follow  soon.  Functioning  TIBER-EU tests mimic the tactics, techniques and procedures of real-life attackers, based on bespoke  threat intelligence. They are tailor-made to simulate an attack on the critical functions of an entity and its  underlying systems, i.e. its people, processes and technologies. The outcome is not a pass or fail;  41 Bouveret, A., Cyber Risk for the Financial Sector: A Framework for Quantitative Assessment, 2018  42 https://www.imf.org/~/media/Files/Publications/WP/2018/wp18143.ashx  43 https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/press/publications/newsletter/2017/html/ssm.nl170517_3.en.html  44 Ibid.  45 https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/cyber-resilience/html/index.en.html  https://www.imf.org/~/media/Files/Publications/WP/2018/wp18143.ashx https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/press/publications/newsletter/2017/html/ssm.nl170517_3.en.html https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/cyber-resilience/html/index.en.html  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  37  instead the test is intended to reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the tested entity, enabling it to  reach a higher level of cyber maturity.  Participants  The main participants in a TIBER-EU test are assigned to one of five different teams depending on their  role and responsibilities:  Blue team – the people in the entity that is the subject of the test and whose prevention, detection and  response capabilities are being tested without their foreknowledge  Threat intelligence provider – the company that looks at the range of possible threats and carries out  reconnaissance on the entity  Red team provider – the company that carries out the simulated attack by attempting to compromise the  critical functions of the entity by mimicking a cyber attacker  White team – a small team within the target entity who are the only ones there who know a test is  happening and that leads and manages the test in collaboration with the TIBER cyber team  TIBER cyber team – the team within the authority that is responsible for overseeing the test and making  sure it meets the requirements of the TIBER-EU framework, thus enabling mutual recognition of the test  by relevant authorities.

ENISA and sectoral  authorities should collaborate more if possible to streamline IRC-related guidelines or good  practices within the future regulation.   The mitigation of the shortage of skilled staff for IR activities at both national and sectoral level  should be a priority for MS. Innovative methods to attract and retain skilled staff could be  studied along with relevant incentives such as training building on existing practices within the  Member States.  https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/cyber-resilience/tiber-eu/html/index.en.html  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  38  3.6 KEY FINDING #6  3.6.1 There is a multiplication of information-exchange tools to facilitate  cooperation at sectoral, national and EU/international level, but the  quality of the exchange depends on both organisational and structural  criteria  The importance of sharing information is widely recognised among Member States, highlighted  by a growing number of initiatives to foster cooperation through information exchange at  national, European and international level.  These initiatives can take very different forms:   Cooperation agreements;   Cooperation and information platforms;   Dedicated fora, communities and networks;   ISACs and other information centres.  Sectoral initiatives at national level  There is a multiplication of initiatives such as ISACs, networks and fora at national level to foster  information exchange and increase awareness among stakeholders within a sector. Certain fora  and communities were created in the early 2000’s but a growing number are currently being  created to respond to the need of information exchange.  Table 10: Information exchange initiatives at national level within sectors  Information exchange initiatives at national level – sectoral illustrations & good practices  Luxembourg  The Luxembourg Bankers’ Association (ABBL) has put in place the Trust and Cybersecurity Committee  (TCS). The TCS Committee’s purpose is to promote Cybersecurity and Information Risk information  across the banking sector, as well as to act as a connector between the various actors on the market.  The members of the TCS Committee gather for quarterly plenary sessions at the Luxembourg House of  Finance in order to openly exchange on the current threat landscape, regulatory and supervisory aspects  and general market practices regarding cyber risks.  Portugal  The Civil Aviation authority organise workshops to share good practices and lessons learned with its  constituent. This information can also be share with the National CSIRT and at EU-level.  Spain  The Industrial Cybersecurity Centre (CCI) was created in in June 2013 to boost and improve industrial  cybersecurity in Spain and Spanish-speaking Latin America, defining industrial cybersecurity as \"the set  of practices, processes and technologies, designed to manage cyberspace's risk associated to the  management, process, storage and transmission of information used by industrial infrastructures, from  the points of view of people, processes and technologies\".46  The activities of the Centre, focused on provide maximum benefits to its members and sponsors are  ruled by the following strategic objectives:   Conglomerate the main experts and actors in industrial cybersecurity in order to facilitate the  exchange of experience and information and be kept up to date on the last technologies and  improvements on this subject.  46 https://www.cci-es.org/en/mision  https://www.cci-es.org/en/mision  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  39   Provide awareness on the current state of cybersecurity, paying special attention to new  threats and attack techniques.   Set communication channels with authorities and lawmakers in order to ease communication  among the different actors involved in industrial cybersecurity (government, industrial  associations, critical infrastructures, engineers, integrators, vendors, consulting firms,  associations, standard and good practice developers and citizens).   Improve awareness among all the actors through courses, events, seminars, publications and  a presence in the media.   Qualify professionals on industrial cybersecurity in order to facilitate hiring.   Improve and expand the Spanish and Latin American industrial cybersecurity market.  Trans-sectoral initiatives at national level  According to the survey, 55% of respondents have a network of IR actors at a national or  sectoral level to exchange good practices on cyber information exchange, capabilities,  cooperation etc. to support the development of OES IRC.  National CSIRTs have developed dedicated platforms for information exchange and  cooperation which are open to OES from all NISD sectors.  Table 11: Information exchange initiatives at national level cross-sectors  Information exchange initiatives at national level – trans-sectoral examples & good practices  Belgium – TIP & MiSP  The Belgian Threat Intel Platform (TIP)47 is a transversal information-exchange platform initially created  for Law enforcement and Intelligence stakeholders to share threat intelligence and was later partially  opened to OES. Within the TIP, OES from all sectors will have access (Belgium is still in the process of  designating OES) to the TIP to receive threat intelligence about their sector.  The Belgian Malware Formation Sharing Platform (MISP) is publicly accessible, but users can set up  private dedicated sectoral communities to exchange information on sectoral incidents.  Poland – N6 Project  The n6 project48 was designed and developed entirely at CERT Polska as a platform for acquisition,  processing and exchange of information regarding Internet threats. It is operational since February 2012.  Within the n6 project, millions of security events are processed daily in an automated manner. The goal  is efficient, reliable and fast delivery of large volumes of network incident data to interested parties:  network owners, administrators and Internet Service Providers. The project disseminates information  gathered from various security systems operated by security organizations, software vendors,  independent researchers, etc.  The core element of n6 is its engine responsible for sorting and managing flow of data. Sorting and  delivering data to appropriate parties is made possible by a flexible tagging system, which defines  categories of incoming data and addresses specific interest.  The Netherlands - NDN  The National Detection Network (NDN)49 is a partnership for better and faster detection of digital dangers  and risks. By sharing information about threats, parties can take appropriate measures in a timely  manner under their own responsibility, to limit or to prevent possible damage.  47 Interview with CERT-BE  48 https://www.cert.pl/en/projekty/n6-network-secident-exchange/  49 Interview with NCSC-NL  https://www.cert.pl/en/projekty/n6-network-secident-exchange/  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  40  United Kingdom – CiSP  The Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership (CiSP) is a joint industry and government initiative  set up to exchange cyber threat information in real time, in a secure, confidential and dynamic  environment, increasing situational awareness and reducing the impact on UK business.50  Initiatives at European / regional level  Several initiatives were identified at both European and regional level to support the creation  and/or the uptake of tools facilitating the exchange of technical information about incidents.  Table 12: Information exchange initiatives at European level  Information exchange initiatives at European level (examples)  Initiatives Description  Trans-sectoral  CSIRT Network51  The CSIRT Network is a network composed of EU Member States’  appointed CSIRTs and CERT-EU (“CSIRTs Network members”).  The European Commission participates in the network as an  observer. ENISA is tasked to actively support the CSIRTs’  cooperation, provide the secretariat and active support for incident  coordination upon request.  The CSIRT Network provides a forum where members can  cooperate, exchange information and build trust. Members will be  able to improve the handling of cross-border incidents and even  discuss how to respond in a coordinated manner to specific  incidents.  European Government CERTs  (EGC) group52  The EGC group forms an informal association of governmental  CERTs in Europe. Its members effectively co-operate on matters  of incident response by building upon a fundament of mutual trust  and understanding due to similarities in constituencies and  problem sets.  To achieve this goal, the EGC members:   Jointly develop measures to deal with large-scale or  regional network security incidents   Facilitate information sharing and technology exchange  relating to IT security incidents and malicious code  threats and vulnerabilities   Identify areas of specialist knowledge and expertise that  could be shared within the group   Identify areas of collaborative research and development  on subjects of mutual interest   Communicate common views with other initiatives and  organizations  Transport  EU Aviation ISAC  An EU Aviation ISAC is being created which will exist alongside  two existing entities: ECCSA and the US Aviation ISAC.  The need for a European-based Aviation ISAC was expressed by  European industry members, OEMs and Airlines who saw a need  to organise and collaborate in the realm of cyber security and in  the field of intelligence and analysis sharing for the aviation sector.  50 https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/section/keep-up-to-date/cisp  51 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirts-network  52 http://www.egc-group.org/  https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/section/keep-up-to-date/cisp https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirts-network http://www.egc-group.org/  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  41  Finance  FI-ISAC53  The FI-ISAC exists since 2008 as an independent organisation  and is well integrated with European and MS banking institutions  and EU organisations such as ENISA, Europol, the European  Central Bank, European Payment Council and the European  Commission.

The mission of the European FI-ISAC is information exchange on  e- and m-channel, cards, central systems and all ICT related topics  including:   Cyber-criminal activity affecting the financial community   Vulnerabilities, technology trends and threats   Incidents and case-studies  This information exchange helps each member and the banks in  its member state, to raise awareness on potentials risks, and  provides an early warning on new threats and Modus Operandi's.  Energy  EE-ISAC54  The European Energy - Information Sharing & Analysis Centre  (EE-ISAC) is an industry-driven, information sharing network of  trust. Both private utilities and solution providers and (semi)public  institutions such as academia, governmental and non-profit  organizations share valuable information on cyber security & cyber  resilience.  EE-ISAC enables the European utility industry to:   Set up long lasting relationships of trust with partners  across the entire value chain   Share both real-time data & analysis within small scale  trust-circles   Learn from their peer's experiences with grid security  incidents and cyber breaches   Compare & evaluate security solutions, both from a  technical and operational viewpoint   Benefit from an open dialogue with industry partners and  suppliers  According to the respondents of the survey, the three most used groups to exchange with peers  at European and international level are the CSIRT Network55 (27%), the TF CSIRT56 (23%) and  the FIRST Community57 (22%).  53 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cross-cooperation-for-csirts/finance/european-fi-isac-a-public-private-partnership  54 https://www.ee-isac.eu  55 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirts-network  56 https://tf-csirt.org/  57 https://www.first.org/  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cross-cooperation-for-csirts/finance/european-fi-isac-a-public-private-partnership https://www.ee-isac.eu/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirts-network https://tf-csirt.org/ https://www.first.org/  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  42  27%  22% 12%  23%  12%  4% The CSIRT Network  The FIRST community  The European Government CERTs (EGC) group  The TF-CSIRT  Other (specify in comments)  All  Do not know  Figure 8: Main groups use to exchange with peers  A discrepancy was identified between the quantitative data collected through the survey and  complementary interviews on the use of the European Government CERTs (EGC)58 group. Only  12% of survey respondents (8 out the 17 National CSIRTs) use the EGC group to exchange IR  good practices and experience, but the interviews with IR experts indicate that there are more  frequent and qualitative exchange within this community which could be explained by the fact  that not all EGC members have participated to the survey.  Cross-border initiatives  Cross-border cooperation relies mostly on information-sharing between MS (peer to peer  exchange in regional communities) and cooperation agreements with other national CSIRTs.   78% of respondents to the survey have specific measures in place to inform the relevant  actors (national authorities and OES) in neighbouring countries about an incident that may  impact them.  58 http://www.egc-group.org/  http://www.egc-group.org/  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  43  0 12 24  Description of the incident and IOCs  Services affected  Indicators to measure the nature and impact in addition to…  Please specify  Cross border impact  Root cause  Severity  Current situation of the incident (actions taken or needed,…  Lessons learnt  Other. Please Specify  Yes No NA  Figure 9: Assessment of the nature of specific measures to inform relevant actors in  neighbouring countries about a cross-border incident  Quality and efficiency of information sharing in sustainable communities  The multiplication of networks and initiatives, however encouraging and a sign of rising  awareness on the need to facilitate information exchange, must also be evaluated in terms of  quality of the exchange within these fora.  Certain fora were created in response to legitimate sectoral needs. Yet these fora can lack the  organisational and structural means to sustain the efficiency of information-sharing, thus  undermining their raison d’être.  As an illustration, the European Cyber Security Organisation (ECSO) published a position paper  on the creation of a European Energy ISAC59 which the paper claims lacks visibility among most  European energy operators. In ECSO’s opinion, “EE-ISAC carries out many activities but the  main outcomes and benefits of the organisation are not clear. In addition, EE-ISAC involves  only a few energy operators whereas they should be strongly represented to drive the ISAC  activities according to the energy sector’s needs.”  Several factors are currently or could in the future jeopardise the quality and efficiency of the  information-sharing initiatives such as:   A lack of representativity and visibility within the sector: if there are multiple communities  or platforms aiming the same objective within a given sector and if the communication and  dissemination resources are not sufficient to raise awareness on the existence of the  initiatives;   A lack of financial resources: If there is not enough budget to sustain the initiative on a long  term;   A lack of trust between participants: within over-sized fora with too many stakeholders, it  can be challenging to build trust to allow fruitful exchanges among participants;  59 https://ecs-org.eu/documents/publications/5c0a6a3aac673.pdf  Information-  sharing  communities and  fora need  resources to  sustain the  efficiency  https://ecs-org.eu/documents/publications/5c0a6a3aac673.pdf  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  44   A fear of penalty for the voluntary reporting of incident caused by human error: when  reporting human errors, stakeholders should be ensured not to be blamed or penalised to  encourage sharing of lessons learned.  Finally, information sharing at sectoral level can also raise operational challenges:  According to one of the interviewees, “one of the difficulties is how to make sure the right  knowledge and information will reach all relevant organisations. On top of that, you want to  have a feedback loop where information flows from the national CSIRT to the sectoral CSIRT to  the individual organisations, it should not be a one-way-street.  Other challenges involve the fact that OES have a notification requirement to their Single Point  of Contact and sectoral regulator, but not always to their sectoral CSIRT, which can sometimes  make the information sharing and notification duties a complex set of responsibilities. In  addition, there is a risk of inefficiency.”  Finally, it can sometimes be challenging for Sectoral CSIRT and OES to assess when a threat  or an incident can also have impact for other sectors and should be shared. In case a major  incident which could have impacts in national security the National CSIRT would be in direct  contact with the OES, and the Sectoral CSIRT in hybrid or distributed IR models. This situation  could raise the question to delegate national security tasks to private sectoral CSIRTs.  This is why it seems like both a continuous exchange with national CSIRT and cross-sectors  communication channel could be important to set-up or maintain at national level. This would  allow to share the work and avoid that several CSIRTs (national and sectoral) analyse the  same threat or event and does not share the analysis. Therefore, there it would mitigate the  risk of doing double work with the already limited cyber security resources.  3.6.2 Lessons learned and recommendations   ENISA could further study the drivers to sustain information-sharing initiatives, develop a set  of guidelines, user-friendly tools and enablers (such as “Secure Group Communications for  incident response and operational communities”60 and “Proactive detection of network security  incidents - incident response tools mapping” ) .   Dedicated collaboration schemes at MS level could avoid duplication of efforts and ensure  that all relevant stakeholders are informed such as user-friendly cross-sectoral communication  tools or channels between several authorities (NISD and GDPR authorities).   The anonymised voluntary reporting of human errors should be encouraged and supported to  ensure that lessons learned are widely disseminated.   The promotion of responsible disclosure programs of vulnerabilities at sectoral level should be  foster.  60 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/secure-group-communications  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/secure-group-communications  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  45  3.7 KEY FINDING #7  3.7.1 There is a growing interest in training to enhance and foster  preparedness in NISD sectors at European level  The NISD encourages MS to foster their preparedness by requiring the establishment of  appropriate measures such as the creation of CSIRTs. Many MS have placed increasing cyber  preparedness, in particular that of NISD sectors, as a priority in their national cyber security  strategy.  Although, it was difficult to measure how this priority is concretely implemented at operational  level, one of the key areas identified to increase preparedness is the set-up of training.  According to the FIRST CSIRTs services framework:  “A training and education programme can help the CSIRT to establish relationships, and to  improve the overall cybersecurity posture of its constituency, including the ability to  prevent future incidents from happening. Such a programme can help maintain user awareness,  help the constituency understand the changing landscape and threats, train the  constituency on tools, processes and procedures related to security and incident  management.  This can be done through various types of activities including documenting the knowledge, skills  and abilities (KSAs) required, developing educational and training materials, delivering content,  mentoring, and professional and skill development. Each of these activities will collectively  contribute to the constituency’s and the team’s capabilities.”  According to the survey, out of 24 respondents, sector-specific cybersecurity training activities  are conducted:   Regularly: 5 National CSIRT   Occasionally: 2 National CSIRT and 3 Sectoral CSIRT   No but planned in the future: 8 National CSIRT and 1 Sectoral CSIRT   No and not planned: 1 National CSIRT   Did not provide answer: 3 National CSIRT and 1 Sectoral CSIRT  There is a need  for sector-  specific training  to mitigate  shortage of  skilled-staff  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  46  Figure 10: Sector-specific training evaluation  These answers indicate a significant interest from the sectoral CSIRT in training. It could be a  concrete way to mitigate the shortage of skills highlighted in the previous findings.  Several initiatives already exist at both national and EU level to conduct trainings on Incident  response procedures and tools.  Table 13: Case study: Good practices for training  Good practices for Training at national level – Illustrations  Initiatives Description  Belgium  CERT-BE annual training program  Every year CERT-BE organises a training programme for federal  officials.

CIRCL.LU offers courses to its members and organisations based  in Luxembourg.  In their mission to improve information security, CIRCL shares its  field experience through a set of training or technical courses. Due  to diversity of competences within the team, CIRCL is able to  provide a large diversity of information security trainings.

This could be done by first assessing  the sector-specific training needs with relevant stakeholders and identifying existing trainings  (such as TRANSITS-I, TRANSITS-II, and the ones conducted by ENISA, FIRST, etc.) to build  on their experience.   Sectoral CSIRTs might want to prioritize practical areas of IR:   Tools;   Taxonomy;   Responsible vulnerability disclosure;   Trust building;   Information sharing and developing skills and experience.  3.8 FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS  Recommendations  Actors Description  Recommendations to ENISA  Knowledge  Collect deeper insights on both national and sectoral CSIRT maturity when  the NISD will have been fully implemented;  Cooperation Favour cross sectoral knowledge between the stakeholders;  Information sharing  Continue to collect available resources to enhance IRC & enhance  information-sharing and build a repository;  Training  Develop a continuum for training activities which range from assessing  sectors trainings needs, to promote the “train-the-trainers» approach, to  continue developing sectoral trainings.  Recommendations to the IR Community  Transparency  Publish a clear list of the sectors covered within NISD at national level (same  as the NISD or extended);  Information sharing  Encourage the use of secure communication tools, common taxonomy63 and  sharing of lessons learned after incident with peers and everywhere;  The responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities should be fostered by setting  incentives;  Cooperation Build trust within communities and engage with OES and DSP;  Resources  The IR community should have adequate resources to conduct their  missions.  62 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/stock-taking-of-information-security-training-needs-in-critical-sectors  63 https://github.com/enisaeu/Reference-Security-Incident-Taxonomy-Task-Force  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/stock-taking-of-information-security-training-needs-in-critical-sectors https://github.com/enisaeu/Reference-Security-Incident-Taxonomy-Task-Force  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  48  4.

The study provides a deeper insight into  NISD sectoral Incident Response capabilities, procedures, processes and tools to identify the  trends and possible gaps and overlaps.  Incident Response Capabilities (IRC) within NISD sectors is a growing concern to tackle  potential incidents which could have a major impact on European societies and citizens. To  assess IRC, the analysis framework for the research included the following aspects:   Impact of the NIS Directive on national CSIRT/IR layout and operational set-up in the NISD  sectors;   IR cooperation and operational models within the NISD sectors   IRC development in the NISD sectors   Lessons learned and recommendations.  A series of seven findings were identified while conducting the research activities.  Key Finding #1 – Member States’ organisational culture and resources tend to shape the  overall IR layout and set-up  Depending on whether a Member State’s organisational culture is centralised or decentralised,  the Incident Response layout and set-up is often structured in a similar manner, i.e. with a  central authority or instead with shared responsibilities between different actors. The main  entities in charge of Incident Response at national level, tend to be the national CSIRT and the  Operator of essential Services (OES)3. However, the mandate and the resources of the National  CSIRT or national cybersecurity authority is another important element influencing a centralised  or distributed incident response model.  Key Finding #2 – The Directive’s main positive impact was to clarify actors’ roles and  responsibilities within the IR organisation  The main positive impact of the Directive was to improve the IR organisation and governance by  clarifying actors’ roles and responsibilities. The data collected also suggest that the NISD had  an unequal effect from one country to another. Indeed, this positive impact is less visible in  Member States with a more mature layout and pre-existing national regulations to govern  incident response in NISD sectors. However, the Directive has led/is leading to the formal  identification of OES in countries who had not previously done so.  Key Finding #3 – The implementation of the NISD raises operational and regulatory  challenges for the MS regulators and competent authorities  The implementation of the Directive raises operational and regulatory challenges, in particular  for the definition of OES and competent authorities and the legal balance between sharing  1 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN#d1e1386-1-1  2 Definition in Chapter 1  3 Definition in Chapter 1  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN#d1e1386-1-1  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  5  information and respecting privacy regulations. The operational implementation of the Directive  in the Member States also highlights MS willingness to move forward since most of them  extended the number of sectors targeted and their scope.  Key Finding #4 – The success of demand or regulatory drivers for the creation of sectoral  IR entities and capabilities depends on IR layout maturity  The creation of sectoral IR entities and capabilities is driven by both operational demand and  policy regulation. A blend of bottom-up and top-down incentives could be the most efficient  driver to enhance capabilities, however an important element to take into account is the MS IR  layout maturity. In countries with a very mature or centralised IR layout, there is less need for  sectoral IRC. For all NISD sectors and/or sub-sectors, the main entities in charge of IR for 51%  of the respondents are the national CSIRT and the OES  Key Finding #5 – Sectoral CSIRTs rely on similar notification and reporting tools as  National CSIRTs but provide sector-specific knowledge and expertise to their  constituents  Both national CSIRTs and sectoral CSIRTs have developed mature reporting processes and  notification tools. The main added value of sectoral CSIRTs is to provide services specific to  their sectors’ needs, in particular a more in-depth knowledge of the threat and actor landscape,  better adapted tools and solutions and operational expertise. Sector-specific regulations which  include guidelines and requirements for reporting and management of incidents are crucial to  enhance capabilities at the sectoral level. However, there is a lack of skilled staff, making it  difficult for sectoral CSIRTs to reach full capacity.  Key Finding #6 – There is a growing number of sectoral cooperation and information-  exchange initiatives, yet they often lack visibility or resources to sustain their efficiency  There is a multiplication of information exchange tools and initiatives to facilitate cooperation at  sectoral, national, regional and EU level. These initiatives can take various forms and be more  or less formalised. This quantitative evolution is an encouraging sign but does not provide  information on the quality and outcomes of the exchanges. The long-term benefits of these  initiatives will depend on the presence of both organisational and structural elements to sustain  the efficiency of the initiatives.  Key Finding #7 – Training at sectoral level is key to foster and enhance preparedness  Training is an area of constantly growing interest for sectoral CSIRTs and for other operational  entities and it is considered as a crucial pillar of the cybersecurity value chain and IR actors’  preparedness and expertise. Interesting good practices to organise training have been gathered  by national CSIRTs, which could provide an answer to the need for skilled personnel training  opportunities.  Recommendations to ENISA   Knowledge: Collect deeper insights on both national and sectoral CSIRT maturity when the  NISD will have been fully practically implemented;   Cooperation: Bolster cross sectoral knowledge between the stakeholders;   Information sharing: Continue to collect available resources to enhance IRC & enhance  information-sharing and build a repository;  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  6   Training: Evaluate a possibility to develop a continuum for training activities which include  assessing sectors trainings needs, promoting the “train-the-trainers» approach and developing  basic sectoral trainings.  Recommendations to the IRC community (National and sectoral CSIRTs)   Transparency: Publish a clear list of the sectors covered within NISD at national level (same  as the NISD or extended);   Information sharing: Encourage the use of secure communication tools, common taxonomy  and sharing of lessons learned after incident with peers and everywhere; The responsible  disclosure of vulnerabilities should be fostered by setting incentives;   Cooperation: Build trust within communities and engage with OES and DSP;   Resources: the IR community should have adequate resources to conduct their missions.  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  7  1. OVERVIEW AND SCOPE OF  THE STUDY  1.1 CONTEXT  In 2019, ENISA is assisting European Member States (EU MS) with their Incident Response  Capabilities (IRC) by providing a state-of-the-art overview of the CSIRT landscape and  development in Europe.  This work aims to further develop and apply ENISA recommendations  for CSIRT capability development.  ENISA’s public website features both a European CSIRT inventory4 with an interactive map,  which gives an overview of the actual situation of publicly listed CSIRT teams in Europe and a  published Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 20255. These two elements  support an overall picture of current CSIRTs’ incident handling and response capabilities (IRC),  with initial facts on sectoral CSIRTs.  Following the adoption of the NIS Directive, EU Member States (MS) transposed the different  measures and guidelines into national legislation, including those focusing on OES and critical  infrastructure. For example, the NIS Directive requests MS to appoint at least one Computer  Security Incident Response Team to monitor incidents at national level and facilitate  collaboration at European level. Beyond national and/or governmental CSIRTs, operators of  essential services (OES) in the seven sectors identified in the NISD are accelerating their efforts  to build or upgrade their IRC. This effort includes the set-up of specific capabilities within the  NISD sectors and the development of sector-specific IR collaboration mechanisms and fora at  sectoral, national, EU and international level.  1.2 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY  The objective of this study is to help ENISA gain a better understanding of and draw  conclusions about the recent and current changes in the European Incident Response  landscape based on NISD requirements. This study aims to dive deeper into IRC in NISD  sectors and to study the procedures, processes and tools used either by designated CSIRTs in  particular sectors or by an entity responsible for IR in these sectors in all EU MS and collect  existing good practices from neighbouring countries.  The specific objectives of this study are:   To collect and aggregate comprehensive data on current IRC of NISD sectors;   To analyse and evaluate the recent changes since the implementation of the NIS Directive;   To identify potential gaps, overlaps and challenges in national IR procedures, processes and  tools.  To achieve these objectives a series of three research activities have been conducted in  parallel, namely desktop research of open sources, a survey of EU national and sectoral  CSIRTs (response received from 17 Member States and Norway) and complementary  interviews with sectoral IRC experts and national CSIRTs.  4 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-inventory/certs-by-country-interactive-map  5 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/study-on-csirt-landscape-and-ir-capabilities-in-europe-2025  OES in the seven  sectors identified  in the NISD are  accelerating their  efforts to build or  upgrade their  IRC.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-inventory/certs-by-country-interactive-map https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/study-on-csirt-landscape-and-ir-capabilities-in-europe-2025  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  8  Norway has also been included in the scope of the study because it provides interesting case  studies within its financial sector. The country is highly digitalised and faced important cyber-  attacks targeting their operator of essential services in the past which led them to develop  sectoral IRC before the publication of the NISD.  An overview of the methodology, an assessment and presentation of the data collection are  presented in chapter 3 and 4.  1.3 SCOPE OF THE WORK AND DEFINITIONS  This study provides data and analysis on the recent changes and evolutions of IR capabilities  (IRC) within NISD sectors in Member States (and Norway).  The study focuses on:   The impact of the NISD on the organisation and conduct (layout) of IR and on CSIRT  operational set-up in all EU MS;   The cooperation models and the capabilities (including processes, procedures and tools)  developed by MS for each NISD sector;   The way sectoral CSIRTs and other IR actors (private sector, OES) function in conjunction  with the national CSIRT in crisis/large incident situations from communication processes to  escalation procedures and incident management;   Good practices, lessons learned and key challenges in this area.  It was therefore important to agree on the definition of the key structuring concepts and  elements of the study.  The following definitions have been used in this document and shared to define the scope and  key concepts of the research:  Incident response (IR): The protection of an organisation's information by developing and  implementing an IR process (e.g. plans, defined roles, training, communications, management  oversight) in order to quickly discover an attack and effectively contain the damage, eradicate  the attacker's presence, and restore the integrity of the network and systems.6  Incident response capabilities (IRC): Incident response capabilities are the processes (e.g.  plans, defined roles, training, communications, management oversight), procedures and tools  (log analysis, Intrusion Detection Systems, Vulnerability scanners, Data Capture & Incident  Response Forensics Tools, Patch management systems, etc.) used to respond to identify,  respond and mitigate an attack, to restore continuity of service.7  Incident response models: Within the survey, a typology of four Incident Response models  have been defined:   Centralised: the national CSIRT is in charge of handling incidents across the different  sectors; it provides a centralised point for incident reporting and analysis, decision making,  response coordination, and information dissemination.   Distributed: the national CSIRT has core responsibilities to handle incidents and works with a  competent authority for each sector (e.g. national ministries or public agencies); the role of  these actors may be to facilitate incident notification and information dissemination.  6 Strategies for Incident Response and Cyber Crisis Cooperation, ENISA, August 2016.  7 Strategies for Incident Response and Cyber Crisis Cooperation, ENISA, August 2016.  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  9   Hybrid: a national CSIRT and the sectoral CSIRTs share the IR responsibilities and  operations, which may depend for example on the sector(s) impacted or the scale of the  incident.   Decentralised: a sectoral CSIRT is in charge of handling incidents in a given sector from  incident detection to response coordination and decision making, including coordinating with  other stakeholders.  National/Government (N/g) CSIRTs: Teams that serve a country’s government by helping to  protect its critical information infrastructure. N/g CSIRTs play a key role in coordinating incident  management with the relevant stakeholders at national level. They also bear responsibility for  cooperation with other countries’ national and governmental teams.8  Sectoral CSIRTs: Entities that respond to computer security or cybersecurity incidents affecting  a specific sector. Sectoral CSIRTs are usually established in NISD sectors such as Healthcare,  Public Utilities, and the Financial Sector. Unlike the National/Government CSIRTs who serve  the public sector, sectoral CSIRTs provide services to constituents from a single sector only9  (in  the context of this study, the Sectoral CSIRTs and sectors mentioned are mainly NISD sectors).  NIS Directive: The Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NISD) was  adopted by the European Parliament on 6 July 2016 and entered into force in August 2016. The  NISD provides legal measures to boost the overall level of cybersecurity in the EU.10  NISD sectors: Sectors vital for the European Union’s society and economy and heavily  dependent on ICT. Seven sectors are listed in the NIS Directive (NISD sectors), for which  Member States have been requested to identify operators of essential services (OES). The  seven sectors – and related sub-sectors - listed in the Directive11 are:   Energy (electricity, oil, gas);   Transport (air, rail, water, road);   Banking;   Financial market infrastructures;   Health sector;   Drinking water supply and distribution;   Digital Infrastructure.  Operator of Essential Services (OES): Operators of essential services are private or public  sector entities who play an important role in providing security in healthcare, transport, energy,  banking and financial market infrastructure, digital infrastructure and water supply. According to  the NIS Directive, the Member States should be responsible for determining which entities meet  the criteria of the definition of operator of essential services12.  Digital Service Provider (DSP): A digital service provider is an entity who provides one or  more of the three types of digital service:   Cloud computing services: digital services that enable access to a scalable and  elastic pool of shareable computing resources.  8 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-capabilities/baseline-capabilities  9 https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Cybersecurity/Documents/GCIv3_documents/GCI%20V3%20Reference%20model.pdf  10 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/network-and-information-security-nis-directive  11 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC  12 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-capabilities/baseline-capabilities https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Cybersecurity/Documents/GCIv3_documents/GCI%20V3%20Reference%20model.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/network-and-information-security-nis-directive https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  10   Online marketplaces: digital services that allow consumers to conclude online sales  or service contracts with traders online using computing services provided by the  online marketplace.   Online search engines: digital services that allow users to perform searches of, in  principle, all websites or websites.

METHODOLOGY AND DATA  COLLECTION  2.1 OVERVIEW OF THE METHODOLOGY  The methodology to identify, collect and analyse data on Incident Response set-up and  capabilities within the NISD sector is illustrated in the graphic below. It aggregates a succession  of steps which are presented in this chapter.  2.2 A SEVEN-STEP APPROACH  2.2.1 Step 1 – Definition of the research focus for the data collection  The research focus of the study was defined by building an analysis grid to be used to classify  the information collected on Sectoral IRC, by defining a set of analysis criteria and theme.  The list of criteria was defined according to elements of interest for ENISA and additional criteria  pertaining to the specific data sought in the context of this study (e.g. cooperation aspects,  recently created entities, etc.).  The list of criteria defined are presented in Annex 1.  Figure 2: Overview of the methodology  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  12  2.2.2 Step 2 – Desktop research in open source on NISD Sectors IRC  This step consisted in conducting a literature review and open source research to collect data  on sectoral IRC and recent trends in the field of IRC.  During this step, the research team used the pre-defined classification criteria to build an  analysis grid. The purpose of this analysis grid was to facilitate the data collection by focusing  the research work on the key topics of interest for ENISA and to present the raw data in a  structured way.  During a preliminary data collection phase, the relevant data was gathered in the data  classification grid by a first team of analysts. The preliminary data was then validated and  further enriched by a second team of analysts.  2.2.3 Step 3 – Designing and validating the survey  Publicly available information on Sectoral IRC procedures and tools was, as anticipated, not  detailed enough to provide insightful input (see part 3.1.2). It was therefore planned early on to  conduct a survey to collect comprehensive data from relevant parties.  Once the objective of the survey was defined, two categories of organisations were identified to  participate to the survey:   28 Member States’ national CSIRTs and Norway;   Additional sectoral CSIRTs from the 28MS and Norway.  Norway has also been included in the scope of the study because it provides interesting case  studies within its financial sector including FinCERT, an entity involved in the IR for Financial  sector also in other Nordic countries. The country is highly digitalised and faced important  cyber-attacks targeting their operator of essential services in the past leading to the early  creation of sectoral IRC, before the publication of the NISD.  The Project Team then drafted the survey which could be sent to both audiences considering  aspects such as data protection, privacy and legal aspects, language, size and format, and  structure.  2.2.4 Step 4 – Conducting the survey and complementary interviews  The survey was sent by ENISA to the 28 national CSIRTs and additional sectoral CSIRTs  CSIRTs that were recommended by CNW members. To maximise participation the survey  included a presentation of the study and its context.  Targeted emails were sent to relevant contacts and followed-up on, to ensure answers from a  maximum of Member States and sectors.  Following the survey, additional interviews were conducted to complement and further enrich  the data collected with the survey and desktop research with both:   National and sectoral CSIRTs who replied to the survey;   National and sectoral CSIRTs who did not reply to the survey.  A list of entities was drafted for each with a rationale for the interview which was validated by  ENISA.  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  13  Once an organisation agreed to participate in the interview, a timeslot was scheduled and a list  of 6 to 7 questions was sent to the interviewees ahead of the interview based on the answers  provided in the short questionnaire or additional element to fill in information gaps.  2.2.5 Step 5 – Collation of raw data  The raw data collected from the desktop research, the survey and the interviews, was gathered  in structured tables in a collaborative tool.  The collaborative tool allowed the aggregation of all raw data, the generation of statistics and  the identification of key input.  2.2.6 Step 6 – Analysis and identification of trends  The methodology used in this step was a qualitative use of the Delphi Method, which ensures  that the data collection team and the data analysis team benefit from and build on each other’s  expertise, and that the final analysis addresses all aspects of the request presented in a  concise, coherent and comprehensive way.  A first analysis of the raw data was made by the data collection team and the data analysis  team to develop a draft set of key findings.  Once analysis methods were applied, a first version  of the key findings of the study was drafted and subjected to validation and further discussion.  At a second stage, a virtual workshop held via videoconference was organised with members of  the ENISA Informal Expert Group on Sectoral Incident Response Capabilities13.  Once the virtual workshop was held and all final comments received, a second version of the  key findings of the study was drafted and subjected to validation and further discussion.  2.2.7 Step 7 – Final report  This final step consisted in further developing findings of specific interest to ENISA and in  drafting the final report of the study in collaboration with the member of the IEG.  2.3 OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF THE DATA & INFORMATION  AVAILABILITY  The identification of reliable and qualitative data was crucial throughout the study. For each of  the three activities conducted during the study, namely the desktop research phase, the survey  and the complementary interviews, an overall assessment the data and information availability  was conducted, and several assumptions are noteworthy.  2.3.1 Desktop research – Data collection assessment  During the open-source desktop research phase, information on IR layout and set-up were  collected for 17 out 28 Member States.   The clarity and level of information available on the national IR approach in NISD  sectors was very different from one Member States to another and not all of them had  information publicly available;   Information on procedures, processes and tools used by Sectoral IR teams were  rarely, if ever, detailed in publicly available documents;   Publicly available information about cooperation models or cross-border procedures  was not detailed;  13 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirt-cert-services/reactive-services/informal-expert-group-on-eu-ms-incident- response-development/  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirt-cert-services/reactive-services/informal-expert-group-on-eu-ms-incident-response-development/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirt-cert-services/reactive-services/informal-expert-group-on-eu-ms-incident-response-development/  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  14   Qualitative information on information exchange communities and fora were rarely, if  ever, detailed in publicly available documents.  2.3.2 Survey – data collection assessment  The survey collected answers from 24 respondents: 18 National CSIRTs and 6 Sectoral CSIRTs  from 17 Member States and Norway (knowing that the minimum planned requirement was  responses from 15 MS).   Efforts were made to cover all Member States, but the survey was conducted between  June and August, a challenging moment to find available yet relevant respondents;   A majority of respondents were National CSIRTs, resulting in the collection of input  more focused on national approaches towards IR in NISD sectors rather than  sectoral approaches and capabilities;   18 out of 24 respondents provided one or several qualitative comments through the  survey.  2.3.3 Interviews – data collection assessment  In total, 8 complementary interviews were conducted: Two with national CSIRTs representatives  and one with a Sectoral CSIRT representative who had replied to the survey. One with a  sectoral expert who did not participate to the survey and four with experts from the Informal  expert group.   Efforts were made to collect additional inputs from sectoral stakeholders. It allowed to  draft interesting case studies but not to develop an analysis at sectoral level;   The interviews allowed to get deeper insights on procedures, processes and tools  used within the interviewees’ organisation.

KEY FINDINGS  3.1 KEY FINDING #1  3.1.1 Member States’ organisational culture and resources tend to shape  IR layout and set-up  The sectoral Incident Response layout and set-up at national level across the EU is strongly  impacted by the national organisational culture of each Member State. Countries with a very  centralised state culture tend to have a centralised Incident Response model under the  supervision of the national CSIRT, whereas decentralised countries tend to have more hybrid or  decentralised models with sectoral CSIRTS in charge of Incident Response.  According to the survey and as illustrated in the graph below, the IR model is centralised or  hybrid for 90% of the respondents and 100% of countries with centralised organisational culture  have a centralised IR model.  Figure 3: Entity in charge of Incident Response by Sector  0 6 12 18 24  Energy  Electricity  Oil  Gas  Transport  Aviation  Rail  Water  Road  Banking and financial services  Health  Drinking water supply and distribution  Financial market infrastructures  Digital infrastructure  The national CSIRT A Sectoral CSIRT The OES  A DSP Other NA  The national CSIRT and the OES The Sectoral CSIRT and the OES  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  16  NB: The respondents to the survey could select the competent entity in charge of Incident  Response within each sector and sub sectors. NA is the number of respondents who did not  provide an answer for the sector or sub-sector. As an example, for the energy sector:   The national CSIRT is the entity in charge or IR for the Energy sector for 8  respondents;   A Sectoral CSIRT is the entity in charge or IR for the Energy sector for 4 respondents;   The OES are the entities in charge or IR for the Energy sector for 6 respondents;   5 respondents did not provide answer to for this sector;   Both the national CSIRT and the OES are the entities in charge or IR for the Energy  sector for 1 respondent.  Based on Figure 1, all NISD sectors and/or sub-sector, the main entities in charge of incident  response for 51% of the respondent are the national CSIRT in cooperation with the OES.  Table 1: Case study - Sectoral IR layout and set-up: France vs The Netherlands  Sectoral IR layout and set-up: centralised vs Hybrid models  France The Netherlands  Organisational Culture  French governance and society have been shaped  by a centuries-old trend towards centralization,  beginning under the French monarchs and  culminating in the French Revolution and the First  Napoleonic Empire14. At the end of the 20th  century, two major decentralisation Acts were  adopted but these progressive measures are likely  to take time to change this profoundly anchored  governance culture.  Since 1848, the Netherlands has been a  decentralised unitary state. The central  government has trust in abilities of local and  regional governments. The Minister of Interior  affairs encourages decentralisation, especially with  regard to local government, and is bound to that  by the Municipalities Act (art. 117) but the central  government guarantees the unity of state. 15  Incident Response Model  Centralised: the national CSIRT is in charge of  handling incidents across the different sectors; it  provides a centralised point for incident reporting  and analysis, decision making, response  coordination, and information dissemination.  Hybrid: a national CSIRT and the sectoral CSIRTs  share the IR responsibilities and operations, which  may depend for example on the sector(s) impacted  or the scale of the incident.  National approach towards IR in NISD sectors  In 2013, a dedicated CIIP regulatory framework  was established: the “CIIP law”. The law is  destined to apply to more than 200 public and  private operators from 12 sectors already identified  as critical in France.  Security requirements will apply only to the  operators’ most “critical information systems”.  ANSSI16 sets technical and organisational rules,  mostly basic cyber hygiene measures common to  all sectors. ANSSI can impose measures in case  of a major crisis, declared by the Prime Minister. It  lays down legal basis for action in the framework  of crisis management plans17.  The Dutch envision that every sector should set-up  their own CSIRT. One of the new ambitions of their  National Cyber Security Agenda is to create a  network of cybersecurity partnerships, including  sectoral and regional CSIRTs.  NCSC-NL is the CSIRT for the central government  and critical infrastructure providers / Operators of  Essential Services (“Rijksoverheid”). Other  governmental bodies like provinces and  municipalities are responsible for their own  information security.  14 Centralization and Decentralization in French History, John Loughlin  15 https://www.oecd.org/regional/regional-policy/Netherlands-experience.pdf  16 The French national Cyber and Information security Agency  17 https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/cybersecurity-in-france/ciip-in-france/  National CSIRTs  and OES are the  entity in charge  of IR for 51% of  the respondents  https://www.oecd.org/regional/regional-policy/Netherlands-experience.pdf https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/cybersecurity-in-france/ciip-in-france/  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  17  Some sectors do not (yet) have a CSIRT but there  are Information Sharing and Analysis Centre  (ISACs) for more sectors than defined in the NISD.  Incident Response layout and operational set-up  Competent authorities in charge of Incident Response  The Agence Nationale de la Sécurité des  Systèmes d’Information or ANSSI (and more  precisely CERT-FR, the national CSIRT) is in  charge of IR for the 12 NISD sectors identified.  OES are in charge of Incident Response for the  Energy, Transport, Banking and financial services,  the Drinking water supply and distribution, and the  Financial market infrastructure sectors.  The Water, Health and Digital Infrastructure  sectors have a sectoral CSIRT.  Sectoral CSIRT roles  There are no sectoral CSIRTs in France, but  mature sectors have created sectorial cyber  expertise groups.  Sectoral CSIRTs roles depend on the sector and  maturity of the CSIRT. NCSC-NL encourages  sectoral CSIRTs to develop towards supplying all  elements of the NISD-framework.  All ISACs are  mature and have been in operation for years.  Authority to which to report incidents  For each sector, OES have to report incidents to  the national CSIRT.  For the Energy, Transport, Banking and financial  services, drinking water supply and distribution,  and Financial market infrastructure sectors,  incidents must be reported to the national CSIRT  and the sectoral competent authority.  For the Water, Health and Digital Infrastructure  sectors, incidents must be reported to the Sectoral  CSIRTs and the sectoral competent authority.  Main challenge identified for the implementation of the NIS Directive within sectors  Organisational challenge: find the right  governance model between national and sectoral  actors.  Organisational challenge: find the right  governance model between national and sectoral  actors.  Regulatory challenge: develop the right legal  framework enabling the uptake of security  requirements and the notification of incidents.  The national CSIRT’s mandates and financial resources also strongly impact the sectoral  Incident Response layout and set-up.  Within each Member State, National CSIRTs can have different mandates, among others:   Raising awareness on threats;   Identifying risks;   Protecting and hardening systems;   Deterring attacks;   Monitoring and detecting incidents;   Responding to incidents;   Recovering from incidents;   Integrating and disseminating lessons learned.  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  18  As an illustration, when building CERT-UK, the United Kingdom’s national CSIRT, the UK  Cabinet Office identified 47 possible functions of a national CSIRT, but ultimately prioritised only  four in the creation of CERT-UK18.  Another interesting case to mention is the Czech Republic layout. The Czech governmental  CERT constituency is consists of owners of important information networks and providers of  essential services (energy, etc.). The national CSIRT provides Incident handling for all other  subjects within the sectors and some private subject have their own IR teams19. Hence, there  are no sectoral CSIRTs in the Czech Republic.  The research highlighted that several national CSIRTs’ mandates do not include Incident  Response, often because of a lack of resources. National CSIRTs tend to delegate functions  such as identification of Operator of Essential Services (OES) and Incident Response activities  to sectoral authorities and sectoral CSIRTs. Additionally, even if national CSIRTs do not include  the IRC, they do include and are responsible for national Incident coordination.  Table 2: Case Study Sectoral IR layout and set-up: Portugal  Sectoral IR layout and set-up: Portugal  National CSIRT Mandate  The CERT.PT is a service integrated in the Portuguese National Cybersecurity Centre that coordinates  the response to incidents involving State entities, operators of essential services, digital service  providers and, in general, the national cyberspace, including any device belonging to a network or address  block attributed to an operator of electronic communications, institution, collective or singular person  based, or physically located, on Portuguese territory.  National CSIRT – Key resources   Resources: The National Security Cabinet provides a budget to the Portuguese national CSIRT.  The National Cybersecurity authority’s budget was not increased after the transposition of the  NISD, which led to the delegation of certain tasks and responsibilities to sectoral authorities  (such as the identification of OES).  National CSIRT services   Incident Handling Coordination   Incident Reporting   On-Site Support   CSIRT Capability Building   Security Alerts  Incident Response Model - Distributed  The Portuguese National Cybersecurity Centre  The coordination of the response to incidents can be an initiative of the Portuguese National Cybersecurity  Centre, for example in the case of a large-scale incident, or it may be requested through the established  communication channels. In case of necessity or force majeure, the Portuguese National Cybersecurity  Centre coordinates with other national authorities.  The national CSIRT is in charge of:   Sorting incident notifications and technical forensic analysis;   Coordinating with the national and international entities involved;  18http://www.digitaldebates.org/fileadmin/media/cyber/National_CSIRTs_and_Their_Role_in_Computer_Security_Incident_ Response__November_2015_--_Morgus__Skierka__Hohmann__Maurer.pdf  19 Interview with the Czech National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NÚKIB)  Sectoral IR  layout depends  strongly on the  national CSIRT  mandate and  budget  http://www.digitaldebates.org/fileadmin/media/cyber/National_CSIRTs_and_Their_Role_in_Computer_Security_Incident_Response__November_2015_--_Morgus__Skierka__Hohmann__Maurer.pdf http://www.digitaldebates.org/fileadmin/media/cyber/National_CSIRTs_and_Their_Role_in_Computer_Security_Incident_Response__November_2015_--_Morgus__Skierka__Hohmann__Maurer.pdf  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  19   Producing recommendations for the mitigation and/or resolving of incidents.  The sectoral authorities are in charge of:   Identifying OES within their sectors;   Mapping dependencies;   Supervising cybersecurity.  The sectoral CSIRTs are in charge of:   Incident Management;   Artefact analysis;   Information Assurance;   Situational awareness;   Communication/outreach.  The OES in NISD sectors are in charge of:   Taking appropriate measures to prevent incidents affecting networks and information systems;   Reporting incidents to the national CSIRT.  IR in NISD sectors – Entity in charge   The OESs’ CSIRT are in charge of IR in the Energy, Transport, Health, Drinking Water, Financial  Market and Digital Infrastructure sectors (sectoral CSIRTs are planned in the Energy and  transport sectors);   A sectoral CSIRT is in charge in the Banking sector.  Impact of the NIS Directive on IR layout  The NIS Directive led to the improvement of the CSIRT/IR national layout already in place but did not  increase the national Cybersecurity authority’s budget, which is why the identification of OES was  delegated to sectoral authorities.

This could be done by using  CSIRT maturity products20.  20 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/csirt-maturity  https://www.cncs.gov.pt/en/certpt_en/ http://www.enisa.europa.eu/csirt-maturity  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  20  3.2 KEY FINDING #2  3.2.1 The NIS Directive has improved the IR organisation and  governance by clarifying actors’ roles and responsibilities  The transposition of the NIS Directive into national legislation seems to be having a positive  impact on the Incident Response (IR) landscape at national level, contributing to improved  overall organisation and governance.  Figure 4: Main features of the changes following the NIS Directive  According to national CSIRTs, the Directive has led to a clarification of the roles and  responsibilities of the various actors involved in IR at all levels, and the ongoing implementation  is leading to significant organisational changes, including:   The formal identification of OES;   The creation of sectoral CSIRTs.  This positive impact is less visible in countries with a more mature organisational layout. The  data collected indeed suggest that the NISD had an unequal effect from one country to  another.  During the survey, respondents were asked about the impact of the NISD of the set-up of their  IR capacities on a scale from 5 (high impact) to 0 (no impact). The replies show that:   10 out of 24 respondents thought that the NISD had an important impact (5 to 3);   13 out of 24 respondents thought that the NISD had a relatively small impact (2 to 0);   1 respondent did not provide an answer.

The  NISD was treated as an update to the previous law and continues the way of thinking.”  (National CSIRT)  According to the results of the survey, the countries who tend to be less impacted by the  Directive are the countries with a more mature landscape who already had a clear  governance and definition of roles and responsibilities.  The evolution of the maturity of MS IR landscape could be an interesting area to further study by  using the ENISA CSIRT Maturity Toolkit21 based on SIM3 (https://opencsirt.org/maturity/sim3/).  These mixed results highlight the fact that there are still important differences between Member  States’ cybersecurity landscape and IRC at large.  3.2.2  Lessons learned and recommendations   Based on received data, it would be interesting to have another round of analysis to evaluate  the mid- and long-term impacts of the NIS Directive on IR layout once the NISD has been  completely implemented in all the MS.  It would be useful to conduct a maturity assessment of sectoral CSIRT landscape within NISD  sectors (using ENISA CSIRT Maturity Toolkit as a basis) and to identify future changes.  21 http://enisa.europa.eu/sas-tool  “The NISD didn’t  change much,  since we were  working in the  same way  before.”  (National CSIRT)  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  5 (highly) 4 3 2 1 0 (not at all) NA  https://opencsirt.org/maturity/sim3/ http://enisa.europa.eu/sas-tool  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  22  3.3 KEY FINDING #3  3.3.1 The implementation of the Directive raises operational and  regulatory challenges and highlights MS willingness to move forward by  extending the scope and number of sectors targeted  Following the transposition of the Directive into national legislation, EU Member States are now  in the process of implementing the regulation. The two main challenges raised by respondents  and confirmed by sectoral experts are regulatory and operational.  Figure 6: Assessment of the challenges faced during the implementation of the NISD  The legal and administrative definition of what constitutes an OES can pose a challenge  for the authority in charge of defining the list of OES within the NISD Sectors. There are two  issues in defining the OES:   The legal definition and threshold/criterion of what constitutes an OES;   The administrative identity of the OES: Name, headquarter, VAT number, etc.  The threshold and criterion to identify the OES are defined by the authority which can be the  national cybersecurity authority, the sectoral authority or another competent authority. The  Directive provides an initial list of entities, but each MS has to define the thresholds and criterion  for the sectors which can be based on quantitative aspects (share of market, tons of freight,  etc.).  NISD  implementation  poses regulatory  and operational  challenges  6  8  6  8  2  10  11  10  12  12  0 12 24  Organisation challenge: find the right governance model  between national and sectoral actors  Regulatory challenge: to develop the right legal framework enabling the  uptake of security  requirements and the notification of…  Operational challenge: to establish effective  response and trusted collaboration mechanisms among sectoral actors  Capability challenge: to ensure that sectoral actors  have the necessary IR expertise and capacities  Technical challenge: to develop and/or adopt  the relevant IR tools at a sectoral level  5 (strongly agree) 4 3 2 1 (not agree at all)  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  23  Table 3: Case-study: Maritime transport OES definition & threshold (United Kingdom)  Definitions and thresholds for identification of Operators of Essential Services in the United  Kingdom maritime transport sector22  Essential service Identification Thresholds  Shipping  A shipping company which handles  (a) over 5 million tonnes of total annual freight at UK ports; and  (b) over 30% of the freight at any individual UK port which fulfils at least one of  the following criteria:  (I) handles more than 15% of UK total roll-on roll-off traffic; (II) handles more  than 15% of UK total lift-on lift-off traffic; (iii) handles more than 10% of UK  total liquid bulk traffic; or (iv) handles more than 20% of UK biomass fuel traffic;  or  A shipping company with over 30% of the annual passenger numbers at any  individual UK port which has annual passenger numbers greater than 10  million.  Provision of services  by a harbour authority  A harbour authority (as defined in section 313(1) of the Merchant Shipping Act  1995) which  (a) has annual passenger numbers greater than 10 million; or (b) fulfils at least  one of the following criteria:  (i) handles more than 15% of UK total roll-on roll-off traffic;  (ii) handles more than 15% of UK total lift-on lift-off traffic;  (iii) handles more than 10% of UK total liquid bulk traffic; or  (iv) handles more than 20% of UK biomass fuel traffic.  Provision of services  by an operator of a  port facility  (a) An operator of a port facility which handles passengers at a port which has  annual passenger numbers greater than 10 million; or  (b) An operator of a port facility at a port which fulfils at least one of the  following criteria:  (i) handles more than 15% of UK total roll-on roll-off traffic; (ii) handles more  than 15% of UK total lift-on lift-off traffic; (iii) handles more than 10% of UK  total liquid bulk traffic; or (iv) handles more than 20% of UK biomass fuel traffic;  and where that port facility operator handles the same type of freight for which  the port fulfils one of the criteria mentioned in sub-paragraphs (i)-(iv).  \"Port facility\" has the same meaning as in regulation 2 of the Port Security  Regulations 2009.  Vessel traffic services  Operator of vessel traffic services at a port which  (a) has annual passenger numbers greater than 10 million; or (b) fulfils at least  one of the following criteria:  (i) handles more than 15% of UK total roll-on roll-off traffic; (ii) handles more  than 15% of UK total lift-on lift-off traffic; (iii) handles more than 10% of UK  total liquid bulk traffic; or (iv) handles more than 20% of UK biomass fuel traffic.  \"Vessel traffic services\" has the same meaning as in regulation 2(1) of the  Merchant Shipping (Vessel Traffic Monitoring and Reporting Requirements)  Regulations 20049.  The identification of all the OES can be an operational challenge in sectors with an  extended range of suppliers and service providers. Sectors which include various public and  private actors can depend strongly on SMEs in their value chain. Should these SMEs be  targeted by a cyberattack, this could impact the entire value chain. It is therefore complex for the  22 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/506/schedule/2/made  http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/506/schedule/2/made  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  24  regulator and/or the entity in charge of listing OES (be it the national CSIRT, the Sectoral  Authority or the sectoral CSIRT) to map the dependencies and identify all the OES within the  sectors and set-up thresholds.  Finally, classifying OES can become complex in the case of large companies who have more  than one activity/branch which falls under the scope of NISD (e.g. an IXP (OES) might also  operate as a cloud provider (DSP)). This could result in a company reporting to several sectoral  authorities in a decentralised IR model, generating overlaps and duplication between the  competent authorities.  Regulatory challenge: information-sharing and incident notification  A regulatory challenge posed by the implementation of the Directive concerns information-  sharing with third countries, especially when there is not an adequate legal basis under GDPR  for such sharing. A national CSIRT analyst may find actionable information which could be of  great help for another country, but he/she may not legally be able to share this information with  that other country’s authority.  As an example, in order to mitigate relevant challenges, the transposition of the NISD into Dutch  law allows the NCSC-NL (CISRT for government and OES in the Netherlands) to share  actionable information outside of its mandate to third countries’ IR entities as long as the entity  is a CSIRT and if it is believed that the entity has the capacity to use the information and will do  so in a reasonable manner.  Moreover, it should be noted that in the case of a security breach involving personal data (as  e.g. in the bank, finance or health sector), aside reporting to the national CSIRT, the national  Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) should be notified, according to GDPR..  According to one of the interviewee, there may be a missing link between the national CSIRT  and the national Data Protection Authority, and it would be therefore interesting to think of a  communication channel between the two types of authorities covering the incidents where  personal data is part of the security breach.  Extension of the scope and number of NISD sectors  As mentioned above, the implementation of the Directive is still in progress in some Member  States, but the research highlights significant differences among national operational set-ups:  While transposing the NIS Directive into national legislation, some Member States opted for  using the 7 sectors listed in the NIS Directive (see Section 3.1 Definition) while others decided  to extend the scope and number of sectors covered:   12 out of 28 MS have extended the scope of NISD sectors and added entities not listed in  the NISD as OES.  The sectors mostly added are electronic communications/telecommunication networks (for 7 out  12 MS) and chemical Industry.  NISD  implementation  is leading to  significant  differences  among MS and,  in some MS, to  an extension of  the scope and  number of  sectors covered  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  25  Table 4: Extended scope of sectors and OES  NISD transposition into national legislation – extended scope of the sectors (examples)  Different and/or additional sectors identified  Different and/or additional categories of OES  included  Cyprus  Additional sectors considered: electronic  communications, wastewater, food, government  and national security/ emergency services and  environmental.

The NIS Directive is one of the three key drivers for the creation of sectoral CSIRTs, along with  lessons learned from past incidents and the lack of sector-specific knowledge of the national  CSIRT, according to the respondents.  “[The creation of the sectoral CSIRT was driven by] a need to collaborate and coordinate  Incident Response against ongoing cyberattacks” (Sectoral CSIRT)  Figure 7: Key drivers to create sectoral IR capabilities  Demand-driven  For 8 out of 24 respondents, the creation of sectoral IRC was driven by lessons learned from  past incidents while for 6 out of 24 respondents it was the lack of either sector-specific  knowledge or national CSIRT capacities. In other words, according to the survey, a bottom-up  (demand-side) incentive favoured the creation of sectoral IRC.  In some of the cases, operators of essential services (public or private entities) created a  sectoral CSIRT on their own initiative. This is also the case for non-EU sectoral CSIRTs such as  the NordicFin CERT which provides a good illustration of a cross-border sectoral IRC set up  prior to the publication of the NISD to respond to an operational need.  6  6  8  1  2  3  8  8  6  13  12  10  The implementation of the NIS Directive  The lack of sector-specific knowledge  or capacity of the National CSIRT  Lessons learnt from past incidents  The difficulties of managing the cybersecurity  incidents in the NISD sectors  The complexity of managing the high number  of OES in some of the NISD sectors  Other.

They adopted digital financial services such as  online banking, digital investment services or online provision of credit early, as illustrated in  the chart below.  According to The Bank of Finland Bulletin, “Not only have banks in the Nordic countries  invested in digitalisation; the position of new FinTech actors is also better in the Nordic region  than in many other countries.”  This growing digitalisation of the Nordic financial sectors opened new vulnerabilities to cyber  threats.  A need to collaborate to better respond to an increasing number of cyber attacks  From 2007 to 2016, Nordic countries experienced numerous attacks on their financial sector.  In 2007, Norway was targeted by their first internet banking malware attacks. Between 2008  and 2011, financial operators collaborated through both formal and informal schemes to  respond to cyber incidents. In 2012, Sveriges Riksbank (central bank of Sweden) was hit by  a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack which left its website offline for 5 hours. In  2014, a DDoS attack on seven large financial institutions in Norway resulted in suspended  services for an entire day. In Finland, at the end of 2014, three banks (Op Pohjola, Danske  Bank and Nordea) suffered DDoS attacks that rendered their online services unavailable and  for one bank prevented customers from withdrawing cash and making card payments.  Lessons learned from incident called for IR cooperation at national level  In 2012, in Norway, while the National Cyber Security Strategy was in the process of being  created, the country experienced a peak of attacks and decided to set up a national platform,  FinansCERT, dedicated to responding to cyber threats targeting the financial sector.  FinansCERT was created to formalise collaboration between relevant actors, and actively  cooperates with the national CSIRT and with the law enforcement computer crime unit.  FinansCERT Norway, based in Oslo, was operational from 2013 to 2017.  A demand from operators to create a cross-border capability to collaborate to fight  cybercrime  In 2017, the largest banks operating in the Nordic countries, namely Nordea, Danske Bank  and DNB worked on a project to set-up a single payment clearance system which would be  operated by one company for all the Nordic countries. To secure this project and face a  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  29  growing number of attacks, Danske Bank, Nordea, DNB, Sparebank 1 and Eika Group,  among other Nordic banks, decided to expand FinansCERT, to develop a collaboration  platform to the entire Nordic region: Nordic Financial CERT (NordicFin CERT).  Nordic-Fin CERT mandate  The Nordic Financial CERT aims at fortifying the Nordic community in the face of cyber risks  to customer assets and at providing a safety net for all financial institutions, big and small. It  envisions a Nordic community in which the financial sector actively and responsively  identifies, defends against and combats cyber risks. The collaboration will enable the banks  to gather the best knowledge available about fighting cybercrime in the Nordic financial  sector, and it will lead to synergies that will improve both the customers’ and the banks’  security.

As a result, their sectoral capabilities are recent or still work in progress. In those cases, the NIS  Directive and the GDPR were an opportunity to justify the need for additional resources to  increase capabilities and create sectoral CSIRTs. However a major increase of financial  resources was rarely noted according to the data collected.   It was the implementation of the NIS Directive for 6 out of 24 respondents, which was the  main driver for the creation of Sectoral capabilities.  As an illustration, Bulgaria is in the process of creating seven sectoral CSIRTs as a  consequence of the transposition of the NISD in the national legislation.  In some cases, the creation of sectoral capacities is driven by both national authorities and  operators. This is the case in The Netherlands, which features many sectoral CSIRTs although  the national CSIRT (and cybersecurity agency) also play a proactive role.  The support of national CSIRTs to the development of sectoral CSIRTs and capabilities  tends to be of great added value because it capitalises on existing expertise.  A noteworthy initiative, pre-dating the NIS Directive, is that of the Dutch NCSC, which provided  incentives and guidelines to support the creation of CSIRTs:   Guidelines to start a collective CSIRT27;   Guidelines to operationalise a CSIRT: NCSC’ CSIRT Maturity Toolkit28.  NCSC-NL also appointed a liaison officer whose mission was to follow the creation of sectoral  CSIRTs. The liaison officer came to the sectoral CSIRT’s premises 2 days a week to support  the newly created team.  27 Guidelines to start a collective CSIRT  28 https://english.ncsc.nl/get-to-work/cooperation/i-would-like-to-strengthen-my-collaboration/csirt-maturity-toolkit  The support of  national CSIRT to  develop and  enhance Sectoral  IRC is key to  capitalise on  existing  expertise  https://www.bofbulletin.fi/en/2018/2/nordic-banks-go-digital/ https://www.nordea.com/en/press-and-news/news-and-press-releases/press-releases/2017/04-10-08h00-nordic-banks-collaborate-on-fighting-cybercrime.html https://www.nordea.com/en/press-and-news/news-and-press-releases/press-releases/2017/04-10-08h00-nordic-banks-collaborate-on-fighting-cybercrime.html https://english.ncsc.nl/binaries/ncsc-en/documents/publications/2019/juli/02/ncsc-guide-collective-csirt/NCSC_Guide_Collective_CSIRT.pdf https://english.ncsc.nl/get-to-work/cooperation/i-would-like-to-strengthen-my-collaboration/csirt-maturity-toolkit  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  30  It also worth mentioning that countries with a centralised Incident Response model tend not to  have, nor to plan to develop specific sectoral CSIRT capabilities since the national CSIRT tend  to have sectoral IR teams within its structure. In these countries, IR is directly managed by the  OES and reported straight to the National CSIRT or governmental CSIRT such as in Czech  Republic (see Key Finding 1).  6 out of 24 respondents confirmed that there are no sectoral CSIRTs in their country.  “Currently we do not provide sectoral CSIRTs and there is no plan to create any” (National  CSIRT)  100% of respondents with no sectoral CSIRT have a centralised IR model with national CSIRT  as the competent authority for NISD sectors.  “We don’t tend to use sectoral CSIRTs but [the national CSIRT] ’s Engagements Team do  maintain close contact with all NISD sectors.” (National CSIRT)  3.4.2 Lessons learned and recommendations   Sectoral actors could benefit from the experience and knowledge of national and other  sectoral CSIRTs, for instance through the appointment of a liaison officer, sharing of know-  how, expert advice or tailored training.   ENISA should continue to collect available resources (guidelines and toolkits), for example by  enabling a GitHub repository.  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  31  3.5 KEY FINDING #5  3.5.1 National CSIRTs have developed mature reporting processes and  notification tools, as have sectoral CSIRTs who provide solutions  specific to their sectors’ needs  The nature of the capabilities developed and used by sectoral CSIRTs in contrast with national  CSIRTs strongly depends on the range of services that both can provide to their constituents.  According to FIRST “CSIRT Services Framework29”, CSIRTs can provides various cyber  security services and functions:  Table 6: FIRST’CSIRT Services Framework V2.0  Services Areas Services Functions  Information Security  Event Management  Monitoring and detection  Log and sensor management, Detection use  case management, Contextual data  management  Analysing Correlation  Information Security  Incident Management  Accepting information security  incident reports  Information security incident report receipt,  Information security incident report triage and  processing,  Analysing information security  incidents  Information security incident triage  (prioritization and categorization), Information  collection, Coordinate any more detailed  analysis, Information security incident root  cause analysis, Cross-incident correlation.

To provide this specific  service, both National CSIRTs and Sectoral CSIRT have developed and/or use mature  reporting processes and notification tools to allow citizens, OES and other private or public-  sector organisations to report incidents.  Notification and reporting tools of national CSIRTs and sectoral CSIRTs  According to the survey, 83% of respondents use incident notification templates and 100% have  specific information-exchange tools to enable the notification of incidents.  The reporting tools used by both national CSIRT and sectoral CSIRT identified through the  survey and the desktop research are:    Email-based reporting tools (secured and/or encrypted), Secured networks/chats, Web forms,  notification portals, collaboration portal, in-house developed tools (in-house notification portal,  customized tool based on RTIR30).  30 RTIR - Request Tracker for Incident Response (RTIR) is the premier open source incident handling system targeted for  computer security teams. We worked with over a dozen CERT and CSIRT teams around the world to help you handle the  ever-increasing volume of incident reports. RTIR builds on all the features of Request Tracker.  REPORTING TOOLS  Email-based reporting  tools (secured and/or  encrypted), Secured  networks/chats, Web  forms, notification  portals, collaboration  portal, in-house  developed tools (in-  house notification  portal).  OTHER TOOLS  Early detection  systems, monitoring  systems, Industrial  control systems,  Threat intels systems,  Malware Information  Sharing Platform  (MISP), IntelIMQ,  information sharing  platforms and tools.  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  33  The other tools identified are:   Early detection systems, monitoring systems, Industrial control systems, Threat Intel systems,  Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP)31, IntelMQ32, information sharing platforms and  tools.  Table 7: Case study: CERT-BE, Belgium  National CSIRT, dedicated notification tools for OES (Belgium)  Context  According to Belgian law, OES have to notify 3 or 4 different authorities:   The national CSIRT (CERT-BE);   The Centre for Cyber Security Belgium (CCB);   The Sectoral Authority;   GDPR Authority (in case of data leak).  A Belgian regulation states that Belgian citizens should only have to report to one authority and not  duplicate the notification to other administrative entities, which resulted in the creation of a dedicated  portal for OES to centralise notifications and systematically transfer the incident notification to the other 3  authorities.  Notification tool for OES Description  Online dedicated portal for OES  The form is accessible online on the CSIRT-DSP  website and the notification is sent directly to both  the CSIRT and the competent Authority;  Notification tool for all33 Description  Notification by email / encrypted email  A central email address is available on the CERT- BE website. The national CSIRT also offers to  send a secure message by using an encrypted  message with PGP encryption.  Exchange of information on incidents based on  Traffic Light Protocol (TLP)34  CERT.BE uses the “Traffic Light Protocol” to  facilitate and encourage the exchange of  information in a safe manner. The protocol  requires that the person sending information  assigns it a colour code. This colour indicates if  and in what ways this information may be further  disseminated. Someone who receives information  and believes that it should be further disseminated  must first ask for permission from the sender.  Online notification form  The form is accessible online on the CERT-BE  website and includes mandatory information to fill  in.  31 The MISP threat sharing platform is a free and open source software helping information sharing of threat intelligence  including cyber security indicators. A threat intelligence platform for gathering, sharing, storing and correlating Indicators of  Compromise of targeted attacks, threat intelligence, financial fraud information, vulnerability information or even counter- terrorism information.  32 IntelMQ is a solution for IT security teams for collecting and processing security feeds using a message queuing protocol  (Github definition).  33 https://www.cert.be/en/report-incident  34 https://www.cert.be/en/traffic-light-protocol-tlp  https://www.cert.be/en/report-incident https://www.cert.be/en/traffic-light-protocol-tlp  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  34  Depending on their mandate, sectoral CSIRTs tend to offer the same range of incident  reporting and notification services as the national CSIRT, including similar notification tools  and reporting processes which rely mostly on web forms and email.  Table 8: Case study: DSP-CSIRT, The Netherlands  CSIRT for Digital Service Provider, notification tools (The Netherlands)  Context  In November 2018, the NIS Directive was transposed into Dutch legislation under the Dutch law on the  protection of networks and information systems. According to this national regulation, Digital Service  providers are required to report incidents on their networks and information systems (duty to report), and  to take security measures on their networks and information systems (duty of care)35.  As a direct effect of the Directive, a CSIRT dedicated to DSP was created (CSIRT-DSP). In case of  incident, according to the Dutch law, DSPs have to report to the CSIRT-DSP and to the Competent  Authority, which, for the DSPs, is the Radio communications Agency. In order to do so, Digital Service  Providers can use three different notification tools:  Notification tools Description  An online incident report form  The form is accessible online on the CSIRT-DSP  website and the notification is directly sent to both  the CSIRT and the competent Authority;  A telephone number  A standard number is available on the CSIRT-DSP  website. However, the report over the phone will  not be shared with the competent Authority;  An e-mail  An e-mail is available on the CSIRT-DSP website.  However, the report by email will not be shared  with the competent Authority;  However, if sectoral CSIRTs appear to use reporting and notification tools and capabilities  similar to the national CSIRTs’, they also provide services more adapted to the sector’s  specificities and needs.  Sectoral CSIRT specific capabilities and services  When asked about the main added value of sectoral CSIRT, respondents to the survey and  sectoral experts raised the following:   Better knowledge of specific sectors’ threat landscape;  By working on a more focused perimeter, sectoral CSIRTs gain robust knowledge of the specific  risks and threats targeting their sectors. As an illustration, the Dutch Health sector CSIRT, Z-  CERT36, offers specialized services to healthcare institutions by publishing regular white  papers37 on the specific threats targeting hospitals.  35 https//csirtdsp.nl/en/node/1  36 https://www.z-cert.nl/  37 https://www.z-cert.nl/nieuws  https://www.z-cert.nl/ https://www.z-cert.nl/nieuws  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  35   Better knowledge of the entire sector value-chain and better relationship with vendors;  Sectoral CSIRTs tend to have more direct contact with sectoral operators. Operators can often  register as participants to sectoral CSIRTs to better benefit from said CSIRT services. Hospitals  (ranging from academic \"UMCs\", top clinical \"STZ\" to \"general\" hospitals) as well as mental  healthcare institutions (\"GGZ\") can register with Z-CERT as participants (constituency)38.   More qualitative and operational information sharing, better sharing of good practices.  Sectoral CSIRTs provide or are used as information-exchange entities either to share identified  vulnerabilities, incidents or lessons learned. Z-CERT, for instance, informs its constituency of  any vulnerabilities detected in medical devices, medical networks and medical applications. To  those participants affected by a vulnerability, Z-CERT provides advice on how best to deal with  the situation. Z-CERT also sends out alerts regarding possible threats and current attacks. Z-  CERT shares its knowledge (through the release of whitepapers, for example) with its  participants, facilitates meetings for its participants, and hosts networking events and theme  sessions39.  Sectoral capabilities maturity assessment  When assessing the maturity of the tools and processes used by national and sectoral CSIRT,  two specific factors must be taken into consideration.  First, the maturity of the CSIRT itself: a more mature (see ENISA Maturity Evaluation  Methodology for CSIRTs)40 CSIRT will tend to have better developed tools and processes than  others.  In The Netherlands, the national CSIRT appointed a liaison officer to follow the creation of the  sectoral CSIRT and support their development and maturity. According to the liaison officer:  “They [Sectoral CSIRT] are growing in staff but it is challenging to find people with cyber  security skills. Besides, we have also seen growth in services, number of staff and  expertise. Our CSIRT for Municipalities and the Health-CERT have been around a couple  years now, grow in more mature CERTs every day, and expand their services from the  traditional incident response activities to activities focused on tackling more long-term  cybersecurity problems by writing advisory products and developing threat landscapes for  their constituency.”  The shortage of skilled staff for both national and sectoral CSIRT has been identified has a  recurrent issue by IR experts.  Highly regulated sectors and maturity of IRC  Secondly, reporting processes and information exchange tend to be more mature in highly  regulated sectors. As stated in the NIS Directive, requirements for notification of incidents can  be part of normal supervisory practice in the highly regulated sectors or sectors ruled by a  supervisory mechanism.  38 https://www.z-cert.nl/en  39 https://www.z-cert.nl/en  40 ENISA Maturity Evaluation Methodology for CSIRTs  There is a  shortage of  skilled staff to  conduct IR tasks  within both  national and  sectoral CSIRTs  https://www.z-cert.nl/en https://www.z-cert.nl/en https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/study-on-csirt-maturity-evaluation-process/at_download/fullReport  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  36  For example, the financial sector has particular regulations which require the notification of  incidents impacting the network and information systems and call for specific IRC and  monitoring tools.  “Financial institutions are particularly exposed to cyber risk due to their reliance on critical  infrastructures and their dependence on highly interconnected networks. Critical financial  market infrastructures include payment and settlement systems, trading platforms, central  securities depositories, and central counterparties.”41  The Financial and banking sectors are targeted by increasingly frequent and sophisticated  cyber-attacks. According to an IMF study on cyber risks (Cyber Risk for the Financial Sector: A  Framework for Quantitative Assessment, WP/18/143, July 2018)42, cyber-attacks targeting the  financial sectors can have several effects:   Business disruptions prevent firms from operating, resulting in loss revenue;   Fraud leads to direct financial losses;   Data breaches take more time to materialize, through reputational effects as well as litigation  costs.  To tackle these risks and avoid cascading effects at European level, the European Central Bank  (ECB) conducted a thematic review on cyber security risk in 2015 (prior to the NIS Directive)  and targeted on-site inspection43. In 2016, the ECB Banking supervision has implemented a  cyber-incident reporting framework as a pilot scheme which was rolled out to the  banking institutions in 201744. All significant institutions from the 19 Eurozone countries have  to report significant cyber incidents as soon as they detect them. This enables supervisors to  identify and monitor trends in cyber incidents affecting significant institutions and to gain a  deeper knowledge of the cyber threat landscape. It also allows for a swifter reaction to a  potential crisis caused by a cyberattack45.  Table 9: Case study: TIBER-EU - threat intelligence-based ethical red-teaming framework  ECB - TIBER-EU  TIBER-EU Context and Framework  TIBER-EU is the European framework for threat intelligence-based ethical red-teaming. It is the first EU- wide guide on how authorities, entities, threat intelligence and red-team providers should work together  to test and improve the cyber resilience of entities by carrying out a controlled cyberattack.  TIBER-EU was jointly developed by the ECB and the EU national central banks, approved by the  Governing Council of the ECB and published in May 2018. It was inspired by and takes into account the  lessons learned from similar initiatives in the United Kingdom (CBEST) and the Netherlands (TIBER-NL).  The TIBER-EU framework is currently (being) implemented in Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and the  Netherlands, as well as by the ECB in its oversight capacity. Other jurisdictions are expected to follow  soon.  Functioning  TIBER-EU tests mimic the tactics, techniques and procedures of real-life attackers, based on bespoke  threat intelligence. They are tailor-made to simulate an attack on the critical functions of an entity and its  underlying systems, i.e. its people, processes and technologies. The outcome is not a pass or fail;  41 Bouveret, A., Cyber Risk for the Financial Sector: A Framework for Quantitative Assessment, 2018  42 https://www.imf.org/~/media/Files/Publications/WP/2018/wp18143.ashx  43 https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/press/publications/newsletter/2017/html/ssm.nl170517_3.en.html  44 Ibid.  45 https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/cyber-resilience/html/index.en.html  https://www.imf.org/~/media/Files/Publications/WP/2018/wp18143.ashx https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/press/publications/newsletter/2017/html/ssm.nl170517_3.en.html https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/cyber-resilience/html/index.en.html  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  37  instead the test is intended to reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the tested entity, enabling it to  reach a higher level of cyber maturity.  Participants  The main participants in a TIBER-EU test are assigned to one of five different teams depending on their  role and responsibilities:  Blue team – the people in the entity that is the subject of the test and whose prevention, detection and  response capabilities are being tested without their foreknowledge  Threat intelligence provider – the company that looks at the range of possible threats and carries out  reconnaissance on the entity  Red team provider – the company that carries out the simulated attack by attempting to compromise the  critical functions of the entity by mimicking a cyber attacker  White team – a small team within the target entity who are the only ones there who know a test is  happening and that leads and manages the test in collaboration with the TIBER cyber team  TIBER cyber team – the team within the authority that is responsible for overseeing the test and making  sure it meets the requirements of the TIBER-EU framework, thus enabling mutual recognition of the test  by relevant authorities.

ENISA and sectoral  authorities should collaborate more if possible to streamline IRC-related guidelines or good  practices within the future regulation.   The mitigation of the shortage of skilled staff for IR activities at both national and sectoral level  should be a priority for MS. Innovative methods to attract and retain skilled staff could be  studied along with relevant incentives such as training building on existing practices within the  Member States.  https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/cyber-resilience/tiber-eu/html/index.en.html  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  38  3.6 KEY FINDING #6  3.6.1 There is a multiplication of information-exchange tools to facilitate  cooperation at sectoral, national and EU/international level, but the  quality of the exchange depends on both organisational and structural  criteria  The importance of sharing information is widely recognised among Member States, highlighted  by a growing number of initiatives to foster cooperation through information exchange at  national, European and international level.  These initiatives can take very different forms:   Cooperation agreements;   Cooperation and information platforms;   Dedicated fora, communities and networks;   ISACs and other information centres.  Sectoral initiatives at national level  There is a multiplication of initiatives such as ISACs, networks and fora at national level to foster  information exchange and increase awareness among stakeholders within a sector. Certain fora  and communities were created in the early 2000’s but a growing number are currently being  created to respond to the need of information exchange.  Table 10: Information exchange initiatives at national level within sectors  Information exchange initiatives at national level – sectoral illustrations & good practices  Luxembourg  The Luxembourg Bankers’ Association (ABBL) has put in place the Trust and Cybersecurity Committee  (TCS). The TCS Committee’s purpose is to promote Cybersecurity and Information Risk information  across the banking sector, as well as to act as a connector between the various actors on the market.  The members of the TCS Committee gather for quarterly plenary sessions at the Luxembourg House of  Finance in order to openly exchange on the current threat landscape, regulatory and supervisory aspects  and general market practices regarding cyber risks.  Portugal  The Civil Aviation authority organise workshops to share good practices and lessons learned with its  constituent. This information can also be share with the National CSIRT and at EU-level.  Spain  The Industrial Cybersecurity Centre (CCI) was created in in June 2013 to boost and improve industrial  cybersecurity in Spain and Spanish-speaking Latin America, defining industrial cybersecurity as \"the set  of practices, processes and technologies, designed to manage cyberspace's risk associated to the  management, process, storage and transmission of information used by industrial infrastructures, from  the points of view of people, processes and technologies\".46  The activities of the Centre, focused on provide maximum benefits to its members and sponsors are  ruled by the following strategic objectives:   Conglomerate the main experts and actors in industrial cybersecurity in order to facilitate the  exchange of experience and information and be kept up to date on the last technologies and  improvements on this subject.  46 https://www.cci-es.org/en/mision  https://www.cci-es.org/en/mision  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  39   Provide awareness on the current state of cybersecurity, paying special attention to new  threats and attack techniques.   Set communication channels with authorities and lawmakers in order to ease communication  among the different actors involved in industrial cybersecurity (government, industrial  associations, critical infrastructures, engineers, integrators, vendors, consulting firms,  associations, standard and good practice developers and citizens).   Improve awareness among all the actors through courses, events, seminars, publications and  a presence in the media.   Qualify professionals on industrial cybersecurity in order to facilitate hiring.   Improve and expand the Spanish and Latin American industrial cybersecurity market.  Trans-sectoral initiatives at national level  According to the survey, 55% of respondents have a network of IR actors at a national or  sectoral level to exchange good practices on cyber information exchange, capabilities,  cooperation etc. to support the development of OES IRC.  National CSIRTs have developed dedicated platforms for information exchange and  cooperation which are open to OES from all NISD sectors.  Table 11: Information exchange initiatives at national level cross-sectors  Information exchange initiatives at national level – trans-sectoral examples & good practices  Belgium – TIP & MiSP  The Belgian Threat Intel Platform (TIP)47 is a transversal information-exchange platform initially created  for Law enforcement and Intelligence stakeholders to share threat intelligence and was later partially  opened to OES. Within the TIP, OES from all sectors will have access (Belgium is still in the process of  designating OES) to the TIP to receive threat intelligence about their sector.  The Belgian Malware Formation Sharing Platform (MISP) is publicly accessible, but users can set up  private dedicated sectoral communities to exchange information on sectoral incidents.  Poland – N6 Project  The n6 project48 was designed and developed entirely at CERT Polska as a platform for acquisition,  processing and exchange of information regarding Internet threats. It is operational since February 2012.  Within the n6 project, millions of security events are processed daily in an automated manner. The goal  is efficient, reliable and fast delivery of large volumes of network incident data to interested parties:  network owners, administrators and Internet Service Providers. The project disseminates information  gathered from various security systems operated by security organizations, software vendors,  independent researchers, etc.  The core element of n6 is its engine responsible for sorting and managing flow of data. Sorting and  delivering data to appropriate parties is made possible by a flexible tagging system, which defines  categories of incoming data and addresses specific interest.  The Netherlands - NDN  The National Detection Network (NDN)49 is a partnership for better and faster detection of digital dangers  and risks. By sharing information about threats, parties can take appropriate measures in a timely  manner under their own responsibility, to limit or to prevent possible damage.  47 Interview with CERT-BE  48 https://www.cert.pl/en/projekty/n6-network-secident-exchange/  49 Interview with NCSC-NL  https://www.cert.pl/en/projekty/n6-network-secident-exchange/  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  40  United Kingdom – CiSP  The Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership (CiSP) is a joint industry and government initiative  set up to exchange cyber threat information in real time, in a secure, confidential and dynamic  environment, increasing situational awareness and reducing the impact on UK business.50  Initiatives at European / regional level  Several initiatives were identified at both European and regional level to support the creation  and/or the uptake of tools facilitating the exchange of technical information about incidents.  Table 12: Information exchange initiatives at European level  Information exchange initiatives at European level (examples)  Initiatives Description  Trans-sectoral  CSIRT Network51  The CSIRT Network is a network composed of EU Member States’  appointed CSIRTs and CERT-EU (“CSIRTs Network members”).  The European Commission participates in the network as an  observer. ENISA is tasked to actively support the CSIRTs’  cooperation, provide the secretariat and active support for incident  coordination upon request.  The CSIRT Network provides a forum where members can  cooperate, exchange information and build trust. Members will be  able to improve the handling of cross-border incidents and even  discuss how to respond in a coordinated manner to specific  incidents.  European Government CERTs  (EGC) group52  The EGC group forms an informal association of governmental  CERTs in Europe. Its members effectively co-operate on matters  of incident response by building upon a fundament of mutual trust  and understanding due to similarities in constituencies and  problem sets.  To achieve this goal, the EGC members:   Jointly develop measures to deal with large-scale or  regional network security incidents   Facilitate information sharing and technology exchange  relating to IT security incidents and malicious code  threats and vulnerabilities   Identify areas of specialist knowledge and expertise that  could be shared within the group   Identify areas of collaborative research and development  on subjects of mutual interest   Communicate common views with other initiatives and  organizations  Transport  EU Aviation ISAC  An EU Aviation ISAC is being created which will exist alongside  two existing entities: ECCSA and the US Aviation ISAC.  The need for a European-based Aviation ISAC was expressed by  European industry members, OEMs and Airlines who saw a need  to organise and collaborate in the realm of cyber security and in  the field of intelligence and analysis sharing for the aviation sector.  50 https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/section/keep-up-to-date/cisp  51 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirts-network  52 http://www.egc-group.org/  https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/section/keep-up-to-date/cisp https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirts-network http://www.egc-group.org/  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  41  Finance  FI-ISAC53  The FI-ISAC exists since 2008 as an independent organisation  and is well integrated with European and MS banking institutions  and EU organisations such as ENISA, Europol, the European  Central Bank, European Payment Council and the European  Commission.

The mission of the European FI-ISAC is information exchange on  e- and m-channel, cards, central systems and all ICT related topics  including:   Cyber-criminal activity affecting the financial community   Vulnerabilities, technology trends and threats   Incidents and case-studies  This information exchange helps each member and the banks in  its member state, to raise awareness on potentials risks, and  provides an early warning on new threats and Modus Operandi's.  Energy  EE-ISAC54  The European Energy - Information Sharing & Analysis Centre  (EE-ISAC) is an industry-driven, information sharing network of  trust. Both private utilities and solution providers and (semi)public  institutions such as academia, governmental and non-profit  organizations share valuable information on cyber security & cyber  resilience.  EE-ISAC enables the European utility industry to:   Set up long lasting relationships of trust with partners  across the entire value chain   Share both real-time data & analysis within small scale  trust-circles   Learn from their peer's experiences with grid security  incidents and cyber breaches   Compare & evaluate security solutions, both from a  technical and operational viewpoint   Benefit from an open dialogue with industry partners and  suppliers  According to the respondents of the survey, the three most used groups to exchange with peers  at European and international level are the CSIRT Network55 (27%), the TF CSIRT56 (23%) and  the FIRST Community57 (22%).  53 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cross-cooperation-for-csirts/finance/european-fi-isac-a-public-private-partnership  54 https://www.ee-isac.eu  55 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirts-network  56 https://tf-csirt.org/  57 https://www.first.org/  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cross-cooperation-for-csirts/finance/european-fi-isac-a-public-private-partnership https://www.ee-isac.eu/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirts-network https://tf-csirt.org/ https://www.first.org/  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  42  27%  22% 12%  23%  12%  4% The CSIRT Network  The FIRST community  The European Government CERTs (EGC) group  The TF-CSIRT  Other (specify in comments)  All  Do not know  Figure 8: Main groups use to exchange with peers  A discrepancy was identified between the quantitative data collected through the survey and  complementary interviews on the use of the European Government CERTs (EGC)58 group. Only  12% of survey respondents (8 out the 17 National CSIRTs) use the EGC group to exchange IR  good practices and experience, but the interviews with IR experts indicate that there are more  frequent and qualitative exchange within this community which could be explained by the fact  that not all EGC members have participated to the survey.  Cross-border initiatives  Cross-border cooperation relies mostly on information-sharing between MS (peer to peer  exchange in regional communities) and cooperation agreements with other national CSIRTs.   78% of respondents to the survey have specific measures in place to inform the relevant  actors (national authorities and OES) in neighbouring countries about an incident that may  impact them.  58 http://www.egc-group.org/  http://www.egc-group.org/  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  43  0 12 24  Description of the incident and IOCs  Services affected  Indicators to measure the nature and impact in addition to…  Please specify  Cross border impact  Root cause  Severity  Current situation of the incident (actions taken or needed,…  Lessons learnt  Other. Please Specify  Yes No NA  Figure 9: Assessment of the nature of specific measures to inform relevant actors in  neighbouring countries about a cross-border incident  Quality and efficiency of information sharing in sustainable communities  The multiplication of networks and initiatives, however encouraging and a sign of rising  awareness on the need to facilitate information exchange, must also be evaluated in terms of  quality of the exchange within these fora.  Certain fora were created in response to legitimate sectoral needs. Yet these fora can lack the  organisational and structural means to sustain the efficiency of information-sharing, thus  undermining their raison d’être.  As an illustration, the European Cyber Security Organisation (ECSO) published a position paper  on the creation of a European Energy ISAC59 which the paper claims lacks visibility among most  European energy operators. In ECSO’s opinion, “EE-ISAC carries out many activities but the  main outcomes and benefits of the organisation are not clear. In addition, EE-ISAC involves  only a few energy operators whereas they should be strongly represented to drive the ISAC  activities according to the energy sector’s needs.”  Several factors are currently or could in the future jeopardise the quality and efficiency of the  information-sharing initiatives such as:   A lack of representativity and visibility within the sector: if there are multiple communities  or platforms aiming the same objective within a given sector and if the communication and  dissemination resources are not sufficient to raise awareness on the existence of the  initiatives;   A lack of financial resources: If there is not enough budget to sustain the initiative on a long  term;   A lack of trust between participants: within over-sized fora with too many stakeholders, it  can be challenging to build trust to allow fruitful exchanges among participants;  59 https://ecs-org.eu/documents/publications/5c0a6a3aac673.pdf  Information-  sharing  communities and  fora need  resources to  sustain the  efficiency  https://ecs-org.eu/documents/publications/5c0a6a3aac673.pdf  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  44   A fear of penalty for the voluntary reporting of incident caused by human error: when  reporting human errors, stakeholders should be ensured not to be blamed or penalised to  encourage sharing of lessons learned.  Finally, information sharing at sectoral level can also raise operational challenges:  According to one of the interviewees, “one of the difficulties is how to make sure the right  knowledge and information will reach all relevant organisations. On top of that, you want to  have a feedback loop where information flows from the national CSIRT to the sectoral CSIRT to  the individual organisations, it should not be a one-way-street.  Other challenges involve the fact that OES have a notification requirement to their Single Point  of Contact and sectoral regulator, but not always to their sectoral CSIRT, which can sometimes  make the information sharing and notification duties a complex set of responsibilities. In  addition, there is a risk of inefficiency.”  Finally, it can sometimes be challenging for Sectoral CSIRT and OES to assess when a threat  or an incident can also have impact for other sectors and should be shared. In case a major  incident which could have impacts in national security the National CSIRT would be in direct  contact with the OES, and the Sectoral CSIRT in hybrid or distributed IR models. This situation  could raise the question to delegate national security tasks to private sectoral CSIRTs.  This is why it seems like both a continuous exchange with national CSIRT and cross-sectors  communication channel could be important to set-up or maintain at national level. This would  allow to share the work and avoid that several CSIRTs (national and sectoral) analyse the  same threat or event and does not share the analysis. Therefore, there it would mitigate the  risk of doing double work with the already limited cyber security resources.  3.6.2 Lessons learned and recommendations   ENISA could further study the drivers to sustain information-sharing initiatives, develop a set  of guidelines, user-friendly tools and enablers (such as “Secure Group Communications for  incident response and operational communities”60 and “Proactive detection of network security  incidents - incident response tools mapping” ) .   Dedicated collaboration schemes at MS level could avoid duplication of efforts and ensure  that all relevant stakeholders are informed such as user-friendly cross-sectoral communication  tools or channels between several authorities (NISD and GDPR authorities).   The anonymised voluntary reporting of human errors should be encouraged and supported to  ensure that lessons learned are widely disseminated.   The promotion of responsible disclosure programs of vulnerabilities at sectoral level should be  foster.  60 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/secure-group-communications  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/secure-group-communications  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  45  3.7 KEY FINDING #7  3.7.1 There is a growing interest in training to enhance and foster  preparedness in NISD sectors at European level  The NISD encourages MS to foster their preparedness by requiring the establishment of  appropriate measures such as the creation of CSIRTs. Many MS have placed increasing cyber  preparedness, in particular that of NISD sectors, as a priority in their national cyber security  strategy.  Although, it was difficult to measure how this priority is concretely implemented at operational  level, one of the key areas identified to increase preparedness is the set-up of training.  According to the FIRST CSIRTs services framework:  “A training and education programme can help the CSIRT to establish relationships, and to  improve the overall cybersecurity posture of its constituency, including the ability to  prevent future incidents from happening. Such a programme can help maintain user awareness,  help the constituency understand the changing landscape and threats, train the  constituency on tools, processes and procedures related to security and incident  management.  This can be done through various types of activities including documenting the knowledge, skills  and abilities (KSAs) required, developing educational and training materials, delivering content,  mentoring, and professional and skill development. Each of these activities will collectively  contribute to the constituency’s and the team’s capabilities.”  According to the survey, out of 24 respondents, sector-specific cybersecurity training activities  are conducted:   Regularly: 5 National CSIRT   Occasionally: 2 National CSIRT and 3 Sectoral CSIRT   No but planned in the future: 8 National CSIRT and 1 Sectoral CSIRT   No and not planned: 1 National CSIRT   Did not provide answer: 3 National CSIRT and 1 Sectoral CSIRT  There is a need  for sector-  specific training  to mitigate  shortage of  skilled-staff  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  46  Figure 10: Sector-specific training evaluation  These answers indicate a significant interest from the sectoral CSIRT in training. It could be a  concrete way to mitigate the shortage of skills highlighted in the previous findings.  Several initiatives already exist at both national and EU level to conduct trainings on Incident  response procedures and tools.  Table 13: Case study: Good practices for training  Good practices for Training at national level – Illustrations  Initiatives Description  Belgium  CERT-BE annual training program  Every year CERT-BE organises a training programme for federal  officials.

CIRCL.LU offers courses to its members and organisations based  in Luxembourg.  In their mission to improve information security, CIRCL shares its  field experience through a set of training or technical courses. Due  to diversity of competences within the team, CIRCL is able to  provide a large diversity of information security trainings.

This could be done by first assessing  the sector-specific training needs with relevant stakeholders and identifying existing trainings  (such as TRANSITS-I, TRANSITS-II, and the ones conducted by ENISA, FIRST, etc.) to build  on their experience.   Sectoral CSIRTs might want to prioritize practical areas of IR:   Tools;   Taxonomy;   Responsible vulnerability disclosure;   Trust building;   Information sharing and developing skills and experience.  3.8 FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS  Recommendations  Actors Description  Recommendations to ENISA  Knowledge  Collect deeper insights on both national and sectoral CSIRT maturity when  the NISD will have been fully implemented;  Cooperation Favour cross sectoral knowledge between the stakeholders;  Information sharing  Continue to collect available resources to enhance IRC & enhance  information-sharing and build a repository;  Training  Develop a continuum for training activities which range from assessing  sectors trainings needs, to promote the “train-the-trainers» approach, to  continue developing sectoral trainings.  Recommendations to the IR Community  Transparency  Publish a clear list of the sectors covered within NISD at national level (same  as the NISD or extended);  Information sharing  Encourage the use of secure communication tools, common taxonomy63 and  sharing of lessons learned after incident with peers and everywhere;  The responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities should be fostered by setting  incentives;  Cooperation Build trust within communities and engage with OES and DSP;  Resources  The IR community should have adequate resources to conduct their  missions.  62 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/stock-taking-of-information-security-training-needs-in-critical-sectors  63 https://github.com/enisaeu/Reference-Security-Incident-Taxonomy-Task-Force  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/stock-taking-of-information-security-training-needs-in-critical-sectors https://github.com/enisaeu/Reference-Security-Incident-Taxonomy-Task-Force  EU MS INCIDENT RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT STATUS REPORT  November 2019  48  4.

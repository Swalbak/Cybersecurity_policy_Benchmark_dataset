Hardware and software play a critical role in the core operations of electronic  communications networks and services and are most of the time procured by specialized ICT suppliers  and outsourcing partners. This leads to providers being increasingly reliant on third parties to ensure  the security and resilience of their own infrastructure and this also exposes them to additional security  risks.  According to the latest ENISA Annual Incident Reports 20131, most incidents reported between 2011  and 2013 were caused by failing hardware or software. In discussions with electronic communications  service providers, they have indicated that there are sometimes problems or misunderstandings in  vendor-provider relationships and outsourcing in general.  The goal of this report is to analyse the importance of managing the security risks involved in the  procurement and outsourcing process. More specifically, it emphasises on the risks which could lead  to a disruption of electronic communications services for users.  ENISA has performed a survey with providers and vendors to collect issues and practices and a desktop  research of existing initiatives.  The surveyed providers mainly have the following concerns when procuring key ICT products and  outsourcing services for core operations:   Lack of adequacy and effectiveness of the security controls on the vendor’s side;   Potential vulnerabilities the provider can be exposed to due to (unknown) flaws in ICT  products or services;   Non-compliance with security requirements defined in the contract on the vendor’s side   Lack of adequate support from vendor in case of breakdown;   Weak negotiation power for the provider to enforce specific security requirements;   Lack of framework or guidelines from the industry to guide providers during the procurement  and outsourcing process.  The survey has indicated that many providers have a policy or framework in place to manage the  security issues experienced during the procurement or outsourcing of ICT products and services. The  security framework usually focuses on the following areas:   Assessing the risks providers may face when buying ICT products or outsourcing ICT services.   Articulating clear, actionable and measurable security requirements which will help the  providers to prevent or mitigate the risks identified during the risk assessment.   Continuously monitoring the performance of its vendors based on the contract, in order to  assess its compliance with security requirements.   Agreeing with the vendor on a change management process in order to define how to handle  potential changes in security requirements or the complete termination of the contract.  ENISA acknowledges however that providers adopt different approaches when dealing with security  risks involved in the procurement or outsourcing process. For these reasons and to meet expressed  concerns, this report presents an overview of practises used in the sector and gives the following  general recommendations:  1 ENISA (2014), Annual incidents report 2013, http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual- reports/annual-incident-reports-2013  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2013 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2013  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page iv  1.

Society is becoming  heavily reliant on communication services and people expect to be connected anywhere and at any  time. As a consequence, customers are more and more demanding reliable and secure services, and  they depend on their providers of electronic communications networks and services.  The importance of resilience in an electronic communications service provider’s network is visible  when significant security incidents hit customers, and when creating issues with important functions  of society. In the last years, network outages have been reported in many parts of the EU, affecting  both mobile and fixed communication providers. According to the ENISA Annual Incident Report  20132, most incidents reported were caused by technical/system failures (i.e. 61% of the incidents in  2013 – Figure 1) and more specifically hardware failures and software bugs. Network assets most  affected by system failures were switches and Home Location Registers (HLR). These network  components, which are essential parts of core operations of networks, are naturally vulnerable to  failures.  An example of a system failure involving a HLR, was an incident with a mobile operator that in 2012  experienced an important network outage leaving mobile customers without electronic  communications services for 21 hours. The outage was caused by a failure in the HLR while the mobile  operator was extending its outsourcing relationship regarding the field maintenance and switch sites  to include the complete operation of the network3. The detailed customer information disappeared  during the transition process leaving handsets unable to authenticate their users. Without the  database and all customers’ information, mobiles and other devices were gradually forced off the  network. The same kind of scenario can similarly impact other providers.  Due to the complexity of electronic communications networks components and services, providers  are to different extents using suppliers to provide them with specific ICT products and services.  Naturally, most of the providers buy their infrastructure components from ICT vendors while a large  range of them also outsource a part of the network operations to an outsourcing partner. This means  that they become reliant on third parties to ensure the security and resilience of their own  infrastructure, but also that they can be subject to additional security threats.  2 ENISA (2014), Annual incidents report 2013  3The Register, http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/07/13/o2_outage_cause/  14  19  6  61  Natural phenomena  Human errors  Malicious actions  System failures  Figure 1: Incidents per root causes (2013)  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 2  In discussions with providers, they indicated that there are sometimes problems or misunderstandings  in the vendor-provider relationships and outsourcing in general. More specifically, providers are not  always empowered to effectively manage the security risks involved in these relationships. For this  reason, in discussions with providers, ENISA has been asked to study this topic and to develop  guidelines with security requirements aimed at vendors. These requirements could be applied in the  procurement or outsourcing phase to support the providers in managing security threats and  guaranteeing the resilience of their networks after the introduction of third party products and  services.  Policy context  The reform of the EU legal framework for electronic communication, which was adopted in 2009 and  came into effect in May 2011, adds Article 13a to the Framework directive. Article 13a addresses the  security and integrity of public electronic communications networks and services. The legislation  concerns National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) and providers of public electronic communications  networks and services (providers).  Among other things, article 13a states the following:   Paragraph 1 requires the provider to take measures to “prevent and minimise the impact  of security incidents on users and interconnected networks”.   Paragraph 2 requires the provider to “take all appropriate steps to guarantee integrity of  their networks, and thus ensure the continuity of supply of services”.   Paragraph 3 requires the provider to “notify the competent National Regulatory Authority  of a breach of security or loss of integrity that has had a significant impact on the operation  of networks or services”.  Providers are liable towards the users of their services and the respective NRA for the security of their  electronic communications services, through the transposition of the above mentioned Article in  member States’ legislation. Liability cannot be transferred to a third party, although providers may be  dependent on suppliers of third party products or services used for their core operations. For that  reason it is important that the security measures the providers are liable for are extended to their  vendors through their contractual relationships.  More information about ENISA’s work on Article 13a, and the Article 13a Expert Group of NRAs, can  be found at: http://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13.  Goal and Scope  The goal of this report is to analyse the importance of managing the security risks involved in the  procurement and outsourcing process of key ICT products and services. More specifically, it  emphasises the risks which could lead to a disruption of services for the customers.  Together with this report a separate Security Guide 4  has been produced to support primarily  electronic communications service providers, but also ICT vendors, with practical guidelines to better  manage potential security risks in products or services, which could lead to disruptions in electronic  communications services.  4 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/requirements-ecomms-vendors  http://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/requirements-ecomms-vendors  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 3  Target audience  This report is aimed at the actors in the electronic communication sector (Providers, Vendors, NRAs,  Information Security Professionals, etc.).  The report informs the actors about issues and concerns of the sector regarding potential security  threats when buying or outsourcing ICT products and services from third parties, current initiatives  and processes used by providers to manage the same and, based on issues and findings, gives general  recommendations to the actors in the sector.  Methodology  In order to gather experience and opinions from experts in the field, an anonymous online survey  across European electronic communications service providers was launched. 29 providers responded  to this survey, bringing insights about their main concerns and areas of focus when buying ICT  equipment or outsourcing ICT services, the type of security policy they have in place and the main  security requirements they apply to their suppliers to prevent or mitigate security risks. The mix of  providers participating in this survey represents a wide coverage in terms of security practises applied  based on the type of electronic communication services provided (figure 2). Note that most of the  participating providers are offering multiple services to their customers.  Figure 2: Types of services provided by survey's respondents  In addition to the online survey, there have been interviews with experts from the electronic  communications industry, 10 electronic communication service providers and 2 vendors, asking them  qualitative questions about their views and experience with security risks involved in the procurement  and outsourcing process of key ICT products and services. Guidelines were gathered from them on  best practises in terms of security requirements and controls which should be applied to vendors to  prevent or mitigate such security risks.  Consequently a desktop study followed. Initiatives already taken by the industry were analysed,  regulatory frameworks or guidelines issued by National Regulatory Authorities (NRA) were looked into  and a range of standards and good practises were reviewed as suggested by the industry, such as  relevant ISO standards and the SAFECode leading practises.

ICT product supply chains and  outsourcing services are successively approached.   Section 3 describes concerns raised by providers during the survey. It focuses on issues  surrounding the management of the security risks and the implementation of security  requirements in the context of third party products and services. The issues are attributed a  number (Issue #1 etc.) and are referred to in the following three sections.   In section 4 national regulatory frameworks and guidelines are described, followed by a  description of industry standards and leading practises.   In section 5 the report presents a security framework with main measures used by electronic  communications service providers to ensure a constant level of resilience after the  introduction of third party products and services into their infrastructure, together with high  level security requirements commonly applied to vendors.   Lastly, in section 6 the report concludes with recommendations to the actors of the electronic  communications sector, with the aim to support them in the security management involved  in the procurement and outsourcing processes.  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 5  2 About Procured Products and Outsourced Services for Core Operations  It is probably not an exaggeration to say that all electronic communications service providers depend  to some degree on their suppliers. Indeed, most of the providers around the world, whatever their  size, their market position or their core services, have relationships with suppliers that provide them  with ICT products or managed services. Most of these products or services play a critical role within  the providers’ networks, and a disruption in those could have an immediate impact on the services  offered to their customers. There is a need for the electronic communication service providers to  carefully manage security risks involved in their procurement and outsourcing relationships to ensure  a constant level of resilience despite the introduction of third party products and services into their  infrastructure. This means that the providers should work closely with vendors to adopt good practises  in terms of security risk management.  2.1 ICT products supply chain  In general, it is common practice that suppliers provide electronic communications service providers  with ICT products and equipment, which will then be integrated into their network infrastructure.  Most of the components in a network are acquired from specialized and large ICT vendors. This  includes both software and hardware components, which are part of a complex environment. Below  we take a mobile network infrastructure as an example.  As shown in figure 3, several components shape a mobile network infrastructure and mobile operators  generally buy these components, from the access network components (Antennas, Base Transceiver  Station, etc.) to the core network components (HLR, GGSN, Intelligent Network). This example is  illustrative but other electronic communication networks present similar complexity.  eNodeB  MME  PDN UE  S-GW P-GW  Evolved packet core (all-IP)  HSS  Policy and Charging  Rules Function (PCRF)  eUTRAN Core Network  Internet  BSS / GERAN / UTRAN Core Network  Internet  MSC  GMSC  BTS NodeB  VLR  HLREIR AuC  PSTN  SGSN  GGSNUE  BSC / RNC  BSC / RNC  Packet Switched Core  (data)  Circuit Switched Core  (voice)  SDP  SCP  SMP  Intelligent Network  Internet  Figure 3: Complex network environment (Mobile 2G, 3G, LTE) - illustrative5  5 Theoretical, source EY Luxembourg  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 6  Nowadays, the ICT products supply chain is becoming more and more globalized and complex,  bringing additional challenges and dependencies for a provider. Multiple components designed,  developed and manufactured in different countries are now combined to produce a single hardware  or software later acquired by an electronic communication service provider through a single vendor.  Each member of the global ICT product supply chain has the responsibility to ensure the security and  the resilience of the final product. Taking that into consideration, a provider is becoming dependent  on the supplier’s downstream suppliers in case of security issues with one single product. This creates  the risk of lack of visibility, understanding, traceability and control over the ICT products for the  providers and increases the risk of counterfeit, malicious or untrustworthy products. As a result, there  is a need for the provider to use specific security frameworks to better manage evolving security risks  involved in the acquisition of ICT products from suppliers.  2.2 Outsourced services  Suppliers can also provide electronic communications service providers with services “in support of a  business function for performing activities using suppliers’ resources rather than the ones of the  acquirer”6 (i.e. human resources, infrastructure, etc.) to perform a specific operation. This involves a  long-term outsourcing contract covering a business operation (e.g. billing, HR, etc.), a network  operation (e.g. maintenance, strategy development, construction, integration, and even full scale  operation of networks and services etc.) or a top layer application (e.g. value added services).  Typically, the vendor acts under a service level agreement with full responsibility for the activities  specified in the outsourcing contract.  Unlike the outsourcing of business operations such as billing or HR function, the outsourcing of  network operations can impact the availability of the provider’s core service. As shown in figure 4, an  organization can outsource its complete network operation or a part of it, such as network planning,  network design and engineering (“PLAN”), network installation and integration (“BUILD”), or network  operations and maintenance (“RUN”). Among this last function, a provider can split its outsourced  services by network operations or field services.  Figure 4: Network operations which can be outsourced7  Electronic communications service providers are planning to spend about $79 billion in 2017 on  outsourced network tasks to equipment vendors, which represents 8 % of annual growth rate8 from  2012 to 20179.  6 ISO/IEC International Standard 27002 (2005), Information technology — Security techniques — code of practice for information security  7 Bookz & Company Inc (2009), Outsourcing network operations: Maximizing the potential  8 Compound Annual Growth Rate : the year-over-year growth rate of an investment over a specified period of time  9 Infonetics (2013), “Telecom equipment vendors manage 45% of the world’s subscribers as outsourcing grows”  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 7  While outsourcing is bringing several benefits to a company, it is also bringing security challenges such  as difficulties to align internal security objectives with suppliers’ policies, lack of security controls,  failures to accurately monitor the security performance of the supplier, etc. As a result, there is a need  to implement an information security governance framework toward outsourcing suppliers. Indeed,  savings from outsourcing could be offset by security incidents, so security threats need to be taken  into account from the first stage of the outsourcing process, to ensure that the benefits of outsourcing  can be realized despite security costs and constraints. On the other hand, suppliers of outsourcing  services should be able to properly manage the risks involved in the outsourcing process, meet clients’  requirements while still making a commercial profit. This means that electronic communications  service providers should be ready to accept an increase in price when imposing strong security  requirements.  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 8  3 Issues and Concerns expressed by providers  In the online survey and interviews with providers and vendors, a set of issues were collected that the  surveyed providers are concerned with when buying or outsourcing key ICT products and services. The  main concerns that were expressed include (but are not limited to):   Lack of adequacy and effectiveness of the security controls on the vendor’s side (Issue #1)  Providers are worried that the security measures that the vendors are applying by default will not be  adequate to protect their infrastructure. They are afraid that vendors’ security controls would not be  aligned with their own security objectives and would fail to prevent the security risks they have  identified. The providers want to receive the assurance from their vendors that relevant controls are  in place and operate correctly to meet the minimum acceptable level of residual risk they have  defined.   Potential vulnerabilities providers can be exposed to due to (unknown) flaws in ICT products  or services (Issue #2)  The interviewees are concerned about vulnerabilities, and especially potential blind spots, unknown  vulnerabilities, in products or services. This is also highlighted by the United States Government  Accountability Office (GAO) (2013), see section 4.1.1, which states that the main concerns of electronic  communication service providers when buying or outsourcing are the anomalies that could arise from  procured products because of low quality, lack of controls or potential errors (i.e. erroneous coding in  the software). The providers want to be made aware of any vulnerability affecting the product or  service they buy and any potential issues they can face with their equipment.  In addition, the providers wish to be informed by the vendor as soon as possible if another provider  has had issues with the same products they have procured, in order to fix the problems before it  actually affects their customers.   Non-compliance with security requirements defined in the contract on the vendor’s side  (Issue #3)  Another concern expressed in our interviews was that sometimes providers experienced vendors  deviating from agreed contracts or “taking shortcuts” in order to cut down costs or time to deliver and  as a result fail to comply with security requirements defined in the contracts leading to increased  security threats.   Lack of adequate support from vendor in case of breakdown (Issue #4)  Electronic communication providers expressed their worries regarding potential lack of support from  their vendors and outsourcing partners in case of incidents. More specifically they were concerned  with the level of responsibility the vendors are willing to accept as well as their response time. They  wanted to be assured that they would be supported by trained and skilled people in case of major  incidents and especially in order for their core services to recover quickly.   Weak negotiation power for provider to enforce specific security requirements (Issue #5)  Providers were concerned about the inherent lack of negotiation power they have, since options on  the market are limited. Some providers expressed that in some cases there could be a non- proportional increase in costs and time to market in vendor offers when requesting additional security  measures.  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 9   Lack of framework or guidelines from the industry to guide providers during the  procurement and outsourcing process (Issue #6)  Providers raised their concern about a lack of unified guidelines to help them dealing with security  risks involved in the procurement and outsourcing process. Despite the existence of standards related  to electronic communication security, providers have highlighted the lack of an integrated and unified  approach which will support them in specifically dealing with security risks involved in the  procurement and outsourcing process.  Through the review of existing initiatives, we observed that only a few national regulatory authorities  consider specifically the management of security risks involved in the relationships providers have  with ICT vendors into their national guidelines (i.e. UK, Australia, USA and India). In addition, our online  survey showed that 72% of the respondents stated that there is no regulatory framework to govern  their requirements regarding third party products and services.  Besides, the online survey showed that not all of the providers themselves apply security requirements  to their ICT vendors. About 7 % do not consider security requirements for ICT vendors, see figure 5  below, while most of them have different approaches for preventing or mitigating potential security  threats when buying from or outsourcing to third party. Through the online survey, we observed a  significant divergence between answers regarding content and levels of security requirements. Even  if all providers in our survey define Service Level Agreements with their vendors, the importance of  security requirements depends highly on the provider’s internal practises. As shown in figure 5, some  providers tend also to adapt the security requirements based on the type of products/services  supplied and/or based on the criticality of the products/services supplied. It could also be the case  that security requirements are adjusted based on the existing relationships providers have with the  vendors (e.g. in case of long and trustful relationship with the same supplier).  Figure 5: Divergence in approach in developing security requirements  52%  14%  7%  20%  7%  As part of the contract, do you require that your vendors follow certain security  practises?

Even if the goal of this report is not  to advise on an approach or another, it provides some comparable points of view.  We provide examples from four countries around the world which advocate through regulatory  frameworks the resilience of the electronic communications sector targeted on risks involved in  relationships with third parties.  A. United Kingdom10,11,12  In May 2011, EU Member States were required to implement Article 13a and 13b in national law as  requested by the EU Telecom Framework Directive. The UK’s Office of Communication (Ofcom)  complied with this requirement by revising the Communication Act 2003 (CA2003), principally by  adding the Sections 105A-D.  The guidance focuses on two main areas:   Risk management: electronic communication service providers and vendors must take care  of their networks, applying appropriate measures to manage security risks including  management of general security risks; protecting end users; protecting interconnections; and  maintaining network availability.   Incident reporting: Vendors and electronic communication service providers must report to  Ofcom any security breaches or reductions in availability which have a significant impact on  the network or service. This significant impact is measured through thresholds given for  different types of networks and outages.  To ensure the above, Ofcom expects providers to develop and implement appropriate risk  management or mitigation actions. In case of doubt about the compliance to the requirements, Ofcom  can request providers to perform an audit of their systems and impose financial penalties.  Due to the increased importance of outsourcing in the electronic communication service industry,  Ofcom have started considering that security requirements should be applied during the outsourcing  or procurement process (section 105 A – Management of general security risks).  According to Ofcom, providers should take the appropriate measures to mitigate security risks coming  from their supply chain. Ofcom expects providers to perform a risk assessment and implement  mitigations actions before entering into a new outsourcing relationship or implementing new  equipment into their network. In addition, the providers should have sufficient technical and  management expertise among its staff to manage potential security risks.  10 Ofcom (2012), Ofcom guidance on security requirements in the revised Communication Act 2003: Implementing the revised EU  Framework.  11 Ofcom (2014), Updating Ofcom’s guidance on network security.  12 Ofcom (2014), Ofcom guidance on security requirements in sections 105A to D of the Communication Act 2003  http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/telecoms/policy/security-resilience/  http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/telecoms/policy/security-resilience/  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 11  B. United States  The United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) was requested to conduct a study in 2013  on actions taken by federal institutions and electronic communication service provider to deal with  security risks involved in the procurement or outsourcing of foreign ICT products and services.13  It has been highlighted that the main concerns of the providers are not related to the provenance of  the products and services but rather the anomalies that could arise from procured products because  of low quality, lack of controls or potential errors (i.e. erroneous coding in the software) (Issue #2)  In order to deal with these problems, GAO study highlights three ways that companies have started  following in order to mitigate this problem:   Some companies have developed their own practices based on national and international  standards regarding information systems’ security (ISO, IEC, NIST, Internet Engineering Task  Force…).   Other companies have participated in cybersecurity groups such as The Open Group Trusted  Technology Forum (OTTF) and The Communication Sector Coordinating Council (CSCC). This  last group has the objective to facilitate the coordination between industry and the federal  government to improve physical and cyber security of the infrastructure through the creation  and adoption of standards.   Lastly, providers have adopted voluntary security management procedures which cover the  entire life cycle of their equipment:  o Vendor Selection: When the providers select their vendors, they usually focus on the  vendor’s security practices, their use of security-related standards and their reputation to  manage security issues. Their practices depend highly on the criticality of equipment or  services being procured.  o Vendor Security Requirements: Some companies force vendors to comply with  requirements covering the physical security of products, the access restriction to sensitive  company information and the verification of employees.  o Equipment testing and monitoring: Companies try to detect incidents and mitigate  vulnerabilities through tests, monitoring of the traffic and audits of the infrastructure.  In addition to the GAO study, the White House has initiated some efforts trying to mitigate  cybersecurity risks appearing in critical infrastructures including electronic communication networks.  In the Executive Order No. 13,636 released in February 2013,14 the White House calls for NIST to  develop a Cybersecurity Framework15 in order to create a compilation of standards and best practices.  This document represents a guide that can help organizations to improve their own risk management  processes and prioritize their cybersecurity decisions. The Framework includes three sub frameworks  as described below:  1 – The Framework Core covers a list of cyber security measures that are common around all sectors  and industries. These measures are sorted by functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and  Recover), categories and subcategories. It helps organizations to create or review their security risks  management practises and their cybersecurity program taking into account existing standards,  guidelines or practises.  13 GAO (2013), Electronic communication Networks: Addressing Potential Security Risks of Foreign-manufactured Equipment.  14 Federal Register of U.S.A.

The organization must assess their own performance in a scale  which ranges from Partial (Tier 1) to Adaptive (Tier 4).  3 – A Framework Profile: An organization will use the Framework Profile to define their current profile  but also the targeted profile they would like to reach in the future including external factors as legal  requirements, industry practices, etc. It supports organizations in identifying opportunities for  improvement. To make it possible, the organization must use the categories and subcategories  previously selected in “The Framework Core” and identify the standards, guidelines and practices that  will need to be implemented in order to reach the \"targeted objective\".  The White House aims with this initiative to alert providers about outsourcing risks. In addition, an  organization could use the targeted profile to request its external supplier to adopt specific  cybersecurity requirements.  C. India  In March 2010, the Indian Ministry of Communication and Information Technology published new  rules on security requirements which should be applied to ICT equipment to prevent and mitigate  security threats. However, due to problematic rules such as the disclosure of commercially sensitive  source code or the obligation to transfer technology to Indian companies, these requirements suffered  from external pressures and were deemed as too restrictive.  In May 2011, the Indian Ministry of Communication and Information Technology decided to present  an amended version. 16  According to this amended version, electronic communication service  providers should hold the complete and total responsibility of the security of their networks. More  specifically, providers must follow strict security guidelines when procuring or outsourcing network  elements:   Providers should have an organizational policy focused on security and security management  of their network.   Providers should audit their network or get it audited by a certified third party from a security  point of view once a year in order to assure the resilience and security of it.   Only network elements tested by relevant contemporary Indian or International Security  Standards (ISO, ITU, IETF, IEC...) can be integrated into an Indian network.   All features, equipment, software, etc., may be subjected to inspection and testing by the  Indian Department of Technology at any time.   Providers should keep records of procedures but also past operation, maintenance, change or  update of products.   Providers should have facilities to detect intrusions, attacks and frauds. Any security breaches  must be quickly reported to competent authorities.  To ensure that providers remain compliant, the Indian Department of Technology created a five  members committee. Every breach of security will be assessed by the committee which will determine  if they have been caused by defects. The electronic communication service providers can be punished  with penalties while the suppliers of hardware/software that caused the security issues could be  blacklisted, banning them from doing business in the country.  In addition to the mandatory requirements, the Indian Government suggested a list of steps which  can be followed by the providers on a voluntary basis. For example, they can create forums or  16Government of India Ministry of Communication & IT Department of Electronic communication (2011), Amendment to Unified Access  Service License Agreement for security related concerns for expansion of Telecom Services in various zones of the country  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 13  associations to increase the security assurance levels and share common issues on the topic. In  addition, the government suggested a template agreement17 which could be signed between the  provider and the manufacturer/vendor. In the context of the template agreement, the providers are  free to add, modify or delete any clauses to their suit. Main clauses are listed below:   The vendor must have a well-defined Information Security policy, compliant with ISO/IEC  27001:2005.   The vendor must be able to demonstrate that they have procedures to deal with security  threats.   The vendor must have a system for detecting and recording any attempted damage,  amendment or unauthorised access to provider’s information.   The vendor must be responsible for the software maintenance including upgrades, operating  systems and application from factory to desk. Additionally, the vendor shall ensure that  software is free of bugs.   The vendor must ensure that all tools, skills, resources remain operational after the end of the  contract.  D. Australia18  Since 2012, the Australian government has started considering a reform of its actual electronic  communication legislation (The Electronic communication Act (1997)) to include a risk-based  regulatory framework. The aim of this framework is to stimulate electronic communication service  providers to protect their infrastructure and take into account security risks when making business  decisions about the design and development of their network, including when they buy ICT products  or outsource ICT services. This approach does not force providers to adopt specific security  requirements but educates them on security risks and encourages them to take responsibility over  their network security. With it, the Australian government tries to raise providers’ awareness about  the potential security threats which could happen when developing their infrastructure, taking into  account their interactions with vendors.  More precisely, electronic communication service providers should be able to prove their competent  supervision and effective control over their network, either managed in-house or by a third party.  Competent supervision means that providers should be able to watch over their network operations  but also over parties which have authorized access to their infrastructure and data such as outsourcing  partners or vendors. In addition, it encompasses a reasonable ability to detect security breaches  impacting their own services but also compromising the cyber security of the country.  With effective control, providers would need to demonstrate their ability to maintain a direct  authority and/or a contractual arrangement over its suppliers, which guarantees the protection of  their infrastructure and data from unauthorized access and interference. In that regard, providers  would have to request their suppliers monitor and report security issues, as well as to implement  preventive actions to mitigate security risks associated with their products or services.  Some compliance assessment and audits may be requested by the government to ensure that  providers have the relevant security measures in place to comply with the regulation. In case of  unsuccessful compliance, the Australian government has the right to request some mitigation or  17Government of India Ministry of Communication & IT Department of Electronic communication (2010), Template of the agreement  between Licensee (VSAT & INSAT MSS-R) and vendor of equipment, product and services  18 Australian Government – Attorney Department (2012), General Equipping Australia against emerging and evolving threats.  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 14  remediation actions, including the modification of the infrastructure, audit or ongoing monitoring. In  that case, the costs should be supported by provider which would fail to meet the adequate security  level requested by the framework. In addition, the government could ask for financial penalties if  necessary.  4.1.2 Industry initiatives and International standards  In addition to national frameworks, some industry consortia or organizations have started to develop  standards and leading practises to help electronic communication service providers to address the  security risks faced when procuring and outsourcing.  When relevant, we map requirements or activities described below to the identified issues  experienced by providers described in section 3.  A. ISO/IEC FDIS 27002: Code of practice for information security controls19  According to the ISO standards, the security of an organization should not be impacted by the  introduction of a third party’s product or service. For this reason, ISO/IEC FDIS 27002 includes some  security practices used by organizations to manage risks involved in their supplier relationship and  take into account the following controls:  1. Identification of risks related to external parties (control 6.2.1 – ISO/IEC 17799:2005)  Every time a third party gets access to an organization’s information or information processing  facilities while offering a product or service, a risk assessment should be performed to determine  potential security implications and adequate security requirements that will need to be established  by both the organization and the supplier. Among other things, the risk assessment should take into  account the following criteria: Type of access granted, targeted facilities, sensitivity of information,  identification of persons who get the access, current controls used by third parties, practices to  manage security incidents, regulatory requirements, etc.  2. Addressing security in third party agreements (control 6.2.3 – ISO/IEC 17799:2005)  All relevant risks and security requirements identified in the previous section (i.e. control 6.2.1) should  be incorporated into a contract. This will assure that there is no misunderstanding between the  organization and its supplier regarding the security requirements and responsibilities of each party.  The contract can be different depending on the organization and the type of supplier used. However,  the ISO advises to consider the following terms to be included in each contract:  - Information security objectives to be achieved, as defined by the organization's security policy  - Parties’ responsibilities and roles  - Controls to ensure assets protection  - Access control policy  - Change management processes  - Reporting structure and reporting template  - Information security incidents management processes  - Targeted level of service and unacceptable level of service  - KPIs and monitoring process  19 ISO/IEC International Standard 27002 (2005), Information technology — Security techniques — code of practice for information security  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 15  - Right to audit, or to have those audits carried out by a third party  - Service continuity requirements  - Involvement of the third party with subcontractors, and security controls that would be  required to be implemented by subcontractors  - Conditions for renegotiation/termination of contract.  - Etc.  3. Service delivery (control 10.2.1 – ISO/IEC 17799:2005)  An organization should make sure that the security requirements included in the contract are  implemented, operated and maintained by its suppliers (Issue #3). In case of an outsourcing  relationship, the organization should ensure that the security requirements are maintained also during  the transition period, back to the organization or transferred to another supplier.  4. Monitoring and review of third party services (control 10.2.2 – ISO/IEC 17799:2005)  An organization should regularly monitor the performance of its vendors by regularly reviewing  services reports and records provided by suppliers. In addition, an organization should perform regular  audit of its supplier (or involve a third party to perform those audits). Penalties can be used in case of  non-compliance with the contract (Issue #3).  5. Managing changes to third party services (control 10.2.3 – ISO/IEC 17799:2005)  An organization should pay attention to any changes to the provision of services, including changes in  security policies, procedures or controls. These changes can be initiated by the organization (e.g.  development of new applications, update of policies, etc.) or by its suppliers (e.g. use of new  technologies, development of new tools, etc.). In any case, a new risk assessment should be performed  to assess new security implications and associated security requirements which should be applied.  In addition to the ISO/IEC FDIS 27002 presented above, ISO organization has recently published a  standard (ISO/IEC 27036:2013 – only part 1 and 3 are currently published) related to specific  information security techniques applying to supplier relationships. 20  This standard offers further  detailed guidance on how to deal with security risks involved in the acquisition of goods and services.  For example, ISO/IEC 27036:2013 advise organizations to adopt a framework with a set of  standardized processes for the acquisition of products and services:  - An organization should start by establishing information security and compliance  requirements for the exchange of information with the suppliers.  - Before buying or outsourcing, an organization should assess the security risks involved in  these processes.  - It should establish a process to negotiate security requirements with the vendors which will  be incorporated into the contract (e.g. right to audit, etc.).  - An organization should continuously monitor the performance of its suppliers and refer back  to the service level agreement included in the contract in case of deficiencies.  20  ISO/IEC International Standard 27036 (2014), Information technology — Security techniques — Information security for supplier  relationships — Part 1: Overview and concepts.  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 16  B. Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI): Security Governance  Framework for IT Managed Service provision – UK 21  The Security Framework developed by the CPNI deals with security across the outsourcing process  through several elements:  1. Roles and Responsibilities  When outsourcing, there is a range of key responsibilities that need to be allocated, both at the  electronic communication service provider’s organization and at the outsourcing partner’s  organization. More specifically, responsibilities should be established to make sure that security risks  and security requirements are clearly articulated and fully understood, that an acceptable level of  residual risk is agreed with the provider, that security risks are managed during the complete  outsourcing lifecycle, that assurance is gained regarding the security framework in place and that  incidents are accurately reported and investigated. These responsibilities should be defined in the  contract signed between both parties.  2. Risk assessment  Before starting outsourcing, an organization should assess the security risks involved in this process.  To achieve this, an organization should first identify the business processes and functions subjected  to outsourcing and the specific governance, regulatory or compliance standards; or other technical  constraints which applied to them and could have a security implication.  Then, for each process or function, an assessment should be carried out to evaluate the impact of a  loss of confidentiality, integrity or availability on the business. In addition, the organization should  assess other security threats such as people/organizations which could attack its systems, their  motivation and capacity to do so.  Third, a review of the current and actual vulnerabilities should be performed as well as a review of the  current mitigation plans implemented. An organization can always set up a residual risk level which  will be accepted by the management. This should nevertheless be in line with the organization’s risks  appetite.  21 Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) (2009), Outsourcing: security governance framework for IT Managed Service  Provision  Figure 6: CPNI Security Governance Framework  Roles and  Responsibilities  Risk Assessment  Managing security  during the  outsourcing  process  Assurance and  Conformance  Security in the  contract lifecycle  Change  Management  Incident  Management  Termination  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 17  Lastly, the organization should identify the gap between the current level of risk management and the  targeted level in order to plan corrective actions.  3. Managing security during the outsourcing process  Once the risk assessment has been performed, an organization has to articulate and develop  appropriate security requirements which will be then communicated to the outsourcing services  provider. It is crucial for the provider to manage the security during the complete lifecycle of the  outsourcing project to ensure that all requirement initially set up are respected by both parties.  Requirements can be set up, communicated, managed and monitored differently based on the  organization’s security risks management approach:  - The electronic communication service provider can describe in a very detailed manner the  controls which will be required to manage security risks. The supplier will then operate its  service according to the provider’s specifications, developing the technical configurations,  procedures, etc. to implement the required controls. The provider will have the right to audit  to gain the assurance that controls operate as they should to manage the security risks. This  approach will be costly in terms of the provider’s resources. Indeed, experts in the fields will  be required to specify and negotiate the controls with the supplier. However, it can define  exactly how security will be addressed in the outsourcing relationship.  - The electronic communication service providers can also develop a set of high level control  objectives (possibly with the help of a third party). If the providers don’t do it themselves, it  will be the sole responsibility of the supplier to define and implement specific security  measures which will meet these objectives. With this approach, the supplier increases its  flexibility but needs to provide its customer with the assurance that control objectives have  been met.  - Lastly, controls can be setup according to international standards such as ISO 27001/2. In that  case, the supplier is required to provide certification of compliance to its client.  The performance of the supplier against the security requirements will be included in the Service Level  Agreement. In case of bad performance, suppliers can be subject to financial penalties (Issue #3).  4. Assurance and conformance  Organizations which are using outsourcing suppliers should receive assurance from their partners that  the risks are correctly managed, that the right processes are in place to guarantee the lowest  acceptable level of security risks and ensure that incidents are reported, investigated and corrective  actions are taken (Issue #3). Assurance can be gained using several methods as agreed in the contract:  - The outsourcing services supplier can report security status and incidents as part of a service  reporting;  - The supplier can request regular independent reviews of its systems and report to its  customers the results and any corrective actions identified;  - The electronic communication service provider can have the right to audit or the right to  review its suppliers’ systems. This can also be performed by a third party if needed;  - Assurance can be gained through certification (ISO 27001).  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 18  5. Security in the contract lifecycle  Security requirements should stay a priority for the organization using outsourcing services during the  complete contract lifecycle.  High level security requirements should be defined even before starting the invitation to tender and  request for proposal. This will support the organization in assessing and reviewing its requirements  based on suppliers’ response and issuing a more detailed statement of requirements later on. The  preferred supplier will be selected based on specific security criteria and scoring methods. This means  that it has to show its experience and capacity to comply with the security requirements defined by  the electronic communication service provider (Issue#1).  Once a supplier is selected, both parties enter into the negotiation phase to finalize the contract. This  will include the definition of security requirements, the security management approach, the controls  specifications and the assurance approach. The contract will be the reference for the supplier to  operate the services and manage the risks according to the requirements.  6. Change management  Security risks can evolve and security requirements can become obsolete. So, any contract should take  into account potential changes. In addition, the responsibilities for change initiation and additional  costs should be established in advance to avoid any further conflict between parties.  7. Termination  Besides, the contract needs to include the procedure to be followed in case of agreement termination.  It will help to ensure that the security risks are managed effectively even during the transition from  the outsourcing provider back to the customer or another service provider; this includes handling all  documents, procedures, configurations etc.  8. Incidents management  The service supplier should report timely and accurately any incidents, near misses or anomalies. Both  parties should agree on how incidents should be managed and investigated (Issue #4). Third party  could be requested to perform the investigation and recommend corrective actions.  C. SAFECode: software Assurance Forum for Excellence in Code22,23  The SAFECode association has released several papers to advise software providers in good practices  to mitigate security risks involved in their global supply chain.  Commercial software starts to be more and more developed in a global environment, meaning that  vendors now serve international markets and use multiple international suppliers to integrate  innovative solutions. Each IT product is now a collection of components developed across the globe  by several suppliers, their subcontractors or obtained by Open Source repositories.  This global model of distribution raises concerns about additional product security risks and software  suppliers are now required to demonstrate the security of the products they produce but also the  security of the component they acquire and use. As a result, there is a need to develop a common  framework to ensure that the overall software industry address supply chain threats to software  integrity (Issue #6).  22  Software Assurance Forum for Excellence in Code (2009), The Software Supply Chain Integrity Framework: Defining Risks and  Responsibilities for Securing Software in the Global Supply Chain.  23 Software Assurance Forum for Excellence in Code (2010), The Software Integrity Controls: An Assurance-Based Approach to Minimizing  Risk in the Software Supply Chain.  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 19  Focusing on Integrity related controls; SAFECode is trying to help organizations in preventing  unauthorized or unintentional changes in the source code of the software. SAFECode has developed  a range of process guidelines split into three key lifecycle processes:  Figure 7: SafeCode Lifecycle Processes  1. Software sourcing process  The controls applied during the sourcing process highly depends on the nature of the relationship  between the vendor and it software supplier, and the level of control a vendor has on its supplier. A  vendor can set up two main types of controls: contractual integrity controls and technical integrity  controls. With the first one, a vendor will sign a written agreement with its supplier clearly stating its  expectations, responsibility and ownership of parties, capability of supplier to respond to vulnerability  threats and capacity to train its people on evolving secure development practices. On the other hand,  technical integrity controls will include more technical requirements such as secure transfer (e.g.  encrypted), privileges management, malware scanning, secure storage, secure code exchange.  2. Software Development and Testing  There are different types of controls which can be used to guarantee the integrity of software during  the development process. First, an organization should have strong security policy for its people  including segregations of duties and security training. Automated processes should always be  privileged to minimize the human interventions and decrease the risks from malicious insiders.  Second, the environment around the development of the software should be highly secure: the  network used and location where the software and code are developed and stored should be secure  and have strong access controls. In addition, clear documentation about the change management  process, change logs and components/code should be kept for reference in case of issues. Lastly, the  organization should test code/software both for vulnerabilities and bugs through automated testing  tools but also through manual review to identify common patterns previously identified to ensure that  the products function as expected.  3. Software Delivery  In the delivery stage, the software can be delivered directly to the end customers but can also first be  delivered to intermediaries such as system integrators, resellers etc. This means that controls falling  under this process are similar to the ones developed for the sourcing stage. However, additional  security concerns can arise when the product is complete. This brings additional controls such as: final  malware scanning, code signing by the software vendor and secure delivery process.  Similarly to the SAFECode initiative described above, the Internet Security Alliance (ISA) has developed  guidelines for securing the electronics value chain24. More specifically, ISA provides IT companies with  very specific security requirements they should apply at each stage of the production of an electronic  product. These security guidelines help companies to prevent losses due to interruptions or delay in  24 The Internet Security Alliance (ISA) (2013), The ISA Guidelines for Securing the Electronics Supply Chain, by Scott Borg.  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 20  the production, voluntary or involuntary altered products, discrediting of processes or products, and  theft of information/data.  Also, The Open Group Standard developed in 2013 security requirements which would help  organizations to mitigate maliciously tainted and counterfeit products25. This standard is a set of  guidelines, requirements and recommendations built to support vendors in ensuring the integrity of  hardware and software developed in a globalized value chain. Such requirements include among other  things: physical security procedures, proper access controls, employees’ background check, product  quality assessment, etc.  25 Open Group Standard (2013), Mitigating Maliciously Tainted and Counterfeit Products – Version 1.0  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 21  5 Security framework commonly used by providers for buying or outsourcing  Following the results of the online survey, the insights discussed during the interviews and the  information gathered with the desktop research, it has been observed that many electronic  communications service providers have some policy or framework in place to manage the security  issues experienced during the procurement or outsourcing of ICT products and services. The security  framework usually focuses on the following areas:  Figure 8: Framework to address security risks when buying or outsourcing  About 97% of the organizations that participated in the online survey have corporate security policies  or security frameworks in place which apply to their relationships with ICT outsourcing partners or ICT  products vendors. Among them, 54% apply a different policy depending on the type of products and  services procured or outsourced and/or depending on the product and service’s criticality. On the  other hand, the others seem to apply a standard corporate security policy to mitigate the risks  involved in the procurement or outsourcing process.  However, despite the existence of standards related to electronic communication security, providers  have highlighted a lack of an integrated and unified approach which will support them in specifically  dealing with security risks involved in the procurement and outsourcing process (Issue #6). To address  this concern, the following sections describe in more details the different steps commonly taken by  the providers as identified through the survey to address the security risks involved in the  procurement and outsourcing process (See also figure 8).  5.1 Risk Assessment  Several regulators (e.g. Ofcom in the Communication Act 2003) and industry standard consortia (e.g.  ISO) advise the electronic communication service providers to perform a Risk Assessment before  entering into a relationship with an ICT products vendor or an outsourcing partner. It will help them  to identify areas of risks, especially the potential lack effectiveness of vendor’s security practises (Issue  #1), and customize security requirements placed on the vendor accordingly. According to GAO (2013),  the providers have the opportunity to take into account the following criteria when performing a Risk  Assessment:   Vendor’s actual security practises;   Vendor’s adoption of security standards or industry best practises;   Vendor’s reputation and past performance related to security and resilience of its  product/service;   Information on vendor’s subcontractors (e.g. Subcontractors’ security policy, reputation,  legislation, etc.);   Criticality of the equipment procured or outsourced (i.e. most critical components require  stronger security practises).  The online survey revealed that more than 70% of the respondents use a Network and Information  Security (NIS) Risk Assessment before contracting with a vendor. The top risk evaluated through a NIS  Risk Assessment is the denial of service attack (figure 9). Most of the respondents scale the denial of  service attack as the highest risk due to its direct impact on service availability. The vendors should be  Risk Assessment Development of  security requirement Performance  Monitoring  Change/Termination  Management  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 22  able to prove that they have security measures in place to prevent to some extent such incidents to  happen, avoiding a complete service collapse for the customers. It is worth noting that Denial of  Service attacks represented only a very small percentage of all the outages in the electronic  communications services that were reported to ENISA and the Commission in 2012 and 201326.  Following the risk of denial of service, the respondents indicated faulty changes/upgrades, bad  maintenance and the risk of configuration errors as the risks they would be the most worried about,  see figure 9. According to the ENISA incidents report (2013), these risks are relatively common and  affect a significant range of providers, and they need to be carefully assessed by the provider. Similarly,  the industry associations such as GAO, CPNI, etc., advise providers to assess the vendors’ security  practises, past performance, reputation, etc., to evaluate the risks of making errors or take faulty  decisions.  Lastly, the providers evaluate hardware failures and power cut as part of a NIS Risk Assessment. Those  risks are most of the time leading to a complete disruption of service for electronic communication  service providers and need to be taken into account. Based on the risk assessments, providers could  evaluate the vendors’ business continuity and recovery plans used following these kinds of incidents.  The Risk assessment will help providers to evaluate if vendors’ security practises are aligned with their  own security objectives and would contribute in preventing the security risks they have identified  (Issue #1). Of course, the existing security framework of the vendor will be improved by additional  security requirements set up by the providers to ensure the highest level of security and resilience  with electronic communication networks.  Figure 9: Risks evaluated during a NIS Risk assessment  5.2 Development of Security Requirements  Once the Risk Assessment has been performed, an electronic communication service provider can  start to articulate and develop appropriate security requirements which will help them to manage the  security risks identified during the Risk Assessment. The security requirements should be  26http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports  4,32  3,95  3,91  3,86  3,86  3,86  3,82  3,73  3,60  3,59  3,48  3,45  3,27  2,91  0 1 2 3 4 5  Denial of Service attack  Faulty changes/upgrades  Bad maintenance  Configuration errors  Hardware failures  Power cuts  Software security vulnerabilities - design error  Insider attacks  Cable cuts  Theft  Social engineering attacks  Congestion/overload  Downtime caused by administrative or legal issues  Vendor lock-in causing incidents  (0) Non risk – (5) Very high risk  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 23  implemented by the vendors as agreed with the providers to ensure an on-going and secure delivery  of service (Issue #3).  According to CPNI (2009), the set-up of high level security requirements could even start before  selecting the preferred vendor. High level requirements could be drawn up at the first stage of the  vendor’s selection process and could be included in the Request for Proposal document in order to  select the suppliers based on their capacity to comply with the same and avoid the risk of inefficient  security controls (Issue #1). Consequently, there is a necessity for each organization to assess and  review the capacity of its suppliers through qualifications check and credentials.  The security requirements, together with the clear set of responsibilities of parties, the Key  Performance Indicators (KPIs) and the monitoring process should be clearly defined and stated in the  contract signed with the vendor. Indeed, providers have highlighted their concern about potential  non-compliance of vendors with security requirements defined in the contract (Issue #3). Most  interviewees agree that the providers have the responsibility to build precise, strong and stable  requirements to avoid any confusion or misunderstanding during the whole duration of the  relationship with their vendors. The contract will be the reference point for the supplier on how to  operate the service and manage the risks according to the requirements. Doing this will ensure a much  more smooth and secure process for both parties involved.  “The better you define your criteria, your SLA for example, the better possibilities you have to have a  functioning network. As a consequence, the commercial/contractual negotiation phase is key to ensure  that realistic and appropriate KPIs are agreed between both parties.” [Major equipment vendor]  As part of the contract, 93% of the respondents to the online survey require their vendors to follow  certain security requirements. Security requirements are either applied on a case by case basis  following a discussion between the relevant stakeholders (technical team, commercial team,  architecture team, etc.), or are standardized across the products and services. Only the lower layer  products such as switches or routers are mainly subject to more standardized security requirements.  The outsourcing services, especially services which demand providers to share confidential data with  their vendors, are usually subject to more sophisticated and customized security requirements. During  the survey, it has also been cited that security requirements depend on the potential impact of a  failure for the customers, so quite naturally, if a product or service breakdown has a significant impact,  it will require stronger security requirements.  As per the online survey, 44% of respondents apply different requirements depending on the type of  products and services and/or depending on the product/service criticality while the others seem to  apply more standardized security requirements to their vendors, for instance in terms of potential  user-hours lost.  Overall, the security requirements can vary between different products and services based on:   The type of product/service provided;   The criticality of the product and service provided;   The electronic communication service provider’s specific requests or needs;   The level of resilience of the network;   The capacity of the network;   The architecture of the network with a strong focus on redundancies;   The business continuity/recovery plans in place in case of incidents.  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 24  In most cases, setting up security requirements is not particularly challenging as it represents a  common practise in the industry. Nevertheless, some providers have expressed their concern about  the inherent lack of negotiation power they may have faced with vendors. Some providers expressed  that in some cases there could be a non-proportional increase in the costs and the time to market on  the vendors’ side when requesting additional or too specific security measures (Issue #5).  Consequently, the providers would need to strongly negotiate with their vendors regarding the level  of requirements they want to apply (e.g. actual response time which would be satisfying for the  providers).  Most of the security requirements highlighted during the online survey are taken into account by  electronic communication service providers when procuring or outsourcing. Nevertheless, it can be  observed that all providers do not always apply the same security requirements. On average, each  security requirement suggested was either “often applied” or either “applied ad-hoc” by the  respondents.  Figure 10: Main requirements from providers applied in the supplier's contract  Overall, the main requirements which providers rely on is the SLA (identified as “always applied”),  followed by testing and auditing, see figure 10. Security requirements addressed (and mentioned in  figure 10) during the online survey are presented below. Some additional requirements (i.e.  assurance, certification and security requirements targeted to subcontractors) have been added due  to their importance raised during the desktop research and the interviews.   Service Level Agreement and Key Performance Indicators  The vendor’s performance and compliance in regard to contract’s security requirements would need  to be monitored and compared to a Service Level Agreement (SLA). The interviewees stressed the  point that the terms included in the SLA have to be simple, clear and measurable. It is crucial for an  electronic communication service provider to be able to verify that the KPIs requirements have been  met by the vendor in order to ensure the vendor’s compliance with the security requirements set up  in the contract (Issue #3).  In addition, the provider could develop clear processes to handle any deviations of a vendor regarding  the SLA. 76% of providers who responded to the online survey ask for compensation or issue penalties  when the performance does not meet the expectations defined in the SLA. Likewise, it has been cited  that stronger penalties can help providers to transfer the security risks to the vendors.

It provides the insurance for the providers that there are not known anomalies or low  quality with the product or services procured (Issue #2). Hence, testing would need to be performed  during the development phase, before and after the integration into the existing infrastructure and  when any patches or updates are applied.  Testing can be performed by the vendors, the providers, a third party and/or by collaborative labs.  This needs to be agreed during the negotiation phase and included in the contract. As a good practise,  complete testing including penetration testing, code review, testing in several environments,  iterations testing, etc., should be performed to guarantee the quality of the product and services  provided. The vendors are often requested to share testing procedures together with testing results  with the provider.   Physical and environmental security  According to SAFECode (2010), the environment around the development of the ICT products and the  performance of an ICT service should be highly secure: the network used and location where the  equipment and infrastructure are developed and stored should be secure and have strong access  controls. In case of physical security breach, malicious attacks could be performed, impacting the  integrity of the network and availability of the electronic communications service. In addition, a  vendor should ensure that the exchange of information, data or codes is highly secure.   Incident management and reporting  The interviewed providers stressed that the suppliers should report timely and accurately any  incidents, near misses or anomalies affecting the electronic communication service providers that  happened with their products or services. In some countries such as Australia27, the suppliers have the  obligation to report incidents to the providers.  First, an early warning could immediately be sent in case of anomalies or suspected incidents to inform  the provider about the situation and ensure an efficient management of the incident.  Secondly, the vendors could investigate and report in details past incidents or near misses in order to  identify causes, learn from the incidents and implement changes when required. A third party could  in some cases be requested to perform investigations and recommend corrective actions.  In addition, the vendors could be requested to report to its clients, any incidents which occurred with  their products or services across the electronic communication industry. This initiative would increase  the transparency regarding potential issues or vulnerabilities and help the providers to prevent the  same type of issues.  This initiative has been highlighted many times during the survey meaning that it is crucial for the  provider to be informed by the vendor in case there is any problem or a vulnerability is discovered or  reported with similar products and services across the electronic communications market (Issue #2).  27 Australian Government – Attorney Department (2012), General Equipping Australia against emerging and evolving threats.  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 26   Business continuity  Electronic communications service providers expressed in the interview their concerns regarding  potential lack of support from their vendors and outsourcing partners in case of incidents and that  their core services will be able to recover quickly (Issue #4). Consequently, they are requesting from  their suppliers to develop a precise and documented business continuity plan (BCP) and a disaster  recovery plan (DRP).  During our survey, it was highlighted that providers often define a minimum time  for recovery from failure or disaster but also a minimum level of service that should be provided by  the vendor (agreed as part of their SLA) in order to ensure the continuity of their critical services or  reduce the recovery time. These metrics are usually taken into account by the vendor in the definition  of the DRP and BCP.   Integration, migration  Our interviewed providers usually require their vendors to assess the quality and security of the  products and services supplied before their integration into the providers’ networks. In addition,  providers are verifying the quality and functionality of the products against specifications defined in  the contract before their integration into their system. Some acceptance criteria can be set up by the  provider and the product or equipment can be rejected if it does not comply with the provider’s  expectations clearly defined in the contract. This will ensure that products and services are working  as they should and avoid any unexpected anomalies (Issue #2).  However, quality and security are not only critical during the integration of a product or a service into  the provider’s network. It should be managed and ensured also in case of upgrade or decommission.  The change management process should indeed include accurate and efficient testing to guarantee  the security and quality during any change.   Organizational security  Providers in our survey are often concerned that vendors’ security controls would not be aligned with  their own security objectives and would fail to prevent the security risks they have identified (Issue  #1). According to ISO/IEC FDIS 27002 standards, the security of an organization should not be  impacted by the introduction of third party products or services. Therefore, the suppliers could adopt  the security policy of their client or have a security policy aligned with the electronic communications  service provider’s security objectives in order to provide them with the same level of security they  apply in-house.   Monitoring and logging  It has been highlighted many times during the survey that the monitoring of vendors’ products is  crucial for a provider. One of their concerns is a lack of monitoring and logging from their vendor  regarding potential security breaches, unauthorized accesses or unauthorized changes which could  occur with their products or services. Vendors have the opportunity to increase the security level by  monitoring and logging for issues and breach and share critical information with providers to increase  the resilience of electronic communication services.   Human resources security  Among the queried security requirements, human resource management was the least applied among  the providers. Vendors have the opportunity to increase the quality of their services by providing  valuable technical knowledge and skills to the providers. To achieve this, it is crucial for vendors to  have highly trained and knowledgeable staff, capable to support providers in their technical request  and guide them in ensuring a high level of resilience. This is even more important when dealing with  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 27  incidents or disaster. Many times, providers have raised concern regarding potential bad support from  their vendors in case they have to recover their network following an incident (Issue #4).   Assurance  The interviewed providers raised that assurance should be provided by the vendor that security risks  are managed continuously and that requirements are implemented and operated as agreed with the  electronic communication service provider in the contract (Issue #3). Assurance can be gained using  several methods which should be defined in the contract28:  - The supplier can regularly report the security status and incidents as part of a service reporting.  - The supplier can request regular independent reviews of its own systems and reports the results  and any corrective actions identified to its customers. In that case, the supplier supports the costs  associated with the audit or inspection. This approach requires no financial investment from the  electronic communication service provider.  - The electronic communication service provider can have the right of audit or the right of  inspection of its suppliers’ systems. Audits and inspections represent a big investment and are  costly measures for the providers. Nevertheless, most of the providers include in the contract the  right to audit or inspect their supplier’s infrastructure as this represents a very useful tool for  ensuring compliance and keeping with agreed standards. However, the decision to perform an  audit is made on a case by case basis, depending on the context and the criticality of the product  or service provided. About 66% of the providers who answered to the online survey perform (or  request 3rd parties to perform) audits of their vendors and outsourcing partners.  - Assurance can also partly be gained through certification (e.g. ISO 27001).   Certifications  Certifications are often required by the surveyed providers for the outsourcing partners (ISO 2700x,  ISA 3402). It provides the provider with an independent assurance that the vendor’s controls have  been correctly designed and operate effectively (Issue #1). According to the online survey, 62% of  respondents request specific products or services certification from their vendors.   Subcontractors’ requirements  Due to the globalization of the ICT products supply chain, more and more players are now interacting  to produce a single product. As a result, some of the electronic communications service providers take  into account potential subcontractors of their vendors when developing security requirements.  According to the ISO/IEC FDIS 27002 standard, the security requirements applying to the main vendors  should also be imposed to downstream suppliers. In addition, a provider should always verify the  methodology used by its vendors to select and manage their own suppliers.  5.3 Performance Monitoring  An organization has the opportunity to continuously monitor the performance of its vendors in order  to assess the compliance of the vendors with security requirements set up in the contract (Issue #3).  To facilitate the monitoring, it is crucial that vendors share all the information, data, record and  knowledge indispensable for the electronic communication service providers to monitor their  28 Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) (2009), Outsourcing: security governance framework for IT Managed Service  Provision  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 28  performance. Performance should be assessed against the KPIs defined in the SLA and corrective  actions or penalties can be applied in case of deficiencies. Examples of main KPIs used are   Uptime   Response time to alarms   Issues resolution time  Some providers are using a collaborative approach when dealing with security risks involved in the  procurement and outsourcing process. It involves a strong collaboration between parties in terms of  sharing of information and sharing of knowledge which supports the electronic communication service  providers in testing and monitoring the performance of the vendor’s products and services. Indeed,  some interviewees expressed that in many cases, the providers need to have better information about  the products and services provided to accurately monitor the performance of their vendors.  5.4 Change/Termination Management  According to CPNI (2009), the security risks can evolve and the security requirements can quickly  become obsolete. Consequently, the provider together with the vendor could discuss and plan how  to handle any future changes in security requirements. More importantly, processes for change  management and responsibilities regarding change initiation would need to be established in advance  and included in the contract. Both parties can also define who will support the cost depending on the  type of change and include the same in the contract.  In addition, the contract needs to include the procedure to be followed in case the agreement is  terminated. This will ensure that the security risks are managed effectively even during the transition  from the outsourcing supplier/vendor back to the customer or another supplier. The termination  process includes:  - Transferring all documents, procedures, configuration, record, etc. relating the product or service  to the electronic communication service provider to ensure a smooth continuation of it;  - Handling to the electronic communication service provider or destroying all documents, files,  records containing provider’s information;  - In case the retention of some information is agreed with the provider, specific security measures  need to be agreed and implemented to ensure the confidentiality and the protection of the data.  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 29  6 Recommendations  Based on concerns expressed by providers, our own observations and existing initiatives, we provide  in this section a set of general recommendations to the sector and specific recommendations to  providers that could be taken to improve the security of electronic communication networks and  services with respect to dependencies on third party products and managed services. The aim of these  recommendations is to support the management of security risks faced by providers when buying ICT  products and services and contribute to an appropriate level of security and resilience.  In parallel with this report we are publishing a separate Security Guide aimed at providers and also  vendors, where we propose guidance on specific security requirements providers may request from  their vendors when entering into a contractual relationship.29  6.1 General recommendations to the electronic communications sector  The following two general recommendations are aimed at Member States and the actors in the  electronic communications sector.  Recommendation 1: Member States should promote the awareness about security risks related to  ICT procurement and outsourcing  Member States must ensure that the introduction of third party’s products or services into an  electronic communication network does not impact the level of resilience and thus the continuity of  supply of services for the customers. There is a need to raise awareness with providers and vendors  about the importance of managing security risks involved in the procurement and outsourcing of ICT  products.  Applying security requirements to vendors will help providers to comply with Article 13a and address  the security and integrity of their networks and services. Member states, in particular NRAs, have the  opportunity to stimulate the development of security practises targeted to the procurement and  outsourcing but also the sharing of best practises, knowledge, and tips and tricks between electronic  communications service providers on dealing with ICT vendors. This will support the industry to  develop a more unified and integrated approach which will support providers in specifically dealing  with security risks involved in the procurement and outsourcing process (Issue #6).  Recommendation 2: Vendors, providers and critical customers should develop a collaborative  approach to defining security requirements, to sharing information about security vulnerabilities  and threats, and to the mitigation of incidents  Providers often procure similar ICT products and they often have similar security requirements. This  means there is an opportunity for providers to collaborate and jointly set security requirements. The  ENISA security guide for ICT procurement could be used as a basis for such collaboration.30  The vendors of ICT products and services should collaborate with providers in order to build more  resilient and secure electronic communication services for end customers and for the whole society.  This should start in the beginning of the procurement or outsourcing process as it helps the provider  and the vendor to jointly define clear, actionable and measurable security requirements and avoid  disputes going forward (Issue #3). The ENISA Security Guide for ICT Procurement could be used as the  basis for such security requirements.31 The security requirements become a reference point for the  supplier on how to manage the risks during the complete lifecycle of the relationship. And because  29 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/requirements-ecomms-vendors  30 Ibid.  31 Ibid.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/requirements-ecomms-vendors  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 30  security risks can change over time, and new issues might come up, there should be a mechanism  which allows vendors, providers and critical customers (e.g. within the energy, health, and transport  sector respectively), to share information in case of discovered vulnerabilities, threats, near-incidents  and incidents (Issue #2).  Lastly, the vendor can support providers in monitoring and testing the performance of procured  products and outsourced services, and the providers should receive appropriate and prompt support  by the vendors in case of problems or occurred security incidents (Issue #4).  As highlighted during the survey, by adopting a more collaborative approach, vendors, providers and  users will all benefit from a more transparent view and in the end more resilient networks and  services.  6.2 Recommendations to individual providers of electronic communications  networks and services  The following recommendations are specifically aimed at providers of electronic communications  networks and services.  Recommendation 3: Engage internal stakeholders and develop a holistic risks management  approach  When addressing security risks in the procurement and outsourcing process, the electronic  communications service provider should involve stakeholders across the organization (Issue #2, #3,  #4). The ENISA Security Guide for ICT Procurement32 could be used as a starting point for working with  internal stakeholders (e.g. the information security team, procurement team, architecture team and  the management team).  It is particularly important to ensure that these security practises are embedded in the whole  organisation. There needs to be procedures in place for addressing and developing vendor security  requirements between network and security experts, procurement and not least management.  Recommendation 4: Conduct a risk assessment before procuring or outsourcing to third party  Before starting the procurement or outsourcing process and entering into a relationship with a third  party, the electronic communications service provider is advised to conduct a Risk Assessment. A Risk  Assessment will support the provider in better identifying the security risks they may face if they enter  in such a relationship, especially the potential lack effectiveness of vendor’s security practises (Issue  #1), and develop specific and relevant security requirements targeted to the vendor which will prevent  or mitigate those risks. Security Risks Assessment can include (but is not limited to) the following  elements:   Criticality of the product procured or service outsourced;   Potential impact in case of loss of confidentiality, integrity or availability;   Known and identified vulnerabilities;   External security threats such as malicious attacks;   Minimum level of residual risk which is acceptable by the electronic communication service  provider;   Vendor’s existing security practises including internal security practises, adoption of security  standard or recognised industry practises, etc.;   Vendor’s past performance or reputation on past performance;   Ability to change vendors (in order to avoid vendor lock-in);  32 Ibid.  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 31   Information on vendor’s subcontractors.   Vendor’s financial status (e.g. credit worthiness, solidity, etc.).  Recommendation 5: Develop high level security policy and requirements before selecting preferred  vendor  The provider should define their own high level security policy for third-party procuring or  outsourcing. High level security requirements could already be developed at the beginning of the  selection process and more precisely when writing the request for proposal. Indeed, this will help the  provider to only consider suppliers based on their capacity to comply with the same and avoid the risk  of inefficient security controls (Issue #1). With this leading practise, the provider can expect saving  time and money when evaluating their possibilities in terms of vendors. All the same, they have to  assess and review the capacity of its suppliers through qualifications checks and credentials.  Recommendation 6: Develop clear, solid, measurable and actionable security requirements for  vendors  The provider should develop and define clear, simple, measurable and actionable security  requirements, for specific ICT products or services, in order to facilitate their implementation by the  vendor and avoid any confusion or misunderstanding during the contract lifecycle (Issue #3). The  ENISA Security Guide for ICT Procurement33 can be consulted for this purpose. It is advised to develop  solid security requirements which will not require further significant changes. Changes in security  requirements risk weakening the vendor’s security practises and bringing confusion in the  relationship.  Recommendation 7: Prioritize the implementation of the security requirements for vendors  Depending on the type and criticality of the products or services, different security requirements and  different levels of security are needed. One size does not fit all. Criteria from regulatory requirements  as well as internal criteria such as uptime, number of users affected in case of failure etc. should be  considered to give security requirements a proper prioritization. This allows stakeholders inside the  organization to focus on the most important requirements first.  Recommendation 8: Manage security risks through the procurement lifecycle  Efforts to ensure sufficient levels of security should be carried out through the project lifecycle and  not only during the vendor selection process. Different steps should be in place to guarantee integrity,  confidentiality and availability of the services throughout the product or service lifecycle. For example,  testing could be performed in the development phase of the product/system, before its integration in  the provider’s infrastructure, along its lifecycle and after each patch or update.  Recommendation 9: Monitor the performance of your vendors  The provider should continuously monitor the performance of their vendors by regularly reviewing  service reports and records provided by the later, or other means such as audits or technical  inspections. Performance can be assessed against the KPIs defined in the SLA and corrective actions  or penalties can be used in case of deficiencies. Higher penalties can be applied for highly critical  systems, and by doing so, vendors may be more risk aware about the provider’s core services and the  role their products and services play. This will support the provider in ensuring the compliance of its  vendor with security requirements defined in the contract (Issue #3).  33 Ibid.

Hardware and software play a critical role in the core operations of electronic  communications networks and services and are most of the time procured by specialized ICT suppliers  and outsourcing partners. This leads to providers being increasingly reliant on third parties to ensure  the security and resilience of their own infrastructure and this also exposes them to additional security  risks.  According to the latest ENISA Annual Incident Reports 20131, most incidents reported between 2011  and 2013 were caused by failing hardware or software. In discussions with electronic communications  service providers, they have indicated that there are sometimes problems or misunderstandings in  vendor-provider relationships and outsourcing in general.  The goal of this report is to analyse the importance of managing the security risks involved in the  procurement and outsourcing process. More specifically, it emphasises on the risks which could lead  to a disruption of electronic communications services for users.  ENISA has performed a survey with providers and vendors to collect issues and practices and a desktop  research of existing initiatives.  The surveyed providers mainly have the following concerns when procuring key ICT products and  outsourcing services for core operations:   Lack of adequacy and effectiveness of the security controls on the vendor’s side;   Potential vulnerabilities the provider can be exposed to due to (unknown) flaws in ICT  products or services;   Non-compliance with security requirements defined in the contract on the vendor’s side   Lack of adequate support from vendor in case of breakdown;   Weak negotiation power for the provider to enforce specific security requirements;   Lack of framework or guidelines from the industry to guide providers during the procurement  and outsourcing process.  The survey has indicated that many providers have a policy or framework in place to manage the  security issues experienced during the procurement or outsourcing of ICT products and services. The  security framework usually focuses on the following areas:   Assessing the risks providers may face when buying ICT products or outsourcing ICT services.   Articulating clear, actionable and measurable security requirements which will help the  providers to prevent or mitigate the risks identified during the risk assessment.   Continuously monitoring the performance of its vendors based on the contract, in order to  assess its compliance with security requirements.   Agreeing with the vendor on a change management process in order to define how to handle  potential changes in security requirements or the complete termination of the contract.  ENISA acknowledges however that providers adopt different approaches when dealing with security  risks involved in the procurement or outsourcing process. For these reasons and to meet expressed  concerns, this report presents an overview of practises used in the sector and gives the following  general recommendations:  1 ENISA (2014), Annual incidents report 2013, http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual- reports/annual-incident-reports-2013  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2013 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2013  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page iv  1.

Society is becoming  heavily reliant on communication services and people expect to be connected anywhere and at any  time. As a consequence, customers are more and more demanding reliable and secure services, and  they depend on their providers of electronic communications networks and services.  The importance of resilience in an electronic communications service provider’s network is visible  when significant security incidents hit customers, and when creating issues with important functions  of society. In the last years, network outages have been reported in many parts of the EU, affecting  both mobile and fixed communication providers. According to the ENISA Annual Incident Report  20132, most incidents reported were caused by technical/system failures (i.e. 61% of the incidents in  2013 – Figure 1) and more specifically hardware failures and software bugs. Network assets most  affected by system failures were switches and Home Location Registers (HLR). These network  components, which are essential parts of core operations of networks, are naturally vulnerable to  failures.  An example of a system failure involving a HLR, was an incident with a mobile operator that in 2012  experienced an important network outage leaving mobile customers without electronic  communications services for 21 hours. The outage was caused by a failure in the HLR while the mobile  operator was extending its outsourcing relationship regarding the field maintenance and switch sites  to include the complete operation of the network3. The detailed customer information disappeared  during the transition process leaving handsets unable to authenticate their users. Without the  database and all customers’ information, mobiles and other devices were gradually forced off the  network. The same kind of scenario can similarly impact other providers.  Due to the complexity of electronic communications networks components and services, providers  are to different extents using suppliers to provide them with specific ICT products and services.  Naturally, most of the providers buy their infrastructure components from ICT vendors while a large  range of them also outsource a part of the network operations to an outsourcing partner. This means  that they become reliant on third parties to ensure the security and resilience of their own  infrastructure, but also that they can be subject to additional security threats.  2 ENISA (2014), Annual incidents report 2013  3The Register, http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/07/13/o2_outage_cause/  14  19  6  61  Natural phenomena  Human errors  Malicious actions  System failures  Figure 1: Incidents per root causes (2013)  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 2  In discussions with providers, they indicated that there are sometimes problems or misunderstandings  in the vendor-provider relationships and outsourcing in general. More specifically, providers are not  always empowered to effectively manage the security risks involved in these relationships. For this  reason, in discussions with providers, ENISA has been asked to study this topic and to develop  guidelines with security requirements aimed at vendors. These requirements could be applied in the  procurement or outsourcing phase to support the providers in managing security threats and  guaranteeing the resilience of their networks after the introduction of third party products and  services.  Policy context  The reform of the EU legal framework for electronic communication, which was adopted in 2009 and  came into effect in May 2011, adds Article 13a to the Framework directive. Article 13a addresses the  security and integrity of public electronic communications networks and services. The legislation  concerns National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) and providers of public electronic communications  networks and services (providers).  Among other things, article 13a states the following:   Paragraph 1 requires the provider to take measures to “prevent and minimise the impact  of security incidents on users and interconnected networks”.   Paragraph 2 requires the provider to “take all appropriate steps to guarantee integrity of  their networks, and thus ensure the continuity of supply of services”.   Paragraph 3 requires the provider to “notify the competent National Regulatory Authority  of a breach of security or loss of integrity that has had a significant impact on the operation  of networks or services”.  Providers are liable towards the users of their services and the respective NRA for the security of their  electronic communications services, through the transposition of the above mentioned Article in  member States’ legislation. Liability cannot be transferred to a third party, although providers may be  dependent on suppliers of third party products or services used for their core operations. For that  reason it is important that the security measures the providers are liable for are extended to their  vendors through their contractual relationships.  More information about ENISA’s work on Article 13a, and the Article 13a Expert Group of NRAs, can  be found at: http://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13.  Goal and Scope  The goal of this report is to analyse the importance of managing the security risks involved in the  procurement and outsourcing process of key ICT products and services. More specifically, it  emphasises the risks which could lead to a disruption of services for the customers.  Together with this report a separate Security Guide 4  has been produced to support primarily  electronic communications service providers, but also ICT vendors, with practical guidelines to better  manage potential security risks in products or services, which could lead to disruptions in electronic  communications services.  4 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/requirements-ecomms-vendors  http://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/requirements-ecomms-vendors  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 3  Target audience  This report is aimed at the actors in the electronic communication sector (Providers, Vendors, NRAs,  Information Security Professionals, etc.).  The report informs the actors about issues and concerns of the sector regarding potential security  threats when buying or outsourcing ICT products and services from third parties, current initiatives  and processes used by providers to manage the same and, based on issues and findings, gives general  recommendations to the actors in the sector.  Methodology  In order to gather experience and opinions from experts in the field, an anonymous online survey  across European electronic communications service providers was launched. 29 providers responded  to this survey, bringing insights about their main concerns and areas of focus when buying ICT  equipment or outsourcing ICT services, the type of security policy they have in place and the main  security requirements they apply to their suppliers to prevent or mitigate security risks. The mix of  providers participating in this survey represents a wide coverage in terms of security practises applied  based on the type of electronic communication services provided (figure 2). Note that most of the  participating providers are offering multiple services to their customers.  Figure 2: Types of services provided by survey's respondents  In addition to the online survey, there have been interviews with experts from the electronic  communications industry, 10 electronic communication service providers and 2 vendors, asking them  qualitative questions about their views and experience with security risks involved in the procurement  and outsourcing process of key ICT products and services. Guidelines were gathered from them on  best practises in terms of security requirements and controls which should be applied to vendors to  prevent or mitigate such security risks.  Consequently a desktop study followed. Initiatives already taken by the industry were analysed,  regulatory frameworks or guidelines issued by National Regulatory Authorities (NRA) were looked into  and a range of standards and good practises were reviewed as suggested by the industry, such as  relevant ISO standards and the SAFECode leading practises.

ICT product supply chains and  outsourcing services are successively approached.   Section 3 describes concerns raised by providers during the survey. It focuses on issues  surrounding the management of the security risks and the implementation of security  requirements in the context of third party products and services. The issues are attributed a  number (Issue #1 etc.) and are referred to in the following three sections.   In section 4 national regulatory frameworks and guidelines are described, followed by a  description of industry standards and leading practises.   In section 5 the report presents a security framework with main measures used by electronic  communications service providers to ensure a constant level of resilience after the  introduction of third party products and services into their infrastructure, together with high  level security requirements commonly applied to vendors.   Lastly, in section 6 the report concludes with recommendations to the actors of the electronic  communications sector, with the aim to support them in the security management involved  in the procurement and outsourcing processes.  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 5  2 About Procured Products and Outsourced Services for Core Operations  It is probably not an exaggeration to say that all electronic communications service providers depend  to some degree on their suppliers. Indeed, most of the providers around the world, whatever their  size, their market position or their core services, have relationships with suppliers that provide them  with ICT products or managed services. Most of these products or services play a critical role within  the providers’ networks, and a disruption in those could have an immediate impact on the services  offered to their customers. There is a need for the electronic communication service providers to  carefully manage security risks involved in their procurement and outsourcing relationships to ensure  a constant level of resilience despite the introduction of third party products and services into their  infrastructure. This means that the providers should work closely with vendors to adopt good practises  in terms of security risk management.  2.1 ICT products supply chain  In general, it is common practice that suppliers provide electronic communications service providers  with ICT products and equipment, which will then be integrated into their network infrastructure.  Most of the components in a network are acquired from specialized and large ICT vendors. This  includes both software and hardware components, which are part of a complex environment. Below  we take a mobile network infrastructure as an example.  As shown in figure 3, several components shape a mobile network infrastructure and mobile operators  generally buy these components, from the access network components (Antennas, Base Transceiver  Station, etc.) to the core network components (HLR, GGSN, Intelligent Network). This example is  illustrative but other electronic communication networks present similar complexity.  eNodeB  MME  PDN UE  S-GW P-GW  Evolved packet core (all-IP)  HSS  Policy and Charging  Rules Function (PCRF)  eUTRAN Core Network  Internet  BSS / GERAN / UTRAN Core Network  Internet  MSC  GMSC  BTS NodeB  VLR  HLREIR AuC  PSTN  SGSN  GGSNUE  BSC / RNC  BSC / RNC  Packet Switched Core  (data)  Circuit Switched Core  (voice)  SDP  SCP  SMP  Intelligent Network  Internet  Figure 3: Complex network environment (Mobile 2G, 3G, LTE) - illustrative5  5 Theoretical, source EY Luxembourg  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 6  Nowadays, the ICT products supply chain is becoming more and more globalized and complex,  bringing additional challenges and dependencies for a provider. Multiple components designed,  developed and manufactured in different countries are now combined to produce a single hardware  or software later acquired by an electronic communication service provider through a single vendor.  Each member of the global ICT product supply chain has the responsibility to ensure the security and  the resilience of the final product. Taking that into consideration, a provider is becoming dependent  on the supplier’s downstream suppliers in case of security issues with one single product. This creates  the risk of lack of visibility, understanding, traceability and control over the ICT products for the  providers and increases the risk of counterfeit, malicious or untrustworthy products. As a result, there  is a need for the provider to use specific security frameworks to better manage evolving security risks  involved in the acquisition of ICT products from suppliers.  2.2 Outsourced services  Suppliers can also provide electronic communications service providers with services “in support of a  business function for performing activities using suppliers’ resources rather than the ones of the  acquirer”6 (i.e. human resources, infrastructure, etc.) to perform a specific operation. This involves a  long-term outsourcing contract covering a business operation (e.g. billing, HR, etc.), a network  operation (e.g. maintenance, strategy development, construction, integration, and even full scale  operation of networks and services etc.) or a top layer application (e.g. value added services).  Typically, the vendor acts under a service level agreement with full responsibility for the activities  specified in the outsourcing contract.  Unlike the outsourcing of business operations such as billing or HR function, the outsourcing of  network operations can impact the availability of the provider’s core service. As shown in figure 4, an  organization can outsource its complete network operation or a part of it, such as network planning,  network design and engineering (“PLAN”), network installation and integration (“BUILD”), or network  operations and maintenance (“RUN”). Among this last function, a provider can split its outsourced  services by network operations or field services.  Figure 4: Network operations which can be outsourced7  Electronic communications service providers are planning to spend about $79 billion in 2017 on  outsourced network tasks to equipment vendors, which represents 8 % of annual growth rate8 from  2012 to 20179.  6 ISO/IEC International Standard 27002 (2005), Information technology — Security techniques — code of practice for information security  7 Bookz & Company Inc (2009), Outsourcing network operations: Maximizing the potential  8 Compound Annual Growth Rate : the year-over-year growth rate of an investment over a specified period of time  9 Infonetics (2013), “Telecom equipment vendors manage 45% of the world’s subscribers as outsourcing grows”  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 7  While outsourcing is bringing several benefits to a company, it is also bringing security challenges such  as difficulties to align internal security objectives with suppliers’ policies, lack of security controls,  failures to accurately monitor the security performance of the supplier, etc. As a result, there is a need  to implement an information security governance framework toward outsourcing suppliers. Indeed,  savings from outsourcing could be offset by security incidents, so security threats need to be taken  into account from the first stage of the outsourcing process, to ensure that the benefits of outsourcing  can be realized despite security costs and constraints. On the other hand, suppliers of outsourcing  services should be able to properly manage the risks involved in the outsourcing process, meet clients’  requirements while still making a commercial profit. This means that electronic communications  service providers should be ready to accept an increase in price when imposing strong security  requirements.  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 8  3 Issues and Concerns expressed by providers  In the online survey and interviews with providers and vendors, a set of issues were collected that the  surveyed providers are concerned with when buying or outsourcing key ICT products and services. The  main concerns that were expressed include (but are not limited to):   Lack of adequacy and effectiveness of the security controls on the vendor’s side (Issue #1)  Providers are worried that the security measures that the vendors are applying by default will not be  adequate to protect their infrastructure. They are afraid that vendors’ security controls would not be  aligned with their own security objectives and would fail to prevent the security risks they have  identified. The providers want to receive the assurance from their vendors that relevant controls are  in place and operate correctly to meet the minimum acceptable level of residual risk they have  defined.   Potential vulnerabilities providers can be exposed to due to (unknown) flaws in ICT products  or services (Issue #2)  The interviewees are concerned about vulnerabilities, and especially potential blind spots, unknown  vulnerabilities, in products or services. This is also highlighted by the United States Government  Accountability Office (GAO) (2013), see section 4.1.1, which states that the main concerns of electronic  communication service providers when buying or outsourcing are the anomalies that could arise from  procured products because of low quality, lack of controls or potential errors (i.e. erroneous coding in  the software). The providers want to be made aware of any vulnerability affecting the product or  service they buy and any potential issues they can face with their equipment.  In addition, the providers wish to be informed by the vendor as soon as possible if another provider  has had issues with the same products they have procured, in order to fix the problems before it  actually affects their customers.   Non-compliance with security requirements defined in the contract on the vendor’s side  (Issue #3)  Another concern expressed in our interviews was that sometimes providers experienced vendors  deviating from agreed contracts or “taking shortcuts” in order to cut down costs or time to deliver and  as a result fail to comply with security requirements defined in the contracts leading to increased  security threats.   Lack of adequate support from vendor in case of breakdown (Issue #4)  Electronic communication providers expressed their worries regarding potential lack of support from  their vendors and outsourcing partners in case of incidents. More specifically they were concerned  with the level of responsibility the vendors are willing to accept as well as their response time. They  wanted to be assured that they would be supported by trained and skilled people in case of major  incidents and especially in order for their core services to recover quickly.   Weak negotiation power for provider to enforce specific security requirements (Issue #5)  Providers were concerned about the inherent lack of negotiation power they have, since options on  the market are limited. Some providers expressed that in some cases there could be a non- proportional increase in costs and time to market in vendor offers when requesting additional security  measures.  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 9   Lack of framework or guidelines from the industry to guide providers during the  procurement and outsourcing process (Issue #6)  Providers raised their concern about a lack of unified guidelines to help them dealing with security  risks involved in the procurement and outsourcing process. Despite the existence of standards related  to electronic communication security, providers have highlighted the lack of an integrated and unified  approach which will support them in specifically dealing with security risks involved in the  procurement and outsourcing process.  Through the review of existing initiatives, we observed that only a few national regulatory authorities  consider specifically the management of security risks involved in the relationships providers have  with ICT vendors into their national guidelines (i.e. UK, Australia, USA and India). In addition, our online  survey showed that 72% of the respondents stated that there is no regulatory framework to govern  their requirements regarding third party products and services.  Besides, the online survey showed that not all of the providers themselves apply security requirements  to their ICT vendors. About 7 % do not consider security requirements for ICT vendors, see figure 5  below, while most of them have different approaches for preventing or mitigating potential security  threats when buying from or outsourcing to third party. Through the online survey, we observed a  significant divergence between answers regarding content and levels of security requirements. Even  if all providers in our survey define Service Level Agreements with their vendors, the importance of  security requirements depends highly on the provider’s internal practises. As shown in figure 5, some  providers tend also to adapt the security requirements based on the type of products/services  supplied and/or based on the criticality of the products/services supplied. It could also be the case  that security requirements are adjusted based on the existing relationships providers have with the  vendors (e.g. in case of long and trustful relationship with the same supplier).  Figure 5: Divergence in approach in developing security requirements  52%  14%  7%  20%  7%  As part of the contract, do you require that your vendors follow certain security  practises?

Even if the goal of this report is not  to advise on an approach or another, it provides some comparable points of view.  We provide examples from four countries around the world which advocate through regulatory  frameworks the resilience of the electronic communications sector targeted on risks involved in  relationships with third parties.  A. United Kingdom10,11,12  In May 2011, EU Member States were required to implement Article 13a and 13b in national law as  requested by the EU Telecom Framework Directive. The UK’s Office of Communication (Ofcom)  complied with this requirement by revising the Communication Act 2003 (CA2003), principally by  adding the Sections 105A-D.  The guidance focuses on two main areas:   Risk management: electronic communication service providers and vendors must take care  of their networks, applying appropriate measures to manage security risks including  management of general security risks; protecting end users; protecting interconnections; and  maintaining network availability.   Incident reporting: Vendors and electronic communication service providers must report to  Ofcom any security breaches or reductions in availability which have a significant impact on  the network or service. This significant impact is measured through thresholds given for  different types of networks and outages.  To ensure the above, Ofcom expects providers to develop and implement appropriate risk  management or mitigation actions. In case of doubt about the compliance to the requirements, Ofcom  can request providers to perform an audit of their systems and impose financial penalties.  Due to the increased importance of outsourcing in the electronic communication service industry,  Ofcom have started considering that security requirements should be applied during the outsourcing  or procurement process (section 105 A – Management of general security risks).  According to Ofcom, providers should take the appropriate measures to mitigate security risks coming  from their supply chain. Ofcom expects providers to perform a risk assessment and implement  mitigations actions before entering into a new outsourcing relationship or implementing new  equipment into their network. In addition, the providers should have sufficient technical and  management expertise among its staff to manage potential security risks.  10 Ofcom (2012), Ofcom guidance on security requirements in the revised Communication Act 2003: Implementing the revised EU  Framework.  11 Ofcom (2014), Updating Ofcom’s guidance on network security.  12 Ofcom (2014), Ofcom guidance on security requirements in sections 105A to D of the Communication Act 2003  http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/telecoms/policy/security-resilience/  http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/telecoms/policy/security-resilience/  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 11  B. United States  The United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) was requested to conduct a study in 2013  on actions taken by federal institutions and electronic communication service provider to deal with  security risks involved in the procurement or outsourcing of foreign ICT products and services.13  It has been highlighted that the main concerns of the providers are not related to the provenance of  the products and services but rather the anomalies that could arise from procured products because  of low quality, lack of controls or potential errors (i.e. erroneous coding in the software) (Issue #2)  In order to deal with these problems, GAO study highlights three ways that companies have started  following in order to mitigate this problem:   Some companies have developed their own practices based on national and international  standards regarding information systems’ security (ISO, IEC, NIST, Internet Engineering Task  Force…).   Other companies have participated in cybersecurity groups such as The Open Group Trusted  Technology Forum (OTTF) and The Communication Sector Coordinating Council (CSCC). This  last group has the objective to facilitate the coordination between industry and the federal  government to improve physical and cyber security of the infrastructure through the creation  and adoption of standards.   Lastly, providers have adopted voluntary security management procedures which cover the  entire life cycle of their equipment:  o Vendor Selection: When the providers select their vendors, they usually focus on the  vendor’s security practices, their use of security-related standards and their reputation to  manage security issues. Their practices depend highly on the criticality of equipment or  services being procured.  o Vendor Security Requirements: Some companies force vendors to comply with  requirements covering the physical security of products, the access restriction to sensitive  company information and the verification of employees.  o Equipment testing and monitoring: Companies try to detect incidents and mitigate  vulnerabilities through tests, monitoring of the traffic and audits of the infrastructure.  In addition to the GAO study, the White House has initiated some efforts trying to mitigate  cybersecurity risks appearing in critical infrastructures including electronic communication networks.  In the Executive Order No. 13,636 released in February 2013,14 the White House calls for NIST to  develop a Cybersecurity Framework15 in order to create a compilation of standards and best practices.  This document represents a guide that can help organizations to improve their own risk management  processes and prioritize their cybersecurity decisions. The Framework includes three sub frameworks  as described below:  1 – The Framework Core covers a list of cyber security measures that are common around all sectors  and industries. These measures are sorted by functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and  Recover), categories and subcategories. It helps organizations to create or review their security risks  management practises and their cybersecurity program taking into account existing standards,  guidelines or practises.  13 GAO (2013), Electronic communication Networks: Addressing Potential Security Risks of Foreign-manufactured Equipment.  14 Federal Register of U.S.A.

Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 12  2 – The Framework Implementation Tiers supports organizations in assessing their own level of  security risks management practises. The organization must assess their own performance in a scale  which ranges from Partial (Tier 1) to Adaptive (Tier 4).  3 – A Framework Profile: An organization will use the Framework Profile to define their current profile  but also the targeted profile they would like to reach in the future including external factors as legal  requirements, industry practices, etc. It supports organizations in identifying opportunities for  improvement. To make it possible, the organization must use the categories and subcategories  previously selected in “The Framework Core” and identify the standards, guidelines and practices that  will need to be implemented in order to reach the \"targeted objective\".  The White House aims with this initiative to alert providers about outsourcing risks. In addition, an  organization could use the targeted profile to request its external supplier to adopt specific  cybersecurity requirements.  C. India  In March 2010, the Indian Ministry of Communication and Information Technology published new  rules on security requirements which should be applied to ICT equipment to prevent and mitigate  security threats. However, due to problematic rules such as the disclosure of commercially sensitive  source code or the obligation to transfer technology to Indian companies, these requirements suffered  from external pressures and were deemed as too restrictive.  In May 2011, the Indian Ministry of Communication and Information Technology decided to present  an amended version. 16  According to this amended version, electronic communication service  providers should hold the complete and total responsibility of the security of their networks. More  specifically, providers must follow strict security guidelines when procuring or outsourcing network  elements:   Providers should have an organizational policy focused on security and security management  of their network.   Providers should audit their network or get it audited by a certified third party from a security  point of view once a year in order to assure the resilience and security of it.   Only network elements tested by relevant contemporary Indian or International Security  Standards (ISO, ITU, IETF, IEC...) can be integrated into an Indian network.   All features, equipment, software, etc., may be subjected to inspection and testing by the  Indian Department of Technology at any time.   Providers should keep records of procedures but also past operation, maintenance, change or  update of products.   Providers should have facilities to detect intrusions, attacks and frauds. Any security breaches  must be quickly reported to competent authorities.  To ensure that providers remain compliant, the Indian Department of Technology created a five  members committee. Every breach of security will be assessed by the committee which will determine  if they have been caused by defects. The electronic communication service providers can be punished  with penalties while the suppliers of hardware/software that caused the security issues could be  blacklisted, banning them from doing business in the country.  In addition to the mandatory requirements, the Indian Government suggested a list of steps which  can be followed by the providers on a voluntary basis. For example, they can create forums or  16Government of India Ministry of Communication & IT Department of Electronic communication (2011), Amendment to Unified Access  Service License Agreement for security related concerns for expansion of Telecom Services in various zones of the country  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 13  associations to increase the security assurance levels and share common issues on the topic. In  addition, the government suggested a template agreement17 which could be signed between the  provider and the manufacturer/vendor. In the context of the template agreement, the providers are  free to add, modify or delete any clauses to their suit. Main clauses are listed below:   The vendor must have a well-defined Information Security policy, compliant with ISO/IEC  27001:2005.   The vendor must be able to demonstrate that they have procedures to deal with security  threats.   The vendor must have a system for detecting and recording any attempted damage,  amendment or unauthorised access to provider’s information.   The vendor must be responsible for the software maintenance including upgrades, operating  systems and application from factory to desk. Additionally, the vendor shall ensure that  software is free of bugs.   The vendor must ensure that all tools, skills, resources remain operational after the end of the  contract.  D. Australia18  Since 2012, the Australian government has started considering a reform of its actual electronic  communication legislation (The Electronic communication Act (1997)) to include a risk-based  regulatory framework. The aim of this framework is to stimulate electronic communication service  providers to protect their infrastructure and take into account security risks when making business  decisions about the design and development of their network, including when they buy ICT products  or outsource ICT services. This approach does not force providers to adopt specific security  requirements but educates them on security risks and encourages them to take responsibility over  their network security. With it, the Australian government tries to raise providers’ awareness about  the potential security threats which could happen when developing their infrastructure, taking into  account their interactions with vendors.  More precisely, electronic communication service providers should be able to prove their competent  supervision and effective control over their network, either managed in-house or by a third party.  Competent supervision means that providers should be able to watch over their network operations  but also over parties which have authorized access to their infrastructure and data such as outsourcing  partners or vendors. In addition, it encompasses a reasonable ability to detect security breaches  impacting their own services but also compromising the cyber security of the country.  With effective control, providers would need to demonstrate their ability to maintain a direct  authority and/or a contractual arrangement over its suppliers, which guarantees the protection of  their infrastructure and data from unauthorized access and interference. In that regard, providers  would have to request their suppliers monitor and report security issues, as well as to implement  preventive actions to mitigate security risks associated with their products or services.  Some compliance assessment and audits may be requested by the government to ensure that  providers have the relevant security measures in place to comply with the regulation. In case of  unsuccessful compliance, the Australian government has the right to request some mitigation or  17Government of India Ministry of Communication & IT Department of Electronic communication (2010), Template of the agreement  between Licensee (VSAT & INSAT MSS-R) and vendor of equipment, product and services  18 Australian Government – Attorney Department (2012), General Equipping Australia against emerging and evolving threats.  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 14  remediation actions, including the modification of the infrastructure, audit or ongoing monitoring. In  that case, the costs should be supported by provider which would fail to meet the adequate security  level requested by the framework. In addition, the government could ask for financial penalties if  necessary.  4.1.2 Industry initiatives and International standards  In addition to national frameworks, some industry consortia or organizations have started to develop  standards and leading practises to help electronic communication service providers to address the  security risks faced when procuring and outsourcing.  When relevant, we map requirements or activities described below to the identified issues  experienced by providers described in section 3.  A. ISO/IEC FDIS 27002: Code of practice for information security controls19  According to the ISO standards, the security of an organization should not be impacted by the  introduction of a third party’s product or service. For this reason, ISO/IEC FDIS 27002 includes some  security practices used by organizations to manage risks involved in their supplier relationship and  take into account the following controls:  1. Identification of risks related to external parties (control 6.2.1 – ISO/IEC 17799:2005)  Every time a third party gets access to an organization’s information or information processing  facilities while offering a product or service, a risk assessment should be performed to determine  potential security implications and adequate security requirements that will need to be established  by both the organization and the supplier. Among other things, the risk assessment should take into  account the following criteria: Type of access granted, targeted facilities, sensitivity of information,  identification of persons who get the access, current controls used by third parties, practices to  manage security incidents, regulatory requirements, etc.  2. Addressing security in third party agreements (control 6.2.3 – ISO/IEC 17799:2005)  All relevant risks and security requirements identified in the previous section (i.e. control 6.2.1) should  be incorporated into a contract. This will assure that there is no misunderstanding between the  organization and its supplier regarding the security requirements and responsibilities of each party.  The contract can be different depending on the organization and the type of supplier used. However,  the ISO advises to consider the following terms to be included in each contract:  - Information security objectives to be achieved, as defined by the organization's security policy  - Parties’ responsibilities and roles  - Controls to ensure assets protection  - Access control policy  - Change management processes  - Reporting structure and reporting template  - Information security incidents management processes  - Targeted level of service and unacceptable level of service  - KPIs and monitoring process  19 ISO/IEC International Standard 27002 (2005), Information technology — Security techniques — code of practice for information security  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 15  - Right to audit, or to have those audits carried out by a third party  - Service continuity requirements  - Involvement of the third party with subcontractors, and security controls that would be  required to be implemented by subcontractors  - Conditions for renegotiation/termination of contract.  - Etc.  3. Service delivery (control 10.2.1 – ISO/IEC 17799:2005)  An organization should make sure that the security requirements included in the contract are  implemented, operated and maintained by its suppliers (Issue #3). In case of an outsourcing  relationship, the organization should ensure that the security requirements are maintained also during  the transition period, back to the organization or transferred to another supplier.  4. Monitoring and review of third party services (control 10.2.2 – ISO/IEC 17799:2005)  An organization should regularly monitor the performance of its vendors by regularly reviewing  services reports and records provided by suppliers. In addition, an organization should perform regular  audit of its supplier (or involve a third party to perform those audits). Penalties can be used in case of  non-compliance with the contract (Issue #3).  5. Managing changes to third party services (control 10.2.3 – ISO/IEC 17799:2005)  An organization should pay attention to any changes to the provision of services, including changes in  security policies, procedures or controls. These changes can be initiated by the organization (e.g.  development of new applications, update of policies, etc.) or by its suppliers (e.g. use of new  technologies, development of new tools, etc.). In any case, a new risk assessment should be performed  to assess new security implications and associated security requirements which should be applied.  In addition to the ISO/IEC FDIS 27002 presented above, ISO organization has recently published a  standard (ISO/IEC 27036:2013 – only part 1 and 3 are currently published) related to specific  information security techniques applying to supplier relationships. 20  This standard offers further  detailed guidance on how to deal with security risks involved in the acquisition of goods and services.  For example, ISO/IEC 27036:2013 advise organizations to adopt a framework with a set of  standardized processes for the acquisition of products and services:  - An organization should start by establishing information security and compliance  requirements for the exchange of information with the suppliers.  - Before buying or outsourcing, an organization should assess the security risks involved in  these processes.  - It should establish a process to negotiate security requirements with the vendors which will  be incorporated into the contract (e.g. right to audit, etc.).  - An organization should continuously monitor the performance of its suppliers and refer back  to the service level agreement included in the contract in case of deficiencies.  20  ISO/IEC International Standard 27036 (2014), Information technology — Security techniques — Information security for supplier  relationships — Part 1: Overview and concepts.  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 16  B. Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI): Security Governance  Framework for IT Managed Service provision – UK 21  The Security Framework developed by the CPNI deals with security across the outsourcing process  through several elements:  1. Roles and Responsibilities  When outsourcing, there is a range of key responsibilities that need to be allocated, both at the  electronic communication service provider’s organization and at the outsourcing partner’s  organization. More specifically, responsibilities should be established to make sure that security risks  and security requirements are clearly articulated and fully understood, that an acceptable level of  residual risk is agreed with the provider, that security risks are managed during the complete  outsourcing lifecycle, that assurance is gained regarding the security framework in place and that  incidents are accurately reported and investigated. These responsibilities should be defined in the  contract signed between both parties.  2. Risk assessment  Before starting outsourcing, an organization should assess the security risks involved in this process.  To achieve this, an organization should first identify the business processes and functions subjected  to outsourcing and the specific governance, regulatory or compliance standards; or other technical  constraints which applied to them and could have a security implication.  Then, for each process or function, an assessment should be carried out to evaluate the impact of a  loss of confidentiality, integrity or availability on the business. In addition, the organization should  assess other security threats such as people/organizations which could attack its systems, their  motivation and capacity to do so.  Third, a review of the current and actual vulnerabilities should be performed as well as a review of the  current mitigation plans implemented. An organization can always set up a residual risk level which  will be accepted by the management. This should nevertheless be in line with the organization’s risks  appetite.  21 Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) (2009), Outsourcing: security governance framework for IT Managed Service  Provision  Figure 6: CPNI Security Governance Framework  Roles and  Responsibilities  Risk Assessment  Managing security  during the  outsourcing  process  Assurance and  Conformance  Security in the  contract lifecycle  Change  Management  Incident  Management  Termination  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 17  Lastly, the organization should identify the gap between the current level of risk management and the  targeted level in order to plan corrective actions.  3. Managing security during the outsourcing process  Once the risk assessment has been performed, an organization has to articulate and develop  appropriate security requirements which will be then communicated to the outsourcing services  provider. It is crucial for the provider to manage the security during the complete lifecycle of the  outsourcing project to ensure that all requirement initially set up are respected by both parties.  Requirements can be set up, communicated, managed and monitored differently based on the  organization’s security risks management approach:  - The electronic communication service provider can describe in a very detailed manner the  controls which will be required to manage security risks. The supplier will then operate its  service according to the provider’s specifications, developing the technical configurations,  procedures, etc. to implement the required controls. The provider will have the right to audit  to gain the assurance that controls operate as they should to manage the security risks. This  approach will be costly in terms of the provider’s resources. Indeed, experts in the fields will  be required to specify and negotiate the controls with the supplier. However, it can define  exactly how security will be addressed in the outsourcing relationship.  - The electronic communication service providers can also develop a set of high level control  objectives (possibly with the help of a third party). If the providers don’t do it themselves, it  will be the sole responsibility of the supplier to define and implement specific security  measures which will meet these objectives. With this approach, the supplier increases its  flexibility but needs to provide its customer with the assurance that control objectives have  been met.  - Lastly, controls can be setup according to international standards such as ISO 27001/2. In that  case, the supplier is required to provide certification of compliance to its client.  The performance of the supplier against the security requirements will be included in the Service Level  Agreement. In case of bad performance, suppliers can be subject to financial penalties (Issue #3).  4. Assurance and conformance  Organizations which are using outsourcing suppliers should receive assurance from their partners that  the risks are correctly managed, that the right processes are in place to guarantee the lowest  acceptable level of security risks and ensure that incidents are reported, investigated and corrective  actions are taken (Issue #3). Assurance can be gained using several methods as agreed in the contract:  - The outsourcing services supplier can report security status and incidents as part of a service  reporting;  - The supplier can request regular independent reviews of its systems and report to its  customers the results and any corrective actions identified;  - The electronic communication service provider can have the right to audit or the right to  review its suppliers’ systems. This can also be performed by a third party if needed;  - Assurance can be gained through certification (ISO 27001).  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 18  5. Security in the contract lifecycle  Security requirements should stay a priority for the organization using outsourcing services during the  complete contract lifecycle.  High level security requirements should be defined even before starting the invitation to tender and  request for proposal. This will support the organization in assessing and reviewing its requirements  based on suppliers’ response and issuing a more detailed statement of requirements later on. The  preferred supplier will be selected based on specific security criteria and scoring methods. This means  that it has to show its experience and capacity to comply with the security requirements defined by  the electronic communication service provider (Issue#1).  Once a supplier is selected, both parties enter into the negotiation phase to finalize the contract. This  will include the definition of security requirements, the security management approach, the controls  specifications and the assurance approach. The contract will be the reference for the supplier to  operate the services and manage the risks according to the requirements.  6. Change management  Security risks can evolve and security requirements can become obsolete. So, any contract should take  into account potential changes. In addition, the responsibilities for change initiation and additional  costs should be established in advance to avoid any further conflict between parties.  7. Termination  Besides, the contract needs to include the procedure to be followed in case of agreement termination.  It will help to ensure that the security risks are managed effectively even during the transition from  the outsourcing provider back to the customer or another service provider; this includes handling all  documents, procedures, configurations etc.  8. Incidents management  The service supplier should report timely and accurately any incidents, near misses or anomalies. Both  parties should agree on how incidents should be managed and investigated (Issue #4). Third party  could be requested to perform the investigation and recommend corrective actions.  C. SAFECode: software Assurance Forum for Excellence in Code22,23  The SAFECode association has released several papers to advise software providers in good practices  to mitigate security risks involved in their global supply chain.  Commercial software starts to be more and more developed in a global environment, meaning that  vendors now serve international markets and use multiple international suppliers to integrate  innovative solutions. Each IT product is now a collection of components developed across the globe  by several suppliers, their subcontractors or obtained by Open Source repositories.  This global model of distribution raises concerns about additional product security risks and software  suppliers are now required to demonstrate the security of the products they produce but also the  security of the component they acquire and use. As a result, there is a need to develop a common  framework to ensure that the overall software industry address supply chain threats to software  integrity (Issue #6).  22  Software Assurance Forum for Excellence in Code (2009), The Software Supply Chain Integrity Framework: Defining Risks and  Responsibilities for Securing Software in the Global Supply Chain.  23 Software Assurance Forum for Excellence in Code (2010), The Software Integrity Controls: An Assurance-Based Approach to Minimizing  Risk in the Software Supply Chain.  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 19  Focusing on Integrity related controls; SAFECode is trying to help organizations in preventing  unauthorized or unintentional changes in the source code of the software. SAFECode has developed  a range of process guidelines split into three key lifecycle processes:  Figure 7: SafeCode Lifecycle Processes  1. Software sourcing process  The controls applied during the sourcing process highly depends on the nature of the relationship  between the vendor and it software supplier, and the level of control a vendor has on its supplier. A  vendor can set up two main types of controls: contractual integrity controls and technical integrity  controls. With the first one, a vendor will sign a written agreement with its supplier clearly stating its  expectations, responsibility and ownership of parties, capability of supplier to respond to vulnerability  threats and capacity to train its people on evolving secure development practices. On the other hand,  technical integrity controls will include more technical requirements such as secure transfer (e.g.  encrypted), privileges management, malware scanning, secure storage, secure code exchange.  2. Software Development and Testing  There are different types of controls which can be used to guarantee the integrity of software during  the development process. First, an organization should have strong security policy for its people  including segregations of duties and security training. Automated processes should always be  privileged to minimize the human interventions and decrease the risks from malicious insiders.  Second, the environment around the development of the software should be highly secure: the  network used and location where the software and code are developed and stored should be secure  and have strong access controls. In addition, clear documentation about the change management  process, change logs and components/code should be kept for reference in case of issues. Lastly, the  organization should test code/software both for vulnerabilities and bugs through automated testing  tools but also through manual review to identify common patterns previously identified to ensure that  the products function as expected.  3. Software Delivery  In the delivery stage, the software can be delivered directly to the end customers but can also first be  delivered to intermediaries such as system integrators, resellers etc. This means that controls falling  under this process are similar to the ones developed for the sourcing stage. However, additional  security concerns can arise when the product is complete. This brings additional controls such as: final  malware scanning, code signing by the software vendor and secure delivery process.  Similarly to the SAFECode initiative described above, the Internet Security Alliance (ISA) has developed  guidelines for securing the electronics value chain24. More specifically, ISA provides IT companies with  very specific security requirements they should apply at each stage of the production of an electronic  product. These security guidelines help companies to prevent losses due to interruptions or delay in  24 The Internet Security Alliance (ISA) (2013), The ISA Guidelines for Securing the Electronics Supply Chain, by Scott Borg.  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 20  the production, voluntary or involuntary altered products, discrediting of processes or products, and  theft of information/data.  Also, The Open Group Standard developed in 2013 security requirements which would help  organizations to mitigate maliciously tainted and counterfeit products25. This standard is a set of  guidelines, requirements and recommendations built to support vendors in ensuring the integrity of  hardware and software developed in a globalized value chain. Such requirements include among other  things: physical security procedures, proper access controls, employees’ background check, product  quality assessment, etc.  25 Open Group Standard (2013), Mitigating Maliciously Tainted and Counterfeit Products – Version 1.0  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 21  5 Security framework commonly used by providers for buying or outsourcing  Following the results of the online survey, the insights discussed during the interviews and the  information gathered with the desktop research, it has been observed that many electronic  communications service providers have some policy or framework in place to manage the security  issues experienced during the procurement or outsourcing of ICT products and services. The security  framework usually focuses on the following areas:  Figure 8: Framework to address security risks when buying or outsourcing  About 97% of the organizations that participated in the online survey have corporate security policies  or security frameworks in place which apply to their relationships with ICT outsourcing partners or ICT  products vendors. Among them, 54% apply a different policy depending on the type of products and  services procured or outsourced and/or depending on the product and service’s criticality. On the  other hand, the others seem to apply a standard corporate security policy to mitigate the risks  involved in the procurement or outsourcing process.  However, despite the existence of standards related to electronic communication security, providers  have highlighted a lack of an integrated and unified approach which will support them in specifically  dealing with security risks involved in the procurement and outsourcing process (Issue #6). To address  this concern, the following sections describe in more details the different steps commonly taken by  the providers as identified through the survey to address the security risks involved in the  procurement and outsourcing process (See also figure 8).  5.1 Risk Assessment  Several regulators (e.g. Ofcom in the Communication Act 2003) and industry standard consortia (e.g.  ISO) advise the electronic communication service providers to perform a Risk Assessment before  entering into a relationship with an ICT products vendor or an outsourcing partner. It will help them  to identify areas of risks, especially the potential lack effectiveness of vendor’s security practises (Issue  #1), and customize security requirements placed on the vendor accordingly. According to GAO (2013),  the providers have the opportunity to take into account the following criteria when performing a Risk  Assessment:   Vendor’s actual security practises;   Vendor’s adoption of security standards or industry best practises;   Vendor’s reputation and past performance related to security and resilience of its  product/service;   Information on vendor’s subcontractors (e.g. Subcontractors’ security policy, reputation,  legislation, etc.);   Criticality of the equipment procured or outsourced (i.e. most critical components require  stronger security practises).  The online survey revealed that more than 70% of the respondents use a Network and Information  Security (NIS) Risk Assessment before contracting with a vendor. The top risk evaluated through a NIS  Risk Assessment is the denial of service attack (figure 9). Most of the respondents scale the denial of  service attack as the highest risk due to its direct impact on service availability. The vendors should be  Risk Assessment Development of  security requirement Performance  Monitoring  Change/Termination  Management  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 22  able to prove that they have security measures in place to prevent to some extent such incidents to  happen, avoiding a complete service collapse for the customers. It is worth noting that Denial of  Service attacks represented only a very small percentage of all the outages in the electronic  communications services that were reported to ENISA and the Commission in 2012 and 201326.  Following the risk of denial of service, the respondents indicated faulty changes/upgrades, bad  maintenance and the risk of configuration errors as the risks they would be the most worried about,  see figure 9. According to the ENISA incidents report (2013), these risks are relatively common and  affect a significant range of providers, and they need to be carefully assessed by the provider. Similarly,  the industry associations such as GAO, CPNI, etc., advise providers to assess the vendors’ security  practises, past performance, reputation, etc., to evaluate the risks of making errors or take faulty  decisions.  Lastly, the providers evaluate hardware failures and power cut as part of a NIS Risk Assessment. Those  risks are most of the time leading to a complete disruption of service for electronic communication  service providers and need to be taken into account. Based on the risk assessments, providers could  evaluate the vendors’ business continuity and recovery plans used following these kinds of incidents.  The Risk assessment will help providers to evaluate if vendors’ security practises are aligned with their  own security objectives and would contribute in preventing the security risks they have identified  (Issue #1). Of course, the existing security framework of the vendor will be improved by additional  security requirements set up by the providers to ensure the highest level of security and resilience  with electronic communication networks.  Figure 9: Risks evaluated during a NIS Risk assessment  5.2 Development of Security Requirements  Once the Risk Assessment has been performed, an electronic communication service provider can  start to articulate and develop appropriate security requirements which will help them to manage the  security risks identified during the Risk Assessment. The security requirements should be  26http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports  4,32  3,95  3,91  3,86  3,86  3,86  3,82  3,73  3,60  3,59  3,48  3,45  3,27  2,91  0 1 2 3 4 5  Denial of Service attack  Faulty changes/upgrades  Bad maintenance  Configuration errors  Hardware failures  Power cuts  Software security vulnerabilities - design error  Insider attacks  Cable cuts  Theft  Social engineering attacks  Congestion/overload  Downtime caused by administrative or legal issues  Vendor lock-in causing incidents  (0) Non risk – (5) Very high risk  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 23  implemented by the vendors as agreed with the providers to ensure an on-going and secure delivery  of service (Issue #3).  According to CPNI (2009), the set-up of high level security requirements could even start before  selecting the preferred vendor. High level requirements could be drawn up at the first stage of the  vendor’s selection process and could be included in the Request for Proposal document in order to  select the suppliers based on their capacity to comply with the same and avoid the risk of inefficient  security controls (Issue #1). Consequently, there is a necessity for each organization to assess and  review the capacity of its suppliers through qualifications check and credentials.  The security requirements, together with the clear set of responsibilities of parties, the Key  Performance Indicators (KPIs) and the monitoring process should be clearly defined and stated in the  contract signed with the vendor. Indeed, providers have highlighted their concern about potential  non-compliance of vendors with security requirements defined in the contract (Issue #3). Most  interviewees agree that the providers have the responsibility to build precise, strong and stable  requirements to avoid any confusion or misunderstanding during the whole duration of the  relationship with their vendors. The contract will be the reference point for the supplier on how to  operate the service and manage the risks according to the requirements. Doing this will ensure a much  more smooth and secure process for both parties involved.  “The better you define your criteria, your SLA for example, the better possibilities you have to have a  functioning network. As a consequence, the commercial/contractual negotiation phase is key to ensure  that realistic and appropriate KPIs are agreed between both parties.” [Major equipment vendor]  As part of the contract, 93% of the respondents to the online survey require their vendors to follow  certain security requirements. Security requirements are either applied on a case by case basis  following a discussion between the relevant stakeholders (technical team, commercial team,  architecture team, etc.), or are standardized across the products and services. Only the lower layer  products such as switches or routers are mainly subject to more standardized security requirements.  The outsourcing services, especially services which demand providers to share confidential data with  their vendors, are usually subject to more sophisticated and customized security requirements. During  the survey, it has also been cited that security requirements depend on the potential impact of a  failure for the customers, so quite naturally, if a product or service breakdown has a significant impact,  it will require stronger security requirements.  As per the online survey, 44% of respondents apply different requirements depending on the type of  products and services and/or depending on the product/service criticality while the others seem to  apply more standardized security requirements to their vendors, for instance in terms of potential  user-hours lost.  Overall, the security requirements can vary between different products and services based on:   The type of product/service provided;   The criticality of the product and service provided;   The electronic communication service provider’s specific requests or needs;   The level of resilience of the network;   The capacity of the network;   The architecture of the network with a strong focus on redundancies;   The business continuity/recovery plans in place in case of incidents.  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 24  In most cases, setting up security requirements is not particularly challenging as it represents a  common practise in the industry. Nevertheless, some providers have expressed their concern about  the inherent lack of negotiation power they may have faced with vendors. Some providers expressed  that in some cases there could be a non-proportional increase in the costs and the time to market on  the vendors’ side when requesting additional or too specific security measures (Issue #5).  Consequently, the providers would need to strongly negotiate with their vendors regarding the level  of requirements they want to apply (e.g. actual response time which would be satisfying for the  providers).  Most of the security requirements highlighted during the online survey are taken into account by  electronic communication service providers when procuring or outsourcing. Nevertheless, it can be  observed that all providers do not always apply the same security requirements. On average, each  security requirement suggested was either “often applied” or either “applied ad-hoc” by the  respondents.  Figure 10: Main requirements from providers applied in the supplier's contract  Overall, the main requirements which providers rely on is the SLA (identified as “always applied”),  followed by testing and auditing, see figure 10. Security requirements addressed (and mentioned in  figure 10) during the online survey are presented below. Some additional requirements (i.e.  assurance, certification and security requirements targeted to subcontractors) have been added due  to their importance raised during the desktop research and the interviews.   Service Level Agreement and Key Performance Indicators  The vendor’s performance and compliance in regard to contract’s security requirements would need  to be monitored and compared to a Service Level Agreement (SLA). The interviewees stressed the  point that the terms included in the SLA have to be simple, clear and measurable. It is crucial for an  electronic communication service provider to be able to verify that the KPIs requirements have been  met by the vendor in order to ensure the vendor’s compliance with the security requirements set up  in the contract (Issue #3).  In addition, the provider could develop clear processes to handle any deviations of a vendor regarding  the SLA. 76% of providers who responded to the online survey ask for compensation or issue penalties  when the performance does not meet the expectations defined in the SLA. Likewise, it has been cited  that stronger penalties can help providers to transfer the security risks to the vendors. This means  4,17  3,86  3,79  3,79  3,79  3,79  3,76  3,72  3,69  3,69  0 1 2 3 4 5  SLAs, KPIs  Testing and auditing  Physical and environmental security  Incident management  Business continuity  Integration, migration  Monitoring and logging  Organizational security  Monitoring, reporting by ICT vendor  Human resource security  (0) Never applied – (5) Always applied  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 25  that incidents have a real commercial impact on vendors in order to bring stronger incentives to  implement more robust security requirements and take immediate mitigation actions in case of issues.   Testing  It is crucial for a provider to receive the assurance that the products provided or services outsourced  are working as they should before integrating them into the existing infrastructure but also along their  whole lifecycle. It provides the insurance for the providers that there are not known anomalies or low  quality with the product or services procured (Issue #2). Hence, testing would need to be performed  during the development phase, before and after the integration into the existing infrastructure and  when any patches or updates are applied.  Testing can be performed by the vendors, the providers, a third party and/or by collaborative labs.  This needs to be agreed during the negotiation phase and included in the contract. As a good practise,  complete testing including penetration testing, code review, testing in several environments,  iterations testing, etc., should be performed to guarantee the quality of the product and services  provided. The vendors are often requested to share testing procedures together with testing results  with the provider.   Physical and environmental security  According to SAFECode (2010), the environment around the development of the ICT products and the  performance of an ICT service should be highly secure: the network used and location where the  equipment and infrastructure are developed and stored should be secure and have strong access  controls. In case of physical security breach, malicious attacks could be performed, impacting the  integrity of the network and availability of the electronic communications service. In addition, a  vendor should ensure that the exchange of information, data or codes is highly secure.   Incident management and reporting  The interviewed providers stressed that the suppliers should report timely and accurately any  incidents, near misses or anomalies affecting the electronic communication service providers that  happened with their products or services. In some countries such as Australia27, the suppliers have the  obligation to report incidents to the providers.  First, an early warning could immediately be sent in case of anomalies or suspected incidents to inform  the provider about the situation and ensure an efficient management of the incident.  Secondly, the vendors could investigate and report in details past incidents or near misses in order to  identify causes, learn from the incidents and implement changes when required. A third party could  in some cases be requested to perform investigations and recommend corrective actions.  In addition, the vendors could be requested to report to its clients, any incidents which occurred with  their products or services across the electronic communication industry. This initiative would increase  the transparency regarding potential issues or vulnerabilities and help the providers to prevent the  same type of issues.  This initiative has been highlighted many times during the survey meaning that it is crucial for the  provider to be informed by the vendor in case there is any problem or a vulnerability is discovered or  reported with similar products and services across the electronic communications market (Issue #2).  27 Australian Government – Attorney Department (2012), General Equipping Australia against emerging and evolving threats.  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 26   Business continuity  Electronic communications service providers expressed in the interview their concerns regarding  potential lack of support from their vendors and outsourcing partners in case of incidents and that  their core services will be able to recover quickly (Issue #4). Consequently, they are requesting from  their suppliers to develop a precise and documented business continuity plan (BCP) and a disaster  recovery plan (DRP).  During our survey, it was highlighted that providers often define a minimum time  for recovery from failure or disaster but also a minimum level of service that should be provided by  the vendor (agreed as part of their SLA) in order to ensure the continuity of their critical services or  reduce the recovery time. These metrics are usually taken into account by the vendor in the definition  of the DRP and BCP.   Integration, migration  Our interviewed providers usually require their vendors to assess the quality and security of the  products and services supplied before their integration into the providers’ networks. In addition,  providers are verifying the quality and functionality of the products against specifications defined in  the contract before their integration into their system. Some acceptance criteria can be set up by the  provider and the product or equipment can be rejected if it does not comply with the provider’s  expectations clearly defined in the contract. This will ensure that products and services are working  as they should and avoid any unexpected anomalies (Issue #2).  However, quality and security are not only critical during the integration of a product or a service into  the provider’s network. It should be managed and ensured also in case of upgrade or decommission.  The change management process should indeed include accurate and efficient testing to guarantee  the security and quality during any change.   Organizational security  Providers in our survey are often concerned that vendors’ security controls would not be aligned with  their own security objectives and would fail to prevent the security risks they have identified (Issue  #1). According to ISO/IEC FDIS 27002 standards, the security of an organization should not be  impacted by the introduction of third party products or services. Therefore, the suppliers could adopt  the security policy of their client or have a security policy aligned with the electronic communications  service provider’s security objectives in order to provide them with the same level of security they  apply in-house.   Monitoring and logging  It has been highlighted many times during the survey that the monitoring of vendors’ products is  crucial for a provider. One of their concerns is a lack of monitoring and logging from their vendor  regarding potential security breaches, unauthorized accesses or unauthorized changes which could  occur with their products or services. Vendors have the opportunity to increase the security level by  monitoring and logging for issues and breach and share critical information with providers to increase  the resilience of electronic communication services.   Human resources security  Among the queried security requirements, human resource management was the least applied among  the providers. Vendors have the opportunity to increase the quality of their services by providing  valuable technical knowledge and skills to the providers. To achieve this, it is crucial for vendors to  have highly trained and knowledgeable staff, capable to support providers in their technical request  and guide them in ensuring a high level of resilience. This is even more important when dealing with  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 27  incidents or disaster. Many times, providers have raised concern regarding potential bad support from  their vendors in case they have to recover their network following an incident (Issue #4).   Assurance  The interviewed providers raised that assurance should be provided by the vendor that security risks  are managed continuously and that requirements are implemented and operated as agreed with the  electronic communication service provider in the contract (Issue #3). Assurance can be gained using  several methods which should be defined in the contract28:  - The supplier can regularly report the security status and incidents as part of a service reporting.  - The supplier can request regular independent reviews of its own systems and reports the results  and any corrective actions identified to its customers. In that case, the supplier supports the costs  associated with the audit or inspection. This approach requires no financial investment from the  electronic communication service provider.  - The electronic communication service provider can have the right of audit or the right of  inspection of its suppliers’ systems. Audits and inspections represent a big investment and are  costly measures for the providers. Nevertheless, most of the providers include in the contract the  right to audit or inspect their supplier’s infrastructure as this represents a very useful tool for  ensuring compliance and keeping with agreed standards. However, the decision to perform an  audit is made on a case by case basis, depending on the context and the criticality of the product  or service provided. About 66% of the providers who answered to the online survey perform (or  request 3rd parties to perform) audits of their vendors and outsourcing partners.  - Assurance can also partly be gained through certification (e.g. ISO 27001).   Certifications  Certifications are often required by the surveyed providers for the outsourcing partners (ISO 2700x,  ISA 3402). It provides the provider with an independent assurance that the vendor’s controls have  been correctly designed and operate effectively (Issue #1). According to the online survey, 62% of  respondents request specific products or services certification from their vendors.   Subcontractors’ requirements  Due to the globalization of the ICT products supply chain, more and more players are now interacting  to produce a single product. As a result, some of the electronic communications service providers take  into account potential subcontractors of their vendors when developing security requirements.  According to the ISO/IEC FDIS 27002 standard, the security requirements applying to the main vendors  should also be imposed to downstream suppliers. In addition, a provider should always verify the  methodology used by its vendors to select and manage their own suppliers.  5.3 Performance Monitoring  An organization has the opportunity to continuously monitor the performance of its vendors in order  to assess the compliance of the vendors with security requirements set up in the contract (Issue #3).  To facilitate the monitoring, it is crucial that vendors share all the information, data, record and  knowledge indispensable for the electronic communication service providers to monitor their  28 Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) (2009), Outsourcing: security governance framework for IT Managed Service  Provision  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 28  performance. Performance should be assessed against the KPIs defined in the SLA and corrective  actions or penalties can be applied in case of deficiencies. Examples of main KPIs used are   Uptime   Response time to alarms   Issues resolution time  Some providers are using a collaborative approach when dealing with security risks involved in the  procurement and outsourcing process. It involves a strong collaboration between parties in terms of  sharing of information and sharing of knowledge which supports the electronic communication service  providers in testing and monitoring the performance of the vendor’s products and services. Indeed,  some interviewees expressed that in many cases, the providers need to have better information about  the products and services provided to accurately monitor the performance of their vendors.  5.4 Change/Termination Management  According to CPNI (2009), the security risks can evolve and the security requirements can quickly  become obsolete. Consequently, the provider together with the vendor could discuss and plan how  to handle any future changes in security requirements. More importantly, processes for change  management and responsibilities regarding change initiation would need to be established in advance  and included in the contract. Both parties can also define who will support the cost depending on the  type of change and include the same in the contract.  In addition, the contract needs to include the procedure to be followed in case the agreement is  terminated. This will ensure that the security risks are managed effectively even during the transition  from the outsourcing supplier/vendor back to the customer or another supplier. The termination  process includes:  - Transferring all documents, procedures, configuration, record, etc. relating the product or service  to the electronic communication service provider to ensure a smooth continuation of it;  - Handling to the electronic communication service provider or destroying all documents, files,  records containing provider’s information;  - In case the retention of some information is agreed with the provider, specific security measures  need to be agreed and implemented to ensure the confidentiality and the protection of the data.  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 29  6 Recommendations  Based on concerns expressed by providers, our own observations and existing initiatives, we provide  in this section a set of general recommendations to the sector and specific recommendations to  providers that could be taken to improve the security of electronic communication networks and  services with respect to dependencies on third party products and managed services. The aim of these  recommendations is to support the management of security risks faced by providers when buying ICT  products and services and contribute to an appropriate level of security and resilience.  In parallel with this report we are publishing a separate Security Guide aimed at providers and also  vendors, where we propose guidance on specific security requirements providers may request from  their vendors when entering into a contractual relationship.29  6.1 General recommendations to the electronic communications sector  The following two general recommendations are aimed at Member States and the actors in the  electronic communications sector.  Recommendation 1: Member States should promote the awareness about security risks related to  ICT procurement and outsourcing  Member States must ensure that the introduction of third party’s products or services into an  electronic communication network does not impact the level of resilience and thus the continuity of  supply of services for the customers. There is a need to raise awareness with providers and vendors  about the importance of managing security risks involved in the procurement and outsourcing of ICT  products.  Applying security requirements to vendors will help providers to comply with Article 13a and address  the security and integrity of their networks and services. Member states, in particular NRAs, have the  opportunity to stimulate the development of security practises targeted to the procurement and  outsourcing but also the sharing of best practises, knowledge, and tips and tricks between electronic  communications service providers on dealing with ICT vendors. This will support the industry to  develop a more unified and integrated approach which will support providers in specifically dealing  with security risks involved in the procurement and outsourcing process (Issue #6).  Recommendation 2: Vendors, providers and critical customers should develop a collaborative  approach to defining security requirements, to sharing information about security vulnerabilities  and threats, and to the mitigation of incidents  Providers often procure similar ICT products and they often have similar security requirements. This  means there is an opportunity for providers to collaborate and jointly set security requirements. The  ENISA security guide for ICT procurement could be used as a basis for such collaboration.30  The vendors of ICT products and services should collaborate with providers in order to build more  resilient and secure electronic communication services for end customers and for the whole society.  This should start in the beginning of the procurement or outsourcing process as it helps the provider  and the vendor to jointly define clear, actionable and measurable security requirements and avoid  disputes going forward (Issue #3). The ENISA Security Guide for ICT Procurement could be used as the  basis for such security requirements.31 The security requirements become a reference point for the  supplier on how to manage the risks during the complete lifecycle of the relationship. And because  29 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/requirements-ecomms-vendors  30 Ibid.  31 Ibid.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/requirements-ecomms-vendors  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 30  security risks can change over time, and new issues might come up, there should be a mechanism  which allows vendors, providers and critical customers (e.g. within the energy, health, and transport  sector respectively), to share information in case of discovered vulnerabilities, threats, near-incidents  and incidents (Issue #2).  Lastly, the vendor can support providers in monitoring and testing the performance of procured  products and outsourced services, and the providers should receive appropriate and prompt support  by the vendors in case of problems or occurred security incidents (Issue #4).  As highlighted during the survey, by adopting a more collaborative approach, vendors, providers and  users will all benefit from a more transparent view and in the end more resilient networks and  services.  6.2 Recommendations to individual providers of electronic communications  networks and services  The following recommendations are specifically aimed at providers of electronic communications  networks and services.  Recommendation 3: Engage internal stakeholders and develop a holistic risks management  approach  When addressing security risks in the procurement and outsourcing process, the electronic  communications service provider should involve stakeholders across the organization (Issue #2, #3,  #4). The ENISA Security Guide for ICT Procurement32 could be used as a starting point for working with  internal stakeholders (e.g. the information security team, procurement team, architecture team and  the management team).  It is particularly important to ensure that these security practises are embedded in the whole  organisation. There needs to be procedures in place for addressing and developing vendor security  requirements between network and security experts, procurement and not least management.  Recommendation 4: Conduct a risk assessment before procuring or outsourcing to third party  Before starting the procurement or outsourcing process and entering into a relationship with a third  party, the electronic communications service provider is advised to conduct a Risk Assessment. A Risk  Assessment will support the provider in better identifying the security risks they may face if they enter  in such a relationship, especially the potential lack effectiveness of vendor’s security practises (Issue  #1), and develop specific and relevant security requirements targeted to the vendor which will prevent  or mitigate those risks. Security Risks Assessment can include (but is not limited to) the following  elements:   Criticality of the product procured or service outsourced;   Potential impact in case of loss of confidentiality, integrity or availability;   Known and identified vulnerabilities;   External security threats such as malicious attacks;   Minimum level of residual risk which is acceptable by the electronic communication service  provider;   Vendor’s existing security practises including internal security practises, adoption of security  standard or recognised industry practises, etc.;   Vendor’s past performance or reputation on past performance;   Ability to change vendors (in order to avoid vendor lock-in);  32 Ibid.  Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications  Analysis and recommendations for procuring ICT securely in the Electronic Communications Sector  December 2014  Page 31   Information on vendor’s subcontractors.   Vendor’s financial status (e.g. credit worthiness, solidity, etc.).  Recommendation 5: Develop high level security policy and requirements before selecting preferred  vendor  The provider should define their own high level security policy for third-party procuring or  outsourcing. High level security requirements could already be developed at the beginning of the  selection process and more precisely when writing the request for proposal. Indeed, this will help the  provider to only consider suppliers based on their capacity to comply with the same and avoid the risk  of inefficient security controls (Issue #1). With this leading practise, the provider can expect saving  time and money when evaluating their possibilities in terms of vendors. All the same, they have to  assess and review the capacity of its suppliers through qualifications checks and credentials.  Recommendation 6: Develop clear, solid, measurable and actionable security requirements for  vendors  The provider should develop and define clear, simple, measurable and actionable security  requirements, for specific ICT products or services, in order to facilitate their implementation by the  vendor and avoid any confusion or misunderstanding during the contract lifecycle (Issue #3). The  ENISA Security Guide for ICT Procurement33 can be consulted for this purpose. It is advised to develop  solid security requirements which will not require further significant changes. Changes in security  requirements risk weakening the vendor’s security practises and bringing confusion in the  relationship.  Recommendation 7: Prioritize the implementation of the security requirements for vendors  Depending on the type and criticality of the products or services, different security requirements and  different levels of security are needed. One size does not fit all. Criteria from regulatory requirements  as well as internal criteria such as uptime, number of users affected in case of failure etc. should be  considered to give security requirements a proper prioritization. This allows stakeholders inside the  organization to focus on the most important requirements first.  Recommendation 8: Manage security risks through the procurement lifecycle  Efforts to ensure sufficient levels of security should be carried out through the project lifecycle and  not only during the vendor selection process. Different steps should be in place to guarantee integrity,  confidentiality and availability of the services throughout the product or service lifecycle. For example,  testing could be performed in the development phase of the product/system, before its integration in  the provider’s infrastructure, along its lifecycle and after each patch or update.  Recommendation 9: Monitor the performance of your vendors  The provider should continuously monitor the performance of their vendors by regularly reviewing  service reports and records provided by the later, or other means such as audits or technical  inspections. Performance can be assessed against the KPIs defined in the SLA and corrective actions  or penalties can be used in case of deficiencies. Higher penalties can be applied for highly critical  systems, and by doing so, vendors may be more risk aware about the provider’s core services and the  role their products and services play. This will support the provider in ensuring the compliance of its  vendor with security requirements defined in the contract (Issue #3).  33 Ibid.

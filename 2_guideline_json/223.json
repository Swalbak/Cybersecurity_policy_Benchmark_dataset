Information and  statistics are presented according to the selection, acquisition and use of cyber insurance as a  mitigation tool in the context of their daily business’ lifecycle. The collection of data and opinions  were elaborated in relation to the category of OESs included in the network and information  security (NIS) directive (Directive (EU) 2016/1148. Nonetheless, results and evidences would be  also applicable to essential and important entities defined in the framework of the NIS2 Directive  (EU) 2022/2555.  The report addresses exclusively the ‘demand side’ of cyber-insurance market, applicable to the  particular case of OESs. The analysis and results have been conducted from a methodological  approach which integrates: desk-research, on-line survey, phone interviews, data  analysis and recommendations for policymakers. To the purpose, the analysis aims at  addressing different segments of the cyber insurance contracting process, namely: risk  management practices, cyber insurance coverage, claims processes and opinions from the  respondents in key areas such as skills.  In terms of results, the analysis shows that a big proportion of operators of essential  services consider cyber insurance less attractive due to increasing prices and  decreasing coverage. This phenomenon is highly noted specially in small entities in a moment  in which ransomware incidents are on the rise1. Data from both the survey and the semi- structured interviews support these findings. Other key findings of the analysis were:  • third-party liabilities are the preferred additional coverage that companies would  like to have added in their cyber insurance coverage;  • cyber-risk is being highly addressed on qualitative basis. For a 77 % of operators  of essential services there is a formalized process to identify cyber-risk. On the other  hand, 64 % of OESs do not quantify cyber-risks;  • other risk mitigation strategies were often mentioned as more favourable than risk  transfer due to coverage and costs.  Regarding recommendations, the report provides advice to policymakers in EU and its  Member States and also to the community of OESs. The report focuses on the analysis of  demand side of cyber insurance (particularly OESs), and accordingly related recommendations  target policymakers and OESs. Accordingly, key recommendations for policy makers are:  • Implement guidance mechanisms to OESs focused on: identification of assets,  monitor key metrics, conduct periodic risk assessments, security controls  identification and quantification of risks.  • Promote the creation of frameworks oriented to identify and exchange good  practices among OESs, particularly those related to identification, mitigation and  quantification of risk exposure.  • Be aware of the heterogeneity of OESs in terms of size, economic sector and  strategic function. Formulation of policy action should be coherent with specific  needs and challenges of OESs without losing sight of differences among them,  e.g. small entities vs large operators.  1 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2021/@@download/fullReport  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2021/@@download/fullReport  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  6  • Address the feasibility of more economically sustainable cyber-insurance  policies by working closer to cyber-insurance brokers.  Similarly, key recommendations to OES are:  • Improve maturity of risk management practices, especially those related to  identification, mitigation and quantification of risk exposure.  • Consider to allocate or increase budgetary provisions to implementing  processes related to identification of assets, monitor key metrics, conduct  periodic risk assessments, security controls identification and quantification  of risks based on industry best practices.  • Improve knowledge transfer and sharing among OESs allowing to learn from  good practices when contracting and implementing cyber insurance to the benefit  of these operators.  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  7  1. INTRODUCTION  Objective  The main objective of this analysis is to understand and identify current requirements and  challenges faced by operators of essential services (OESs)2 when contracting cyber insurance.  Accordingly, the aim of the analysis is to provide recommendations to policymakers and OES on  possible ways to face these challenges. The work is particularly focused on the analysis of  OESs as acquirers of cyber insurance products and services.  Scope  The conducted work aims at shedding light on potential barriers that are preventing OESs from  purchasing cyber insurance. The report addresses exclusively the ‘demand side’ of cyber- insurance market, applicable to the particular case of OESs. Therefore, considerations and  analysis related to the supply side of the cyber-insurance sector (e.g. insurers, brokers) are out  of the scope of this analysis.  The study has focused on challenges faced by 262 OESs distributed in 25 EU Member States,  representing all strategic sectors defined by Directive (EU) 2016/1148, known as the NIS  directive. The final outcome of the analysis is reflected in the main part of this report. The  comprehensive set of questions and answers addressed in the survey are included in the  annexes.  Background  Prior to the analysis presented in this report, ENISA had conducted deep-dives analysis on  specific aspects of cyber insurance from a policy development point of view. Key outputs of this  previous work were:  a) Cyber insurance: recent advances, good practices and challenges3;  b) Commonalities of risk assessment language in cyber insurance - recommendations on  cyber insurance 4.  The results from these reports, released between 2016 and 2017, provided solid evidence of  the existence of good practices in the areas of both cyber insurance and risk management and  on the existence of challenges that are yet to be tackled and that require further investigation  into their respective causes and consequences.  At interinstitutional level, ENISA has developed strong synergies with several stakeholders  including the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) in actions  oriented to have a better understanding of the sector of cyber insurance from a two-fold  perspective: cybersecurity and market development. These synergies have been materialised  on close coordination activities to monitor cyber insurance developments, knowledge exchange  and multidisciplinary collaboration.  2 As defined in the Article 5(2) of the NIS Directive: the criteria for the identification of the operators of essential services are  the following: (i) The entity provides a service which is essential for the maintenance of critical societal and/or economic  activities. (ii) The provision of that service depends on network and information systems. (iii)  An incident would have  significant disruptive effects on the provision of that service.  3 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-insurance-recent-advances-good-practices-and-challenges  4 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/commonality-of-risk-assessment-language-in-cyber-insurance  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  8  Methodological approach  The study was conducted based on the following steps:  Desktop research: Focused on gathering information helping to understand the state of the art of  the market, the requirements and challenges faced by OESs and the experiences around the use  of cyber insurance as mitigation tool in different contexts. The knowledge base allowed the  formulation of preliminary hypotheses which were used as input to create the survey and the  interview guide.  Online survey: Consisted of obtaining data related to challenges and requirements of OESs in  acquiring cyber insurance. The survey covered over sixty questions distributed in seven  thematic blocks including: (i) information about the respondent, (ii) risk identification,  quantification and prioritization, (iii) identification and selection phase, (iv) contractual phase, (v)  coverage maintenance and support, (vi) claim procedure and (vii) skills. For a complete  overview of the survey please refer to Annex B.  Semi-structured interviews: A series of 10 interviews were conducted to investigate the  background and motivation of answers in the survey. This activity provided additional insights  into the experiences of OESs in finding acquiring and managing cyber insurance as a tool for  cyber risk mitigation. The respondent consisted of a diverse group of OESs in terms of size,  geography and sector represented.  Data analysis and validation: A final step in the approach was to conduct an analysis of the  survey and interview data. Challenges, issues and key insights derived from both the interviews  and through analysis of the dataset were captured in the report.  Policy recommendations: As a result of previous methodological steps, the analysis concludes  with a list of recommendations addressed to policymakers. These recommendations are  elaborated on the basis of evidences, findings and data gathered mostly in first half of 2022. To  this end, interested parties should keep in mind the constant and rapid evolution of the cyber  insurance market, and should therefore consider the time in which related analysis took place.  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  9  2. THE DEMAND SIDE OF  CYBER INSURANCE SECTOR  Based on the desk-research analysis5, the following aspects provide a general overview of the  cyber insurance sector. Existing literature has addressed cyber insurance from several angles,  mostly from the perspective of the cyber insurance offer-side of the market, such as insurers or  brokers.  • Cyber insurance is still in a development phase and it is challenging to capture how  expectations on coverage may change over time and how emerging threats may  change the expectations regarding coverage.  • The cyber insurance industry may expect a gradual increase in the demand for cyber  insurance and the importance of cyber coverage is expected to increase significantly  • The cyber insurance processes follow three main pillars: risk identification, risk  analysis and establishing a contract.  • The overall awareness and perceived probability of the cyber risks is high but expected  impacts of a cyber-attack may yet be underestimated.  • Lack of incident-related data is a primary obstacle to a detailed understanding of  fundamental aspects of cyber risk and to the provision of proper coverage to end  users.  • Insurers may face challenges in collecting accurate information from end-users as they  may be reluctant to provide complete answers in questionnaires or to provide access  to information related to critical assets, internal procedures and security controls.  • End-users may be concerned about possible non-disclosure or incomplete information  leading to claims being rejected. As a result, it is hard to determine how much risk to  transfer and insurers may also face risks they may not have properly quantified.  • The lack of credible data and the potential for high aggregate losses may lead to cyber  insurance policies with gaps in coverages and limits that are too low, which may lead  to a lack of indemnification for cyber losses.  • Systems change continuously as new systems are added and obsolete ones are  dismantled, leading to a continuous change of the risk profile.  • Statistics on cyber incidents are not completely reliable as victims do not always report  incidents (e.g. to avoid reputational damage)  • It can take a very long time before a breach is noticed and depending on the policy  conditions, such an event may be no longer covered.  • Guidelines for cyber insurance are available and can provide an initial framework for  end-users to approach the selection and use of cyber insurance in their respective  contexts6.  In contrast, the desk research activity did not contribute to obtain data and information related to  the demand side in cyber insurance market dynamics. Accordingly, the work presented in this  report aims at analysing cyber insurance challenges and perspectives, targeting the particular  group of entities called: operators of essential services (OESs), as defined in the NIS Directive.  The following sections discuss in detail related analysis and obtained results. The sections are a  reflect of typical cyber insurance lifecycle that includes: risk management practices (section  2.1), coverage (2.2), identification and selection of insurer (2.3), contracts (2.4), maintenance  (2.5), claim procedures (2.6) and awareness and skills (2.7)  5 A complete overview of the publications reviewed can be found in the Annex A.  6 See: Information security management — Guidelines for cyber-insurance ISO/IEC 27102:2019  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  10  2.1 RISK-MANAGEMENT PRACTICES  Cyber insurance is a strategy to reduce risk and therefore is addressed in a context of risk  management processes within an organisation. The risk management processes can also be a  pre-requisite for cyber insurance. As risk transfer is preceded by the identification and  quantification of risk exposure, it can be one option in a range of other risk management  strategies (acceptance, termination of activities or risk mitigation through process controls).  Therefore, respondents were asked about risk management processes, risk mitigation options  and the quantification of cyber risks.  Of all the respondents, over 77 % indicated that they follow a formalised process to identify  cyber risks. In contrast, the analysis also shows that 23 % are not using a formalised process or  are unsure that there is one. This gap expands when respondents were queried regarding  existing processes to make decisions on risk mitigation tools and controls. In 32 % of the cases,  a process to determine risk mitigation tools and controls is not in place.  Figure 1: Formalised process to identify cyber-risk  This observation becomes even clearer when analysing the data on risk quantification. The  results also demonstrate that only 32 % of respondents quantify cyber risk. The difference  between these numbers could be explained by respondents only applying a qualitative risk  assessment process (for the 67 % that have a formalised process to identify cyber risk).  Respondents who have cyber insurance are more likely to quantify cyber risk as well. The  research shows that 61 % of respondents with cyber insurance do, compared to the 22 % of  respondents who do not have cyber insurance.  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  11  Figure 2: Formalised process to identify cyber risk  As risk quantification is a pre-requisite for risk transfer, the relative lack of risk quantification  practices among OESs can be seen as an emergent challenge in the preliminary steps oriented  to acquiring cyber insurance services. During the interviews, some respondents indicated that  the risk quantification process was conducted by their insurance broker or agent.  All interviewed contributors indicated to have risk-management practices in place and a  process to determine controls. Most of respondents did not quantify cyber risks themselves  but worked with their broker or insurance company to quantify their exposure and determine  coverage needs. In some cases, the coverage chosen was also a trade-off between  coverage and costs, to keep the annual cyber insurance policy fee within the allowed budget.  Summing up, it can be stated that for a subset of OESs, the maturity of the risk-management  processes can be improved. The obtained data suggests that as risk-management maturity  improves, the coverage of cyber insurance will also increase. Other key findings of risk  management practices in OESs are:  • Most respondents (77 %) follow a formalized process for qualitative risks assessments  (N = 202). Additionally, 68 % follows a process for the selection of controls to mitigate  risk (N = 177).  • Among all respondents, only 32 % (N = 84) quantifies cyber risk (N = 167 does not).  • Within respondents who already have cyber insurance, 22 % of them quantify cyber  risk  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  12  2.2 CYBER INSURANCE AND OTHER COVERAGE  A key aspect of the research was to understand the cyber coverage of OESs. In addition,  coverage through other existing policies was investigated as well as the type of coverage,  missing elements and failed attempts to get cyber insurance in the past. The motivations behind  contracting cyber insurance and the major challenges were also analysed.  Current cyber coverage  The survey revealed that only 26 % of the respondents currently have cyber insurance and 74%  do not. This indicates a slightly lower coverage than the NIS investment results of 2022, which  report that 32 % of OESs/DSPs have cyber insurance (or the 30 % of OESs/DSPs with cyber  insurance in 20217). Although the reported coverage percentages from this cyber insurance  survey are slightly lower than in NIS investment reports, it does show a declining trend over the  last few years.  Figure 3: Cyber insurance uptake in OESs  From a territorial point of view, regional differences in cyber coverage appear. In western and  northern Europe the cyber coverage appears to be the highest (45 %), followed by southern  Europe (39 %) and lastly eastern Europe, with the lowest adoption of cyber insurance (12 %).  Table 1: Cyber insurance uptake across the EU  Cyber insurance Western and  northern Europe  Southern Europe Eastern Europe  No 55 % 61 % 88 %  Yes 45 % 39 % 12 %  7 NIS Investment report 2021: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/nis-investments-2021  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/nis-investments-2021  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  13  Other insurance coverage including cyber  In addition to specific cyber policies, other insurance policies might sometimes provide coverage  for cyber incidents. This could be explicitly through a cyber add-on or more implicitly by not  excluding any cyber incidents. Over half of the respondents indicated that they do not have this  coverage, but 26 % (N = 64) indicated that they have some form of cyber coverage through their  other policies.  Figure 4: Insurance, other than standalone cyber policies  What cyber insurance policies cover  The coverage of cyber insurance is quite broad and includes various damages and incidents.  Coverage ranges from (Distributed) denial of service (DDoS) attacks, malware, ransomware  attacks, stolen credentials (unauthorised access and use of data assets and computer  systems), phishing attacks, network interruption and more.  However, respondents to the interview expressed concern about the ease of renewing the  policies and exclusions, limitations, and price of the prolongations. In particular, getting  coverage for ransomware has become increasingly difficult in the last few years according to  respondents.  Not able to get cyber insurance  The survey revealed also that companies have difficulties in getting cyber insurance mainly for  three reasons:  • Coverage is not sufficient for their needs.  • Because of the way insurers assess the organisation.  • The price of the insurance policy or offer generally does not meet the expectations.  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  14  Figure 5: Reasons for not contracting cyber insurance  Reasons to purchase cyber insurance and preferred coverage  Coverage in case of incident is, for almost half of respondents, the driving reason to purchase  cyber insurance. Requirements by law (19 %), pre-incident (11 %) and post-incident (11 %)  coverage were in less degree important reasons. Respondents who did not have insurance  indicated to be interested in various types of coverage including: business continuity, expert  support during an incident and ransomware coverage.  Figure 6: Main reason to purchase cyber insurance  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  15  One of the respondents, a large OESs from western Europe, revealed that the organisation  had decided against a cyber insurance policy due to costs and limitations in available  coverage. The key decision in this case was to invest the budget in the Chief Information  Security Officer (CISO) function instead, as this was seen as more effective.  Key findings  • For 26 % of respondents, other insurance policies would provide some cover in case of  a cyber incident (N = 64). 53 % of respondents do not have this coverage (N = 131),  other 22 % do not know (N = 54).  • Only 26 % of OESs has a cyber policy (N = 67), 74 % of the respondents does not  have cyber insurance (N = 195).  • Third party liability coverage is the preferred additional coverage by the respondents  (e.g. coverage of incidents at a supplier which would interrupt business for the  insured).  • Regional differences show that western and northern Europe have the highest  coverage (45 %), followed by Southern Europe (39 %). Eastern Europe has the lowest  coverage with 12 %.  • Of all respondents 36% (N = 95) have not evaluated a cyber insurance offer before,  against 38 % (N = 100) who have and 20 % who expects this in the future.  • Both market research and the interviews indicate cyber insurance policies are  increasing in price and decrease in coverage.  • OESs increasingly looking at alternative risk mitigating strategies (e.g. risk  treatment/risk reduction).  • 56 % of respondents stated they consider other risk mitigations tools to be more  effective compared to cyber insurance (N = 147).  • Some respondents indicated to consider discontinuing current cyber insurance if  pricing keeps on increasing.  • Combined data from this study and previous NIS Investment data shows a declining  cyber insurance coverage trend.  2.3 IDENTIFICATION AND SELECTION OF CYBER INSURER  This section describes aspects related to the identification and selection phase of a cyber  insurer as part of a cyber insurance contracting process. Similarly, the section addresses the  perception of OESs to the acceptance by the insurance company.  Orientation, identification, and selection  The data shows that 26 % of the respondents (N = 67) currently have cyber insurance and 74 %  do not. However, 37 % of the respondents (N = 97) confirms that they have identified cyber  insurance as a risk mitigation tool and 20 % states that they are considering acquiring it within  one year (N = 28) or after two years (N = 25).  It is important to highlight that 56 % of the respondents (N = 157) reports that ‘other risk  mitigation tools were considered more adequate’. This topic has been discussed in detail with  the OESs during the interviews and the reason for this response it is often linked to the high  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  16  prices of available coverages. This trend explains why other mitigation strategies (like  investment in cyber controls) are becoming a more feasible investment for some OESs.  Figure 7: Support during initial steps of cyber insurance  With reference to the selection process, most of the OESs that have insurance have pointed out  that they rely on the insurance broker or on the insurance company to identify the right cyber  insurance. In contrast, when asking the same question to OESs that have not yet acquired  cyber insurance (out of 169 respondents), 57 % would rely on the insurance broker or on the  insurance company and 24 % would rely on the regulator / public body.  Still on the selection process, out of 232 respondents, 54 % confirms knowing about cyber  insurance offers through own research, 27 % have been contacted by an agent or a broker and  10 % have relied on other resources (e.g., information from other internal organisation  departments, parent companies, shareholders). Finally, only 13 out of 232 OESs declare that  they have acquired knowledge about cyber insurance offers through interactions with other  OESs.  When asked about the selection criteria for acquiring cyber insurance, 174 respondents have  provided the answers as shown in Figure 8.  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  17  Figure 8: Selection criteria for acquiring cyber insurance  It can be noted that ‘price’ appears on its own or in combination with other criteria in every  possible combination. Therefore, price emerges as the most important criterion for acquiring  cyber insurance. Immediately after the price, other criteria conditioning cyber insurance  acquisition are:  • reputation of the insurance company,  • coverage,  • specific clauses,  • support.  Finally, out of 64 OESs entities that have cyber insurance, only 16 % of them declare that they  are not satisfied with their insurance regarding their risk exposure, while the rest of them declare  that they are satisfied (69 %) or very satisfied (16 %).  Many of the respondents indicated they worked with their broker to identify cyber insurance  options. One respondent with a sizable insurance team indicated that the initiative came  from their insurance responsible – later supported by the insurance broker.  Assessment and acceptance by the insurance company  On the matter of the intake assessment, the OESs have been asked to provide an answer  based on the elements that apply to the procedure they have undergone. Their answers are  shown in Table 2.  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  18  Table 2: Intake assessment conducted by insurers  How did the insurance company conduct the intake assessment?

Also, third-party8 assessments are among the assessments’ methods, but  they don’t happen very often.  On the duration of the assessment, only 18 out of 61 respondents have reported that they  consider it too long, while the vast majority (70 %) answered that the length of the assessment  was ‘about right’ (N = 39) or ‘short’ (N = 4). In respect of the effort required during the  assessment, 60 OESs have replied as follows:  Figure 9: Effort required during the assessment  Finally, on the matter of legal limitations (e.g. classified or internal documentation) potentially  encountered during the assessment phase, the respondents reported that they had no  limitations and, if existing, they could be adjusted to allow information sharing. Only one  respondent out of 60 reported that these legal limitations couldn’t be adjusted. It has to be noted  that in 7 % of the cases (N = 4), legal limitations led to a rejection or modification of the offer by  the insurer.  8 In line with the ENISA report: ‘Cyber Insurance: Recent Advances, Good Practices and Challenges’, third party risks are  risks that might initially affect someone other than the insured (first party) or insurer (second party), against which an  insured would like to have coverage.  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  19  On the interviews several respondents indicated that time and effort to renew insurance  was getting longer and more effort-intensive, especially in the last couple of years.  Key findings  • One in four OESs currently have cyber insurance in place. Moreover, 37 % of the  respondents (N = 97) confirms that they have identified cyber insurance as a risk  mitigation tool and 20 % state that they are considering acquiring cyber insurance  within one year (N=28) or after two years (N = 25).  • Half of OESs confirms knowing about cyber insurance offers through own research, 27  % have been contacted by an agent or a broker and 10% have relied on other  resources. Only 13 of OES declare that they have acquired knowledge about cyber  insurance offers through interactions with other OESs.  • Within the criteria for acquiring cyber insurance, price appears to be the most  important, followed by: reputation of the insurance company, coverage, specific  clauses and support.  • Legal limitations at the time of sharing information with the broker do not normally  trigger a problem. Yet, in 7 % of the cases, legal limitations led to a rejection or  modification of the offer by the insurer.  2.4 CONTRACT AND PROCESS  For 13 % of respondents, Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) or security team is  responsible for procuring cyber insurance. The respondents who have cyber insurance are  slightly more likely to have a dedicated insurance team involved in the procurement of cyber  insurance. As shown in Table 3, in most of cases decision making regarding acquisition of  insurance takes place outside the CISO function. Decisions regarding cyber insurance are more  often taken by executives, a dedicated insurance team or the finance function.  Table 3: Responsible for cyber insurance in OESs  In case insurance coverage is identified as a mitigation measure,  who is responsible for procuring cyber insurance in your  organisation?  Total  No response 19  CFO or financial team 37  CISO or security team 34  Dedicated insurance manager or team 67  Executive manager 66  Other, please specify 39  Grand total (N) 262  For 39 % of the overall experiences show that the contract was not negotiable and based on  standard templates, while most of the experiences show that the contract could be at least  partially negotiable if not completely negotiable.  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  20  Figure 10: Cyber insurance contracts according to organisational needs  The data regarding the existence of certifications (e.g. ISO 27001) and their impact on the  contractual agreement show that in 77 % of the cases this element led to the easing of the  acceptance by the insurance company. Out of 40 OESs, 5 reported that the existence of  certifications led to the reduction of the price and 4 declared that owning these features had an  impact on the coverage limits. Still on the matter of coverage, only 7 OESs out of 58 reported  that the assessment conducted by the insurer led to exclusions and sub-limits, while 44 %  responded that no limitations were introduced.  With reference to the information received when purchasing cyber insurance, out of 60  respondents, 57 % reported that they have received clear information about any embedded  exclusions and limitations of the coverage, including the cases of systemic events.  At the same time, only 32% of the OESs (N = 19) have confirmed that they have been  presented with a list of examples of events that are excluded from the coverage. It should be  noted that in the same two questions, almost one third of the participants replied that they do  not know whether they have received clear information and a list of exclusions.  An insurance manager expressed his concerns about how to interpret certain clauses of  the cyber insurance contract. He mentioned the lack of standardisation in the clauses and  the lack of available precedents to understand how clauses would be explained in a loss  scenario.  Key findings  • Decision making regarding acquisition of insurance, in most of cases, takes place  outside the CISO function (only in 12 % of OESs).  • Only 3 % of OESs (2 out of 62) stated the contract and its annexes to be unclear.  • Of respondents with cyber insurance, 63 % of respondents found the contract clauses  clear or somewhat clear.  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  21  • On the negotiability of the contract, 61 % was partially or completely negotiable (N =  61).  • A 57 % of OESs reported to have received clear information about any embedded  exclusions and limitations of the cyber insurance coverage, including the cases of a  systemic events.  2.5 MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT  When exploring the area regarding additional features or services embedded in the  cybersecurity insurance acquired by the OESs, it can be noted that:  • 40 % of respondents (24 out of 60) declared that their insurance company provide  support in prevention of cyber incidents;  • 68 % of respondents (40 out of 59) declared that their insurance company provide  post-incident cyber support.  The question related to importance of ‘prevention support’ services has also been asked to the  participants. Cyber insurance support appears to be not relevant for 18 % of OESs and relevant  for the 32 %. Only 20 % of OESs consider it as extremely necessary.  Figure 11: Relevance of cyber insurance  In contrast, the insured OESs have been asked if a cyber incident has led to an increase of  costs or denial of coverage. In this case only 10 % of the respondents has confirmed this  possibility, while 50 % has declared that they haven’t observed any incident. The rest of the  respondents were equally divided between ‘no’ and ‘does not know’.  A few respondents mentioned cyber-incident response to be a very valuable service.  However, in many cases an existing relationship with a cyber-incident response party is  already in place, making the insurance company a less likely candidate to offer this service.  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  22  Key findings:  • For OESs, post-incident response services provided by cyber insurers are more  prominent that pre-incident response services.  • For 20 % of non-insured OESs, maintenance and support from a cyber insurer provider  would be extremely necessary.  • Half of insured OESs have not witnessed any cyber-incident, therefore they cannot  assess how the increase of cyber insurance costs could be related  2.6 CLAIM PROCEDURE  The final section of the survey, dedicated to the gathering of data about the experiences of  OESs that have acquired cyber insurance, has been focused on the ‘claim procedure’.  To the question: has your organisation issued a claim with a cyber insurer? Almost 3 in four  OESs (44 out of 60), have never issued a claim.  Likewise, 13 % of the respondents (8 out of  60) have issued a claim and 13 % do not know.  Figure 12: Issuing a claim  Operators of essential services were also asked if they have ever issued a cyber claim with their  insurer on a non-cyber policy.  In this case 7 out of 8 responded that they have never done it, 1  did not know.  Determining the claim and proving all supporting evidence can be quite a complex step in  the process. A respondent indicated that they hired a claims adjustment consultant due to  the complexity of the case.  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  23  Key findings  • 13 % of the respondents (8 out of 60) have issued a claim with their cyber insurer.  • Of the 8 respondents, 6 confirmed their claim was approved and 2 confirmed that the  reimbursement was enough to cover the actual damage.  • 3 out of 6 respondents also confirmed that the claim was processed in a timely manner  (only 2 responded that it was not).  • On the clarity of the methodology for calculating the amount of the claim, 3 out of 6  confirmed that the methodology was clear (only 2 responded that it was not).  • Out of the 6 respondents, 5 reported that the claim did not lead to any legal dispute  with the insurer, 1 did not know.  2.7 AWARENESS AND SKILLS  To increase awareness about cyber insurance, the top responses (in order of priority) were  communication and dissemination, better coverage, ad-hoc collaborative networks and peer- learning. Interestingly, better coverage was mentioned, which could indicate that cyber  insurance is perceived as a mitigation strategy with limited scope for the risk itself. Some  respondents mentioned that they do not regard cyber insurance as a viable risk mitigation  strategy at all. Informal learning and recommendations were suggested as a good way to  improve strategy. Options mentioned less often were public support and research and scientific  evidence.  To increase the purchase of cyber insurance, the top responses (in order of priority) were:  • better coverages,  • less exclusions,  • clearer policy wording,  • communication and dissemination.  These responses would be understood in line with higher expectations from organisations  according to the offered cyber insurance services. This finding is coherent with outcomes of  interviews where interviewees expressed their decreasing appetite for cyber insurance as a  strategy to reduce risk.  In the interviews, interviewees expressed that cyber insurance policy fees have gone up  significantly in recent years, while at the same time the policy terms have become less attractive  (exclusions, sub-limits, etc.). The decreasing attractiveness of cyber insurance due to price and  coverage was a recurring theme during the interviews. Investments in cyber controls (risk  treatment instead of transfer) were generally seen as more effective in mitigating cyber risk.  Lastly, respondents were asked to indicate the relevant skills they believed to be necessary  when purchasing cyber insurance. The top skills mentioned (in order) were risk assessment  skills, knowledge about legislation, information management and functioning of the insurance  market. As risk-management skills were indicated as the primary skill, it is notable to mention  the maturity gap described in section 2.1 on risk-management practices.  Several respondents indicated that it was unclear how premiums are being calculated.  They asked for more transparency – so as to be able to see the risk models - so to be able  to make a better weighted decision on the level of coverage to buy. One respondent also  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  24  argued that it was unclear how investment in cyber controls would contribute to lower  premiums (creating a better foundation for a business case).  Key findings  • Communication and dissemination, better coverage, ad-hoc collaborative networks and  peer-learning are prominent areas to raise awareness on cyber insurance relevance.  • In the opinion of OESs, key aspects oriented to increase purchase of cyber insurance  are:  better coverages, less exclusions, clearer policy wording, communication and  dissemination.  • From an awareness perspective, most of interviewees realised how cyber insurance  policy fees have gone up significantly in recent years, while policy terms have become  less attractive.  • In terms of skills, the top ones mentioned as relevant for cyber insurance sector are:  risk assessment, knowledge about legislation, information management and  functioning of the insurance market.  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  25  Table 4: Summary of key findings  Risk management practices Coverage Identification and selection of cyber insurer  Most respondents (77 %) follow  a formalized process for  qualitative risks assessments (N  = 202). Additionally, 68 %  follows a process for the  selection of controls to mitigate  risk (N = 177).  Among all respondents, only 32  % (N = 84) quantifies cyber risk  (N = 167 does not).  Within respondents who already  have cyber insurance, 22 % of  them quantify cyber risk  For 26 % of respondents, other insurance policies would provide some cover in case  of a cyber incident (N = 64). 53 % of respondents do not have this coverage (N =  131), other 22 % do not know (N = 54).  Only 26 % of OESs has a cyber policy (N = 67), 74 % of the respondents does not  have cyber insurance (N = 195).  Third-party liability coverage is the preferred additional coverage by the respondents  (e.g. coverage of incidents at a supplier which would interrupt business for the  insured).  Regional differences show that western and northern Europe have the highest  coverage (45 %), followed by southern Europe (39 %). Eastern Europe has the  lowest coverage with 12 %.  Of all respondents 36 % (N = 95) have not evaluated a cyber insurance offer before,  against 38 % (N = 100) who have and 20 % who expects this in the future.  Both market research and the interviews indicate cyber insurance policies are  increasing in price and decrease in coverage.  OESs increasingly looking at alternative risk mitigating strategies (e.g. risk  treatment/risk reduction).  56 % of respondents stated they consider other risk mitigations tools to be more  effective compared to cyber insurance (N = 147).  Some respondents indicated to consider discontinuing current cyber insurance if  pricing keeps on increasing.  Combined data from this study and previous NIS Investment data shows a declining  cyber insurance coverage trend.  One in four OESs currently have cyber  insurance in place. Moreover, 37 % of the  respondents (N = 97) confirms that they have  identified cyber insurance as a risk mitigation  tool and 20 % state that they are considering  acquiring cyber insurance within one year (N =  28) or after two years (N = 25).  Half of OESs confirms knowing about cyber  insurance offers through own research, 27 %  have been contacted by an agent or a broker  and 10 % have relied on other resources. Only  13 of OESs declare that they have acquired  knowledge about cyber insurance offers  through interactions with other OESs.  Within the criteria for acquiring cyber  insurance, price appears to be the most  important, followed by: reputation of the  insurance company, coverage, specific  clauses and support.  Legal limitations at the time of sharing  information with the broker do not normally  trigger a problem. Yet, in 7 % of the cases,  legal limitations led to a rejection or  modification of the offer by the insurer.

For OESs, post-incident  response services provided by  cyber insurers are more  prominent that pre-incident  response services.  For 20 % of non-insured  OESs, maintenance and  support from a cyber insurer  provider would be extremely  necessary.  Half of insured OESs have not  witnessed any cyber-incident,  therefore they cannot assess  how the increase of cyber  insurance costs could be  related  13 % of the respondents (8 out of 60) have  issued a claim with their cyber insurer;  Of the 8 respondents, 6 confirmed their  claim was approved and 2 confirmed that  the reimbursement was enough for  covering the actual damage;  3 out of 6 respondents also confirmed that  the claim was processed in a timely  manner (only 2 responded that it was not)  On the clarity of the methodology for  calculating the amount of the claim, 3 out  of 6 confirmed that the methodology was  clear (only 2 responded that it was not);  Out of the 6 respondents, 5 reported that  the claim did not lead to any legal dispute  with the insurer, 1 did not know.

DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  27  3. RECOMMENDATIONS  The following recommendations are provided aiming to mitigate challenges faced by OESs  when addressing cyber security. The following set of recommendations are addressed primarily  to policymakers and OESs in the EU and its Member States, dealing cyber insurance policy.  Recommendations to policymakers  • Implement guidance mechanisms aiming at improving maturity of risk  management practices of OESs. Specific areas where guidance would be more  helpful are: identification of assets, monitoring key metrics, frameworks for risk  assessment and quantification, security controls identification and quantification of  risks.  • Promote the creation of frameworks oriented to identify and exchange good  practices among OESs, particularly those related to identification, mitigation and  quantification of risk exposure. Also, facilitate exchange of experiences among  OESs related to contracting and implementing cyber insurance in different  contexts.  • Be aware of the heterogeneity of OESs in terms of size, economic sector and  strategic function. Formulation of policy action should be coherent with specific  needs and challenges of OESs as a whole, without losing sight of differences  among them, e.g., small entities vs large operators.  • The study shows that OESs tend to prefer self-investment to risk transfer if prices  of cyber insurance are high. Policymakers should address the feasibility of more  economically sustainable cyber insurance policies by working closer to brokers.  • Address the link between the cyber-insurance and cyber security by making sure  that procurement of products, services and processes certified in the European  Union – or that have obtained a label associated with those schemes - obtain a  higher score in the intake assessment performed by the insurance companies.  • Foster initiatives, including standardization and guidance development, to provide  elements and assessment methodologies on the quantification of cyber risks,  circumstance that would also improve the awareness and decision-making on  specific areas in which cyber insurance would be the optimal mitigation tool.  • Steer multi-stakeholder dialogues oriented to improving clarity, understandability  and comparability of policies by fostering the development of terminology of  reference (taxonomy) for cyber insurance.  • Develop collaborative frameworks with public and private partners to enable skills  frameworks and programmes for cyber insurance, particularly in areas such as  risk assessment, legal aspects, information management and cyber insurance  market dynamics.  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  28  Recommendations to OESs  • Improve maturity of risk management practices. The risk management practices  related to identification, mitigation and quantification of risk exposure would  contribute to clarify cyber insurance needs.  • Consider to allocate or increase budgetary provisions to implementing processes  related to identification of assets, monitor key metrics, conduct periodic risk  assessments, security controls identification and quantification of risks based on  industry best practices.  • Improve knowledge transfer and sharing with other OESs allowing to learn from  other good practices when contracting and implementing cyber insurance to the  benefit of these operators. Also improve incident data sharing among sectors.  • Improve coverage all over digital supply chains, specifically covering 3rd party  liability managed service providers. As supply chain are digitally connected,  coverage for only a participant in the entire chain might not reduce risks  sufficiently.

Information and  statistics are presented according to the selection, acquisition and use of cyber insurance as a  mitigation tool in the context of their daily business’ lifecycle. The collection of data and opinions  were elaborated in relation to the category of OESs included in the network and information  security (NIS) directive (Directive (EU) 2016/1148. Nonetheless, results and evidences would be  also applicable to essential and important entities defined in the framework of the NIS2 Directive  (EU) 2022/2555.  The report addresses exclusively the ‘demand side’ of cyber-insurance market, applicable to the  particular case of OESs. The analysis and results have been conducted from a methodological  approach which integrates: desk-research, on-line survey, phone interviews, data  analysis and recommendations for policymakers. To the purpose, the analysis aims at  addressing different segments of the cyber insurance contracting process, namely: risk  management practices, cyber insurance coverage, claims processes and opinions from the  respondents in key areas such as skills.  In terms of results, the analysis shows that a big proportion of operators of essential  services consider cyber insurance less attractive due to increasing prices and  decreasing coverage. This phenomenon is highly noted specially in small entities in a moment  in which ransomware incidents are on the rise1. Data from both the survey and the semi- structured interviews support these findings. Other key findings of the analysis were:  • third-party liabilities are the preferred additional coverage that companies would  like to have added in their cyber insurance coverage;  • cyber-risk is being highly addressed on qualitative basis. For a 77 % of operators  of essential services there is a formalized process to identify cyber-risk. On the other  hand, 64 % of OESs do not quantify cyber-risks;  • other risk mitigation strategies were often mentioned as more favourable than risk  transfer due to coverage and costs.  Regarding recommendations, the report provides advice to policymakers in EU and its  Member States and also to the community of OESs. The report focuses on the analysis of  demand side of cyber insurance (particularly OESs), and accordingly related recommendations  target policymakers and OESs. Accordingly, key recommendations for policy makers are:  • Implement guidance mechanisms to OESs focused on: identification of assets,  monitor key metrics, conduct periodic risk assessments, security controls  identification and quantification of risks.  • Promote the creation of frameworks oriented to identify and exchange good  practices among OESs, particularly those related to identification, mitigation and  quantification of risk exposure.  • Be aware of the heterogeneity of OESs in terms of size, economic sector and  strategic function. Formulation of policy action should be coherent with specific  needs and challenges of OESs without losing sight of differences among them,  e.g. small entities vs large operators.  1 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2021/@@download/fullReport  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2021/@@download/fullReport  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  6  • Address the feasibility of more economically sustainable cyber-insurance  policies by working closer to cyber-insurance brokers.  Similarly, key recommendations to OES are:  • Improve maturity of risk management practices, especially those related to  identification, mitigation and quantification of risk exposure.  • Consider to allocate or increase budgetary provisions to implementing  processes related to identification of assets, monitor key metrics, conduct  periodic risk assessments, security controls identification and quantification  of risks based on industry best practices.  • Improve knowledge transfer and sharing among OESs allowing to learn from  good practices when contracting and implementing cyber insurance to the benefit  of these operators.

INTRODUCTION  Objective  The main objective of this analysis is to understand and identify current requirements and  challenges faced by operators of essential services (OESs)2 when contracting cyber insurance.  Accordingly, the aim of the analysis is to provide recommendations to policymakers and OES on  possible ways to face these challenges. The work is particularly focused on the analysis of  OESs as acquirers of cyber insurance products and services.  Scope  The conducted work aims at shedding light on potential barriers that are preventing OESs from  purchasing cyber insurance. The report addresses exclusively the ‘demand side’ of cyber- insurance market, applicable to the particular case of OESs. Therefore, considerations and  analysis related to the supply side of the cyber-insurance sector (e.g. insurers, brokers) are out  of the scope of this analysis.  The study has focused on challenges faced by 262 OESs distributed in 25 EU Member States,  representing all strategic sectors defined by Directive (EU) 2016/1148, known as the NIS  directive. The final outcome of the analysis is reflected in the main part of this report. The  comprehensive set of questions and answers addressed in the survey are included in the  annexes.  Background  Prior to the analysis presented in this report, ENISA had conducted deep-dives analysis on  specific aspects of cyber insurance from a policy development point of view. Key outputs of this  previous work were:  a) Cyber insurance: recent advances, good practices and challenges3;  b) Commonalities of risk assessment language in cyber insurance - recommendations on  cyber insurance 4.  The results from these reports, released between 2016 and 2017, provided solid evidence of  the existence of good practices in the areas of both cyber insurance and risk management and  on the existence of challenges that are yet to be tackled and that require further investigation  into their respective causes and consequences.  At interinstitutional level, ENISA has developed strong synergies with several stakeholders  including the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) in actions  oriented to have a better understanding of the sector of cyber insurance from a two-fold  perspective: cybersecurity and market development. These synergies have been materialised  on close coordination activities to monitor cyber insurance developments, knowledge exchange  and multidisciplinary collaboration.  2 As defined in the Article 5(2) of the NIS Directive: the criteria for the identification of the operators of essential services are  the following: (i) The entity provides a service which is essential for the maintenance of critical societal and/or economic  activities. (ii) The provision of that service depends on network and information systems. (iii)  An incident would have  significant disruptive effects on the provision of that service.  3 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-insurance-recent-advances-good-practices-and-challenges  4 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/commonality-of-risk-assessment-language-in-cyber-insurance  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  8  Methodological approach  The study was conducted based on the following steps:  Desktop research: Focused on gathering information helping to understand the state of the art of  the market, the requirements and challenges faced by OESs and the experiences around the use  of cyber insurance as mitigation tool in different contexts. The knowledge base allowed the  formulation of preliminary hypotheses which were used as input to create the survey and the  interview guide.  Online survey: Consisted of obtaining data related to challenges and requirements of OESs in  acquiring cyber insurance. The survey covered over sixty questions distributed in seven  thematic blocks including: (i) information about the respondent, (ii) risk identification,  quantification and prioritization, (iii) identification and selection phase, (iv) contractual phase, (v)  coverage maintenance and support, (vi) claim procedure and (vii) skills. For a complete  overview of the survey please refer to Annex B.  Semi-structured interviews: A series of 10 interviews were conducted to investigate the  background and motivation of answers in the survey. This activity provided additional insights  into the experiences of OESs in finding acquiring and managing cyber insurance as a tool for  cyber risk mitigation. The respondent consisted of a diverse group of OESs in terms of size,  geography and sector represented.  Data analysis and validation: A final step in the approach was to conduct an analysis of the  survey and interview data. Challenges, issues and key insights derived from both the interviews  and through analysis of the dataset were captured in the report.  Policy recommendations: As a result of previous methodological steps, the analysis concludes  with a list of recommendations addressed to policymakers. These recommendations are  elaborated on the basis of evidences, findings and data gathered mostly in first half of 2022. To  this end, interested parties should keep in mind the constant and rapid evolution of the cyber  insurance market, and should therefore consider the time in which related analysis took place.  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  9  2. THE DEMAND SIDE OF  CYBER INSURANCE SECTOR  Based on the desk-research analysis5, the following aspects provide a general overview of the  cyber insurance sector. Existing literature has addressed cyber insurance from several angles,  mostly from the perspective of the cyber insurance offer-side of the market, such as insurers or  brokers.  • Cyber insurance is still in a development phase and it is challenging to capture how  expectations on coverage may change over time and how emerging threats may  change the expectations regarding coverage.  • The cyber insurance industry may expect a gradual increase in the demand for cyber  insurance and the importance of cyber coverage is expected to increase significantly  • The cyber insurance processes follow three main pillars: risk identification, risk  analysis and establishing a contract.  • The overall awareness and perceived probability of the cyber risks is high but expected  impacts of a cyber-attack may yet be underestimated.  • Lack of incident-related data is a primary obstacle to a detailed understanding of  fundamental aspects of cyber risk and to the provision of proper coverage to end  users.  • Insurers may face challenges in collecting accurate information from end-users as they  may be reluctant to provide complete answers in questionnaires or to provide access  to information related to critical assets, internal procedures and security controls.  • End-users may be concerned about possible non-disclosure or incomplete information  leading to claims being rejected. As a result, it is hard to determine how much risk to  transfer and insurers may also face risks they may not have properly quantified.  • The lack of credible data and the potential for high aggregate losses may lead to cyber  insurance policies with gaps in coverages and limits that are too low, which may lead  to a lack of indemnification for cyber losses.  • Systems change continuously as new systems are added and obsolete ones are  dismantled, leading to a continuous change of the risk profile.  • Statistics on cyber incidents are not completely reliable as victims do not always report  incidents (e.g. to avoid reputational damage)  • It can take a very long time before a breach is noticed and depending on the policy  conditions, such an event may be no longer covered.  • Guidelines for cyber insurance are available and can provide an initial framework for  end-users to approach the selection and use of cyber insurance in their respective  contexts6.  In contrast, the desk research activity did not contribute to obtain data and information related to  the demand side in cyber insurance market dynamics. Accordingly, the work presented in this  report aims at analysing cyber insurance challenges and perspectives, targeting the particular  group of entities called: operators of essential services (OESs), as defined in the NIS Directive.  The following sections discuss in detail related analysis and obtained results. The sections are a  reflect of typical cyber insurance lifecycle that includes: risk management practices (section  2.1), coverage (2.2), identification and selection of insurer (2.3), contracts (2.4), maintenance  (2.5), claim procedures (2.6) and awareness and skills (2.7)  5 A complete overview of the publications reviewed can be found in the Annex A.  6 See: Information security management — Guidelines for cyber-insurance ISO/IEC 27102:2019  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  10  2.1 RISK-MANAGEMENT PRACTICES  Cyber insurance is a strategy to reduce risk and therefore is addressed in a context of risk  management processes within an organisation. The risk management processes can also be a  pre-requisite for cyber insurance. As risk transfer is preceded by the identification and  quantification of risk exposure, it can be one option in a range of other risk management  strategies (acceptance, termination of activities or risk mitigation through process controls).  Therefore, respondents were asked about risk management processes, risk mitigation options  and the quantification of cyber risks.  Of all the respondents, over 77 % indicated that they follow a formalised process to identify  cyber risks. In contrast, the analysis also shows that 23 % are not using a formalised process or  are unsure that there is one. This gap expands when respondents were queried regarding  existing processes to make decisions on risk mitigation tools and controls. In 32 % of the cases,  a process to determine risk mitigation tools and controls is not in place.  Figure 1: Formalised process to identify cyber-risk  This observation becomes even clearer when analysing the data on risk quantification. The  results also demonstrate that only 32 % of respondents quantify cyber risk. The difference  between these numbers could be explained by respondents only applying a qualitative risk  assessment process (for the 67 % that have a formalised process to identify cyber risk).  Respondents who have cyber insurance are more likely to quantify cyber risk as well. The  research shows that 61 % of respondents with cyber insurance do, compared to the 22 % of  respondents who do not have cyber insurance.  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  11  Figure 2: Formalised process to identify cyber risk  As risk quantification is a pre-requisite for risk transfer, the relative lack of risk quantification  practices among OESs can be seen as an emergent challenge in the preliminary steps oriented  to acquiring cyber insurance services. During the interviews, some respondents indicated that  the risk quantification process was conducted by their insurance broker or agent.  All interviewed contributors indicated to have risk-management practices in place and a  process to determine controls. Most of respondents did not quantify cyber risks themselves  but worked with their broker or insurance company to quantify their exposure and determine  coverage needs. In some cases, the coverage chosen was also a trade-off between  coverage and costs, to keep the annual cyber insurance policy fee within the allowed budget.  Summing up, it can be stated that for a subset of OESs, the maturity of the risk-management  processes can be improved. The obtained data suggests that as risk-management maturity  improves, the coverage of cyber insurance will also increase. Other key findings of risk  management practices in OESs are:  • Most respondents (77 %) follow a formalized process for qualitative risks assessments  (N = 202). Additionally, 68 % follows a process for the selection of controls to mitigate  risk (N = 177).  • Among all respondents, only 32 % (N = 84) quantifies cyber risk (N = 167 does not).  • Within respondents who already have cyber insurance, 22 % of them quantify cyber  risk  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  12  2.2 CYBER INSURANCE AND OTHER COVERAGE  A key aspect of the research was to understand the cyber coverage of OESs. In addition,  coverage through other existing policies was investigated as well as the type of coverage,  missing elements and failed attempts to get cyber insurance in the past. The motivations behind  contracting cyber insurance and the major challenges were also analysed.  Current cyber coverage  The survey revealed that only 26 % of the respondents currently have cyber insurance and 74%  do not. This indicates a slightly lower coverage than the NIS investment results of 2022, which  report that 32 % of OESs/DSPs have cyber insurance (or the 30 % of OESs/DSPs with cyber  insurance in 20217). Although the reported coverage percentages from this cyber insurance  survey are slightly lower than in NIS investment reports, it does show a declining trend over the  last few years.  Figure 3: Cyber insurance uptake in OESs  From a territorial point of view, regional differences in cyber coverage appear. In western and  northern Europe the cyber coverage appears to be the highest (45 %), followed by southern  Europe (39 %) and lastly eastern Europe, with the lowest adoption of cyber insurance (12 %).  Table 1: Cyber insurance uptake across the EU  Cyber insurance Western and  northern Europe  Southern Europe Eastern Europe  No 55 % 61 % 88 %  Yes 45 % 39 % 12 %  7 NIS Investment report 2021: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/nis-investments-2021  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/nis-investments-2021  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  13  Other insurance coverage including cyber  In addition to specific cyber policies, other insurance policies might sometimes provide coverage  for cyber incidents. This could be explicitly through a cyber add-on or more implicitly by not  excluding any cyber incidents. Over half of the respondents indicated that they do not have this  coverage, but 26 % (N = 64) indicated that they have some form of cyber coverage through their  other policies.  Figure 4: Insurance, other than standalone cyber policies  What cyber insurance policies cover  The coverage of cyber insurance is quite broad and includes various damages and incidents.  Coverage ranges from (Distributed) denial of service (DDoS) attacks, malware, ransomware  attacks, stolen credentials (unauthorised access and use of data assets and computer  systems), phishing attacks, network interruption and more.  However, respondents to the interview expressed concern about the ease of renewing the  policies and exclusions, limitations, and price of the prolongations. In particular, getting  coverage for ransomware has become increasingly difficult in the last few years according to  respondents.  Not able to get cyber insurance  The survey revealed also that companies have difficulties in getting cyber insurance mainly for  three reasons:  • Coverage is not sufficient for their needs.  • Because of the way insurers assess the organisation.  • The price of the insurance policy or offer generally does not meet the expectations.  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  14  Figure 5: Reasons for not contracting cyber insurance  Reasons to purchase cyber insurance and preferred coverage  Coverage in case of incident is, for almost half of respondents, the driving reason to purchase  cyber insurance. Requirements by law (19 %), pre-incident (11 %) and post-incident (11 %)  coverage were in less degree important reasons. Respondents who did not have insurance  indicated to be interested in various types of coverage including: business continuity, expert  support during an incident and ransomware coverage.  Figure 6: Main reason to purchase cyber insurance  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  15  One of the respondents, a large OESs from western Europe, revealed that the organisation  had decided against a cyber insurance policy due to costs and limitations in available  coverage. The key decision in this case was to invest the budget in the Chief Information  Security Officer (CISO) function instead, as this was seen as more effective.  Key findings  • For 26 % of respondents, other insurance policies would provide some cover in case of  a cyber incident (N = 64). 53 % of respondents do not have this coverage (N = 131),  other 22 % do not know (N = 54).  • Only 26 % of OESs has a cyber policy (N = 67), 74 % of the respondents does not  have cyber insurance (N = 195).  • Third party liability coverage is the preferred additional coverage by the respondents  (e.g. coverage of incidents at a supplier which would interrupt business for the  insured).  • Regional differences show that western and northern Europe have the highest  coverage (45 %), followed by Southern Europe (39 %). Eastern Europe has the lowest  coverage with 12 %.  • Of all respondents 36% (N = 95) have not evaluated a cyber insurance offer before,  against 38 % (N = 100) who have and 20 % who expects this in the future.  • Both market research and the interviews indicate cyber insurance policies are  increasing in price and decrease in coverage.  • OESs increasingly looking at alternative risk mitigating strategies (e.g. risk  treatment/risk reduction).  • 56 % of respondents stated they consider other risk mitigations tools to be more  effective compared to cyber insurance (N = 147).  • Some respondents indicated to consider discontinuing current cyber insurance if  pricing keeps on increasing.  • Combined data from this study and previous NIS Investment data shows a declining  cyber insurance coverage trend.  2.3 IDENTIFICATION AND SELECTION OF CYBER INSURER  This section describes aspects related to the identification and selection phase of a cyber  insurer as part of a cyber insurance contracting process. Similarly, the section addresses the  perception of OESs to the acceptance by the insurance company.  Orientation, identification, and selection  The data shows that 26 % of the respondents (N = 67) currently have cyber insurance and 74 %  do not. However, 37 % of the respondents (N = 97) confirms that they have identified cyber  insurance as a risk mitigation tool and 20 % states that they are considering acquiring it within  one year (N = 28) or after two years (N = 25).  It is important to highlight that 56 % of the respondents (N = 157) reports that ‘other risk  mitigation tools were considered more adequate’. This topic has been discussed in detail with  the OESs during the interviews and the reason for this response it is often linked to the high  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  16  prices of available coverages. This trend explains why other mitigation strategies (like  investment in cyber controls) are becoming a more feasible investment for some OESs.  Figure 7: Support during initial steps of cyber insurance  With reference to the selection process, most of the OESs that have insurance have pointed out  that they rely on the insurance broker or on the insurance company to identify the right cyber  insurance. In contrast, when asking the same question to OESs that have not yet acquired  cyber insurance (out of 169 respondents), 57 % would rely on the insurance broker or on the  insurance company and 24 % would rely on the regulator / public body.  Still on the selection process, out of 232 respondents, 54 % confirms knowing about cyber  insurance offers through own research, 27 % have been contacted by an agent or a broker and  10 % have relied on other resources (e.g., information from other internal organisation  departments, parent companies, shareholders). Finally, only 13 out of 232 OESs declare that  they have acquired knowledge about cyber insurance offers through interactions with other  OESs.  When asked about the selection criteria for acquiring cyber insurance, 174 respondents have  provided the answers as shown in Figure 8.  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  17  Figure 8: Selection criteria for acquiring cyber insurance  It can be noted that ‘price’ appears on its own or in combination with other criteria in every  possible combination. Therefore, price emerges as the most important criterion for acquiring  cyber insurance. Immediately after the price, other criteria conditioning cyber insurance  acquisition are:  • reputation of the insurance company,  • coverage,  • specific clauses,  • support.  Finally, out of 64 OESs entities that have cyber insurance, only 16 % of them declare that they  are not satisfied with their insurance regarding their risk exposure, while the rest of them declare  that they are satisfied (69 %) or very satisfied (16 %).  Many of the respondents indicated they worked with their broker to identify cyber insurance  options. One respondent with a sizable insurance team indicated that the initiative came  from their insurance responsible – later supported by the insurance broker.  Assessment and acceptance by the insurance company  On the matter of the intake assessment, the OESs have been asked to provide an answer  based on the elements that apply to the procedure they have undergone. Their answers are  shown in Table 2.  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  18  Table 2: Intake assessment conducted by insurers  How did the insurance company conduct the intake assessment?

Also, third-party8 assessments are among the assessments’ methods, but  they don’t happen very often.  On the duration of the assessment, only 18 out of 61 respondents have reported that they  consider it too long, while the vast majority (70 %) answered that the length of the assessment  was ‘about right’ (N = 39) or ‘short’ (N = 4). In respect of the effort required during the  assessment, 60 OESs have replied as follows:  Figure 9: Effort required during the assessment  Finally, on the matter of legal limitations (e.g. classified or internal documentation) potentially  encountered during the assessment phase, the respondents reported that they had no  limitations and, if existing, they could be adjusted to allow information sharing. Only one  respondent out of 60 reported that these legal limitations couldn’t be adjusted. It has to be noted  that in 7 % of the cases (N = 4), legal limitations led to a rejection or modification of the offer by  the insurer.  8 In line with the ENISA report: ‘Cyber Insurance: Recent Advances, Good Practices and Challenges’, third party risks are  risks that might initially affect someone other than the insured (first party) or insurer (second party), against which an  insured would like to have coverage.  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  19  On the interviews several respondents indicated that time and effort to renew insurance  was getting longer and more effort-intensive, especially in the last couple of years.  Key findings  • One in four OESs currently have cyber insurance in place. Moreover, 37 % of the  respondents (N = 97) confirms that they have identified cyber insurance as a risk  mitigation tool and 20 % state that they are considering acquiring cyber insurance  within one year (N=28) or after two years (N = 25).  • Half of OESs confirms knowing about cyber insurance offers through own research, 27  % have been contacted by an agent or a broker and 10% have relied on other  resources. Only 13 of OES declare that they have acquired knowledge about cyber  insurance offers through interactions with other OESs.  • Within the criteria for acquiring cyber insurance, price appears to be the most  important, followed by: reputation of the insurance company, coverage, specific  clauses and support.  • Legal limitations at the time of sharing information with the broker do not normally  trigger a problem. Yet, in 7 % of the cases, legal limitations led to a rejection or  modification of the offer by the insurer.  2.4 CONTRACT AND PROCESS  For 13 % of respondents, Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) or security team is  responsible for procuring cyber insurance. The respondents who have cyber insurance are  slightly more likely to have a dedicated insurance team involved in the procurement of cyber  insurance. As shown in Table 3, in most of cases decision making regarding acquisition of  insurance takes place outside the CISO function. Decisions regarding cyber insurance are more  often taken by executives, a dedicated insurance team or the finance function.  Table 3: Responsible for cyber insurance in OESs  In case insurance coverage is identified as a mitigation measure,  who is responsible for procuring cyber insurance in your  organisation?  Total  No response 19  CFO or financial team 37  CISO or security team 34  Dedicated insurance manager or team 67  Executive manager 66  Other, please specify 39  Grand total (N) 262  For 39 % of the overall experiences show that the contract was not negotiable and based on  standard templates, while most of the experiences show that the contract could be at least  partially negotiable if not completely negotiable.  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  20  Figure 10: Cyber insurance contracts according to organisational needs  The data regarding the existence of certifications (e.g. ISO 27001) and their impact on the  contractual agreement show that in 77 % of the cases this element led to the easing of the  acceptance by the insurance company. Out of 40 OESs, 5 reported that the existence of  certifications led to the reduction of the price and 4 declared that owning these features had an  impact on the coverage limits. Still on the matter of coverage, only 7 OESs out of 58 reported  that the assessment conducted by the insurer led to exclusions and sub-limits, while 44 %  responded that no limitations were introduced.  With reference to the information received when purchasing cyber insurance, out of 60  respondents, 57 % reported that they have received clear information about any embedded  exclusions and limitations of the coverage, including the cases of systemic events.  At the same time, only 32% of the OESs (N = 19) have confirmed that they have been  presented with a list of examples of events that are excluded from the coverage. It should be  noted that in the same two questions, almost one third of the participants replied that they do  not know whether they have received clear information and a list of exclusions.  An insurance manager expressed his concerns about how to interpret certain clauses of  the cyber insurance contract. He mentioned the lack of standardisation in the clauses and  the lack of available precedents to understand how clauses would be explained in a loss  scenario.  Key findings  • Decision making regarding acquisition of insurance, in most of cases, takes place  outside the CISO function (only in 12 % of OESs).  • Only 3 % of OESs (2 out of 62) stated the contract and its annexes to be unclear.  • Of respondents with cyber insurance, 63 % of respondents found the contract clauses  clear or somewhat clear.  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  21  • On the negotiability of the contract, 61 % was partially or completely negotiable (N =  61).  • A 57 % of OESs reported to have received clear information about any embedded  exclusions and limitations of the cyber insurance coverage, including the cases of a  systemic events.  2.5 MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT  When exploring the area regarding additional features or services embedded in the  cybersecurity insurance acquired by the OESs, it can be noted that:  • 40 % of respondents (24 out of 60) declared that their insurance company provide  support in prevention of cyber incidents;  • 68 % of respondents (40 out of 59) declared that their insurance company provide  post-incident cyber support.  The question related to importance of ‘prevention support’ services has also been asked to the  participants. Cyber insurance support appears to be not relevant for 18 % of OESs and relevant  for the 32 %. Only 20 % of OESs consider it as extremely necessary.  Figure 11: Relevance of cyber insurance  In contrast, the insured OESs have been asked if a cyber incident has led to an increase of  costs or denial of coverage. In this case only 10 % of the respondents has confirmed this  possibility, while 50 % has declared that they haven’t observed any incident. The rest of the  respondents were equally divided between ‘no’ and ‘does not know’.  A few respondents mentioned cyber-incident response to be a very valuable service.  However, in many cases an existing relationship with a cyber-incident response party is  already in place, making the insurance company a less likely candidate to offer this service.  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  22  Key findings:  • For OESs, post-incident response services provided by cyber insurers are more  prominent that pre-incident response services.  • For 20 % of non-insured OESs, maintenance and support from a cyber insurer provider  would be extremely necessary.  • Half of insured OESs have not witnessed any cyber-incident, therefore they cannot  assess how the increase of cyber insurance costs could be related  2.6 CLAIM PROCEDURE  The final section of the survey, dedicated to the gathering of data about the experiences of  OESs that have acquired cyber insurance, has been focused on the ‘claim procedure’.  To the question: has your organisation issued a claim with a cyber insurer? Almost 3 in four  OESs (44 out of 60), have never issued a claim.  Likewise, 13 % of the respondents (8 out of  60) have issued a claim and 13 % do not know.  Figure 12: Issuing a claim  Operators of essential services were also asked if they have ever issued a cyber claim with their  insurer on a non-cyber policy.  In this case 7 out of 8 responded that they have never done it, 1  did not know.  Determining the claim and proving all supporting evidence can be quite a complex step in  the process. A respondent indicated that they hired a claims adjustment consultant due to  the complexity of the case.  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  23  Key findings  • 13 % of the respondents (8 out of 60) have issued a claim with their cyber insurer.  • Of the 8 respondents, 6 confirmed their claim was approved and 2 confirmed that the  reimbursement was enough to cover the actual damage.  • 3 out of 6 respondents also confirmed that the claim was processed in a timely manner  (only 2 responded that it was not).  • On the clarity of the methodology for calculating the amount of the claim, 3 out of 6  confirmed that the methodology was clear (only 2 responded that it was not).  • Out of the 6 respondents, 5 reported that the claim did not lead to any legal dispute  with the insurer, 1 did not know.  2.7 AWARENESS AND SKILLS  To increase awareness about cyber insurance, the top responses (in order of priority) were  communication and dissemination, better coverage, ad-hoc collaborative networks and peer- learning. Interestingly, better coverage was mentioned, which could indicate that cyber  insurance is perceived as a mitigation strategy with limited scope for the risk itself. Some  respondents mentioned that they do not regard cyber insurance as a viable risk mitigation  strategy at all. Informal learning and recommendations were suggested as a good way to  improve strategy. Options mentioned less often were public support and research and scientific  evidence.  To increase the purchase of cyber insurance, the top responses (in order of priority) were:  • better coverages,  • less exclusions,  • clearer policy wording,  • communication and dissemination.  These responses would be understood in line with higher expectations from organisations  according to the offered cyber insurance services. This finding is coherent with outcomes of  interviews where interviewees expressed their decreasing appetite for cyber insurance as a  strategy to reduce risk.  In the interviews, interviewees expressed that cyber insurance policy fees have gone up  significantly in recent years, while at the same time the policy terms have become less attractive  (exclusions, sub-limits, etc.). The decreasing attractiveness of cyber insurance due to price and  coverage was a recurring theme during the interviews. Investments in cyber controls (risk  treatment instead of transfer) were generally seen as more effective in mitigating cyber risk.  Lastly, respondents were asked to indicate the relevant skills they believed to be necessary  when purchasing cyber insurance. The top skills mentioned (in order) were risk assessment  skills, knowledge about legislation, information management and functioning of the insurance  market. As risk-management skills were indicated as the primary skill, it is notable to mention  the maturity gap described in section 2.1 on risk-management practices.  Several respondents indicated that it was unclear how premiums are being calculated.  They asked for more transparency – so as to be able to see the risk models - so to be able  to make a better weighted decision on the level of coverage to buy. One respondent also  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  24  argued that it was unclear how investment in cyber controls would contribute to lower  premiums (creating a better foundation for a business case).  Key findings  • Communication and dissemination, better coverage, ad-hoc collaborative networks and  peer-learning are prominent areas to raise awareness on cyber insurance relevance.  • In the opinion of OESs, key aspects oriented to increase purchase of cyber insurance  are:  better coverages, less exclusions, clearer policy wording, communication and  dissemination.  • From an awareness perspective, most of interviewees realised how cyber insurance  policy fees have gone up significantly in recent years, while policy terms have become  less attractive.  • In terms of skills, the top ones mentioned as relevant for cyber insurance sector are:  risk assessment, knowledge about legislation, information management and  functioning of the insurance market.  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  25  Table 4: Summary of key findings  Risk management practices Coverage Identification and selection of cyber insurer  Most respondents (77 %) follow  a formalized process for  qualitative risks assessments (N  = 202). Additionally, 68 %  follows a process for the  selection of controls to mitigate  risk (N = 177).  Among all respondents, only 32  % (N = 84) quantifies cyber risk  (N = 167 does not).  Within respondents who already  have cyber insurance, 22 % of  them quantify cyber risk  For 26 % of respondents, other insurance policies would provide some cover in case  of a cyber incident (N = 64). 53 % of respondents do not have this coverage (N =  131), other 22 % do not know (N = 54).  Only 26 % of OESs has a cyber policy (N = 67), 74 % of the respondents does not  have cyber insurance (N = 195).  Third-party liability coverage is the preferred additional coverage by the respondents  (e.g. coverage of incidents at a supplier which would interrupt business for the  insured).  Regional differences show that western and northern Europe have the highest  coverage (45 %), followed by southern Europe (39 %). Eastern Europe has the  lowest coverage with 12 %.  Of all respondents 36 % (N = 95) have not evaluated a cyber insurance offer before,  against 38 % (N = 100) who have and 20 % who expects this in the future.  Both market research and the interviews indicate cyber insurance policies are  increasing in price and decrease in coverage.  OESs increasingly looking at alternative risk mitigating strategies (e.g. risk  treatment/risk reduction).  56 % of respondents stated they consider other risk mitigations tools to be more  effective compared to cyber insurance (N = 147).  Some respondents indicated to consider discontinuing current cyber insurance if  pricing keeps on increasing.  Combined data from this study and previous NIS Investment data shows a declining  cyber insurance coverage trend.  One in four OESs currently have cyber  insurance in place. Moreover, 37 % of the  respondents (N = 97) confirms that they have  identified cyber insurance as a risk mitigation  tool and 20 % state that they are considering  acquiring cyber insurance within one year (N =  28) or after two years (N = 25).  Half of OESs confirms knowing about cyber  insurance offers through own research, 27 %  have been contacted by an agent or a broker  and 10 % have relied on other resources. Only  13 of OESs declare that they have acquired  knowledge about cyber insurance offers  through interactions with other OESs.  Within the criteria for acquiring cyber  insurance, price appears to be the most  important, followed by: reputation of the  insurance company, coverage, specific  clauses and support.  Legal limitations at the time of sharing  information with the broker do not normally  trigger a problem. Yet, in 7 % of the cases,  legal limitations led to a rejection or  modification of the offer by the insurer.  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  26  Contracts and process Maintenance and support Claim procedures Awareness and skills  Decision making regarding acquisition of  insurance, in most of cases, takes place  outside the CISO function (only in 12 %  of OESs).  Only 3 % of OESs (2 out of 62) stated the  contract and its annexes to be unclear.  Of respondents with cyber insurance, 63  % of respondents found the contract  clauses clear or somewhat clear.  On the negotiability of the contract, 61 %  was partially or completely negotiable (N  = 61).  A 57 % of OESs reported to have  received clear information about any  embedded exclusions and limitations of  the cyber insurance coverage, including  the cases of a systemic events.  For OESs, post-incident  response services provided by  cyber insurers are more  prominent that pre-incident  response services.  For 20 % of non-insured  OESs, maintenance and  support from a cyber insurer  provider would be extremely  necessary.  Half of insured OESs have not  witnessed any cyber-incident,  therefore they cannot assess  how the increase of cyber  insurance costs could be  related  13 % of the respondents (8 out of 60) have  issued a claim with their cyber insurer;  Of the 8 respondents, 6 confirmed their  claim was approved and 2 confirmed that  the reimbursement was enough for  covering the actual damage;  3 out of 6 respondents also confirmed that  the claim was processed in a timely  manner (only 2 responded that it was not)  On the clarity of the methodology for  calculating the amount of the claim, 3 out  of 6 confirmed that the methodology was  clear (only 2 responded that it was not);  Out of the 6 respondents, 5 reported that  the claim did not lead to any legal dispute  with the insurer, 1 did not know.  Communication and dissemination, better  coverage, ad-hoc collaborative networks and  peer-learning are prominent areas to raise  awareness on cyber insurance relevance.  In the opinion of OESs, key aspects oriented  to increase purchase of cyber insurance are:  better coverages, less exclusions, clearer  policy wording, communication and  dissemination.  From an awareness perspective, most of  interviewees realised how cyber insurance  policy fees have gone up significantly in  recent years, while policy terms have become  less attractive.  In terms of skills, the top ones mentioned as  relevant for cyber insurance sector are:  risk  assessment, knowledge about legislation,  information management and functioning of  the insurance market.  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  27  3. RECOMMENDATIONS  The following recommendations are provided aiming to mitigate challenges faced by OESs  when addressing cyber security. The following set of recommendations are addressed primarily  to policymakers and OESs in the EU and its Member States, dealing cyber insurance policy.  Recommendations to policymakers  • Implement guidance mechanisms aiming at improving maturity of risk  management practices of OESs. Specific areas where guidance would be more  helpful are: identification of assets, monitoring key metrics, frameworks for risk  assessment and quantification, security controls identification and quantification of  risks.  • Promote the creation of frameworks oriented to identify and exchange good  practices among OESs, particularly those related to identification, mitigation and  quantification of risk exposure. Also, facilitate exchange of experiences among  OESs related to contracting and implementing cyber insurance in different  contexts.  • Be aware of the heterogeneity of OESs in terms of size, economic sector and  strategic function. Formulation of policy action should be coherent with specific  needs and challenges of OESs as a whole, without losing sight of differences  among them, e.g., small entities vs large operators.  • The study shows that OESs tend to prefer self-investment to risk transfer if prices  of cyber insurance are high. Policymakers should address the feasibility of more  economically sustainable cyber insurance policies by working closer to brokers.  • Address the link between the cyber-insurance and cyber security by making sure  that procurement of products, services and processes certified in the European  Union – or that have obtained a label associated with those schemes - obtain a  higher score in the intake assessment performed by the insurance companies.  • Foster initiatives, including standardization and guidance development, to provide  elements and assessment methodologies on the quantification of cyber risks,  circumstance that would also improve the awareness and decision-making on  specific areas in which cyber insurance would be the optimal mitigation tool.  • Steer multi-stakeholder dialogues oriented to improving clarity, understandability  and comparability of policies by fostering the development of terminology of  reference (taxonomy) for cyber insurance.  • Develop collaborative frameworks with public and private partners to enable skills  frameworks and programmes for cyber insurance, particularly in areas such as  risk assessment, legal aspects, information management and cyber insurance  market dynamics.  DEMAND SIDE OF CYBER INSURANCE IN THE EU  Analysis of Challenges and Perspectives of OESs  February 2023  28  Recommendations to OESs  • Improve maturity of risk management practices. The risk management practices  related to identification, mitigation and quantification of risk exposure would  contribute to clarify cyber insurance needs.  • Consider to allocate or increase budgetary provisions to implementing processes  related to identification of assets, monitor key metrics, conduct periodic risk  assessments, security controls identification and quantification of risks based on  industry best practices.  • Improve knowledge transfer and sharing with other OESs allowing to learn from  other good practices when contracting and implementing cyber insurance to the  benefit of these operators. Also improve incident data sharing among sectors.  • Improve coverage all over digital supply chains, specifically covering 3rd party  liability managed service providers. As supply chain are digitally connected,  coverage for only a participant in the entire chain might not reduce risks  sufficiently.

ENISA Permanent Stakeholder Group: Key Topics for Future Work Programmes 29  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  05  Executive Summary  The time has come for ENISA to take a look at the crystal ball of technology; In particular looking at what  are considered to be emerging technologies and what might be their prospective usage scenarios.  Considering emerging technologies and applications is an important step in assessing future security  needs.  ENISA has performed this effort in collaboration with external experts from academia and industry.  Starting with a small number of individuals, it is planned to expand this assessment by engaging additional  experts, both within and outside ENISA committees and bodies. For the time being, the initial sight to  emerging technologies has shown that currently top technological challenges are:   The Internet of Things,   Autonomous systems,   Next generation virtualized infrastructures (including SDN and 5G),   Upcoming societal challenges,   Virtual and Augmented reality,   The Internet of Bio-Nano Things,   AI and Robotics.  Knowing that the above list is not exhaustive, ENISA will continue the dialogue with experts to  complement it. For the above emerging technology areas both technological and cyber-security challenges  are presented in this report.  By taking into account the emerging security challenges, the most important cyber security areas have  been identified by means of “emerging security related areas”. These are:   Elaboration on Certification,   Coordination of actions in cyber space,   Development of trustworthiness,   Coverage of complete lifecycle,   The future of cryptography,   Future Identification technologies,   Use of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in cyber security,   Increasing end-user involvement.  ENISA believes that these cyber security areas will present challenges to the cyber security community in  the years to come and hopes that they will be extensively discussed within its stakeholder communities.  Last but not least, in this work input that has been received by the ENISA Permanent Stakeholder Group  (PSG) is being mentioned. In a similar manner, input will be integrated through an interaction with the new  PSG that will have its kick-off end of October 2017. In this manner, both previous and new contributions  from PSG will be put in the context of the areas presented in this report, widening thus significantly the  number of contributors.  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  06  1. Introduction  This paper is the initial documentation of an attempt to assess upcoming technology and the associated  security challenges. This will be achieved through interaction with security experts from various sectors  such as industry, academia, public sector, etc.  This idea is not new: within ENISA, the consideration of future technological challenges is part of the  internal planning and knowledge management process. It allows to develop proposals, channel knowledge  development and set work priorities. In the realm of ENISA projects, various external experts participate in  achieving this objective, for example by contributing to the corresponding activities (e.g. conclusions  drawn in projects, providing advice, supporting studies, stock-takings, surveys, etc.). Finally, the Permanent  Stakeholder Group1 (PSG) is established in order to channel information and ideas on new developments  into the ENISA planning process.  Yet, with this effort the prediction of future challenges is being brought on a broader and yet more focused  basis: ENISA initiated a dedicated dialogue with representatives of stakeholder groups to brainstorm about  emerging technological and security challenges and consolidates discussions/ideas/experiences in form of  this paper. The time horizon covered by the covered technology areas varies and covers developments  that are ca. 1 to 5 years ahead of our time. Aim of this approach is to create an initial nucleus of material  with relatively low resource investment, by collecting input from various key stakeholders. At the initial  phases of this report, a collection within technology oriented stakeholders in the area of  Information/Cyber Security has been performed. After an assessment of the achieved results, this activity  may be put on a wider basis, both regarding the involved skills and number of contributing stakeholders.  The process behind this work has a second objective: through the interaction with various stakeholders,  ENISA gets an insight on complementary, mutually enforcing interests and ideas of those stakeholders. To  this extent, ENISA will play the role of mediator to achieve mutual fertilization of ideas that might lead to  advancement of security practices/products/operation among these stakeholders. At the same time,  results from activities of these stakeholders may flow into the work of others, including ENISA’s  deliverables and will be disseminated to the public.  1 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/psg, accessed June 2017.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/psg  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  07  2. Process and Content  Process  In order to proceed with this work, the following process has been defined:   An ongoing information collection is established within ENISA. This is based mainly on open source and  covers various areas of security, technology and policy developments. Moreover, this information  contains also input from interactions of ENISA management team with key stakeholders.   Available material from previous stakeholder interactions (e.g. previous ENISA Permanent Stakeholder  Group -PSG) has been taken into account.   Within the ENISA annual work programme delivery process, open points, future requirements and  gaps in the area of security and emerging technologies are being identified. This material is subject to  discussions, both internally and with contributing stakeholders.   Guidance and brainstorming is being performed within various ENISA bodies, particularly in the ENISA  PSG. This information flows in prospective versions of work programmes and is being taken up within  internal and external projects/activities.   Interested key contacts of ENISA (e.g. PSG-experts, other experts engaged within ENISA projects,  academic organisations working together with ENISA) are enrolled in a brainstorming dialogue relating  to emerging technology and security issues.   All this information is consolidated internally and has been used as input to this paper.   This initial draft will be put to the attention of a wider group of stakeholders/experts for wider  consultations. ENISA will ask for contributions the members of the newly appointed Permanent  Stakeholder Group during its constitutional meeting end October 2017.  Content  The content of this paper is oriented towards groups of issues/topics/aspects that share some common  characteristics. Examples are: same technology sector, same business area, same policy context and scope,  etc. Knowing that it is impossible to be free of overlaps, the different topics presented may have  commonalities both regarding technological but also security issues.  In the following we present different prevailing views on technological topics and – when appropriate – we  draw possible consequences for cyber security.  In case actions have been identified that relate to some existing ENISA work programme topics, these will  be indicatively mentioned. The same holds true in case identified topics map to non-confidential activities  of the stakeholders involved in the brainstorming. Such topics are good candidates for the initiation of  cross-stakeholder interactions based on topics of common interest.  Finally, for the sake of completeness, we provide a list with topics addressed in the performed  brainstorming per organisation. This material serves as a reminder for the list of topics discussed and the  sequence bellow does not indicate any prioritization.  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  08  3. Consolidation of collected ideas: Emerging Technology Areas  This chapter contains all evolving technology areas that are considered to bring cyber-security challenges.  This assessment is based on discussions, presentations and information collection that has been  performed over the previous year. It is taken as given, that these technology areas will present challenges  to the cyber security community for the years to come.  Internet of Things  3.1.1 Technological Challenges  The Internet of Things (IoT) has been considered as an emerging technology area due to its potential in  affecting human lives and to lead to digital transformation through new products. Even though this  technology is available for some years now and as such not new, experts believe that its potential is by far  not yet exhausted and brings a lot of technological challenges.  The challenges related to Internet of Things (IoT) are known and understood in the (security) community.  IoT plays an important role in life, as it serves/manages various areas of consumer environments. Hence,  from the market point of view IoT:   Is the new context for delivering hardware, software and services to consumers;   Creates a lot of re-usable data helping the development of new products;   Allows for penetrating2 – hence marketing - private life and private sphere of users;   Allows for a flexible development of environments, while enabling customer binding;   Constitutes the next level of convergence of various infrastructures, data and services.  These facts make clear why information about IoT deployment/usage will be a very desirable piece of  information for a variety of market, government, national security, but also malicious actors.  Addressing security in IoT is difficult: cheap, mass production devices are launched with weak security due  to cost issues. Moreover, as they are of generic purpose, it is difficult to foresee the area of application,  thus take care of protection requirements during fabrication. Nonetheless, when bundled into  bigger/constellations they might be part of a complex infrastructure processing significant amounts of data  of that pose strong confidentiality, integrity and availability requirements.  Another challenge is the computing power that is inherently available in interconnected devices. This  computing power can be misused when entire or parts of an IoT network is being taken over by malicious  agents. The Mirai4 botnet has demonstrated the intensity an orchestrated attack from large numbers of  devices may have (see also next section).  It is interesting to see that in the Gartner Hype Cycle 20163, IoT is considered as being still in the innovation  trigger phase (i.e. early phase). Hence, there is significant time for action in the IoT till market  maturity/productivity.  2 The penetration of IoT in every day’s life becomes more and more evident, eventually with corresponding market  growth.  3 http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3412017, accessed June 2017.  http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3412017  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  09  All in all, the challenge with IoT environments and devices alike will be to maintain the balance between  low cost (i.e. the driver for IoT adoption), short time to market and security (i.e. the enabler of  trustworthiness). If this balance is lost, there is a risk for market failure of IoT applications.  3.1.2 Security Challenges of IoT  IoT will be an opportunity for cyber-crime monetization activities. Equivalently, IoT will be in the focus of  national security and espionage, both state and corporations sponsored. Moreover, data on user  behaviour will be the future marketing instrument.  Having said that, one can easily assess the areas of misuse of this information and the corresponding  threat exposure (list indicative, non-exhaustive):   Data and available functions from IoT applications may be misused within cyber-threats such as  phishing, ransomware, cyber-espionage, data breaches, identity theft, etc4.   Ill-secured devices can be hijacked and misused in various attack scenarios, e.g. Botnets, Denial of  Service, spam, etc.   Available ill-protected interfaces and processes owned by service providers may be misused to  penetrate their systems. Moreover, the absence of product life-cycle functions (e.g. updates) makes  the elimination of vulnerabilities impossible.   Available functions, processes and data can be misused with the aim of illicit profit.   Companies may be interested in data, practices and functions available to spy on their competitors.   Home appliances of single households or group of those can be misused by activists, terrorists, cyber- warriors, etc. to cause harm to entire areas.  Given the intimate but also existential nature of IoT applications (media consumption, life habits, private  environment, e-health, assisted living, etc.) confidentiality, integrity and availability requirements will be  high. It will be necessary to develop products to protect such environments.  Instead of “micro” - protecting each element in an IoT environment, a focus on protecting architecture  components may be more appropriate. The utilization of existing/well known/efficiently manageable  security controls may provide a good protection if applied properly at the right level of the IoT  architecture. Current discussion shows that IoT needs a lot of work to mature, both regarding architectures  and services. The Mirai4 botnet, for example, that is taken predominantly as THE example of an IoT misuse,  was actually abusing internet routers. Nonetheless, such components have never been considered to be  part of IoT infrastructures.  Estimated timescale for rollout5: 2 to 5 years  Takeaways IoT   IoT platform is in early development phases.   5G and virtualization will enhance the device-to-device interactions (M2M).   IoT protection as a whole will be difficult. Application/sector oriented solutions are more feasible.   IoT will enlarge attack surface by means of novel abuse scenarios.   Existing security protection controls will need to be considered for IoT scenarios.  4 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirai_(malware), accessed June 2017.  5 http://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/top-trends-in-the-gartner-hype-cycle-for-emerging-technologies- 2017/, accessed September 2017.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirai_(malware) http://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/top-trends-in-the-gartner-hype-cycle-for-emerging-technologies-2017/ http://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/top-trends-in-the-gartner-hype-cycle-for-emerging-technologies-2017/  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  10   Although processed data may be volatile and of low value, data protection will be necessary in order to  maintain privacy.  The interplay between Technology Use and Societal Challenges  3.2.1 Technological and Societal challenges  Though not a technology area per se, societal changes play an important role in technology adoption:  firstly they affect the creation of new products. Secondly, they play an important role on how existing  products are being used. In both cases, societal challenges affect technology deployment and  security/privacy issues. As such, they have been considered in our brainstorming sessions as an area that is  setting up context of technology use. This is the main reason for considering societal changes this chapter.  Societal changes with regard to digitization are undoubtedly a significant phenomenon in society.  Understanding those changes helps identifying behaviour and habits of end users – that is - deriving  various usage scenarios. This, in turn, provides important incentives for protection requirements of end- users.  A noticeable shift has happened in the way media are consumed: while the average age of traditional TV  viewers is growing, younger generations go away from TV watching6. At the same time, use of video on  demand is mostly used by younger users7. Similarly, technology has played and still plays an important role  in changes of social behaviour of younger generations, in particular regarding their communication,  interaction, media consumption and socialization habits.  Complex behaviour of users can also be assessed in the areas of socializing by using messaging services,  social networks and sharing of life-logging information and qualified self8. Many of those trends are in  partial contradiction with the use of well formulated human rights regarding the need of privacy. For  example, some users may publicise information about themselves that the government treats as  confidential personal data.  Moreover, modern considerations of the digital divide show that there is a difference in technology usage  between (socially) advanced and disadvantaged individuals. These differences are reflected in the way they  are using online services9.  It is impossible to talk and act in the area of technology and technological platforms without fully  understanding end-user behaviour. This will lead to failure of any technical measure, including cyber- security.  3.2.2 Security challenges emerging from Societal Changes  Challenges to cyber-security from societal changes in the user community are quite big. This is mainly due  to the fact that there is a need to better understand the motives, habits and psychology of end-users,  knowingly the weakest link in cyber-security.  Assessments show that a better security awareness from end-users may reduce over 50% of the current  security incidents that are reportedly based on human error39,40. This is indicative for the importance of  6 http://www.marketingcharts.com/television/are-young-people-watching-less-tv-24817/  7 https://digiday.com/media/demographics-youtube-5-charts/  8 http://aias.au.dk/events/the-quantified-self/  9 https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/new-digital-divide-emilio-mordini?trk=prof-post  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  11  such measures, though their spread is far beyond average throughout all age categories. This has been well  understood in the security community: important awareness campaigns currently launched take into  account such facts.  From user behaviour, cyber-security may draw important conclusions regarding (list in indicative, non- exhaustive):   Weaknesses caused by behavioural patterns;   Weaknesses caused by usage scenarios;   Threats exposure due to weaknesses;   Misuse scenarios;   Identification/assessment of important user assets;   Elaboration on security controls that can be managed by non-experts;   Awareness raising and training matters including differentiation according to age of target groups.   Balance/orchestration of societal needs, educational methods and user behavioural patterns.   Elaboration on potential courses of action to achieve this balance (including regulation, user liability  etc.).  Estimated timescale for addressing: 2 to 5 years  Takeaways Societal Changes   User behaviour needs to be better studied and understood   User habits have to be taken into account in cyber-security   With implementation of basic security controls, significant mitigation of risk can be achieved  Next Generation IT infrastructure  3.3.1 Technological Challenges  In many areas of IT we see currently the creation of next generation IT-Infrastructures. Main characteristics  of this evolution is the increased deployment of virtualization, meshed environments/applications, multi- tenant capabilities, provision of customization and management capabilities, just to mention a few. In  those systems, end-to-end offerings are being considered, where the operation can be managed remotely,  without the need to maintain any own infrastructure locally.  These trends pose significant technological, operational and economic challenges. Based on these trends,  for example, many end-to-end services will need to be re-defined and re-commissioned.  Though being positive from the user’s point of view, this trend will create a big re-shuffling of current  market equilibria: big vendors will be in the position to displace or take over competitors whose offerings  will become transparent for end-customers. By means of market competition, however, this trend may  lead to concentration of market power to a few giants. Such an oligopoly may influence end-user flexibility  regarding their needs, costs and security with regard to the offered services.  New generation IT Infrastructures implement multi-layer architectures that neutralise from the  peculiarities of individual hardware and low level functional dependencies. While the configuration and  management of these systems is being performed at the application level, inherent dependencies with the  heterogeneous subsystems (hard- and software) pose technical, operational and security challenges.  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  12  3.3.2 Security challenges next gen IT  Multi-layered, virtualized architectures have the advantage of abstracting from peculiarities of sub- systems. Multiple systems may be independently defined on a common hard- and software platform and  then be managed by means of a hypervisor.  Next generation systems are delivering thus a more  comprehensive and coherent view to the operators and to the end-users. The implementation of such  functions, however, needs to support translation of user actions over various logical and system layers into  the particular system-specifics of underlying components.  This kind of back-and-forward translation and execution bears security risks, in particular if the short  innovation cycles of underlying (hardware) systems is taken into account. It is worth mentioning, that most  popular next generation infrastructures in the context of this discussion are software defined networks  and 5G.  These risks may be related to eventual weaknesses of sub-systems, errors in configuration, versioning,  incompatibility, security gaps, etc. Moreover, the impact from materialization of such risks may be big, as it  may affect operations of multiple tenants using the system.  The large number of users/tenants using the service is a motive for adversaries to target those platforms: if  such a service can be compromised, access to a large amount of data can be obtained. Obviously, the  manipulation options from such a breach may be quite broad. In general, next gen IT infrastructures will  bring many security challenges, indicatively:   Multiple options of weakness/vulnerability hunting due to big number of heterogeneous components;   Efficient abuse of weaknesses/vulnerabilities due to multiple logical and physical layers;   Multiple monetization opportunities through large number of services offered and users;   Multiple attack scenarios due to various technical, procedural and business workflows implemented on  these platforms;   Multiple abuse cases due to various involved management/administrative roles involved (esp. insider  abuse);   Inefficient cross-layer implementation of security measures introducing protection gaps;   Too many ways to circumvent existing security controls by abusing multi-layered architectures.  Estimated timescale for rollout5: 5 to 10 years  Takeaways next gen IT-infrastructures   Traditionally, security abuse takes place between system layers. Next gen IT encompasses a lot of  layers and components which increase abuse cases.   Just as with cloud infrastructures, next gen IT will be an attractive target due to the large volume of  information that can be breached.   Flaws of components involved in virtualized infrastructures may affect confidentiality and integrity of  data.   New ways to understand the interplay and architectural requirements of new virtualized  infrastructures; establishment of security protection in accordance.  Virtual and Augmented reality / Gamification  Generally speaking, virtual reality and gamification technologies are used when decoupling a process from  its physical pedant is desirable. This technology allows simulation of catastrophic events without actually  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  13  experiencing them. Simulation is very common in training when the trainee wants to obtain skills for  professions which – when performed in real life – may bear significant risks. Examples can be found in  medicine, aerospace, underwater, military, etc. As far as the decoupling between the cyber and physical  spaces are maintained, the relevance of virtual reality and gamification to cyber security is rather low. This  will change, when the virtual and physical words start getting connected. Nonetheless, virtual reality and  gamification has significant relevance to privacy.  3.4.1 Technological Challenges  Virtual and augmented reality (VAR) is a technology area that has made significant improvements towards  going to production phases3,10. Depending on the sector/domain in which virtual and augmented  technology is being used, it may be quite intrusive and/or crucial for human activities, especially when  used in sectors like medicine, military, aviation, space, etc.  Virtual and augmented reality is being used within gamification by means of games, both serious and for  fun. As such, it is being utilized by a very wide user community in a wide spectrum of applications. Current  challenges regarding this technology are related to the display and to the capture of user feedback through  sensors.  Being a collection of highly interacting components, virtual and augmented reality bears the challenges of  complex systems regarding robustness of architecture, as well as reliability of connected components (see  also challenges in next gen IT infrastructures above).  3.4.2 Security Challenges  Security challenges in virtual and augmented reality resemble those of complex, highly interconnected  multi-component environments. Moreover, VAR will offer an additional field to collect data about user  habits. This information may be of intimate nature, and, depending the filed in which VAR is used, may be  misused to affect human life.  As in other emerging technological areas, VAR is a challenge for cyber-security be means of:   Security and privacy implication from VAR information misuse;   Role of confidentiality, integrity and availability requirements for information processed and functions  provided by such systems;   Weaknesses from usage (i.e. addiction, confusion, etc.), operation, maintenance;   Insider abuse scenarios;   Threat exposure due to weak integration of components.  Estimated timescale for rollout5: 2 years (Virtual Reality) to 10 years (Augmented Reality)  Takeaways next gen IT-infrastructures   Security requirements of this technology area need to be understood   VAR will deliver new attack surfaces and weaknesses   VAR misuse implications/impact still subject to assessments  10 http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160729-virtual-reality-the-hype-the-problems-and-the-promise  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  14  Autonomous systems (e.g. vehicles)  3.5.1 Technological challenges  Autonomous systems is one of the emerging technologies that finds currently a gradual implementation in  the sector of autonomous vehicles. Though experiencing some successful show-cases11 and providing  positive predictions about product development, autonomous systems often deliver headlines related to  failures12.  For obvious reasons, testing is undoubtedly one of the most important, yet laborious tasks for the product  deployment of autonomous systems13. Scientists see a number of challenges related to testing, in  particular:   Mastering the complexity of the environment of the autonomous system;   Managing complex soft- and hardware, including integration and interfacing with a large number of  situational parameters and eventually other complex systems;   Mastering the maintenance of all these components, given the variety in the life-cycles of  heterogeneous components.  Moreover, some additional technology challenges relate to fault tolerance, trust in functions and  resiliency:   Given the fact that configuration errors and device failures are frequent sources of system failures,  there is a need for increasing of fault tolerance, fault avoidance and fault removal. This property turns  to be inevitable in autonomous systems, especially with the ones that are relating to human life;   Establishment of trust to the system functions and the operation of autonomous systems;   Even in cases of failures, autonomous systems will need to be in the position to adjust their functional  characteristics to the new situation and fall back to secure states for the entire ecosystem they  operate in.  3.5.2 Security challenges  The security challenges in the area of autonomous systems emerge from the resiliency requirements,  as well as from the trust and integrity requirements. It is worth mentioning that in autonomous  systems the interplay between security and safety will need to be better understood: due to typical  engineering legacies in the area of autonomous systems many (trust) requirements are based on  safety. In elaborating security issues of such systems, one will need to understand the use of security  controls to ensure safety, but also elaborate on the impact of security failures to safety. More  specifically:   Autonomous systems resilience is their ability to survive various classes of failures without falling into  states that may cause personal injury, loss of life or severe damage or loss of assets. Such assets may  be the ones controlled by the autonomous system or are directly/indirectly belong to the environment  the autonomous system. In order to achieve this, continuity mechanisms, fail over and redundancy  mechanisms need to be maintained. In addition, security mechanisms will be necessary to protect the  run-time environment in all its phases, from development to its operation.  11 https://www.wired.com/2017/04/detroit-stomping-silicon-valley-self-driving-car-race/, accessed April 2017.  12 https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/business/tesla-model-s-autopilot-fatal-crash.html?_r=0, accessed April  2017.  13 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305622163_Testing_of_Autonomous_Systems_- _Challenges_and_Current_State-of-the-Art, accessed April 2017.  https://www.wired.com/2017/04/detroit-stomping-silicon-valley-self-driving-car-race/ https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/business/tesla-model-s-autopilot-fatal-crash.html?_r=0 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305622163_Testing_of_Autonomous_Systems_-_Challenges_and_Current_State-of-the-Art https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305622163_Testing_of_Autonomous_Systems_-_Challenges_and_Current_State-of-the-Art  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  15   One of the most challenging requirements that needs to be covered by autonomous systems is trust.  This trust relates to the establishment of trust functions among the various components of the system  so that they cannot be faked/maliciously changed. Moreover, trust relationships need to be in place in  order to guarantee authenticity in the interaction with other components/systems that are external to  the autonomous system. This is particularly important for autonomous vehicles as they will probably  be critically dependent in information exchanged with the outside world (e.g. GPS and traffic  information). Finally, trust in the security of various critical functions of the autonomous system per se  needs to be established (e.g. non-repudiation of processed information). The entire range of trust  functions can be implemented by using security function, merely based on cyphers (e.g. block chain,  authentication, data signatures, certificates, etc.).   Besides the availability requirements posed by resilience (see bullet above), maintenance of integrity is  another basic function needed by such systems. Besides the non-changeability of existing functions  and processed information while on the flow and at rest, such systems need to maintain non- repudiation of performed activities. This will be required, given that such systems may affect human  life (e.g. through accidents).   Trust is particularly important in autonomous systems: the complexity of such systems and the severe  impact (i.e. loss of life) of failure or malicious action opens the question on the trust among the  involved components. Taking into account potential ad-hoc interconnections among such systems (i.e.  via M2M), it becomes clear that models of trust for interacting systems will need to be developed.  Estimated timescale for rollout5: more than 10 years  Takeaways autonomous systems   Autonomous systems need to interact with other components based on some trust models.   Resilience of autonomous systems will reach new qualities, given their potential role in traffic and  health.   Autonomous systems will eventually require novel approaches in security mechanisms, especially in  their interaction with less reliable devices such as sensors, eventually belonging to IoT environments.  The Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT)  3.6.1 Technological challenges  After the introduction of the Internet of Things14, scientists elaborate on the possibility to combine  Internet-enabled devices with miniaturization and biological processes. It is being envisaged that  technology will provide “tools to control, reuse, modify, and reengineer the cells’ structure and function,  and it is expected to enable engineers to effectively use the biological cells as programmable substrates”15.  In this context an implementation of Bio-Nano Things as biological embedded computing devices is being  considered as a main enabler.  14 https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-internet-of-things-goes-nano/, accessed April 2017.  15 https://bwn.ece.gatech.edu/papers/2015/j3.pdf, accessed April 2017.  https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-internet-of-things-goes-nano/ https://bwn.ece.gatech.edu/papers/2015/j3.pdf  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  16  If seen together with developments in DNA research, biocomputing16,17 and advances in e-health and  medicine, IoBNT opens up numerous avenues for technological breakthroughs where cyber becomes part  of and controls vital human biological processes18.  Such a development will bring massive challenges to technology, including ethical, social, legal economic  and political aspects, to mention the most imminent ones. Though the effects of these developments are  difficult to assess by now, technologist will need to be aware that a lot of work will be necessary in order to  cope with such challenges.  3.6.2 Security challenges  Coverage of security issues in IoBNT will bring massive challenges for security and cyber-security: level of  protection will be the highest possible, as the assets to be protected are the building blocks of life and  health. Moreover, trust in the functions and in the communication between all involved components will  be of great importance. Finally, requirements of identification, accountability, non-repudiation and  integrity functions will be decisive for the development and deployment of IoBNT.  Estimated timescale for rollout5: more than 10 years  Takeaways IoBNT   IoBNT will bring enormous challenges for information security / cyber-security. This is because of the  interdisciplinary nature of assets involved in this sector.   An initial risk assessment of these technologies will be absolutely vital to understand the implications  of this technology.   Due to the nature of the application area and the very nature of the involved components and their  interaction, it will be necessary to expand existing security techniques in order to achieve the required  protection needed.  AI and Robotics  3.7.1 Technological Challenges  Artificial intelligence (AI) in computer science AI refers to computer systems/services/applications that  perceive their environment and use this potentially incomplete data from the environment to maximize  the success rate of completing a certain task. AI techniques and methods can range from simple decision  making algorithms, to pattern recognition and data mining, as well as to deep learning and other  reinforcement learning techniques to name a few. Interesting showcase examples of AI include robotics,  autonomous driving, drones, medical diagnostics, personal assistants, etc.   Complex and large landscape: Robotics and AI build on a wealth of information that enable intelligent  decision making. AI and robotics go hand-in-hand in facilitating the deployment of intelligent, adaptive,  context-aware services and applications. It is therefore evident that the complexity of securing AI  touches upon many areas and domains, hence security controls need to be adaptive and operate in  16 https://singularityhub.com/2017/04/12/scientists-hacked-a-cells-dna-and-made-a-biocomputer-out-of-it/,  accessed April 2017.  17 http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nbt.3805.html, accessed April 2017.  18 https://futurism-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/futurism.com/kurzweil-by-2030-nanobots-will-flow-throughout-our- bodies/amp/, accessed April 2017.  https://singularityhub.com/2017/04/12/scientists-hacked-a-cells-dna-and-made-a-biocomputer-out-of-it/ http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nbt.3805.html https://futurism-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/futurism.com/kurzweil-by-2030-nanobots-will-flow-throughout-our-bodies/amp/ https://futurism-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/futurism.com/kurzweil-by-2030-nanobots-will-flow-throughout-our-bodies/amp/  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  17  these coordinated settings. This kind of security controls are novel and are still subject of new  development.   Financial costs: the wide penetration of AI in several critical sectors denotes the potential of significant  financial costs associated to cyber security, compared with the ones needed for the replaced  components/humans.   Omnipresence: while AI is rightly heralded as one of the technologies that bring about both a societal  and technological paradigm shift, it might be established as something that people rely on, without  giving too much awareness to associated risks. As with most innovations, in its adoption phase it is  more prevalent to consider the benefits of AI without much consideration to its shortcomings.   Large supply chain: there is a great number of stakeholders involved in every AI solution, e.g. software  developers, hardware manufacturers, network providers, software providers, service providers of big  data/machine learning solutions, data exchange protocols, mathematicians, etc. to name a few.   Algorithmic integrity: AI usually being a black box does not allow for algorithmic verification, whereas  the dynamic and evolving nature of said algorithms hinders forensic efforts. The problem is  exacerbated by the fact that algorithms are tightly linked to the data that was used to train and test  them, which when modified can lead to whole different algorithm behaviours. Therefore, verification  of the aforementioned algorithms to ensure they are not biased and are secure and trustworthy is of  high importance.  3.7.2 Security Challenges  AI technologies facilitate intelligent and automated decision-making and are thus a prerequisite to the  deployment of IoT and Industry 4.0 scenarios. The paramount need for security in such scenarios,  therefore naturally extends to AI. By analysing existing material on AI and robotics, ENISA has identified a  series of cybersecurity challenges. Though not exhaustive, the cyber-security risks and challenges below  are indicative:   Trust: given the particularity of AI that supports automated decision making often not considering  human input at all, the notion of trust emerges as being of paramount importance. Robotics systems  need to interact with other components based on some trust models. How this trust is built into such  AI-based systems, how it is propagated in a chain of trust, how it can be used to promote user  awareness and how it can be used to raise concern over security implications, are among the open  challenges in the domain.   Very large attack surface: the threats and risks related to robotics and AI are manifold and they evolve  rapidly. With great impact on citizens’ health, safety and privacy (data collection and processing may  be unclear to the users), the threat landscape concerning AI is extremely wide.   Complex landscape: security concerns are exacerbated since AI and its application on robotics should  not be seen as a collection of standalone algorithms and solutions, but rather as a rich, diverse and  wide ecosystem involving aspects such as software, hardware, data, devices, communications,  interfaces, and people.   Uncertainty: The very nature of autonomous robotics systems relies on a certain degree of uncertainty,  given the lack of deterministic such systems. Security controls need to consider this aspect and provide  appropriate solutions.   Transparency: transparency of decision making implies the need for AI to be able to justify the cause of  actions and the logical flow of decision making. Why a decision was taken is something to be made  available to regulators and users alike, to increase trust and appropriate responsibilities if needed.  Acceptance and hence adoption of robotics relies on such transparency.  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  18   Widespread deployment: apart from commercial applications of AI (e.g. smart notifications regarding  wearables), recent trends see Critical Infrastructures (CIs) migrating toward Smart ones by employing  AI on top of legacy infrastructures, namely Industry 4.0 (e.g. robotics in manufacturing). Dynamic  security controls to cater for the different context under which said systems will operate need to be  considered.   Safety and security process integration: this is a very challenging task since it involves possibly  contradicting viewpoints and requirements from all involved stakeholders. Safety challenges are in  their own extremely high in the agenda. Security for safety should be promoted since AI decisions and  actions of robots can have serious and solid effects on the physical world.   Repercussions for personal data and privacy: AI may lead to concentration of massive knowledge  about user behaviour within few organisations/companies. It will be a challenge to guarantee  compliance of this concentration with privacy regulation and information security practices. Moreover,  the need for AI to collect and process data is likely to impact the behaviour of consumers as their  personal data and privacy might risk to be disclosed to illegitimate parties. In this respect the way  consent is provided, the way an application on AI operates, the way data is relayed from one algorithm  to another, etc., need to be further analysed.  Estimated timescale for rollout5: 5 to 10 yeas  Takeaways AI and Robotics   There is a need to understand the building blocks of AI and robotics technologies AND their interplay.  Based on this (technological) information, security experts will be in the position to identify their risk  exposure.   Threats and weaknesses pertinent to the components of AI and robotics have to be assessed. Given  the wide scope of use of these technologies, this assessment needs to include both technical and non- technical issues.   Both social and technological issues identified need to be addressed by policy: the role of various  stakeholders will need to be identified; the level of necessary guidance through governments; the  interface to various existing regulation, etc.   It is important to ensure security in all stages of the life cycle of products and services, especially in the  design, development phase (testing, because of API reuse), and the usage and maintenance (security  patch, especially when using third-party security functions/API).  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  19  4. Consolidation of collected ideas: Emerging Security Related Areas  Certification  Through mobile computing, smart devices and IoT, security protection is relevant for many families of  devices and commodities. This increases the need for a seal regarding certifying existence and efficiency of  security functions, in a similar manner to seals used for electric appliances19.  Existing certification schemes, however, are too “heavy” (i.e. expensive, rigid, narrowly scoped and static).  These properties are not “compatible” with the characteristics of IoT devices that are short-lived,  inexpensive and may rapidly change their mode of operation. In many cases, the effort to obtain a  certification of security functions may drastically lower the economic benefits emerging from the product  marketing. This fact acts as a disincentive to security certificates.  Over time, various ideas for security certification have been developed in order to overcome the  deficiencies mentioned.  One of those ideas is related to the creation of artificial exposure of devices via simulated cyber-threat  landscapes. This would show the level of resistance/protection offered by various security products.  Though not formal, such an approach could be a pragmatic, economically efficient way to check the  security level offered by commercial products. A similar approach is followed by the commission in the  area of research (H2020) by means of an open call20.  Other existing ideas include trustworthiness models for vendors and/or components (both hard- and  software). In such a scenario, evaluators are called upon to assess the effectiveness of security functions  based on knowledge of the utilized architecture and exposure scenarios (see also discussion on  trustworthiness below). Whereas the latter option is similar to the one mentioned in the paragraph above.  Software liability may be an area that will impact the developments in innovative, short living  components/technologies.  ENISA has a series of activities in the area of security certification of products21 and supports the  commission and Member States to establish a framework for mapping Europe-wide available certification  standards. As an additional element hereto, both stakeholders and ENISA plan to elaborate on lightweight  certification schemes to be applied to retail hard- and software components deployed in consumer- oriented environments and applications (e.g. IoT, eHelath, connected home, etc.).  It is worth mentioning, that in its proposal on a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council  on the future of ENISA, the European Commission has delivered a draft of potential content for  certification22. This draft is subject to negotiations with EU Member States and stakeholders.  19 http://www.atbatt.com/laptop-chargers/adapter-safety-mark, accessed April 2017.  20 https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/ds-01-2016.html,  accessed April 2017.  21 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/ict-security-certification-for-industry/security-certification-of-ict-products-in- europe, accessed April 2017.  22 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/european-commission-proposal-on-a-regulation-on-the-future-of- enisa, accessed September 2017.  http://www.atbatt.com/laptop-chargers/adapter-safety-mark https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/ds-01-2016.html https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/ict-security-certification-for-industry/security-certification-of-ict-products-in-europe https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/ict-security-certification-for-industry/security-certification-of-ict-products-in-europe https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/european-commission-proposal-on-a-regulation-on-the-future-of-enisa https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/european-commission-proposal-on-a-regulation-on-the-future-of-enisa  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  20  Takeaways Certification   Existing certification schemes are not appropriate for lightweight devices similar to the ones found in  IoT.   Novel approaches for the development of alternative methods to check the cyber-security functions  will be necessary.   ENISA supports the Commission in consolidating existing approaches.  One virtual terrain, many actors: civil, LE and military societies on cyber-space  The cyber-space is the virtual terrain on which various criminal/illegal/offensive acts are taking place.  When notified upon the existence of such incidents/acts, various professional actors who own IT- components at stake will take some actions to protect their assets. Similarly, national security, law  enforcement and military forces may intervene to take care of the effects of cyber-incidents.  Just as in a real space/territory, a serious security incident will attract the simultaneous attention of  national security, law enforcement and eventually military forces. Due to lessons learned from this field, it  is apparent that the deployment of forces acting in the terrain of the incidents reserves careful  coordination. Otherwise the risk does exist to create more harm through the rescue forces than the  incident itself.  The fact that the cyber-space is practically virtual and attribution is difficult makes the coordination of the  acting organisations even more difficult, yet critical. If seen in combination with the fact that the  regulatory frameworks for coordinated action of various forces is not yet in place, it becomes apparent  how urgent this matter is, in particular in a cross-border, pan European manner23.  This has been already understood by the relevant community. Cyber-crisis management cooperation is  considered as one important matter that needs to be taken forward, both at the level of Commission24 and  ENISA25. Given the draft provided by the commission on the future of ENISA22, it is expected that quite  some developments will happen in this area in the coming period.  Takeaways coordination of actions   Like in other areas of life (e.g. crises, catastrophic events, etc.) it will be necessary to coordinate  activities of various players including defence, law enforcement, rescue forces.   Cyber-crisis cooperation is an important area that needs to be addressed.  Trustworthiness  Trustworthiness, a collection of characteristics that make an entity trustful with regard to an interaction  with others. The need to become trusted among various interacting parties is not a new security issue. This  23 https://www.eu2017.ee/news/press-releases/estonia-conduct-first-cyber-defence-exercise-defence-ministers,  accessed September 2017.  24 http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-16-2322_en.htm, accessed April 2017.  25 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/strategies-for-incident-response-and-cyber-crisis-cooperation, accessed  April 2017.  https://www.eu2017.ee/news/press-releases/estonia-conduct-first-cyber-defence-exercise-defence-ministers http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-16-2322_en.htm https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/strategies-for-incident-response-and-cyber-crisis-cooperation  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  21  need has emerged in e-commerce over the past decade. Various models have been developed, some  based on strong authentication (e.g. PKI based) and others are based on reputation models26.  While such models fulfil their purpose, e.g. within e-commerce platforms and transactions, they might not  necessarily be applicable to various emerging technology areas as the ones mentioned in section 4. We  expect that various new trust models will be developed, in particular for components establishing  communication in ad-hoc manner via wireless protocols. Such models will be necessary in order to achieve  the data protection / data privacy that is appropriate in order to obtain the necessary user trust.  A challenge that has to be addressed by authentication based systems is definitely scalability: given the  number of devices/services and the large number of interactions, the performance of the authentication  process (including the processing of involved credentials) may be a limiting factor for deployment.  Given multi-vendor and ad-hoc manner of interoperability of components, it is expected that existing trust  infrastructures (e.g. ones based on PKI, encryption, etc.) will need to increase their interoperability in order  to mutually recognise trusted components. This need will lead to new business models for trust  infrastructure providers. Moreover, the necessary functions and infrastructure may be part of “all- inclusive” service portfolios of globally acting big players engaged in related fields. It can be expected tht  trust and trustworthiness may cross-fertilize the area of certification.  Takeaways trustworthiness   New trust models will be developed to accommodate the needs of ad-hoc components interactions.   Existing and new trust infrastructures will need to fulfil necessary interoperability and performance  requirements.   Trust models will be important for the acceptance of the service offerings and can be thus seamlessly  integrated in service portfolios.  Security coverage of complete lifecycle  Given the complexity and of current and future infrastructures, systems, applications and services, the  coverage of security during the complete life cycle of all kinds of IT-products is inevitable. Including  security in all phases of IT-products covers design, development, testing, procurement, operation,  management and phase-out. IT-product liability is an issue that will require attention in the coming  time27,28,29. Together with proper configuration and maintenance of the components from the user side,  security coverage of the life-cycle is one of the conditions for the achievement of liability of IT-products.  This service level will need to be kept during the entire life-cycle of products, often having lifespans up to  few decades30.  There is one more important reason for including security in the complete lifecycle, namely the possibility  to implement a holistic security management or integrate the relevant component in an existing security  management system.  26 http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse522/05au/reputation-ebay.pdf, accessed April 2017.  27 https://threatpost.com/software-liability-is-inevitable/114136/, accessed April 2017.  28 https://devant.co.uk/software-companies-new-liability-under-the-commercial-agents-regulations-1993/, accessed  April 2017.  29 https://www.itnews.com.au/blogentry/software-liability-is-coming-447800, accessed April 2017.  30 http://plcwhatisplcscada.blogspot.gr/, accessed June 2017.  http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse522/05au/reputation-ebay.pdf https://threatpost.com/software-liability-is-inevitable/114136/ https://devant.co.uk/software-companies-new-liability-under-the-commercial-agents-regulations-1993/ https://www.itnews.com.au/blogentry/software-liability-is-coming-447800 http://plcwhatisplcscada.blogspot.gr/  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  22  The ability of a component to be integrated into an overall security management system is very important:  in the emerging technology areas mentioned above, the availability of security management is an enabler  for the achievement of acceptable security and protection levels. Moreover, one can make the assumption  that most of the professionally used IT-Infrastructures will be part of a security management system.  A final point that can be made here is the need to encompass agility both in the ability of components to  integrate to existing security management platforms, and the ability of security management platforms to  adapt to the changing threat landscape.  Takeaways security lifecycle   Inclusion of security in product development lifecycles is a precondition for the necessary  improvement of security in infrastructures of all kinds.   Inclusion of security in product development lifecycles increases agility with regard to changing threat  environment.   Security in product development lifecycle is the only way to incorporate IT-components into holistic  security management schemes.  Upcoming issues in the area of Encryption  Currently, we see a race between those who want privacy, e.g. encryption, and those that want security  through surveillance. In 2016, there is evidence that the privacy vs. national security battle is as uncertain  as never before. Various states tend to develop own interpretations on how cyber-security and  surveillance will be implemented in order to ensure national security31.  Nonetheless, having different encryption and privacy regulations, new encryption “legislation geographies”  are created. Citizens on the move within these areas may find their compliance status changing. This is a  similar situation as older generations have experienced when strong encryption was restricted in the US by  law32. Given that ca. half of the internet traffic is already encrypted33, national security sees this as an  increasing obstacle in gaining intelligence from data communications.  At the same time, states and industry work on censorship functions and on control of massive traffic  streams/bandwidths. And political developments show a trend towards de-globalization. This may lead to  control centres of big parts of the internet. Such entities may be in the position to exert their power to all  nations and individuals who have caused this traffic34. The tension created by this diverging development  will certainly bother the cyber-security community in the future.  As regards competition, it is considered meaningful to bundle existing EU-capabilities in cryptography.  European competitive advances in areas such as key management, hardware crypto, identification  methods, encryption and data protection belong to core of EU capabilities. Any relevant resources, skills  and knowledge hereto should be consolidated and used within engagement and support frameworks (e.g.  EU programmes, Member State supported development plans, etc.).  31 https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/19/extreme-surveillance-becomes-uk-law-with-barely-a-whimper,  accessed June 2017.  32 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_of_cryptography_from_the_United_States, accessed June 2017.  33 https://www.wired.com/2017/01/half-web-now-encrypted-makes-everyone-safer/, accessed June 2017.  34 http://www.iisp.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/documents/2017_threats_report_finalblu-web.pdf, accessed June  2017.  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/19/extreme-surveillance-becomes-uk-law-with-barely-a-whimper https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_of_cryptography_from_the_United_States https://www.wired.com/2017/01/half-web-now-encrypted-makes-everyone-safer/ http://www.iisp.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/documents/2017_threats_report_finalblu-web.pdf  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  23  In particular, European advances in medical device certification standards and regulation may be  considered in order to impose high European security requirements for such devices and implement  competitive advantages for European vendors of that are engaged in this market.  Last but not least, new models for use of cryptography are being developed in an attempt to secure  component interactions within IoT environments/applications. This trend is quite strong and is related to  the implementation business processes on IoT infrastructures, such as e-payment options via digital  currencies. It is expected that usage of encryption will be a key technology for securing such interactions  both within IoT but also other technology areas.  Concluding this section one should mention the importance of technological advances: secure encryption  schemes and protocols, for instance in the light of Quantum Computers, and possible other mathematical  breakthroughs will be crucial. Both from the defenders and offenders sides. Such developments make a  working crypto an indispensable component.  Takeaways security encryption   At nation-state level encryption is seen as a barrier in lawful surveillance. Nation-states will invest  resources in overcoming these barrier.   Vendors/providers are interested in weak data protection that will allow them to have a better  international presence with uniform security standards that will ease product  development/integration efforts35.   EU should capitalize on existing advances of encryption technology and services in this area to  implement global market leadership.   New usage models for encryption functions are under development. This will boost the need to include  encryption functions in soft- and hardware products.  Identification  Just as now, identification will be in the future THE function in all kinds of interconnected technologies,  individuals, components and all other identifiable objects in cyber-space. Identification is a necessary  prerequisite for trust, but also non-repudiation, that is, the non-debatable evidence that an action has  happened between two or more identifiable subjects.  Currently, most forms of identification cover human subjects and are used mostly within authentication.  Moreover, quite some identification/authentication methods have been developed for non-human  subjects. In both cases, identities are one of the most desirable objects for cyber-criminals. For obvious  reasons, personally Identifiable Information (PII) tops breached data.  Recent research shows the shortcomings in current implementation of cutting edge, widely deployed  biometric authentication methods36. Would such an authentication mechanism implementation be used  within e-health or financial applications? Obviously not; therefore it is necessary to (pre-) invest efforts in  identification/authentication methods that are appropriate for emerging technologies in order to avoid  sever incidents in critical IT systems.  35 http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/tisa-leaks-wie-das-dienstleistungsabkommen-den-datenschutz- gefaehrdet-a-1122844.html, accessed June 2017.  36 https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/10/technology/fingerprint-security-smartphones-apple-google-samsung.html,  accessed April 2017.  http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/tisa-leaks-wie-das-dienstleistungsabkommen-den-datenschutz-gefaehrdet-a-1122844.html http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/tisa-leaks-wie-das-dienstleistungsabkommen-den-datenschutz-gefaehrdet-a-1122844.html https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/10/technology/fingerprint-security-smartphones-apple-google-samsung.html  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  24  Two other equally important aspects in cyber-space that are subject to identification is anonymity and  attribution. Though being two sides of the same coin, both anonymity and non-repudiation of actions are  two functions/qualities that need to be supported by identification mechanisms. They bring an additional  dimension in the complexity of the entire identification area.  Finally, due to the rich digital footprint of users (e.g. summary of all digital traces), the notion of identity in  general needs to be reconsidered, as it goes far beyond typical identities as covered by today’s functions,  products and services. Moreover, identities of non-user components such as autonomous systems, will  become increasingly important, as they are going to undertake important functions of human life.  Takeaways identification   The interplay between identification and trust needs to be investigated.   The notion of anonymity, identity and non-repudiation need to be put in common basis and  considered in modern IT infrastructures, also with respect to privacy and security requirements.   The notion of identity needs to be put to a wider basis, as multiple user data allow for the definition of  exact profiles matching single users in the internet.  Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) as cybersecurity tools  AI/ML and IoT seems to be an interesting combination that gains in speed: AI and ML can be used to semi- automatically or automatically supervise simple tasks within an IoT environment37. This can be achieved by  leveraging on available knowledge/data (massively) created by interacting components/sensors. This can  be a great advantage given that fact that the internet never forgets. Such information could be used to  perform corrective actions of component interactions, thus increasing security and resilience.  Just as for many application areas, ML and AI are both interesting within cyber-security. They can be used  to detect attacks by identifying anomalies in operational or communication patterns of components.  Similarly, ML and AI can be used in the discovery of interrelationships required in the collection of cyber- threat intelligence, hence establishing context out of mass data. Similar activities are already reported in  the area of big data and national security38.  The use of ML and AI in security may also support the autonomous supervision of infrastructure and  application areas with regard to security management policies. To this extend, ML and AI will contribute  towards the revision of policy implementation and oversight that has been typically performed by humans  to a great extent. In this way, ML and AI may achieve costs reduction and increase of efficiency towards  secure operations.  Takeaways security AI and ML   AI and ML are important tools in the area of cyber-security. The can be used for context discovery in  the area of Threat Intelligence (TI).   A second very promising area is the use of ML and AI in the identification of attack patterns (i.e. based  on TI) and facilitation of security management/policy implementation supervision.  37 http://telecoms.com/480122/ericssons-big-black-box-full-of-ai-goodness-intrigues-at-mwc-2017/, accessed June  2017.  38 https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/09/27/national-security-relies-more-and-more- on-big-data-heres-why/?utm_term=.4072fff3ca40, accessed September 2017.  http://telecoms.com/480122/ericssons-big-black-box-full-of-ai-goodness-intrigues-at-mwc-2017/ https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/09/27/national-security-relies-more-and-more-on-big-data-heres-why/?utm_term=.4072fff3ca40 https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/09/27/national-security-relies-more-and-more-on-big-data-heres-why/?utm_term=.4072fff3ca40  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  25   AI and ML will be target to attacks. They might open new avenues in manipulation and attack  methods.  Getting end-user more involved  There is no doubt that cyber-security knowledge needs to be transferred to end-users. Numbers from  incident analysis show that over 50% of the incidents are due to common/basic user errors39,40. This makes  clear that user awareness, can become the most efficient security control by means of cost/benefit ratio.  Awareness actions for cyber-security do exist and education efforts are ongoing. Thought many initiatives  cover end user training, there is still plenty of space for improvements. Some examples are: security and  education, improvement of information awareness of decision makers, better enrolment of user in  managing security of their devices/applications, target group oriented methods for communication of  security information. The list and width/depth of this matter is quite wide. We believe that end-user  security is an important area that is not growing in analogy to the digitalization of the society.  Last but not least, it is known that there is a significant shortage in cyber-security skills. This need will be  further intensified in the future. New types of organisations from the area of military come to complete  the picture of big white-hat cyber-players. Yet the question is how to fill the gap in cyber-security and  cyber-threats skills. Is the enlargement of cyber-warfare going to affect other, commercial areas? This is a  difficult question given that already today, a wide grey area does exist among cyber-crime, cyber-warfare,  cyber-espionage, vendors, researches and other commercial organisations.  There is no question that the security community has to let people know more about it and decision  makers need to create more capacities to better educate people at all levels of education.  Takeaways involving the end user   Education and awareness on cyber-security needs to advance to include all levels and skills.   Professional education needs to try covering the skill shortage in the market.   Products need to take care of hiding complexity and supporting users to manage security parameters.  39 http://www.cybersecuritytrend.com/topics/cyber-security/articles/421821-human-error-to-blame-most- breaches.htm, accessed June 2017.  40 http://searchcompliance.techtarget.com/feature/Verizon-Human-error-still-among-the-top-data-security-threats,  accessed June 2017.  http://www.cybersecuritytrend.com/topics/cyber-security/articles/421821-human-error-to-blame-most-breaches.htm http://www.cybersecuritytrend.com/topics/cyber-security/articles/421821-human-error-to-blame-most-breaches.htm http://searchcompliance.techtarget.com/feature/Verizon-Human-error-still-among-the-top-data-security-threats  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  26  5. List of topics University of Federal Armed Forces (Universität der  Bundeswehr)  Participants of brainstorming session: Thomas Diefenbach, Peter Hillmann, Prof. Dr. Ulrike Lechner, Prof.  Dr. Axel Lehmann  During our brainstorming session on 3rd March 2017, we have raised the following topics of mutual  interest:  - Simulation of exposure to threats and materialization of risks is important, eventually by means of  scenarios. E.g. based on those scenarios, serious games on cyber security can be generated.  - Organic computing as self-protective/adaptive system organisation. This paradigm might be useful in  the context of resilience.  - Risk and perception of risks as a topic regarding own organisation. Perception of risks is an item that  needs to be elaborated on.  - Prediction of botnet activity on the basis of system behaviour such as recognition of patterns, etc.  seems to be an important element for research, simulation but also exercises.  - Threat analysis and threat landscaping, threat evolution, etc. is considered as an area of innovation.  Seen in conjunction with novel tools for operations and risk management, this area is a challenge for  the security community and the University in particular.  - Within a multi-project coordination effort, the University is involved in a project that covers IT-Security  match-playing. The game is in German, however, any player from ENISA would be very welcome.  - Data sharing for surfacing emergencies is an area of activity covering the needs for military  interventions in health matters. This experience is considered to be relevant for cyber-emergencies.  - Trace the operational pictures of security: consisting of measuring efficiency, social media aspects,  mentioning in dark fora and in the web, evaluation of environmental parameters, etc.  - ENISA will consider the EUROSTARS call (part of H2020 framework) to assess the possibility of finding  partners. This would enable the desired creation of synergies with the objective of product  development.  - ENISA will establish contacts to its experts for future interactions in the areas of:  - CIIP – Comprehensive and Integrated Infrastructure Program  - Simulation (serious games)  - E-health (ENISA provides access to available project/internal data)  - Cyber exercises and emergency coordination  - Networking (SDN – Software Defined Networks)  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  27  - On the basis of these interactions, the development of a yearly plan specifying delivery every 3 months  will take place. These plans are subject to revisions based on the progress made.  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  28  6.

ENISA Permanent Stakeholder Group: Key Topics for Future Work  Programmes  Below, a list of key topics for future work is presented. This list has been added after four years of  interaction the ENISA PSG (2015-2017)41. Within this chapter we try to show the relevance of these points  to the one mentioned in this report. This is being performed by means of a mapping between each  identified top priority and the content of the crystal ball report.  Top priorities and challenges mentioned by PSG members in this respect include the following:  1. Implementation of the new cyber-security strategy  Relevance: CONSIDERED AS NOT DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO EMERGING TECHNOLOGY AREAS  2. Cyber-security policy for the EU: Europeans dependence from external cyber security assets has been  increasing rapidly. At the same time a large portion of European Cyber Security providers have been  merged to foreign companies, or totally vanished. Only EU’s biggest countries still have governmental  support to build competences and companies and tight governmental control for national security  purposes. ENISA should support building European new cyber security policy, which would be  reflecting the real situation. European current situation where EU MB's are having cyber security and  policy defining assets, policy, hardware, standards etc. coming largely from one single non-European  country, when in the same time fastest development, understanding European like dependency from  external cyber security assets, is happening outside this one country. ENISA should either build policy  which defends European only cyber-security assets and competences, or ENISA should make policy  which should fully utilise international best practises and technologies which are coming countries  having similar dependencies like EU and still build holistic Cybersecurity to protect digital sovereignty  and citizen’s privacy.

GDPR and NIS directive. Both are changing cyber security rules fundamentally and are also for first  time, entering the national cyber security policy space. Some national governmental stakeholders are  facing the challenge not to be able to support and guide public, or private companies which will fall  under one, or both directives. Now there is a clear need for clear communication and support even  directly to these companies/Institutions.  Relevance: CONSIDERED AS NOT DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO EMERGING TECHNOLOGY AREAS  4.

With many sensors IoT devices are often (and often  unexpected by users) collecting data. This holds not only for smartphones or hoovers and other robot-  like devices, but also e.g. toys (puppets, toy tanks, etc.). It is important for users to know what data are  collected and how, and where they may be flowing, so that users can make decisions about this. Given  the often small user interfaces this is not easy. At the same time, it is important, that users get  assurance, that the decisions on data flows are really respected and implemented by the IoT devices.  So the security/privacy testing and evaluation of these devices is essential.  Relevance: See challenges mentioned in section Internet of Things.  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  31  15. Privacy respecting identity management in eIDAS (electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust  Services) context. Meanwhile the more and more eIDAS services are being established. Most of them  deal with personal identities and identifiers. Often these identifiers are for assurance reasons spread  through many entities (e.g. the “calling home effect” in in the STORK PEPS protocols), which is creating  privacy issues, as too many entities are learning about the users’ interests and behaviour on the  Internet. As now a number of real eIDAS services exist, it is time for a privacy analysis of these.  Relevance: Privacy issues mentioned in security challenges of section Trustworthiness and  Identification and AI and Robotics  16. Reacting to Cyberattacks: Cyberattacks are real existing threats, but it is still unclear what an  appropriate response to these threats might be. Is it for example acceptable to start a counter-attack  against the originator of a cyberattack, although it is known that the counterstrike has consequences  for uninvolved nations, people, and infrastructures? For this reason it is important to establish useful  rules and measures, which take into account the juridical status on the national / EU level as well as  political, social and ethical requirements.  Relevance: Coordination issues mentioned in section  One virtual terrain, many actors: civil, LE and  military societies on cyber-space  17. Industry 4.0: The digitalisation of the industry provides various challenges regarding IT security. To  maintain and increase the competitiveness of products supplied by European manufacturers, it is  important to raise the IT security level in the industry. Therefore, it is necessary to create common  framework conditions and regulations for Industry 4.0 applications and infrastructures to establish a  high IT security level within the EU.

However, NFV’s new architecture, operations, and openness create new security challenges.  Those challenges must be overcome for service providers to scale NFV and earn its business benefits.  The needs here are a risk identification methodology, followed by a careful review of the top security  risks when migrating services to NFV. The intent is to provide security practitioners with a basis for  developing a documented risk dashboard in order to bring down the overall security risk to an  acceptable level when migrating to NFV.  Relevance: Virtualization issues mentioned in section Next Generation IT infrastructure  27. 5G: As observed by 3GPP today, 5G networks will require complex security requirements at different  layers within the system. Moreover, with standardization at an early stage, innovative security  solutions proportionate to the threats will have to be built into the network from the very start. This  approach will protect subscribers, devices and their communications, as well as the integrity of the  network itself-whatever the use case. Investing in 5G security now is also a wise insurance policy to  avoid unexpected costs that might arise later from countering attacks or from suffering the  consequences of insufficiently protected high-value data. The wrong decision about security today will  only prove to be false economy in the future.

Considering emerging technologies and applications is an important step in assessing future security  needs.  ENISA has performed this effort in collaboration with external experts from academia and industry.  Starting with a small number of individuals, it is planned to expand this assessment by engaging additional  experts, both within and outside ENISA committees and bodies. For the time being, the initial sight to  emerging technologies has shown that currently top technological challenges are:   The Internet of Things,   Autonomous systems,   Next generation virtualized infrastructures (including SDN and 5G),   Upcoming societal challenges,   Virtual and Augmented reality,   The Internet of Bio-Nano Things,   AI and Robotics.  Knowing that the above list is not exhaustive, ENISA will continue the dialogue with experts to  complement it. For the above emerging technology areas both technological and cyber-security challenges  are presented in this report.  By taking into account the emerging security challenges, the most important cyber security areas have  been identified by means of “emerging security related areas”. These are:   Elaboration on Certification,   Coordination of actions in cyber space,   Development of trustworthiness,   Coverage of complete lifecycle,   The future of cryptography,   Future Identification technologies,   Use of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in cyber security,   Increasing end-user involvement.  ENISA believes that these cyber security areas will present challenges to the cyber security community in  the years to come and hopes that they will be extensively discussed within its stakeholder communities.  Last but not least, in this work input that has been received by the ENISA Permanent Stakeholder Group  (PSG) is being mentioned. In a similar manner, input will be integrated through an interaction with the new  PSG that will have its kick-off end of October 2017. In this manner, both previous and new contributions  from PSG will be put in the context of the areas presented in this report, widening thus significantly the  number of contributors.  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  06  1. Introduction  This paper is the initial documentation of an attempt to assess upcoming technology and the associated  security challenges. This will be achieved through interaction with security experts from various sectors  such as industry, academia, public sector, etc.  This idea is not new: within ENISA, the consideration of future technological challenges is part of the  internal planning and knowledge management process. It allows to develop proposals, channel knowledge  development and set work priorities. In the realm of ENISA projects, various external experts participate in  achieving this objective, for example by contributing to the corresponding activities (e.g. conclusions  drawn in projects, providing advice, supporting studies, stock-takings, surveys, etc.). Finally, the Permanent  Stakeholder Group1 (PSG) is established in order to channel information and ideas on new developments  into the ENISA planning process.  Yet, with this effort the prediction of future challenges is being brought on a broader and yet more focused  basis: ENISA initiated a dedicated dialogue with representatives of stakeholder groups to brainstorm about  emerging technological and security challenges and consolidates discussions/ideas/experiences in form of  this paper. The time horizon covered by the covered technology areas varies and covers developments  that are ca. 1 to 5 years ahead of our time. Aim of this approach is to create an initial nucleus of material  with relatively low resource investment, by collecting input from various key stakeholders. At the initial  phases of this report, a collection within technology oriented stakeholders in the area of  Information/Cyber Security has been performed. After an assessment of the achieved results, this activity  may be put on a wider basis, both regarding the involved skills and number of contributing stakeholders.  The process behind this work has a second objective: through the interaction with various stakeholders,  ENISA gets an insight on complementary, mutually enforcing interests and ideas of those stakeholders. To  this extent, ENISA will play the role of mediator to achieve mutual fertilization of ideas that might lead to  advancement of security practices/products/operation among these stakeholders. At the same time,  results from activities of these stakeholders may flow into the work of others, including ENISA’s  deliverables and will be disseminated to the public.  1 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/psg, accessed June 2017.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/psg  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  07  2. Process and Content  Process  In order to proceed with this work, the following process has been defined:   An ongoing information collection is established within ENISA. This is based mainly on open source and  covers various areas of security, technology and policy developments. Moreover, this information  contains also input from interactions of ENISA management team with key stakeholders.   Available material from previous stakeholder interactions (e.g. previous ENISA Permanent Stakeholder  Group -PSG) has been taken into account.   Within the ENISA annual work programme delivery process, open points, future requirements and  gaps in the area of security and emerging technologies are being identified. This material is subject to  discussions, both internally and with contributing stakeholders.   Guidance and brainstorming is being performed within various ENISA bodies, particularly in the ENISA  PSG. This information flows in prospective versions of work programmes and is being taken up within  internal and external projects/activities.   Interested key contacts of ENISA (e.g. PSG-experts, other experts engaged within ENISA projects,  academic organisations working together with ENISA) are enrolled in a brainstorming dialogue relating  to emerging technology and security issues.   All this information is consolidated internally and has been used as input to this paper.   This initial draft will be put to the attention of a wider group of stakeholders/experts for wider  consultations. ENISA will ask for contributions the members of the newly appointed Permanent  Stakeholder Group during its constitutional meeting end October 2017.  Content  The content of this paper is oriented towards groups of issues/topics/aspects that share some common  characteristics. Examples are: same technology sector, same business area, same policy context and scope,  etc. Knowing that it is impossible to be free of overlaps, the different topics presented may have  commonalities both regarding technological but also security issues.  In the following we present different prevailing views on technological topics and – when appropriate – we  draw possible consequences for cyber security.  In case actions have been identified that relate to some existing ENISA work programme topics, these will  be indicatively mentioned. The same holds true in case identified topics map to non-confidential activities  of the stakeholders involved in the brainstorming. Such topics are good candidates for the initiation of  cross-stakeholder interactions based on topics of common interest.  Finally, for the sake of completeness, we provide a list with topics addressed in the performed  brainstorming per organisation. This material serves as a reminder for the list of topics discussed and the  sequence bellow does not indicate any prioritization.  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  08  3. Consolidation of collected ideas: Emerging Technology Areas  This chapter contains all evolving technology areas that are considered to bring cyber-security challenges.  This assessment is based on discussions, presentations and information collection that has been  performed over the previous year. It is taken as given, that these technology areas will present challenges  to the cyber security community for the years to come.  Internet of Things  3.1.1 Technological Challenges  The Internet of Things (IoT) has been considered as an emerging technology area due to its potential in  affecting human lives and to lead to digital transformation through new products. Even though this  technology is available for some years now and as such not new, experts believe that its potential is by far  not yet exhausted and brings a lot of technological challenges.  The challenges related to Internet of Things (IoT) are known and understood in the (security) community.  IoT plays an important role in life, as it serves/manages various areas of consumer environments. Hence,  from the market point of view IoT:   Is the new context for delivering hardware, software and services to consumers;   Creates a lot of re-usable data helping the development of new products;   Allows for penetrating2 – hence marketing - private life and private sphere of users;   Allows for a flexible development of environments, while enabling customer binding;   Constitutes the next level of convergence of various infrastructures, data and services.  These facts make clear why information about IoT deployment/usage will be a very desirable piece of  information for a variety of market, government, national security, but also malicious actors.  Addressing security in IoT is difficult: cheap, mass production devices are launched with weak security due  to cost issues. Moreover, as they are of generic purpose, it is difficult to foresee the area of application,  thus take care of protection requirements during fabrication. Nonetheless, when bundled into  bigger/constellations they might be part of a complex infrastructure processing significant amounts of data  of that pose strong confidentiality, integrity and availability requirements.  Another challenge is the computing power that is inherently available in interconnected devices. This  computing power can be misused when entire or parts of an IoT network is being taken over by malicious  agents. The Mirai4 botnet has demonstrated the intensity an orchestrated attack from large numbers of  devices may have (see also next section).  It is interesting to see that in the Gartner Hype Cycle 20163, IoT is considered as being still in the innovation  trigger phase (i.e. early phase). Hence, there is significant time for action in the IoT till market  maturity/productivity.  2 The penetration of IoT in every day’s life becomes more and more evident, eventually with corresponding market  growth.  3 http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3412017, accessed June 2017.  http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3412017  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  09  All in all, the challenge with IoT environments and devices alike will be to maintain the balance between  low cost (i.e. the driver for IoT adoption), short time to market and security (i.e. the enabler of  trustworthiness). If this balance is lost, there is a risk for market failure of IoT applications.  3.1.2 Security Challenges of IoT  IoT will be an opportunity for cyber-crime monetization activities. Equivalently, IoT will be in the focus of  national security and espionage, both state and corporations sponsored. Moreover, data on user  behaviour will be the future marketing instrument.  Having said that, one can easily assess the areas of misuse of this information and the corresponding  threat exposure (list indicative, non-exhaustive):   Data and available functions from IoT applications may be misused within cyber-threats such as  phishing, ransomware, cyber-espionage, data breaches, identity theft, etc4.   Ill-secured devices can be hijacked and misused in various attack scenarios, e.g. Botnets, Denial of  Service, spam, etc.   Available ill-protected interfaces and processes owned by service providers may be misused to  penetrate their systems. Moreover, the absence of product life-cycle functions (e.g. updates) makes  the elimination of vulnerabilities impossible.   Available functions, processes and data can be misused with the aim of illicit profit.   Companies may be interested in data, practices and functions available to spy on their competitors.   Home appliances of single households or group of those can be misused by activists, terrorists, cyber- warriors, etc. to cause harm to entire areas.  Given the intimate but also existential nature of IoT applications (media consumption, life habits, private  environment, e-health, assisted living, etc.) confidentiality, integrity and availability requirements will be  high. It will be necessary to develop products to protect such environments.  Instead of “micro” - protecting each element in an IoT environment, a focus on protecting architecture  components may be more appropriate. The utilization of existing/well known/efficiently manageable  security controls may provide a good protection if applied properly at the right level of the IoT  architecture. Current discussion shows that IoT needs a lot of work to mature, both regarding architectures  and services. The Mirai4 botnet, for example, that is taken predominantly as THE example of an IoT misuse,  was actually abusing internet routers. Nonetheless, such components have never been considered to be  part of IoT infrastructures.  Estimated timescale for rollout5: 2 to 5 years  Takeaways IoT   IoT platform is in early development phases.   5G and virtualization will enhance the device-to-device interactions (M2M).   IoT protection as a whole will be difficult. Application/sector oriented solutions are more feasible.   IoT will enlarge attack surface by means of novel abuse scenarios.   Existing security protection controls will need to be considered for IoT scenarios.  4 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirai_(malware), accessed June 2017.  5 http://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/top-trends-in-the-gartner-hype-cycle-for-emerging-technologies- 2017/, accessed September 2017.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirai_(malware) http://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/top-trends-in-the-gartner-hype-cycle-for-emerging-technologies-2017/ http://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/top-trends-in-the-gartner-hype-cycle-for-emerging-technologies-2017/  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  10   Although processed data may be volatile and of low value, data protection will be necessary in order to  maintain privacy.  The interplay between Technology Use and Societal Challenges  3.2.1 Technological and Societal challenges  Though not a technology area per se, societal changes play an important role in technology adoption:  firstly they affect the creation of new products. Secondly, they play an important role on how existing  products are being used. In both cases, societal challenges affect technology deployment and  security/privacy issues. As such, they have been considered in our brainstorming sessions as an area that is  setting up context of technology use. This is the main reason for considering societal changes this chapter.  Societal changes with regard to digitization are undoubtedly a significant phenomenon in society.  Understanding those changes helps identifying behaviour and habits of end users – that is - deriving  various usage scenarios. This, in turn, provides important incentives for protection requirements of end- users.  A noticeable shift has happened in the way media are consumed: while the average age of traditional TV  viewers is growing, younger generations go away from TV watching6. At the same time, use of video on  demand is mostly used by younger users7. Similarly, technology has played and still plays an important role  in changes of social behaviour of younger generations, in particular regarding their communication,  interaction, media consumption and socialization habits.  Complex behaviour of users can also be assessed in the areas of socializing by using messaging services,  social networks and sharing of life-logging information and qualified self8. Many of those trends are in  partial contradiction with the use of well formulated human rights regarding the need of privacy. For  example, some users may publicise information about themselves that the government treats as  confidential personal data.  Moreover, modern considerations of the digital divide show that there is a difference in technology usage  between (socially) advanced and disadvantaged individuals. These differences are reflected in the way they  are using online services9.  It is impossible to talk and act in the area of technology and technological platforms without fully  understanding end-user behaviour. This will lead to failure of any technical measure, including cyber- security.  3.2.2 Security challenges emerging from Societal Changes  Challenges to cyber-security from societal changes in the user community are quite big. This is mainly due  to the fact that there is a need to better understand the motives, habits and psychology of end-users,  knowingly the weakest link in cyber-security.  Assessments show that a better security awareness from end-users may reduce over 50% of the current  security incidents that are reportedly based on human error39,40. This is indicative for the importance of  6 http://www.marketingcharts.com/television/are-young-people-watching-less-tv-24817/  7 https://digiday.com/media/demographics-youtube-5-charts/  8 http://aias.au.dk/events/the-quantified-self/  9 https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/new-digital-divide-emilio-mordini?trk=prof-post  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  11  such measures, though their spread is far beyond average throughout all age categories. This has been well  understood in the security community: important awareness campaigns currently launched take into  account such facts.  From user behaviour, cyber-security may draw important conclusions regarding (list in indicative, non- exhaustive):   Weaknesses caused by behavioural patterns;   Weaknesses caused by usage scenarios;   Threats exposure due to weaknesses;   Misuse scenarios;   Identification/assessment of important user assets;   Elaboration on security controls that can be managed by non-experts;   Awareness raising and training matters including differentiation according to age of target groups.   Balance/orchestration of societal needs, educational methods and user behavioural patterns.   Elaboration on potential courses of action to achieve this balance (including regulation, user liability  etc.).  Estimated timescale for addressing: 2 to 5 years  Takeaways Societal Changes   User behaviour needs to be better studied and understood   User habits have to be taken into account in cyber-security   With implementation of basic security controls, significant mitigation of risk can be achieved  Next Generation IT infrastructure  3.3.1 Technological Challenges  In many areas of IT we see currently the creation of next generation IT-Infrastructures. Main characteristics  of this evolution is the increased deployment of virtualization, meshed environments/applications, multi- tenant capabilities, provision of customization and management capabilities, just to mention a few. In  those systems, end-to-end offerings are being considered, where the operation can be managed remotely,  without the need to maintain any own infrastructure locally.  These trends pose significant technological, operational and economic challenges. Based on these trends,  for example, many end-to-end services will need to be re-defined and re-commissioned.  Though being positive from the user’s point of view, this trend will create a big re-shuffling of current  market equilibria: big vendors will be in the position to displace or take over competitors whose offerings  will become transparent for end-customers. By means of market competition, however, this trend may  lead to concentration of market power to a few giants. Such an oligopoly may influence end-user flexibility  regarding their needs, costs and security with regard to the offered services.  New generation IT Infrastructures implement multi-layer architectures that neutralise from the  peculiarities of individual hardware and low level functional dependencies. While the configuration and  management of these systems is being performed at the application level, inherent dependencies with the  heterogeneous subsystems (hard- and software) pose technical, operational and security challenges.  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  12  3.3.2 Security challenges next gen IT  Multi-layered, virtualized architectures have the advantage of abstracting from peculiarities of sub- systems. Multiple systems may be independently defined on a common hard- and software platform and  then be managed by means of a hypervisor.  Next generation systems are delivering thus a more  comprehensive and coherent view to the operators and to the end-users. The implementation of such  functions, however, needs to support translation of user actions over various logical and system layers into  the particular system-specifics of underlying components.  This kind of back-and-forward translation and execution bears security risks, in particular if the short  innovation cycles of underlying (hardware) systems is taken into account. It is worth mentioning, that most  popular next generation infrastructures in the context of this discussion are software defined networks  and 5G.  These risks may be related to eventual weaknesses of sub-systems, errors in configuration, versioning,  incompatibility, security gaps, etc. Moreover, the impact from materialization of such risks may be big, as it  may affect operations of multiple tenants using the system.  The large number of users/tenants using the service is a motive for adversaries to target those platforms: if  such a service can be compromised, access to a large amount of data can be obtained. Obviously, the  manipulation options from such a breach may be quite broad. In general, next gen IT infrastructures will  bring many security challenges, indicatively:   Multiple options of weakness/vulnerability hunting due to big number of heterogeneous components;   Efficient abuse of weaknesses/vulnerabilities due to multiple logical and physical layers;   Multiple monetization opportunities through large number of services offered and users;   Multiple attack scenarios due to various technical, procedural and business workflows implemented on  these platforms;   Multiple abuse cases due to various involved management/administrative roles involved (esp. insider  abuse);   Inefficient cross-layer implementation of security measures introducing protection gaps;   Too many ways to circumvent existing security controls by abusing multi-layered architectures.  Estimated timescale for rollout5: 5 to 10 years  Takeaways next gen IT-infrastructures   Traditionally, security abuse takes place between system layers. Next gen IT encompasses a lot of  layers and components which increase abuse cases.   Just as with cloud infrastructures, next gen IT will be an attractive target due to the large volume of  information that can be breached.   Flaws of components involved in virtualized infrastructures may affect confidentiality and integrity of  data.   New ways to understand the interplay and architectural requirements of new virtualized  infrastructures; establishment of security protection in accordance.  Virtual and Augmented reality / Gamification  Generally speaking, virtual reality and gamification technologies are used when decoupling a process from  its physical pedant is desirable. This technology allows simulation of catastrophic events without actually  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  13  experiencing them. Simulation is very common in training when the trainee wants to obtain skills for  professions which – when performed in real life – may bear significant risks. Examples can be found in  medicine, aerospace, underwater, military, etc. As far as the decoupling between the cyber and physical  spaces are maintained, the relevance of virtual reality and gamification to cyber security is rather low. This  will change, when the virtual and physical words start getting connected. Nonetheless, virtual reality and  gamification has significant relevance to privacy.  3.4.1 Technological Challenges  Virtual and augmented reality (VAR) is a technology area that has made significant improvements towards  going to production phases3,10. Depending on the sector/domain in which virtual and augmented  technology is being used, it may be quite intrusive and/or crucial for human activities, especially when  used in sectors like medicine, military, aviation, space, etc.  Virtual and augmented reality is being used within gamification by means of games, both serious and for  fun. As such, it is being utilized by a very wide user community in a wide spectrum of applications. Current  challenges regarding this technology are related to the display and to the capture of user feedback through  sensors.  Being a collection of highly interacting components, virtual and augmented reality bears the challenges of  complex systems regarding robustness of architecture, as well as reliability of connected components (see  also challenges in next gen IT infrastructures above).  3.4.2 Security Challenges  Security challenges in virtual and augmented reality resemble those of complex, highly interconnected  multi-component environments. Moreover, VAR will offer an additional field to collect data about user  habits. This information may be of intimate nature, and, depending the filed in which VAR is used, may be  misused to affect human life.  As in other emerging technological areas, VAR is a challenge for cyber-security be means of:   Security and privacy implication from VAR information misuse;   Role of confidentiality, integrity and availability requirements for information processed and functions  provided by such systems;   Weaknesses from usage (i.e. addiction, confusion, etc.), operation, maintenance;   Insider abuse scenarios;   Threat exposure due to weak integration of components.  Estimated timescale for rollout5: 2 years (Virtual Reality) to 10 years (Augmented Reality)  Takeaways next gen IT-infrastructures   Security requirements of this technology area need to be understood   VAR will deliver new attack surfaces and weaknesses   VAR misuse implications/impact still subject to assessments  10 http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160729-virtual-reality-the-hype-the-problems-and-the-promise  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  14  Autonomous systems (e.g. vehicles)  3.5.1 Technological challenges  Autonomous systems is one of the emerging technologies that finds currently a gradual implementation in  the sector of autonomous vehicles. Though experiencing some successful show-cases11 and providing  positive predictions about product development, autonomous systems often deliver headlines related to  failures12.  For obvious reasons, testing is undoubtedly one of the most important, yet laborious tasks for the product  deployment of autonomous systems13. Scientists see a number of challenges related to testing, in  particular:   Mastering the complexity of the environment of the autonomous system;   Managing complex soft- and hardware, including integration and interfacing with a large number of  situational parameters and eventually other complex systems;   Mastering the maintenance of all these components, given the variety in the life-cycles of  heterogeneous components.  Moreover, some additional technology challenges relate to fault tolerance, trust in functions and  resiliency:   Given the fact that configuration errors and device failures are frequent sources of system failures,  there is a need for increasing of fault tolerance, fault avoidance and fault removal. This property turns  to be inevitable in autonomous systems, especially with the ones that are relating to human life;   Establishment of trust to the system functions and the operation of autonomous systems;   Even in cases of failures, autonomous systems will need to be in the position to adjust their functional  characteristics to the new situation and fall back to secure states for the entire ecosystem they  operate in.  3.5.2 Security challenges  The security challenges in the area of autonomous systems emerge from the resiliency requirements,  as well as from the trust and integrity requirements. It is worth mentioning that in autonomous  systems the interplay between security and safety will need to be better understood: due to typical  engineering legacies in the area of autonomous systems many (trust) requirements are based on  safety. In elaborating security issues of such systems, one will need to understand the use of security  controls to ensure safety, but also elaborate on the impact of security failures to safety. More  specifically:   Autonomous systems resilience is their ability to survive various classes of failures without falling into  states that may cause personal injury, loss of life or severe damage or loss of assets. Such assets may  be the ones controlled by the autonomous system or are directly/indirectly belong to the environment  the autonomous system. In order to achieve this, continuity mechanisms, fail over and redundancy  mechanisms need to be maintained. In addition, security mechanisms will be necessary to protect the  run-time environment in all its phases, from development to its operation.  11 https://www.wired.com/2017/04/detroit-stomping-silicon-valley-self-driving-car-race/, accessed April 2017.  12 https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/business/tesla-model-s-autopilot-fatal-crash.html?_r=0, accessed April  2017.  13 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305622163_Testing_of_Autonomous_Systems_- _Challenges_and_Current_State-of-the-Art, accessed April 2017.  https://www.wired.com/2017/04/detroit-stomping-silicon-valley-self-driving-car-race/ https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/business/tesla-model-s-autopilot-fatal-crash.html?_r=0 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305622163_Testing_of_Autonomous_Systems_-_Challenges_and_Current_State-of-the-Art https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305622163_Testing_of_Autonomous_Systems_-_Challenges_and_Current_State-of-the-Art  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  15   One of the most challenging requirements that needs to be covered by autonomous systems is trust.  This trust relates to the establishment of trust functions among the various components of the system  so that they cannot be faked/maliciously changed. Moreover, trust relationships need to be in place in  order to guarantee authenticity in the interaction with other components/systems that are external to  the autonomous system. This is particularly important for autonomous vehicles as they will probably  be critically dependent in information exchanged with the outside world (e.g. GPS and traffic  information). Finally, trust in the security of various critical functions of the autonomous system per se  needs to be established (e.g. non-repudiation of processed information). The entire range of trust  functions can be implemented by using security function, merely based on cyphers (e.g. block chain,  authentication, data signatures, certificates, etc.).   Besides the availability requirements posed by resilience (see bullet above), maintenance of integrity is  another basic function needed by such systems. Besides the non-changeability of existing functions  and processed information while on the flow and at rest, such systems need to maintain non- repudiation of performed activities. This will be required, given that such systems may affect human  life (e.g. through accidents).   Trust is particularly important in autonomous systems: the complexity of such systems and the severe  impact (i.e. loss of life) of failure or malicious action opens the question on the trust among the  involved components. Taking into account potential ad-hoc interconnections among such systems (i.e.  via M2M), it becomes clear that models of trust for interacting systems will need to be developed.  Estimated timescale for rollout5: more than 10 years  Takeaways autonomous systems   Autonomous systems need to interact with other components based on some trust models.   Resilience of autonomous systems will reach new qualities, given their potential role in traffic and  health.   Autonomous systems will eventually require novel approaches in security mechanisms, especially in  their interaction with less reliable devices such as sensors, eventually belonging to IoT environments.  The Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT)  3.6.1 Technological challenges  After the introduction of the Internet of Things14, scientists elaborate on the possibility to combine  Internet-enabled devices with miniaturization and biological processes. It is being envisaged that  technology will provide “tools to control, reuse, modify, and reengineer the cells’ structure and function,  and it is expected to enable engineers to effectively use the biological cells as programmable substrates”15.  In this context an implementation of Bio-Nano Things as biological embedded computing devices is being  considered as a main enabler.  14 https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-internet-of-things-goes-nano/, accessed April 2017.  15 https://bwn.ece.gatech.edu/papers/2015/j3.pdf, accessed April 2017.  https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-internet-of-things-goes-nano/ https://bwn.ece.gatech.edu/papers/2015/j3.pdf  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  16  If seen together with developments in DNA research, biocomputing16,17 and advances in e-health and  medicine, IoBNT opens up numerous avenues for technological breakthroughs where cyber becomes part  of and controls vital human biological processes18.  Such a development will bring massive challenges to technology, including ethical, social, legal economic  and political aspects, to mention the most imminent ones. Though the effects of these developments are  difficult to assess by now, technologist will need to be aware that a lot of work will be necessary in order to  cope with such challenges.  3.6.2 Security challenges  Coverage of security issues in IoBNT will bring massive challenges for security and cyber-security: level of  protection will be the highest possible, as the assets to be protected are the building blocks of life and  health. Moreover, trust in the functions and in the communication between all involved components will  be of great importance. Finally, requirements of identification, accountability, non-repudiation and  integrity functions will be decisive for the development and deployment of IoBNT.  Estimated timescale for rollout5: more than 10 years  Takeaways IoBNT   IoBNT will bring enormous challenges for information security / cyber-security. This is because of the  interdisciplinary nature of assets involved in this sector.   An initial risk assessment of these technologies will be absolutely vital to understand the implications  of this technology.   Due to the nature of the application area and the very nature of the involved components and their  interaction, it will be necessary to expand existing security techniques in order to achieve the required  protection needed.  AI and Robotics  3.7.1 Technological Challenges  Artificial intelligence (AI) in computer science AI refers to computer systems/services/applications that  perceive their environment and use this potentially incomplete data from the environment to maximize  the success rate of completing a certain task. AI techniques and methods can range from simple decision  making algorithms, to pattern recognition and data mining, as well as to deep learning and other  reinforcement learning techniques to name a few. Interesting showcase examples of AI include robotics,  autonomous driving, drones, medical diagnostics, personal assistants, etc.   Complex and large landscape: Robotics and AI build on a wealth of information that enable intelligent  decision making. AI and robotics go hand-in-hand in facilitating the deployment of intelligent, adaptive,  context-aware services and applications. It is therefore evident that the complexity of securing AI  touches upon many areas and domains, hence security controls need to be adaptive and operate in  16 https://singularityhub.com/2017/04/12/scientists-hacked-a-cells-dna-and-made-a-biocomputer-out-of-it/,  accessed April 2017.  17 http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nbt.3805.html, accessed April 2017.  18 https://futurism-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/futurism.com/kurzweil-by-2030-nanobots-will-flow-throughout-our- bodies/amp/, accessed April 2017.  https://singularityhub.com/2017/04/12/scientists-hacked-a-cells-dna-and-made-a-biocomputer-out-of-it/ http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nbt.3805.html https://futurism-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/futurism.com/kurzweil-by-2030-nanobots-will-flow-throughout-our-bodies/amp/ https://futurism-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/futurism.com/kurzweil-by-2030-nanobots-will-flow-throughout-our-bodies/amp/  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  17  these coordinated settings. This kind of security controls are novel and are still subject of new  development.   Financial costs: the wide penetration of AI in several critical sectors denotes the potential of significant  financial costs associated to cyber security, compared with the ones needed for the replaced  components/humans.   Omnipresence: while AI is rightly heralded as one of the technologies that bring about both a societal  and technological paradigm shift, it might be established as something that people rely on, without  giving too much awareness to associated risks. As with most innovations, in its adoption phase it is  more prevalent to consider the benefits of AI without much consideration to its shortcomings.   Large supply chain: there is a great number of stakeholders involved in every AI solution, e.g. software  developers, hardware manufacturers, network providers, software providers, service providers of big  data/machine learning solutions, data exchange protocols, mathematicians, etc. to name a few.   Algorithmic integrity: AI usually being a black box does not allow for algorithmic verification, whereas  the dynamic and evolving nature of said algorithms hinders forensic efforts. The problem is  exacerbated by the fact that algorithms are tightly linked to the data that was used to train and test  them, which when modified can lead to whole different algorithm behaviours. Therefore, verification  of the aforementioned algorithms to ensure they are not biased and are secure and trustworthy is of  high importance.  3.7.2 Security Challenges  AI technologies facilitate intelligent and automated decision-making and are thus a prerequisite to the  deployment of IoT and Industry 4.0 scenarios. The paramount need for security in such scenarios,  therefore naturally extends to AI. By analysing existing material on AI and robotics, ENISA has identified a  series of cybersecurity challenges. Though not exhaustive, the cyber-security risks and challenges below  are indicative:   Trust: given the particularity of AI that supports automated decision making often not considering  human input at all, the notion of trust emerges as being of paramount importance. Robotics systems  need to interact with other components based on some trust models. How this trust is built into such  AI-based systems, how it is propagated in a chain of trust, how it can be used to promote user  awareness and how it can be used to raise concern over security implications, are among the open  challenges in the domain.   Very large attack surface: the threats and risks related to robotics and AI are manifold and they evolve  rapidly. With great impact on citizens’ health, safety and privacy (data collection and processing may  be unclear to the users), the threat landscape concerning AI is extremely wide.   Complex landscape: security concerns are exacerbated since AI and its application on robotics should  not be seen as a collection of standalone algorithms and solutions, but rather as a rich, diverse and  wide ecosystem involving aspects such as software, hardware, data, devices, communications,  interfaces, and people.   Uncertainty: The very nature of autonomous robotics systems relies on a certain degree of uncertainty,  given the lack of deterministic such systems. Security controls need to consider this aspect and provide  appropriate solutions.   Transparency: transparency of decision making implies the need for AI to be able to justify the cause of  actions and the logical flow of decision making. Why a decision was taken is something to be made  available to regulators and users alike, to increase trust and appropriate responsibilities if needed.  Acceptance and hence adoption of robotics relies on such transparency.  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  18   Widespread deployment: apart from commercial applications of AI (e.g. smart notifications regarding  wearables), recent trends see Critical Infrastructures (CIs) migrating toward Smart ones by employing  AI on top of legacy infrastructures, namely Industry 4.0 (e.g. robotics in manufacturing). Dynamic  security controls to cater for the different context under which said systems will operate need to be  considered.   Safety and security process integration: this is a very challenging task since it involves possibly  contradicting viewpoints and requirements from all involved stakeholders. Safety challenges are in  their own extremely high in the agenda. Security for safety should be promoted since AI decisions and  actions of robots can have serious and solid effects on the physical world.   Repercussions for personal data and privacy: AI may lead to concentration of massive knowledge  about user behaviour within few organisations/companies. It will be a challenge to guarantee  compliance of this concentration with privacy regulation and information security practices. Moreover,  the need for AI to collect and process data is likely to impact the behaviour of consumers as their  personal data and privacy might risk to be disclosed to illegitimate parties. In this respect the way  consent is provided, the way an application on AI operates, the way data is relayed from one algorithm  to another, etc., need to be further analysed.  Estimated timescale for rollout5: 5 to 10 yeas  Takeaways AI and Robotics   There is a need to understand the building blocks of AI and robotics technologies AND their interplay.  Based on this (technological) information, security experts will be in the position to identify their risk  exposure.   Threats and weaknesses pertinent to the components of AI and robotics have to be assessed. Given  the wide scope of use of these technologies, this assessment needs to include both technical and non- technical issues.   Both social and technological issues identified need to be addressed by policy: the role of various  stakeholders will need to be identified; the level of necessary guidance through governments; the  interface to various existing regulation, etc.   It is important to ensure security in all stages of the life cycle of products and services, especially in the  design, development phase (testing, because of API reuse), and the usage and maintenance (security  patch, especially when using third-party security functions/API).  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  19  4. Consolidation of collected ideas: Emerging Security Related Areas  Certification  Through mobile computing, smart devices and IoT, security protection is relevant for many families of  devices and commodities. This increases the need for a seal regarding certifying existence and efficiency of  security functions, in a similar manner to seals used for electric appliances19.  Existing certification schemes, however, are too “heavy” (i.e. expensive, rigid, narrowly scoped and static).  These properties are not “compatible” with the characteristics of IoT devices that are short-lived,  inexpensive and may rapidly change their mode of operation. In many cases, the effort to obtain a  certification of security functions may drastically lower the economic benefits emerging from the product  marketing. This fact acts as a disincentive to security certificates.  Over time, various ideas for security certification have been developed in order to overcome the  deficiencies mentioned.  One of those ideas is related to the creation of artificial exposure of devices via simulated cyber-threat  landscapes. This would show the level of resistance/protection offered by various security products.  Though not formal, such an approach could be a pragmatic, economically efficient way to check the  security level offered by commercial products. A similar approach is followed by the commission in the  area of research (H2020) by means of an open call20.  Other existing ideas include trustworthiness models for vendors and/or components (both hard- and  software). In such a scenario, evaluators are called upon to assess the effectiveness of security functions  based on knowledge of the utilized architecture and exposure scenarios (see also discussion on  trustworthiness below). Whereas the latter option is similar to the one mentioned in the paragraph above.  Software liability may be an area that will impact the developments in innovative, short living  components/technologies.  ENISA has a series of activities in the area of security certification of products21 and supports the  commission and Member States to establish a framework for mapping Europe-wide available certification  standards. As an additional element hereto, both stakeholders and ENISA plan to elaborate on lightweight  certification schemes to be applied to retail hard- and software components deployed in consumer- oriented environments and applications (e.g. IoT, eHelath, connected home, etc.).  It is worth mentioning, that in its proposal on a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council  on the future of ENISA, the European Commission has delivered a draft of potential content for  certification22. This draft is subject to negotiations with EU Member States and stakeholders.  19 http://www.atbatt.com/laptop-chargers/adapter-safety-mark, accessed April 2017.  20 https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/ds-01-2016.html,  accessed April 2017.  21 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/ict-security-certification-for-industry/security-certification-of-ict-products-in- europe, accessed April 2017.  22 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/european-commission-proposal-on-a-regulation-on-the-future-of- enisa, accessed September 2017.  http://www.atbatt.com/laptop-chargers/adapter-safety-mark https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/ds-01-2016.html https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/ict-security-certification-for-industry/security-certification-of-ict-products-in-europe https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/ict-security-certification-for-industry/security-certification-of-ict-products-in-europe https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/european-commission-proposal-on-a-regulation-on-the-future-of-enisa https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/european-commission-proposal-on-a-regulation-on-the-future-of-enisa  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  20  Takeaways Certification   Existing certification schemes are not appropriate for lightweight devices similar to the ones found in  IoT.   Novel approaches for the development of alternative methods to check the cyber-security functions  will be necessary.   ENISA supports the Commission in consolidating existing approaches.  One virtual terrain, many actors: civil, LE and military societies on cyber-space  The cyber-space is the virtual terrain on which various criminal/illegal/offensive acts are taking place.  When notified upon the existence of such incidents/acts, various professional actors who own IT- components at stake will take some actions to protect their assets. Similarly, national security, law  enforcement and military forces may intervene to take care of the effects of cyber-incidents.  Just as in a real space/territory, a serious security incident will attract the simultaneous attention of  national security, law enforcement and eventually military forces. Due to lessons learned from this field, it  is apparent that the deployment of forces acting in the terrain of the incidents reserves careful  coordination. Otherwise the risk does exist to create more harm through the rescue forces than the  incident itself.  The fact that the cyber-space is practically virtual and attribution is difficult makes the coordination of the  acting organisations even more difficult, yet critical. If seen in combination with the fact that the  regulatory frameworks for coordinated action of various forces is not yet in place, it becomes apparent  how urgent this matter is, in particular in a cross-border, pan European manner23.  This has been already understood by the relevant community. Cyber-crisis management cooperation is  considered as one important matter that needs to be taken forward, both at the level of Commission24 and  ENISA25. Given the draft provided by the commission on the future of ENISA22, it is expected that quite  some developments will happen in this area in the coming period.  Takeaways coordination of actions   Like in other areas of life (e.g. crises, catastrophic events, etc.) it will be necessary to coordinate  activities of various players including defence, law enforcement, rescue forces.   Cyber-crisis cooperation is an important area that needs to be addressed.  Trustworthiness  Trustworthiness, a collection of characteristics that make an entity trustful with regard to an interaction  with others. The need to become trusted among various interacting parties is not a new security issue. This  23 https://www.eu2017.ee/news/press-releases/estonia-conduct-first-cyber-defence-exercise-defence-ministers,  accessed September 2017.  24 http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-16-2322_en.htm, accessed April 2017.  25 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/strategies-for-incident-response-and-cyber-crisis-cooperation, accessed  April 2017.  https://www.eu2017.ee/news/press-releases/estonia-conduct-first-cyber-defence-exercise-defence-ministers http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-16-2322_en.htm https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/strategies-for-incident-response-and-cyber-crisis-cooperation  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  21  need has emerged in e-commerce over the past decade. Various models have been developed, some  based on strong authentication (e.g. PKI based) and others are based on reputation models26.  While such models fulfil their purpose, e.g. within e-commerce platforms and transactions, they might not  necessarily be applicable to various emerging technology areas as the ones mentioned in section 4. We  expect that various new trust models will be developed, in particular for components establishing  communication in ad-hoc manner via wireless protocols. Such models will be necessary in order to achieve  the data protection / data privacy that is appropriate in order to obtain the necessary user trust.  A challenge that has to be addressed by authentication based systems is definitely scalability: given the  number of devices/services and the large number of interactions, the performance of the authentication  process (including the processing of involved credentials) may be a limiting factor for deployment.  Given multi-vendor and ad-hoc manner of interoperability of components, it is expected that existing trust  infrastructures (e.g. ones based on PKI, encryption, etc.) will need to increase their interoperability in order  to mutually recognise trusted components. This need will lead to new business models for trust  infrastructure providers. Moreover, the necessary functions and infrastructure may be part of “all- inclusive” service portfolios of globally acting big players engaged in related fields. It can be expected tht  trust and trustworthiness may cross-fertilize the area of certification.  Takeaways trustworthiness   New trust models will be developed to accommodate the needs of ad-hoc components interactions.   Existing and new trust infrastructures will need to fulfil necessary interoperability and performance  requirements.   Trust models will be important for the acceptance of the service offerings and can be thus seamlessly  integrated in service portfolios.  Security coverage of complete lifecycle  Given the complexity and of current and future infrastructures, systems, applications and services, the  coverage of security during the complete life cycle of all kinds of IT-products is inevitable. Including  security in all phases of IT-products covers design, development, testing, procurement, operation,  management and phase-out. IT-product liability is an issue that will require attention in the coming  time27,28,29. Together with proper configuration and maintenance of the components from the user side,  security coverage of the life-cycle is one of the conditions for the achievement of liability of IT-products.  This service level will need to be kept during the entire life-cycle of products, often having lifespans up to  few decades30.  There is one more important reason for including security in the complete lifecycle, namely the possibility  to implement a holistic security management or integrate the relevant component in an existing security  management system.  26 http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse522/05au/reputation-ebay.pdf, accessed April 2017.  27 https://threatpost.com/software-liability-is-inevitable/114136/, accessed April 2017.  28 https://devant.co.uk/software-companies-new-liability-under-the-commercial-agents-regulations-1993/, accessed  April 2017.  29 https://www.itnews.com.au/blogentry/software-liability-is-coming-447800, accessed April 2017.  30 http://plcwhatisplcscada.blogspot.gr/, accessed June 2017.  http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse522/05au/reputation-ebay.pdf https://threatpost.com/software-liability-is-inevitable/114136/ https://devant.co.uk/software-companies-new-liability-under-the-commercial-agents-regulations-1993/ https://www.itnews.com.au/blogentry/software-liability-is-coming-447800 http://plcwhatisplcscada.blogspot.gr/  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  22  The ability of a component to be integrated into an overall security management system is very important:  in the emerging technology areas mentioned above, the availability of security management is an enabler  for the achievement of acceptable security and protection levels. Moreover, one can make the assumption  that most of the professionally used IT-Infrastructures will be part of a security management system.  A final point that can be made here is the need to encompass agility both in the ability of components to  integrate to existing security management platforms, and the ability of security management platforms to  adapt to the changing threat landscape.  Takeaways security lifecycle   Inclusion of security in product development lifecycles is a precondition for the necessary  improvement of security in infrastructures of all kinds.   Inclusion of security in product development lifecycles increases agility with regard to changing threat  environment.   Security in product development lifecycle is the only way to incorporate IT-components into holistic  security management schemes.  Upcoming issues in the area of Encryption  Currently, we see a race between those who want privacy, e.g. encryption, and those that want security  through surveillance. In 2016, there is evidence that the privacy vs. national security battle is as uncertain  as never before. Various states tend to develop own interpretations on how cyber-security and  surveillance will be implemented in order to ensure national security31.  Nonetheless, having different encryption and privacy regulations, new encryption “legislation geographies”  are created. Citizens on the move within these areas may find their compliance status changing. This is a  similar situation as older generations have experienced when strong encryption was restricted in the US by  law32. Given that ca. half of the internet traffic is already encrypted33, national security sees this as an  increasing obstacle in gaining intelligence from data communications.  At the same time, states and industry work on censorship functions and on control of massive traffic  streams/bandwidths. And political developments show a trend towards de-globalization. This may lead to  control centres of big parts of the internet. Such entities may be in the position to exert their power to all  nations and individuals who have caused this traffic34. The tension created by this diverging development  will certainly bother the cyber-security community in the future.  As regards competition, it is considered meaningful to bundle existing EU-capabilities in cryptography.  European competitive advances in areas such as key management, hardware crypto, identification  methods, encryption and data protection belong to core of EU capabilities. Any relevant resources, skills  and knowledge hereto should be consolidated and used within engagement and support frameworks (e.g.  EU programmes, Member State supported development plans, etc.).  31 https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/19/extreme-surveillance-becomes-uk-law-with-barely-a-whimper,  accessed June 2017.  32 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_of_cryptography_from_the_United_States, accessed June 2017.  33 https://www.wired.com/2017/01/half-web-now-encrypted-makes-everyone-safer/, accessed June 2017.  34 http://www.iisp.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/documents/2017_threats_report_finalblu-web.pdf, accessed June  2017.  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/19/extreme-surveillance-becomes-uk-law-with-barely-a-whimper https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_of_cryptography_from_the_United_States https://www.wired.com/2017/01/half-web-now-encrypted-makes-everyone-safer/ http://www.iisp.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/documents/2017_threats_report_finalblu-web.pdf  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  23  In particular, European advances in medical device certification standards and regulation may be  considered in order to impose high European security requirements for such devices and implement  competitive advantages for European vendors of that are engaged in this market.  Last but not least, new models for use of cryptography are being developed in an attempt to secure  component interactions within IoT environments/applications. This trend is quite strong and is related to  the implementation business processes on IoT infrastructures, such as e-payment options via digital  currencies. It is expected that usage of encryption will be a key technology for securing such interactions  both within IoT but also other technology areas.  Concluding this section one should mention the importance of technological advances: secure encryption  schemes and protocols, for instance in the light of Quantum Computers, and possible other mathematical  breakthroughs will be crucial. Both from the defenders and offenders sides. Such developments make a  working crypto an indispensable component.  Takeaways security encryption   At nation-state level encryption is seen as a barrier in lawful surveillance. Nation-states will invest  resources in overcoming these barrier.   Vendors/providers are interested in weak data protection that will allow them to have a better  international presence with uniform security standards that will ease product  development/integration efforts35.   EU should capitalize on existing advances of encryption technology and services in this area to  implement global market leadership.   New usage models for encryption functions are under development. This will boost the need to include  encryption functions in soft- and hardware products.  Identification  Just as now, identification will be in the future THE function in all kinds of interconnected technologies,  individuals, components and all other identifiable objects in cyber-space. Identification is a necessary  prerequisite for trust, but also non-repudiation, that is, the non-debatable evidence that an action has  happened between two or more identifiable subjects.  Currently, most forms of identification cover human subjects and are used mostly within authentication.  Moreover, quite some identification/authentication methods have been developed for non-human  subjects. In both cases, identities are one of the most desirable objects for cyber-criminals. For obvious  reasons, personally Identifiable Information (PII) tops breached data.  Recent research shows the shortcomings in current implementation of cutting edge, widely deployed  biometric authentication methods36. Would such an authentication mechanism implementation be used  within e-health or financial applications? Obviously not; therefore it is necessary to (pre-) invest efforts in  identification/authentication methods that are appropriate for emerging technologies in order to avoid  sever incidents in critical IT systems.  35 http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/tisa-leaks-wie-das-dienstleistungsabkommen-den-datenschutz- gefaehrdet-a-1122844.html, accessed June 2017.  36 https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/10/technology/fingerprint-security-smartphones-apple-google-samsung.html,  accessed April 2017.  http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/tisa-leaks-wie-das-dienstleistungsabkommen-den-datenschutz-gefaehrdet-a-1122844.html http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/tisa-leaks-wie-das-dienstleistungsabkommen-den-datenschutz-gefaehrdet-a-1122844.html https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/10/technology/fingerprint-security-smartphones-apple-google-samsung.html  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  24  Two other equally important aspects in cyber-space that are subject to identification is anonymity and  attribution. Though being two sides of the same coin, both anonymity and non-repudiation of actions are  two functions/qualities that need to be supported by identification mechanisms. They bring an additional  dimension in the complexity of the entire identification area.  Finally, due to the rich digital footprint of users (e.g. summary of all digital traces), the notion of identity in  general needs to be reconsidered, as it goes far beyond typical identities as covered by today’s functions,  products and services. Moreover, identities of non-user components such as autonomous systems, will  become increasingly important, as they are going to undertake important functions of human life.  Takeaways identification   The interplay between identification and trust needs to be investigated.   The notion of anonymity, identity and non-repudiation need to be put in common basis and  considered in modern IT infrastructures, also with respect to privacy and security requirements.   The notion of identity needs to be put to a wider basis, as multiple user data allow for the definition of  exact profiles matching single users in the internet.  Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) as cybersecurity tools  AI/ML and IoT seems to be an interesting combination that gains in speed: AI and ML can be used to semi- automatically or automatically supervise simple tasks within an IoT environment37. This can be achieved by  leveraging on available knowledge/data (massively) created by interacting components/sensors. This can  be a great advantage given that fact that the internet never forgets. Such information could be used to  perform corrective actions of component interactions, thus increasing security and resilience.  Just as for many application areas, ML and AI are both interesting within cyber-security. They can be used  to detect attacks by identifying anomalies in operational or communication patterns of components.  Similarly, ML and AI can be used in the discovery of interrelationships required in the collection of cyber- threat intelligence, hence establishing context out of mass data. Similar activities are already reported in  the area of big data and national security38.  The use of ML and AI in security may also support the autonomous supervision of infrastructure and  application areas with regard to security management policies. To this extend, ML and AI will contribute  towards the revision of policy implementation and oversight that has been typically performed by humans  to a great extent. In this way, ML and AI may achieve costs reduction and increase of efficiency towards  secure operations.  Takeaways security AI and ML   AI and ML are important tools in the area of cyber-security. The can be used for context discovery in  the area of Threat Intelligence (TI).   A second very promising area is the use of ML and AI in the identification of attack patterns (i.e. based  on TI) and facilitation of security management/policy implementation supervision.  37 http://telecoms.com/480122/ericssons-big-black-box-full-of-ai-goodness-intrigues-at-mwc-2017/, accessed June  2017.  38 https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/09/27/national-security-relies-more-and-more- on-big-data-heres-why/?utm_term=.4072fff3ca40, accessed September 2017.  http://telecoms.com/480122/ericssons-big-black-box-full-of-ai-goodness-intrigues-at-mwc-2017/ https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/09/27/national-security-relies-more-and-more-on-big-data-heres-why/?utm_term=.4072fff3ca40 https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/09/27/national-security-relies-more-and-more-on-big-data-heres-why/?utm_term=.4072fff3ca40  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  25   AI and ML will be target to attacks. They might open new avenues in manipulation and attack  methods.  Getting end-user more involved  There is no doubt that cyber-security knowledge needs to be transferred to end-users. Numbers from  incident analysis show that over 50% of the incidents are due to common/basic user errors39,40. This makes  clear that user awareness, can become the most efficient security control by means of cost/benefit ratio.  Awareness actions for cyber-security do exist and education efforts are ongoing. Thought many initiatives  cover end user training, there is still plenty of space for improvements. Some examples are: security and  education, improvement of information awareness of decision makers, better enrolment of user in  managing security of their devices/applications, target group oriented methods for communication of  security information. The list and width/depth of this matter is quite wide. We believe that end-user  security is an important area that is not growing in analogy to the digitalization of the society.  Last but not least, it is known that there is a significant shortage in cyber-security skills. This need will be  further intensified in the future. New types of organisations from the area of military come to complete  the picture of big white-hat cyber-players. Yet the question is how to fill the gap in cyber-security and  cyber-threats skills. Is the enlargement of cyber-warfare going to affect other, commercial areas? This is a  difficult question given that already today, a wide grey area does exist among cyber-crime, cyber-warfare,  cyber-espionage, vendors, researches and other commercial organisations.  There is no question that the security community has to let people know more about it and decision  makers need to create more capacities to better educate people at all levels of education.  Takeaways involving the end user   Education and awareness on cyber-security needs to advance to include all levels and skills.   Professional education needs to try covering the skill shortage in the market.   Products need to take care of hiding complexity and supporting users to manage security parameters.  39 http://www.cybersecuritytrend.com/topics/cyber-security/articles/421821-human-error-to-blame-most- breaches.htm, accessed June 2017.  40 http://searchcompliance.techtarget.com/feature/Verizon-Human-error-still-among-the-top-data-security-threats,  accessed June 2017.  http://www.cybersecuritytrend.com/topics/cyber-security/articles/421821-human-error-to-blame-most-breaches.htm http://www.cybersecuritytrend.com/topics/cyber-security/articles/421821-human-error-to-blame-most-breaches.htm http://searchcompliance.techtarget.com/feature/Verizon-Human-error-still-among-the-top-data-security-threats  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  26  5. List of topics University of Federal Armed Forces (Universität der  Bundeswehr)  Participants of brainstorming session: Thomas Diefenbach, Peter Hillmann, Prof. Dr. Ulrike Lechner, Prof.  Dr. Axel Lehmann  During our brainstorming session on 3rd March 2017, we have raised the following topics of mutual  interest:  - Simulation of exposure to threats and materialization of risks is important, eventually by means of  scenarios. E.g. based on those scenarios, serious games on cyber security can be generated.  - Organic computing as self-protective/adaptive system organisation. This paradigm might be useful in  the context of resilience.  - Risk and perception of risks as a topic regarding own organisation. Perception of risks is an item that  needs to be elaborated on.  - Prediction of botnet activity on the basis of system behaviour such as recognition of patterns, etc.  seems to be an important element for research, simulation but also exercises.  - Threat analysis and threat landscaping, threat evolution, etc. is considered as an area of innovation.  Seen in conjunction with novel tools for operations and risk management, this area is a challenge for  the security community and the University in particular.  - Within a multi-project coordination effort, the University is involved in a project that covers IT-Security  match-playing. The game is in German, however, any player from ENISA would be very welcome.  - Data sharing for surfacing emergencies is an area of activity covering the needs for military  interventions in health matters. This experience is considered to be relevant for cyber-emergencies.  - Trace the operational pictures of security: consisting of measuring efficiency, social media aspects,  mentioning in dark fora and in the web, evaluation of environmental parameters, etc.  - ENISA will consider the EUROSTARS call (part of H2020 framework) to assess the possibility of finding  partners. This would enable the desired creation of synergies with the objective of product  development.  - ENISA will establish contacts to its experts for future interactions in the areas of:  - CIIP – Comprehensive and Integrated Infrastructure Program  - Simulation (serious games)  - E-health (ENISA provides access to available project/internal data)  - Cyber exercises and emergency coordination  - Networking (SDN – Software Defined Networks)  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  27  - On the basis of these interactions, the development of a yearly plan specifying delivery every 3 months  will take place. These plans are subject to revisions based on the progress made.  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  28  6.

ENISA Permanent Stakeholder Group: Key Topics for Future Work  Programmes  Below, a list of key topics for future work is presented. This list has been added after four years of  interaction the ENISA PSG (2015-2017)41. Within this chapter we try to show the relevance of these points  to the one mentioned in this report. This is being performed by means of a mapping between each  identified top priority and the content of the crystal ball report.  Top priorities and challenges mentioned by PSG members in this respect include the following:  1. Implementation of the new cyber-security strategy  Relevance: CONSIDERED AS NOT DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO EMERGING TECHNOLOGY AREAS  2. Cyber-security policy for the EU: Europeans dependence from external cyber security assets has been  increasing rapidly. At the same time a large portion of European Cyber Security providers have been  merged to foreign companies, or totally vanished. Only EU’s biggest countries still have governmental  support to build competences and companies and tight governmental control for national security  purposes. ENISA should support building European new cyber security policy, which would be  reflecting the real situation. European current situation where EU MB's are having cyber security and  policy defining assets, policy, hardware, standards etc. coming largely from one single non-European  country, when in the same time fastest development, understanding European like dependency from  external cyber security assets, is happening outside this one country. ENISA should either build policy  which defends European only cyber-security assets and competences, or ENISA should make policy  which should fully utilise international best practises and technologies which are coming countries  having similar dependencies like EU and still build holistic Cybersecurity to protect digital sovereignty  and citizen’s privacy.  Relevance: CONSIDERED AS NOT DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO EMERGING TECHNOLOGY AREAS  3. GDPR and NIS guideline for European Industry: There are two major disturbances coming next year.  GDPR and NIS directive. Both are changing cyber security rules fundamentally and are also for first  time, entering the national cyber security policy space. Some national governmental stakeholders are  facing the challenge not to be able to support and guide public, or private companies which will fall  under one, or both directives. Now there is a clear need for clear communication and support even  directly to these companies/Institutions.  Relevance: CONSIDERED AS NOT DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO EMERGING TECHNOLOGY AREAS  4.

With many sensors IoT devices are often (and often  unexpected by users) collecting data. This holds not only for smartphones or hoovers and other robot-  like devices, but also e.g. toys (puppets, toy tanks, etc.). It is important for users to know what data are  collected and how, and where they may be flowing, so that users can make decisions about this. Given  the often small user interfaces this is not easy. At the same time, it is important, that users get  assurance, that the decisions on data flows are really respected and implemented by the IoT devices.  So the security/privacy testing and evaluation of these devices is essential.  Relevance: See challenges mentioned in section Internet of Things.  Looking into the crystal ball  Version 1.0 | January 2018  31  15. Privacy respecting identity management in eIDAS (electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust  Services) context. Meanwhile the more and more eIDAS services are being established. Most of them  deal with personal identities and identifiers. Often these identifiers are for assurance reasons spread  through many entities (e.g. the “calling home effect” in in the STORK PEPS protocols), which is creating  privacy issues, as too many entities are learning about the users’ interests and behaviour on the  Internet. As now a number of real eIDAS services exist, it is time for a privacy analysis of these.  Relevance: Privacy issues mentioned in security challenges of section Trustworthiness and  Identification and AI and Robotics  16. Reacting to Cyberattacks: Cyberattacks are real existing threats, but it is still unclear what an  appropriate response to these threats might be. Is it for example acceptable to start a counter-attack  against the originator of a cyberattack, although it is known that the counterstrike has consequences  for uninvolved nations, people, and infrastructures? For this reason it is important to establish useful  rules and measures, which take into account the juridical status on the national / EU level as well as  political, social and ethical requirements.  Relevance: Coordination issues mentioned in section  One virtual terrain, many actors: civil, LE and  military societies on cyber-space  17. Industry 4.0: The digitalisation of the industry provides various challenges regarding IT security. To  maintain and increase the competitiveness of products supplied by European manufacturers, it is  important to raise the IT security level in the industry. Therefore, it is necessary to create common  framework conditions and regulations for Industry 4.0 applications and infrastructures to establish a  high IT security level within the EU.

There are too many actors to  coordinate, Member States, Europol, CERT-EU, ENISA, etc. Enforcing and increasing the activities of  cyber-exercises could give to the Industry (mainly Critical Operators) new capabilities and also improve  current capabilities. Organising one Cyber-Europe exercise each two years could be poor, as there is a  need to test, to train, to stress organizations, to prepare for next incidents and new situations. Make it  possible for PSG members to participate as observers during the cyber-exercises. PSGs could be  counsellors, proposing new topics and scenarios, studying and analysing the activities and also  improving with more lessons learned the reports on results.

Relevance: CONSIDERED AS NOT DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO EMERGING TECHNOLOGY AREAS  26. Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) helps service providers become more agile and reduce their  costs. However, NFV’s new architecture, operations, and openness create new security challenges.  Those challenges must be overcome for service providers to scale NFV and earn its business benefits.  The needs here are a risk identification methodology, followed by a careful review of the top security  risks when migrating services to NFV. The intent is to provide security practitioners with a basis for  developing a documented risk dashboard in order to bring down the overall security risk to an  acceptable level when migrating to NFV.  Relevance: Virtualization issues mentioned in section Next Generation IT infrastructure  27. 5G: As observed by 3GPP today, 5G networks will require complex security requirements at different  layers within the system. Moreover, with standardization at an early stage, innovative security  solutions proportionate to the threats will have to be built into the network from the very start. This  approach will protect subscribers, devices and their communications, as well as the integrity of the  network itself-whatever the use case. Investing in 5G security now is also a wise insurance policy to  avoid unexpected costs that might arise later from countering attacks or from suffering the  consequences of insufficiently protected high-value data. The wrong decision about security today will  only prove to be false economy in the future.

A great many of these initiatives either directly or indirectly integrate cybersecurity  concerns, challenges and solutions, and they were introduced in December 2020 in the  EU’s new cybersecurity strategy. ENISA is ready and indeed very proud to contribute to  making these initiatives and their implementation a success, whether by promoting the  uptake of the EU’s first cybersecurity certification schemes, revising the network and  information security (NIS) directive and the electronic identification and trust services  (eIDAS) regulation, supporting the full implementation of the EU’s 5G Cybersecurity  Toolbox or fulfilling its roles in the European Cybersecurity Competence Centre, the  Network of National Coordination Centres and the new Joint Cyber Unit. ENISA will  use its new mandate, the expanded tasks and the fresh resources given to it by the  2019 Cybersecurity Act to make sure that it remains a key and reliable player and  partner within the EU’s cybersecurity ecosystem, able to tackle the ever-moving target  of cybersecurity. Furthermore, it will make sure that the need for future resources is  understood and that resources remain tailored to the EU’s cybersecurity prerogatives.  In the second year of my tenure, I have been inspired in my work by the motivation  and drive of the EU cybersecurity community – from my ENISA colleagues in their daily  work to the political leaders and the European stakeholder community across the  EU and in the national institutions in their united vision and support. There is a real  common determination and a ‘let’s do it’ approach to making Europe more cybersecure.  We will need to maintain that momentum to tackle the ever-growing sophistication  of cyberattackers and cyber challenges. Only in this way will we be able to establish  European technological autonomy in the area of cybersecurity.  I am particularly proud that we – the Agency’s staff and Management Board together  – have laid solid foundations to make ENISA more agile, more connected and more  performance-orientated, and this is reflected in the new organisational structure  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 5  of ENISA, operational since 1 January 2021, and in the way we work. This has been  enshrined in the 2020 ENISA strategy A Trusted and Cyber Secure Europe. And the  effects are showing: we are increasingly able to attract cybersecurity talent from all  over the EU to help us make a difference. In addition, with the generous support of  our Greek host authorities, we have moved to larger premises in Athens, and we are  expanding our networks throughout the EU, specifically through the imminent opening  of a local office in Brussels.  The full positive effects of these investments will be truly felt only once we have overcome  the current pandemic, but I am convinced that we will come out of this stronger, more  united and better prepared to embark on the European digital decade project.  Juhan Lepassaar Executive Director  I  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 7  The year 2020 was characterised by the increased  prioritisation of EU digital policies, through initiatives  such as the Digital Services Act, the proposals for  cybersecurity-specific revisions to the NIS directive, and  many other digital initiatives, such as the European  digital identity. The EU’s ambition in this area were  encapsulated in the phrase ‘making 2020–2030  “Europe’s Digital Decade”’, used by Commission  President Ursula von der Leyen in her State of the Union  address1 in September 2020. Where cybersecurity is  concerned, these ambitions were made more concrete  in the EU’s cybersecurity strategy2 for the digital decade,  released in December 2020, and also in the context  of ensuring the EU’s technological autonomy. This  prioritisation continued in 20213 and beyond.  ENISA welcomes the EU’s new cybersecurity strategy.  The strategy proposes, among many things, a review  of the NIS directive, a new critical entities resilience  directive, a network of security operations centres  (SOCs), new measures to strengthen the EU Cyber  Diplomacy Toolbox and the further implementation  of the 5G Cybersecurity Toolbox. The Agency is ready  to fully utilise its mandate and tasks to act in the  areas outlined by the strategy that are covered by  1 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ SPEECH_20_1655 2 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ IP_20_2391  3 And has been fortified by the most recent State of the  Union address (15 September 2021), which highlighted the  concepts of cooperation, resilience and situational awareness  (https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ SPEECH_21_4701).  its mandate over the period of the 2022–2024 single  programming document (SPD).  The COVID-19 pandemic has not only brought  healthcare challenges; it has also had an impact on  the process of digitalisation in Europe, worldwide and  across sectors, increased technological complexities  and exposed the need to boost technology skill sets.  These effects in turn have accelerated exposure to a  wide range of cybersecurity threats and threat actors,  as documented by ENISA in 2021, on the one hand, and  have increased the need for cybersecurity knowledge,  awareness, resilience, cooperation and solutions on the  other. This affects all aspects of ENISA’s work and the  cybersecurity ecosystem that the EU is building up.  ENISA’s eighth edition of its annual threat landscape  report4 confirmed current and future trends of  cyberattacks becoming ever-more sophisticated,  targeted, widespread and undetected. Malware was  again voted the EU’s number one cyber threat in a poll  of intelligence experts, and changes were observed in  phishing, identity theft and ransomware that moved  them to higher-ranking positions. Monetisation remains  cybercriminals’ top motivation, and the COVID-19  environment fuelled attacks on homes, businesses,  governments and critical infrastructure in 2020 and  early 2021. Industries and governments alike continue  to be hit by cyberespionage attacks. The number of  data breach incidents continues to be very high, and  4 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-threat- landscape-2020  PART I GENERAL CONTEXT  https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_20_1655 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_20_1655 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_2391 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_2391 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-threat-landscape-2020 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-threat-landscape-2020  8  the amount of stolen financial information and user  credentials is growing. Unfortunately, we are getting  used to hearing terms like ‘Bad Rabbit ransomware’,  ‘Winnti’, ‘Magecart’ and ‘watering hole attacks’. In  December 2020, the European Medicines Agency was a  victim of a cyberattack resulting in the leak of documents  relating to the evaluation processes for COVID-19  vaccines. In the same month, another cyberattack on the  software company SolarWinds through its supply chain  resulted in a back-door infiltration into its commercial  software application. The list has grown in 2021, with  further supply chain attacks with global implications,  such as the Kaseya and SITA attacks. The current  escalation and the threat landscape status require the  continual introduction of new methods and different  approaches for Europe to become cybersecure.  The adoption and implementation of policy  frameworks is one key area where the EU is making  a difference. Indeed, the policies and initiatives that  will be put in place in the coming years will determine  how the EU faces the cybersecurity challenges of  today and tomorrow. In this context, ENISA will  determine and adapt the support that it provides,  particularly in the following areas.  THE NIS2 DIRECTIVE  AND THE JOINT CYBER UNIT  Improving cyber resilience, particularly for those who  operate essential services such as healthcare and  energy or for those who provide online marketplace  services, has been the main focus of the current NIS  directive since 2016. The proposed expansion of its  scope, in the form of the new NIS2 directive, will see  far more entities obliged to take measures to increase  the level of cybersecurity in Europe.  A 2020 ENISA study on NIS investments5 showed that,  for organisations implementing the NIS directive,  ‘Unclear expectations’ (35 %) and ‘Limited support  from the national authority’ (22 %) were among the  challenges faced. The NIS2 proposal addresses these  areas, aiming to provide more clarity in terms of what  is expected of national authorities, computer security  incident response teams (CSIRTs), and essential  and important entities in terms of reporting, crisis  management and information sharing.  ENISA is already invested in the above areas, with  its resilience, cooperation and capacity-building  work, and will be building up its own capacities to  support the outcome of the proposal in the coming  years using existing resources and building on these  5 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/nis-investments  wherever necessary. This will also apply to increased  cooperation under the potential Joint Cyber Unit (JCU)  umbrella. ENISA will contribute to the implementation  of the Commission’s recommendation on ‘building  the Joint Cyber Unit’, with a view to contributing  to the establishment of an EU crisis management  framework. This includes fostering cooperation  among cybersecurity communities, among relevant  EU institutions, bodies and agencies, and within  (and between) civilian cooperation networks (i.e. the  Cyber Crisis Liaison Organisation Network (CyCLONe),  the CSIRTs Network and, to the extent needed,  Cooperation Group).  IMPLEMENTATION OF  THE EU CYBERSECURITY  CERTIFICATION FRAMEWORK  ENISA is playing a central role in supporting the  implementation of the European cybersecurity  certification framework by preparing and maintaining  the candidate schemes with the support of area  experts and in collaboration with public authorities in  Member States. It is expected that the draft candidate  cybersecurity certifications schemes proposed by  ENISA will be adopted as Commission implementing  regulations. A conformity assessment of digital products,  services and processes in the digital single market will  be enabled under the adopted schemes, therefore  improving their cybersecurity. At the time of writing,  ENISA has prepared a candidate scheme on common  criteria (common criteria based European candidate  cybersecurity certification scheme) and is advancing  its work on cloud services (European cybersecurity  certification scheme for cloud services) and 5G (EU5G).  Finalising the candidate schemes for the more  specialised product categories under the common  criteria and for cloud services is just the first step and  should start bringing initial benefits in terms of EU- wide certification processes and higher consumer and  user trust during 2022–2024.  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION  The EU is extending its support for and investments  in the wealth of expertise and experience in  cybersecurity research and technological and  industrial development that exists in the EU by  prioritising cybersecurity in its research and  innovation support efforts, and in particular  through its Horizon Europe and Digital Europe  programmes. It is also pooling resources and  expertise by setting up the European Cybersecurity  Competence Centre and the Network of National  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/nis-investments  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 9  PART I. General context  Coordination Centres6. ENISA is ready to contribute  to this essential area in the coming years within  the role given to it by the regulation establishing  the European Cybersecurity Competence Centre  and the Network of National Coordination Centres  and by the mandate of the Cybersecurity Act (CSA).  Some of this work is anticipated to take place in  2022–2024, and the particular tasks required will  become clearer as the Cybersecurity Competence  Centre becomes operational.  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  With the EU’s artificial intelligence (AI) agenda  advancing rapidly following the European  Commission proposal on AI7 and 2021 coordinated  plan on AI8, the EU is addressing the major  technological, ethical, legal and socioeconomic  challenges that must be met to put AI at the service of  European citizens and the economy, for instance by  considering linking high-risk AI systems to mandatory  trustworthiness requirements. One of these  challenges is understanding the interplay between  cybersecurity and AI and how this can affect the  availability, safety and resilience of future AI services  and applications.  Building on ENISA’s AI threat landscape report9 of  December 2020 and with the guidance of its Ad Hoc  Expert Group on AI10, the Agency can continue its  open dialogue with EU institutions in support of the  legislative initiatives reaching into 2022–2024. In this  way, ENISA can continue to support the Commission  and Member States by providing good security  practices and guidelines.  THE EUROPEAN DIGITAL  IDENTITY FRAMEWORK  The EU’s eIDAS regulation provides a framework for  interoperability of national electronic identification  (eID) schemes and sets up an EU-wide market of  electronic trust services. eID schemes and trust  services are crucial for the EU digital market  6 Regulation (EU) 2021/887 of 20 May 2021 establishing  the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and  Research Competence Centre and the Network of National  Coordination Centres. 7 Proposal for Regulation (EU) 2021/206 of 21 April 2021 laying  down harmonised rules on AI (Artificial Intelligence Act) and  amending certain Union legislative acts. 8 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/coordinated- plan-artificial-intelligence-2021-review 9 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-ai- threat-landscape-report-unveils-major-cybersecurity-challenges 10 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart- infrastructures/artificial_intelligence/ad-hoc-working-group  because they allow citizens and businesses to  carry out transactions online in a safe and trusted  way. In 2020, the Commission reviewed the eIDAS  regulation and identified several gaps. In June 2021,  the Commission adopted a proposal for a revised  legal framework establishing a European digital  identity11 that can be used by all EU citizens and by  EU businesses when carrying out online transactions.  In 2022–2024, ENISA will support Member States  and the Commission in the implementation and  development of the toolbox and the European digital  identity framework as set out in the Commission’s  recommendation of 3 June 202112 in addition to  promoting the exchange of good practices and  capacity building of relevant stakeholders.  FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS  In 2020, ENISA put forward a proposal to open a local  office in Brussels in accordance with Article 20(5)  of the CSA. This will strengthen ENISA’s position in  the digital ecosystem of the EU and in particular its  role in establishing synergies with EU institutions,  bodies, offices and agencies in the field of operational  cooperation at EU level. Moreover, the local office in  Brussels will aim to ensure regular and systematic  cooperation with EU institutions, bodies and  agencies and other competent bodies involved in  cybersecurity. Indeed, it will support the delivery of  tasks mandated to ENISA under Article 7 of the CSA,  in particular that of establishing and maintaining  structured cooperation with the Computer  Emergency Response Team for the EU institutions,  bodies and agencies (CERT-EU). A detailed and annual  cooperation plan is being integrated into ENISA’s SPD  and is part of the memorandum of understanding  (MoU) signed in early 2021. This will enable both  organisations to benefit from synergies provided  by proximity and daily contact and to avoid any  duplication of activities.  In 2021, ENISA established a cooperation agreement13  with the European Telecommunications Standards  Institute (ETSI). ETSI and ENISA have the common  objective of collaborating on, contributing to and  promoting regional and international standardisation.  There is mutual interest in avoiding any duplication  of technical work, and in adopting an aligned and  complementary approach to the standardisation  process in specific domains.  11 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021PC0281 12 Commission Recommendation (EU) 2021/946 of 3 June 2021  on a common union toolbox for a coordinated approach towards  a European digital identity framework. 13 Signature pending.  https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/coordinated-plan-artificial-intelligence-2021-review https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/coordinated-plan-artificial-intelligence-2021-review https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-ai-threat-landscape-report-unveils-major-cybersecurity-challenges https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-ai-threat-landscape-report-unveils-major-cybersecurity-challenges https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/artificial_intelligence/ad-hoc-working-group https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/artificial_intelligence/ad-hoc-working-group https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021PC0281 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021PC0281  10  II  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 11  PART II WORK PROGRAMME 2022  This is the main body of the work programme,  describing, as per operational and corporate activity,  what the Agency aims to deliver in the respective year  in terms of achieving its strategy and the expected  results. In total, nine operational activities and two  corporate activities have been identified to support  the implementation of ENISA’s mandate in 2022.  The activities of the work programme seek to mirror  and align with the tasks set out in Chapter II of the  CSA, demonstrating concretely not only the specific  objectives, results and outputs expected for each task  but also the resources assigned.  12  3.1. OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES  ACTIVITY 1: Providing assistance in policy  development  Overview of activity  This activity delivers assistance and advice to the EU and Member States in developing cybersecurity policy and  sector-specific policy and law initiatives where matters related to cybersecurity are involved, and on the basis  of the new 2020 EU cybersecurity strategy. Aspects such as privacy and personal data protection are taken into  consideration (including encryption).  This activity seeks to bolster policy initiatives on novel/emerging technology areas by providing technical, fact- driven and tailor-made cybersecurity advice and recommendations. In addition to support in emerging policy  areas (such as AI, 5G, EU eID, quantum computing, blockchain, big data, digital resilience and response to current  and future crises), ENISA – in coordination with the Commission and Member States – will also conduct policy  scouting to support the Commission and Member States in identifying potential areas of policy development,  as well as develop monitoring capabilities and tools to regularly and consistently be able to give advice on the  effectiveness of existing EU policy and law in accordance with the EU’s institutional competencies in this area.  The added value of this activity is to support the decision-makers in a timely manner on developments at  technological, societal and economic market levels that might affect the cybersecurity policy framework (see also  activity 8). Given the cross-cutting nature of cybersecurity across the policy landscape, this activity will provide an  up-to-date risk-based analysis of cybersecurity not only in the areas of critical infrastructure and sectors, but also  by providing advice across the field in an integrated and holistic manner. The legal basis for this activity is Article  5 of the CSA.  Objectives  •  Foster cybersecurity as an integral part of EU  policy (existing and new).  •  Ensure that EU policymakers are regularly  informed about the effectiveness of the  existing frameworks and EU policymakers and  stakeholders are provided with timely and  tailor-made policy recommendations on future  cybersecurity challenges and opportunities.

It further supports initiatives related to implementation of policy frameworks on novel digital technologies such  as 5G (e.g. 5G Cybersecurity Toolbox) and assisting the work of the NIS Cooperation Group and its work streams.  Contribution towards the Commission’s regular monitoring of the implementation of specific EU policies is  envisaged, which considers relevant indicators and could contribute to possible indices that could capture the  maturity of relevant cybersecurity policies, and provide input to the review of existing policies (output 1.3).  This activity helps to avoid fragmentation and supports a coherent implementation of the digital single market  across Member States, following a consistent approach to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection.  The legal basis for this activity is Article 5 and Article 6(1)(b) of the CSA.  Objectives  •  Consistent development of sectoral Union  policies with horizontal Union policy to avoid  implementation inconsistencies.  •  Contribute to the efficient and effective monitoring  of EU cybersecurity policy implementation in  Member States.  •  Effective implementation of cybersecurity policy  across the EU and aim to support consistency of  Member State laws, regulations and administrative  provisions related to cybersecurity.  •  Improved cybersecurity practices, taking on board  lessons learnt from incident reports.

A great many of these initiatives either directly or indirectly integrate cybersecurity  concerns, challenges and solutions, and they were introduced in December 2020 in the  EU’s new cybersecurity strategy. ENISA is ready and indeed very proud to contribute to  making these initiatives and their implementation a success, whether by promoting the  uptake of the EU’s first cybersecurity certification schemes, revising the network and  information security (NIS) directive and the electronic identification and trust services  (eIDAS) regulation, supporting the full implementation of the EU’s 5G Cybersecurity  Toolbox or fulfilling its roles in the European Cybersecurity Competence Centre, the  Network of National Coordination Centres and the new Joint Cyber Unit. ENISA will  use its new mandate, the expanded tasks and the fresh resources given to it by the  2019 Cybersecurity Act to make sure that it remains a key and reliable player and  partner within the EU’s cybersecurity ecosystem, able to tackle the ever-moving target  of cybersecurity. Furthermore, it will make sure that the need for future resources is  understood and that resources remain tailored to the EU’s cybersecurity prerogatives.  In the second year of my tenure, I have been inspired in my work by the motivation  and drive of the EU cybersecurity community – from my ENISA colleagues in their daily  work to the political leaders and the European stakeholder community across the  EU and in the national institutions in their united vision and support. There is a real  common determination and a ‘let’s do it’ approach to making Europe more cybersecure.  We will need to maintain that momentum to tackle the ever-growing sophistication  of cyberattackers and cyber challenges. Only in this way will we be able to establish  European technological autonomy in the area of cybersecurity.  I am particularly proud that we – the Agency’s staff and Management Board together  – have laid solid foundations to make ENISA more agile, more connected and more  performance-orientated, and this is reflected in the new organisational structure  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 5  of ENISA, operational since 1 January 2021, and in the way we work. This has been  enshrined in the 2020 ENISA strategy A Trusted and Cyber Secure Europe. And the  effects are showing: we are increasingly able to attract cybersecurity talent from all  over the EU to help us make a difference. In addition, with the generous support of  our Greek host authorities, we have moved to larger premises in Athens, and we are  expanding our networks throughout the EU, specifically through the imminent opening  of a local office in Brussels.  The full positive effects of these investments will be truly felt only once we have overcome  the current pandemic, but I am convinced that we will come out of this stronger, more  united and better prepared to embark on the European digital decade project.  Juhan Lepassaar Executive Director  I  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 7  The year 2020 was characterised by the increased  prioritisation of EU digital policies, through initiatives  such as the Digital Services Act, the proposals for  cybersecurity-specific revisions to the NIS directive, and  many other digital initiatives, such as the European  digital identity. The EU’s ambition in this area were  encapsulated in the phrase ‘making 2020–2030  “Europe’s Digital Decade”’, used by Commission  President Ursula von der Leyen in her State of the Union  address1 in September 2020. Where cybersecurity is  concerned, these ambitions were made more concrete  in the EU’s cybersecurity strategy2 for the digital decade,  released in December 2020, and also in the context  of ensuring the EU’s technological autonomy. This  prioritisation continued in 20213 and beyond.  ENISA welcomes the EU’s new cybersecurity strategy.  The strategy proposes, among many things, a review  of the NIS directive, a new critical entities resilience  directive, a network of security operations centres  (SOCs), new measures to strengthen the EU Cyber  Diplomacy Toolbox and the further implementation  of the 5G Cybersecurity Toolbox. The Agency is ready  to fully utilise its mandate and tasks to act in the  areas outlined by the strategy that are covered by  1 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ SPEECH_20_1655 2 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ IP_20_2391  3 And has been fortified by the most recent State of the  Union address (15 September 2021), which highlighted the  concepts of cooperation, resilience and situational awareness  (https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ SPEECH_21_4701).  its mandate over the period of the 2022–2024 single  programming document (SPD).  The COVID-19 pandemic has not only brought  healthcare challenges; it has also had an impact on  the process of digitalisation in Europe, worldwide and  across sectors, increased technological complexities  and exposed the need to boost technology skill sets.  These effects in turn have accelerated exposure to a  wide range of cybersecurity threats and threat actors,  as documented by ENISA in 2021, on the one hand, and  have increased the need for cybersecurity knowledge,  awareness, resilience, cooperation and solutions on the  other. This affects all aspects of ENISA’s work and the  cybersecurity ecosystem that the EU is building up.  ENISA’s eighth edition of its annual threat landscape  report4 confirmed current and future trends of  cyberattacks becoming ever-more sophisticated,  targeted, widespread and undetected. Malware was  again voted the EU’s number one cyber threat in a poll  of intelligence experts, and changes were observed in  phishing, identity theft and ransomware that moved  them to higher-ranking positions. Monetisation remains  cybercriminals’ top motivation, and the COVID-19  environment fuelled attacks on homes, businesses,  governments and critical infrastructure in 2020 and  early 2021. Industries and governments alike continue  to be hit by cyberespionage attacks. The number of  data breach incidents continues to be very high, and  4 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-threat- landscape-2020  PART I GENERAL CONTEXT  https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_20_1655 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_20_1655 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_2391 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_2391 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-threat-landscape-2020 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-threat-landscape-2020  8  the amount of stolen financial information and user  credentials is growing. Unfortunately, we are getting  used to hearing terms like ‘Bad Rabbit ransomware’,  ‘Winnti’, ‘Magecart’ and ‘watering hole attacks’. In  December 2020, the European Medicines Agency was a  victim of a cyberattack resulting in the leak of documents  relating to the evaluation processes for COVID-19  vaccines. In the same month, another cyberattack on the  software company SolarWinds through its supply chain  resulted in a back-door infiltration into its commercial  software application. The list has grown in 2021, with  further supply chain attacks with global implications,  such as the Kaseya and SITA attacks. The current  escalation and the threat landscape status require the  continual introduction of new methods and different  approaches for Europe to become cybersecure.  The adoption and implementation of policy  frameworks is one key area where the EU is making  a difference. Indeed, the policies and initiatives that  will be put in place in the coming years will determine  how the EU faces the cybersecurity challenges of  today and tomorrow. In this context, ENISA will  determine and adapt the support that it provides,  particularly in the following areas.  THE NIS2 DIRECTIVE  AND THE JOINT CYBER UNIT  Improving cyber resilience, particularly for those who  operate essential services such as healthcare and  energy or for those who provide online marketplace  services, has been the main focus of the current NIS  directive since 2016. The proposed expansion of its  scope, in the form of the new NIS2 directive, will see  far more entities obliged to take measures to increase  the level of cybersecurity in Europe.  A 2020 ENISA study on NIS investments5 showed that,  for organisations implementing the NIS directive,  ‘Unclear expectations’ (35 %) and ‘Limited support  from the national authority’ (22 %) were among the  challenges faced. The NIS2 proposal addresses these  areas, aiming to provide more clarity in terms of what  is expected of national authorities, computer security  incident response teams (CSIRTs), and essential  and important entities in terms of reporting, crisis  management and information sharing.  ENISA is already invested in the above areas, with  its resilience, cooperation and capacity-building  work, and will be building up its own capacities to  support the outcome of the proposal in the coming  years using existing resources and building on these  5 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/nis-investments  wherever necessary. This will also apply to increased  cooperation under the potential Joint Cyber Unit (JCU)  umbrella. ENISA will contribute to the implementation  of the Commission’s recommendation on ‘building  the Joint Cyber Unit’, with a view to contributing  to the establishment of an EU crisis management  framework. This includes fostering cooperation  among cybersecurity communities, among relevant  EU institutions, bodies and agencies, and within  (and between) civilian cooperation networks (i.e. the  Cyber Crisis Liaison Organisation Network (CyCLONe),  the CSIRTs Network and, to the extent needed,  Cooperation Group).  IMPLEMENTATION OF  THE EU CYBERSECURITY  CERTIFICATION FRAMEWORK  ENISA is playing a central role in supporting the  implementation of the European cybersecurity  certification framework by preparing and maintaining  the candidate schemes with the support of area  experts and in collaboration with public authorities in  Member States. It is expected that the draft candidate  cybersecurity certifications schemes proposed by  ENISA will be adopted as Commission implementing  regulations. A conformity assessment of digital products,  services and processes in the digital single market will  be enabled under the adopted schemes, therefore  improving their cybersecurity. At the time of writing,  ENISA has prepared a candidate scheme on common  criteria (common criteria based European candidate  cybersecurity certification scheme) and is advancing  its work on cloud services (European cybersecurity  certification scheme for cloud services) and 5G (EU5G).  Finalising the candidate schemes for the more  specialised product categories under the common  criteria and for cloud services is just the first step and  should start bringing initial benefits in terms of EU- wide certification processes and higher consumer and  user trust during 2022–2024.  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION  The EU is extending its support for and investments  in the wealth of expertise and experience in  cybersecurity research and technological and  industrial development that exists in the EU by  prioritising cybersecurity in its research and  innovation support efforts, and in particular  through its Horizon Europe and Digital Europe  programmes. It is also pooling resources and  expertise by setting up the European Cybersecurity  Competence Centre and the Network of National  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/nis-investments  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 9  PART I. General context  Coordination Centres6. ENISA is ready to contribute  to this essential area in the coming years within  the role given to it by the regulation establishing  the European Cybersecurity Competence Centre  and the Network of National Coordination Centres  and by the mandate of the Cybersecurity Act (CSA).  Some of this work is anticipated to take place in  2022–2024, and the particular tasks required will  become clearer as the Cybersecurity Competence  Centre becomes operational.  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  With the EU’s artificial intelligence (AI) agenda  advancing rapidly following the European  Commission proposal on AI7 and 2021 coordinated  plan on AI8, the EU is addressing the major  technological, ethical, legal and socioeconomic  challenges that must be met to put AI at the service of  European citizens and the economy, for instance by  considering linking high-risk AI systems to mandatory  trustworthiness requirements. One of these  challenges is understanding the interplay between  cybersecurity and AI and how this can affect the  availability, safety and resilience of future AI services  and applications.  Building on ENISA’s AI threat landscape report9 of  December 2020 and with the guidance of its Ad Hoc  Expert Group on AI10, the Agency can continue its  open dialogue with EU institutions in support of the  legislative initiatives reaching into 2022–2024. In this  way, ENISA can continue to support the Commission  and Member States by providing good security  practices and guidelines.  THE EUROPEAN DIGITAL  IDENTITY FRAMEWORK  The EU’s eIDAS regulation provides a framework for  interoperability of national electronic identification  (eID) schemes and sets up an EU-wide market of  electronic trust services. eID schemes and trust  services are crucial for the EU digital market  6 Regulation (EU) 2021/887 of 20 May 2021 establishing  the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and  Research Competence Centre and the Network of National  Coordination Centres. 7 Proposal for Regulation (EU) 2021/206 of 21 April 2021 laying  down harmonised rules on AI (Artificial Intelligence Act) and  amending certain Union legislative acts. 8 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/coordinated- plan-artificial-intelligence-2021-review 9 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-ai- threat-landscape-report-unveils-major-cybersecurity-challenges 10 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart- infrastructures/artificial_intelligence/ad-hoc-working-group  because they allow citizens and businesses to  carry out transactions online in a safe and trusted  way. In 2020, the Commission reviewed the eIDAS  regulation and identified several gaps. In June 2021,  the Commission adopted a proposal for a revised  legal framework establishing a European digital  identity11 that can be used by all EU citizens and by  EU businesses when carrying out online transactions.  In 2022–2024, ENISA will support Member States  and the Commission in the implementation and  development of the toolbox and the European digital  identity framework as set out in the Commission’s  recommendation of 3 June 202112 in addition to  promoting the exchange of good practices and  capacity building of relevant stakeholders.  FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS  In 2020, ENISA put forward a proposal to open a local  office in Brussels in accordance with Article 20(5)  of the CSA. This will strengthen ENISA’s position in  the digital ecosystem of the EU and in particular its  role in establishing synergies with EU institutions,  bodies, offices and agencies in the field of operational  cooperation at EU level. Moreover, the local office in  Brussels will aim to ensure regular and systematic  cooperation with EU institutions, bodies and  agencies and other competent bodies involved in  cybersecurity. Indeed, it will support the delivery of  tasks mandated to ENISA under Article 7 of the CSA,  in particular that of establishing and maintaining  structured cooperation with the Computer  Emergency Response Team for the EU institutions,  bodies and agencies (CERT-EU). A detailed and annual  cooperation plan is being integrated into ENISA’s SPD  and is part of the memorandum of understanding  (MoU) signed in early 2021. This will enable both  organisations to benefit from synergies provided  by proximity and daily contact and to avoid any  duplication of activities.  In 2021, ENISA established a cooperation agreement13  with the European Telecommunications Standards  Institute (ETSI). ETSI and ENISA have the common  objective of collaborating on, contributing to and  promoting regional and international standardisation.  There is mutual interest in avoiding any duplication  of technical work, and in adopting an aligned and  complementary approach to the standardisation  process in specific domains.  11 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021PC0281 12 Commission Recommendation (EU) 2021/946 of 3 June 2021  on a common union toolbox for a coordinated approach towards  a European digital identity framework. 13 Signature pending.  https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/coordinated-plan-artificial-intelligence-2021-review https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/coordinated-plan-artificial-intelligence-2021-review https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-ai-threat-landscape-report-unveils-major-cybersecurity-challenges https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-ai-threat-landscape-report-unveils-major-cybersecurity-challenges https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/artificial_intelligence/ad-hoc-working-group https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/artificial_intelligence/ad-hoc-working-group https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021PC0281 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021PC0281  10  II  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 11  PART II WORK PROGRAMME 2022  This is the main body of the work programme,  describing, as per operational and corporate activity,  what the Agency aims to deliver in the respective year  in terms of achieving its strategy and the expected  results. In total, nine operational activities and two  corporate activities have been identified to support  the implementation of ENISA’s mandate in 2022.  The activities of the work programme seek to mirror  and align with the tasks set out in Chapter II of the  CSA, demonstrating concretely not only the specific  objectives, results and outputs expected for each task  but also the resources assigned.  12  3.1. OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES  ACTIVITY 1: Providing assistance in policy  development  Overview of activity  This activity delivers assistance and advice to the EU and Member States in developing cybersecurity policy and  sector-specific policy and law initiatives where matters related to cybersecurity are involved, and on the basis  of the new 2020 EU cybersecurity strategy. Aspects such as privacy and personal data protection are taken into  consideration (including encryption).  This activity seeks to bolster policy initiatives on novel/emerging technology areas by providing technical, fact- driven and tailor-made cybersecurity advice and recommendations. In addition to support in emerging policy  areas (such as AI, 5G, EU eID, quantum computing, blockchain, big data, digital resilience and response to current  and future crises), ENISA – in coordination with the Commission and Member States – will also conduct policy  scouting to support the Commission and Member States in identifying potential areas of policy development,  as well as develop monitoring capabilities and tools to regularly and consistently be able to give advice on the  effectiveness of existing EU policy and law in accordance with the EU’s institutional competencies in this area.  The added value of this activity is to support the decision-makers in a timely manner on developments at  technological, societal and economic market levels that might affect the cybersecurity policy framework (see also  activity 8). Given the cross-cutting nature of cybersecurity across the policy landscape, this activity will provide an  up-to-date risk-based analysis of cybersecurity not only in the areas of critical infrastructure and sectors, but also  by providing advice across the field in an integrated and holistic manner. The legal basis for this activity is Article  5 of the CSA.  Objectives  •  Foster cybersecurity as an integral part of EU  policy (existing and new).  •  Ensure that EU policymakers are regularly  informed about the effectiveness of the  existing frameworks and EU policymakers and  stakeholders are provided with timely and  tailor-made policy recommendations on future  cybersecurity challenges and opportunities.

It further supports initiatives related to implementation of policy frameworks on novel digital technologies such  as 5G (e.g. 5G Cybersecurity Toolbox) and assisting the work of the NIS Cooperation Group and its work streams.  Contribution towards the Commission’s regular monitoring of the implementation of specific EU policies is  envisaged, which considers relevant indicators and could contribute to possible indices that could capture the  maturity of relevant cybersecurity policies, and provide input to the review of existing policies (output 1.3).  This activity helps to avoid fragmentation and supports a coherent implementation of the digital single market  across Member States, following a consistent approach to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection.  The legal basis for this activity is Article 5 and Article 6(1)(b) of the CSA.  Objectives  •  Consistent development of sectoral Union  policies with horizontal Union policy to avoid  implementation inconsistencies.  •  Contribute to the efficient and effective monitoring  of EU cybersecurity policy implementation in  Member States.  •  Effective implementation of cybersecurity policy  across the EU and aim to support consistency of  Member State laws, regulations and administrative  provisions related to cybersecurity.  •  Improved cybersecurity practices, taking on board  lessons learnt from incident reports.  Link to strategic objective  (ENISA strategy)  •  Cybersecurity as an integral part of EU policies.  •  Empowered and engaged communities across  the cybersecurity ecosystem.

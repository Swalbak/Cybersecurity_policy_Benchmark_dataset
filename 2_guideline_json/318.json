In this paper, we look at the role telecom providers played in ensuring the security  and resilience of the services and networks during the pandemic.  This paper focuses on the telecom networks and services themselves, not the  endpoints. So COVID-related cyberattacks like COVID phishing emails and scam  domain names are out of scope here. Also we don’t discuss the arson attacks on  base stations inspired by the conspiracy theories about the pandemic.  Throughout this paper we give examples of good practices and we conclude with  lessons learned. We look at the following three aspects.   Early response phase: in this phase, providers activated their business  continuity plans and supported emergency communications and public  warnings. We give examples of such activities in the EU and across the  globe.   From initial strain to the new normal: providers had to deal with major  surges and shifts in usage and traffic patterns from the start of the  pandemic. This gradually stabilised to what is now considered the new  normal. We look in detail at the changes in usage and traffic patterns and  the network performance monitoring during the pandemic, and examine how  providers managed the increased network loads.   Response by the national authorities and collaboration with the sector:  we give a brief country-by-country summary of the pandemic response by  the national telecom security authorities in the EU and we give examples of  collaboration initiatives and information sharing between providers and  authorities as well as in the private sector.  The general take away from the pandemic so far is that the services and the  networks have been resilient during the crisis, despite major changes in usage and  traffic.  The pandemic also had a lasting effect on the perception of consumers about  telecoms: Electronic communication networks are now considered as a lifeline for  citizens and they are crucial to keep the economy and society going.  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  5  From discussions with experts in the sector and the national authorities, we can also draw the  following first lessons and ideas for improvements:  There is a need for intense cooperation and policy alignment between the various  stakeholders in the public sector (competent authorities/ministries) but also between  the public and the private sector, among the industry and with the citizens.  There is a need to build trust between the public sector and critical infrastructure  operators. Information relevant to the handling of the crisis has to be disseminated in a  timely way to key stakeholders, so that they can successfully adjust and apply their  business continuity plans.  It is a crucial in this period to provide enhanced support to digitalisation, focusing on:  • enhancing network capacity and coverage in rural areas;  • encouraging investments and innovation (broadband/fibre vouchers,  teleworking, e-government).  The internal operations of the providers have to be flexible, able to adapt to emerging  situations and aligned with the company’s business continuity plan. Remote and  unmanned monitoring and surveillance of the infrastructure and diagnostic, as well as  remote access to networking equipment should be promoted.  Telecom customers should be supported with advanced customer care services.  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  6  1. INTRODUCTION  The COVID-19 pandemic required an immediate response from the EU’s telecom sector. In this  paper, we look at the role of telecom providers in ensuring the security and resilience of the  telecom networks during the pandemic.  We focus on the networks and services, the telecommunication infrastructure. Out of scope are  COVID related attacks on endpoints like COVID phishing emails and COVID scam domain  names. The ENISA Threat Landscape 2020 gives an overview of such attacks.  The paper focuses on the following three aspects:   Early response phase: this section summarises the steps taken by providers in the  early response phase, in activating business continuity plans and supporting  emergency services and communications.   From initial strain to the new normal: this section looks in detail at the network traffic  changes. It gives examples of how providers are coping with the load and the need to  manage the network traffic.   Response by the authorities and collaboration with the industry: this section  summarises the response of national authorities in the EU, country-by-country. It  contains some examples of collaboration between the authorities and the industry and  within the industry.  Note that throughout the paper, we highlight a few examples from the real world, using  information from public sources, for the sake of illustration (not to single out a single provider for  criticism or praise).  This paper does not intend to give a full and complete overview of how EU providers reacted to  overcome the crisis, but it gives a number of interesting examples from providers in the EU and  in the rest of the world.  1.1 TARGET AUDIENCE  The paper targets security and resilience experts in the telecom sector, cybersecurity experts  and experts at national authorities and ministries.  1.2 SCOPE  The scope of this report is the impact of the pandemic on electronic communication networks  and services. The goal is to give an overview of the different activities telecom providers  undertook to safeguard the security and resilience of their networks and services during the  pandemic.  1.3 METHODOLOGY  The methodology for this paper was a stock-taking desktop research to collect a wide range of  examples, statistics, and good practices, followed by targeted interviews with sector experts.  At the start of this work, the Article 13a Expert Group provided direction and provided  information about the reaction to the pandemic by the EU telecom security telecom authorities  (see Chapter 4 of this report). The group also reviewed a final draft of the paper.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-threat-landscape-2020 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  7  2. EARLY RESPONSE PHASE  In this section, we look at the role of telecom providers in the early response to the pandemic.  We examine at two key activities:   providers activating their business continuity plans;   providers supporting emergency services and emergency communications.  2.1 ACTIVATION OF BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANS  Following the outbreak of the pandemic, telecommunications networks and services were given  the status of critical infrastructure across the globe. Telecom providers quickly adapted and  activated their business continuity plans.  Providers implemented changes to the workplace, including protection measures such as  contact limitation, turns/shifts, remote working and decentralizing key engineering staff, to avoid  that one infection would affect an entire engineering or security function.  Most providers, from the onset, reduced physical meetings, events and business travel,  gradually moving to a complete halt of all (non-essential) travel. Note that the approach of  individual operators was different depending on the rules and the government strategy in each  country.  Remote work was a global recommendation adopted by most organisations and institutions,  including the World Health Organization (WHO). Most telecommunication operators followed  suit and advised employees to work from home whenever possible.  Telstra in Australia, for example, ordered 20 000 of their staff to work from home despite not  having detected a COVID-19 case within their organisation. Telefónica in Europe, Orange  Global and Liquid Telecom in Africa are just some of the organisations that took similar  measures. Verizon reported 100 000 of their employees working from home. In addition to  office jobs, people that worked in distributed call centres, helpdesks and even network  operations centres resorted to teleworking. VEON, for example, closed their offices in  Amsterdam, London and Luxembourg and provided work from home arrangements for call  centre services. Orange reported on the capacity to transfer and distribute its operational  customer support activities to one of its five major service centres around the world. Airtel  India activated remote network operations centres with only 2 % of its staff required on site.  2.2 SUPPORTING EMERGENCY SERVICES AND COMMUNICATIONS  At the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, many countries started using emergency  communications and public warning systems to inform the public about the pandemic,  movement restrictions, social distancing measures, contact information (about how to get  medical support) and accurate health information. Often this involved telecom providers, for  example, by broadcasting text messages (SMS) to citizens.  In the Netherlands, Greece, Romania, the United Arab Emirates, Azerbaijan and New  Zealand, for example, cell broadcast messages were used to alert the public on the specific  measures taken to fight the outbreak. Wireless emergency alerts were used to send city-wide  and state-wide messages regarding social distancing and shelter-in-place measures in the  United States, while the Canadian provinces used their Common Alert Protocol (CAP) - based  https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/telstra-tells-20-000-staff-to-work-from-home-for-rest-of-month-20200313-p549za.html https://www.telefonica.com/en/web/press-office/-/telefonica-announces-measures-related-to-covid-19 https://www.orange-business.com/en/case-study/working-home-key-part-industrial-groups-business-continuity https://www.orange-business.com/en/case-study/working-home-key-part-industrial-groups-business-continuity https://www.capacitymedia.com/articles/3825122/live-covid-19-coronavirus-news-how-the-telecoms-world-is-dealing-with-the-pandemic https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/19/verizon-ceo-web-traffic-up-20percent-in-one-week-amid-coronavirus-shutdown.html https://www.capacitymedia.com/articles/3825122/live-covid-19-coronavirus-news-how-the-telecoms-world-is-dealing-with-the-pandemic https://www.orange-business.com/fr/presse/orange-est-mobilise-pour-assurer-continuite-services-aupres-lensemble-clients-en-france https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=50296 https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=50296 https://eena.org/document/data-and-strategies-per-country-on-emergency-calls-public-warning-during-covid-19 https://www.tra.gov.ae/en/about-tra/tra-initiatives-in-response-to-covid-19.aspx https://www.tra.gov.ae/en/about-tra/tra-initiatives-in-response-to-covid-19.aspx https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12319899 https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12319899 https://www.radioworld.com/news-and-business/covid19-eas-best-practices https://eena.org/document/data-and-strategies-per-country-on-emergency-calls-public-warning-during-covid-19  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  8  broadcast immediate mobile alert system. France, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, Portugal,  Slovenia, Denmark, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Sudan sent nation-wide SMS messages to the  entire population. In Czechia, O2 disseminated SMS messages to roaming visitors in  agreement with the national health authorities. Nepal Telecom, Etisalat and Du in the United  Arab Emirates and Zain in Sudan and Iraq used ringtone messages to alert the public. Zain in  Sudan used automated message calls. Vodacom Democratic Republic of the Congo used an  SMS broadcast to notify the population. Ncell Nepal used outbound dialling, SMS messaging  and call tone messages to distribute government announcements.  Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic meant that emergency call centres came under  unprecedented strain. In some countries congestions of emergency call centres occurred.  In Italy, for example, the number of calls to 112 doubled within a day when the first positive  COVID-19 case was confirmed. In Croatia, the number of calls to 112 increased by  approximately 50 % in the first 3 weeks, as did the average call duration. Other helplines  experienced similar increases. The helpline of the Ministry of Health in Portugal, for example,  reached a historic record shortly after confirmation of the first two cases of COVID-19 in  Portugal. The non-emergency online service 111 in the United Kingdom saw a record number  of enquiries reaching as high as 210 000 in a single day. More than 15 000 calls to the 1135  line were reported within 24 hours in Greece following the outbreak, with the trend increasing  to reach 20 000 calls per day by the end of the first week. In the United States, the authorities  reported a temporary rise in the number of 911 calls in regions where shelter-in-place orders  were issued, as well as in COVID-19 hotspot areas, such as New York City, where the  number of reported 911 calls surpassed those recorded during the terrorist attack on the  World Trade Center on 11 September 2001. (source: European Emergency Number  Association –EENA)  The measures taken by telecommunications operators to ensure sufficient communications  capacities and coverage for emergency response were critical from the very beginning.  Telecommunications providers around the world took proactive measures in offering support  plans for other front-line professionals involved in the COVID-19 response activities, whose  effective and efficient operations depended on communications services.  Vodafone UK doubled the calling capacity for the NHS 111 telephone advice service to reach  a capacity of 2 400 simultaneous calls, after the volume of calls has surged by as much as  400 % compared to the pre-pandemic peak.  In Sri Lanka, Dialog Axiata partnered with Wavenet International and MyDoctor to launch a  free trilingual hotline offering information and advice and providing online access to doctors.  Operators in numerous other countries worldwide provided various forms of discounted or free  hotline services, portals and short codes, including Vodacom Mozambique and Lesotho, O2,  O2 Family, T-Mobile and Vodafone in Czechia , Liquid Telecom in Zimbabwe, Cosmote in  Greece, operators in Greenland and the United Kingdom’s Tesco and O2. Providers set up  zero-rated short code numbers for call centres in Azerbaijan. In the Dominican Republic, the  Dominican Telecommunications Institute and the Emergency Operations Center launched a  call centre dedicated to the pandemic.  In Brazil, the national telecommunications agency,  Anatel, provided a dedicated access code,  111, for emergency assistance related to the pandemic in cooperation with the  telecommunications operators.  https://eena.org/document/data-and-strategies-per-country-on-emergency-calls-public-warning-during-covid-19 https://eena.org/document/data-and-strategies-per-country-on-emergency-calls-public-warning-during-covid-19 https://www.zain.com/en/covid19/iraq/ https://www.zain.com/en/covid19/saudiarabia/ https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=54002 https://eena.org/document/data-and-strategies-per-country-on-emergency-calls-public-warning-during-covid-19 https://www.nepalitelecom.com/2020/03/nepal-telecom-ntc-coronavirus-awareness-ring-tones.html https://www.instagram.com/p/B-JknVegTwD/?igshid=113h5qdjdx0i3 https://www.instagram.com/p/B-JknVegTwD/?igshid=113h5qdjdx0i3 https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=54002 https://www.zain.com/en/covid19/iraq/ https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=54002 https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=54002 https://www.vodafone.com/covid19/news/vodacom-helps-to-flatten-covid-19-curve-through-technological-innovation https://www.ncell.axiata.com/Navigating-COVID-19 https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.nena.org/resource/resmgr/covid/9-1-1_and_COVID-19_Report.pdf https://eena.org/data-strategies-emergency-calls-public-warning-covid19/ https://eena.org/data-strategies-emergency-calls-public-warning-covid19/ https://newscentre.vodafone.co.uk/features/coronavirus-how-vodafone-uk-is-helping-the-nhs/ https://www.mobileworldlive.com/blog/covid-19-industry-impact-february-to-march/ https://www.vodafone.com/covid19/news/vodacom-helps-to-flatten-covid-19-curve-through-technological-innovation https://www.ctu.eu/sites/default/files/obsah/ctu/monthly-monitoring-report-no.04/2020/obrazky/mz2020-4en.pdf https://www.ctu.eu/sites/default/files/obsah/ctu/monthly-monitoring-report-no.04/2020/obrazky/mz2020-4en.pdf https://www.liquidtelecom.com/about-us/news/Liquid%20Telecom%20enables%20Government%20of%20Zimbabwe%20to%20establish%20COVID%2019%20toll-free%202023%20helpline https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=54000 https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=54000 https://www.nun.gl/Nyheder_COVID19/2020/03/Hotline?sc_lang=da https://www.tescomobile.com/coronavirus https://www.o2.co.uk/business/why-o2/our-approach/covid-19 https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=53532 https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=50404 https://www.anatel.gov.br/institucional/mais-noticias/2555-anatel-disponibiliza-codigo-111-para-auxilio-emergencial  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  9  FirstNet, operated by AT&T, a provider of professional communications services for response  authorities in the United States, deployed Cell on Wheels and distributed devices to provide  additional capacity and communications capabilities to emergency medical personnel in North  Carolina. They deployed a portable base station at a COVID-19 test facility in the Northeast  where the situation was particularly devastating. CenturyLink equipped the US Naval hospital  ship Mercy with 1 gigabyte ethernet connectivity free of charge within 48 hours of its arrival in  Los Angeles.  Liquid Telecom in Africa installed free Wi-Fi at COVID-19 quarantine centres. Hellas Sat, in  partnership with Africom, provided free unlimited broadband connectivity to 127 public clinics  and hospitals across Zimbabwe.  Telekom Malaysia deployed 5G base stations at two quarantine centres (Malaysia Agro  Exposition Park Serdang and Institut Latihan Kementerian Kesihatan Malaysia), operating on  700 MHz and 3.5 GHz bands on Stand Alone (SA) architecture to deliver free Wi-Fi to patients  and medical staff and provided 5G fixed wireless access terminals. Telekom Malaysia  partnered with Huawei and the setup was completed in 3 days. In Thailand, the Ministry of  Digital Economy, in cooperation with Huawei Technology, provided an artificial intelligence  assistant solution with 5G technology to a hospital, to help increase the capacity of its  examination and care. Satellite service provider SES cooperated with the Luxembourg  government’s SATMED project to connect the e-health SATMED platform in remote  healthcare institutions in Bangladesh and Niger to communicate with national and  international doctors. Cambodia’s Cellcard deployed 5G services conjoined with Ezecom’s  fibre optics in the Khmer Soviet Friendship Hospital and The Chak Angre Health Center to  help fight the pandemic.  https://about.att.com/innovationblog/2020/03/covid_19_fn.html https://news.centurylink.com/connections-1?item=877 https://www.liquidtelecom.com/about-us/news/Liquid%20Telecom%20Zambia%20installs%20free%20Wifi%20at%20COVID-19%20quarantine%20centres https://allafrica.com/stories/202005130682.html https://www.malaysianwireless.com/2020/04/telekom-malaysia-free-wifi-5g-covid-19-quarantine-centres/ https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=54119 https://www.ses.com/news/covid-19-it-together/offering-helping-hand https://www.khmertimeskh.com/706678/cellcard-announces-cambodias-first-5g-use-case-to-help-the-kingdom-during-covid-19/  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  10  3. FROM INITIAL STRAIN TO  THE NEW NORMAL  From the start of the pandemic, the normal service usage and network traffic changed  drastically. Telecom providers reported several changes in the usage of telecom services and in  traffic patterns.  INITIAL CHANGES IN USAGE AND TRAFFIC PATTERNS   An initial spike in traffic volumes as users attempted to be informed and connected  with family and friends.   Increased consumption of voice services along with a significant drop in the volume  of mobile handoffs.   Increased and persistent upstream traffic volumes as a result of increased use of  online collaboration tools for remote work and schooling.   Usage hotspots in business and commute areas relocated to residential and rural  areas.   A persistent and long-lasting burden on the network, measured in weeks and  months.  Figure 1 shows the number of COVID-19 infections and the network traffic on a single timeline.  This is an example of one EU country, but this timeline is representative of the traffic changes  experienced by other operators in Europe and the United States.  Figure 1: A schema of the volume of traffic on the telecommunications networks as the  pandemic evolved (Source: Fastly)  https://www.fastly.com/blog/how-covid-19-is-affecting-internet-performance  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  11  The figure shows that at the start of the pandemic, the networks experienced an initial strain,  primarily due to people connecting with families and friends, and trying to access information  about the pandemic. A number of consecutive spikes in traffic took place following major  announcements and new measures. The biggest spikes were seen following the declaration of  a nationwide lockdown, and following the closure of businesses and schools.  Following this initial period of changes and peaks, the volume of traffic continued to grow,  marking the new normal, where changed consumption habits are consolidating. In comparison  to other crises, during the current pandemic the traffic changes lasted for a long time and it is  expected that the pandemic will leave a permanent mark on network traffic patterns and the  consumption habits of citizens.  The rest of this section will focus on these three phases: the initial strain, the increased demand  under lockdown and the new normal.  3.1 THE INITIAL STRAIN  At the start of the pandemic there was a sudden and large increase in the overall  communications demands. Several providers experienced overloads and brief congestions.  For example, in some areas in Europe and the United States, the increase in mobile traffic  volume was similar to Christmas and New Year peak times, except they lasted longer.  According to Nokia, networks saw an increase of 20–40 % in the regions impacted by the  pandemic. In Europe, the biggest spikes were measured in Italy and Spain. A 70 % increase  in traffic was reported by Italian operators. Mobile networks in Italy experienced increases in  peak throughput by as much as 90 % and average mobile data usage by 50 %. Vodafone  Italy reported peak traffic throughputs reaching and even exceeding 90 %, while average  throughput increased by 80 %. According to Telecom Italia, the internet traffic on their fixed  network rose by 70 % following a lockdown, a large portion of which was attributed to gaming.  During the first week of quarantine, Spanish mobile networks experienced a 35 % increase in  throughput and fixed networks a 50 % increase. Telefónica’s Movistar, Orange, Vodafone,  Másmóvil and Euskaltel reported a 40 % increase in traffic on IP networks within just the first  few days and a 50 % increase in the use of mobile voice and 25 % in mobile data when  quarantine was enforced in certain regions of Spain. WhatsApp usage in Spain was said to  have increased fivefold in a matter of days.  Large strain and network disruptions were reported in several other European countries as  well, including, for example, Lithuania, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. For instance,  several operators in the United Kingdom, including Vodafone, O2, Three, Virgin, Tesco,  GiffGaff and EE, experienced issues on 17 March 2020 around 9 a.m., when social distancing  measures were enforced and millions of users were forced to work remotely. Voice services  on 2G, 3G and 4G networks were affected the most with anywhere between 3 % and 9 % of  calls not getting through, whereas mobile data, Wi-Fi and messaging services were not  affected.  In the United Kingdom, government announcements and the enforcement of social distancing  measures resulted in spikes and traffic pattern changes. Looking closer at reports from EE  and Virgin, two UK broadband providers, there were spikes in mobile data traffic following the  Prime Minister’s daily 5 p.m. briefings. Additionally, when quarantine measures were  announced at 8.30 p.m. on Monday 23 March 2020, data traffic on EE’s mobile network  increased by more than five times compared to just 1 hour before.  https://www.nokia.com/blog/early-effects-covid-19-lockdowns-service-provider-networks-networks-soldier/ https://news.itu.int/telecoms-coronavirus-and-keeping-the-networks-running-time-for-leadership/ https://owmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/Managing-your-network-in-the-coronavirus-crisis-v1.pdf https://owmobility.com/how-are-italian-and-spanish-mobile-operators-managing-the-coronavirus-crisis/ https://owmobility.com/how-are-italian-and-spanish-mobile-operators-managing-the-coronavirus-crisis/ https://blog.telegeography.com/internet-traffic-surges-as-covid-19-spreads https://www.telefonica.com/en/web/press-office/-/operators-advise-a-rational-and-responsible-use-of-telecommunication-networks-to-cope-with-traffic-increases https://www.telefonica.com/en/web/press-office/-/operators-advise-a-rational-and-responsible-use-of-telecommunication-networks-to-cope-with-traffic-increases https://blog.telegeography.com/internet-traffic-surges-as-covid-19-spreads https://news.itu.int/telecoms-coronavirus-and-keeping-the-networks-running-time-for-leadership/ https://www.capacitymedia.com/articles/3825121/uk-mobile-networks-go-into-meltdown-as-coronavirus-forces-home-working https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2020/03/covid-19-snapshot-of-internet-traffic-from-ee-and-virgin-media.html https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2020/03/covid-19-snapshot-of-internet-traffic-from-ee-and-virgin-media.html  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  12  Figure 2: EE’s network traffic volumes displaying volume spikes as a result of large number  of subscribers watching the 5 p.m. briefings (left), and a significant spike in network traffic on  18 March after social distancing measures were announced and when lockdown was  announced on 23 March (right) (Souce: EE)  Nokia’s statistics from the week of 9 March when several European countries declared a state  of emergency and implemented lockdown measures showed an increase in the overall traffic  on day 1 of the lockdown reaching anywhere between 30 % (5 p.m.) and 80 % (9 a.m.), with  boosts between 50 % and 70 % for most of the day. On the first Sunday of lockdown, traffic  rose even further, reaching increases of anywhere between 34 % and 97 % during the day.  Further analysis of Nokia’s traffic volumes per type of communications service on the first day  and the first Sunday of lockdown revealed spikes in the use of messaging, social media  services and streamed video (see Figure 3).

There were the three following major changes.   Shift of peak hours. According to Cloudflare, for instance, in addition to the normal  evening peak hour, two additional peak times occurred, one in the morning and  another in the afternoon. The same patterns were observed by Sandvine. According to  BT in the United Kingdom and AT&T in the United States, for example, daytime traffic  rose by 30 % to 50 %.   Changes in upload traffic volumes. Changes in service consumption and, in  particular, increased use of videoconferencing and online collaboration tools, led to a  considerable increase in upload traffic volumes.   Shift of hotspot locations. There was a visible shift of service consumption  hotspots, causing unexpected strains, in particular in residential broadband access  networks. The volume of traffic dropped significantly in city centres, business districts  and industrial centres (including, for example, airports, major metro stations and  tourist attractions).  Sandvine saw an almost 40 % growth of internet traffic across different types of consumer  networks between February and mid April. Sandvine reported increased demands on both the  fixed and wireless networks, whereas the biggest volume increase was seen on Tier 1 fixed  broadband networks (cable, DSL, FTTx).  According to data provided by Fastly, over the roughly 1-month period from the end of  February to the end of March, traffic increased in Italy by 109.3 % (more than doubling). The  increase was 78.6 % in the United States, 39.4 % in Spain, 38.4 % in France and 31.5 % in  Japan Kingdom. These increases in traffic volume coincided with decreases in download  speeds (35.4 % in Italy, 30.3 % in the United Kingdom, 13.9 % in France and 8 % in Spain). In  Japan and California on the other hand, average download speeds actually increased, by  9.7 % and 1.2 %, respectively.  Figure 5: Increased internet traffic volumes in selected European countries and US states  that were significantly hit by the pandemic, and the corresponding download speed  deteriorations (Source: Fastly)  https://blog.cloudflare.com/on-the-shoulders-of-giants-recent-changes-in-internet-traffic/ https://www.sandvine.com/hubfs/Sandvine_Redesign_2019/Downloads/2020/Phenomena/COVID%20Internet%20Phenomena%20Report%2020200507.pdf https://www.sandvine.com/hubfs/Sandvine_Redesign_2019/Downloads/2020/Phenomena/COVID%20Internet%20Phenomena%20Report%2020200507.pdf https://www.fastly.com/blog/how-covid-19-is-affecting-internet-performance https://www.fastly.com/blog/how-covid-19-is-affecting-internet-performance  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  14  A statistical analysis of average download speed data for individual countries was prepared  by the Phoenix Center, based on data provided by Ookla for fixed and mobile connections  covering 116 countries between 16 December 2019 and 11 May 11 2020. It showed that for  fixed connections, 54 out of 108 countries experienced speed degradations, and 33 % of  these were statistically significant with levels of 10 % or higher. The average speed reduction  was estimated at 9.2 %, while the average speed increase was estimated at 6.6 %, indicating  considerable differences between countries. Most of the countries that experienced  degradations of 5 % or more have relatively low per-capita gross domestic product, but there  were exceptions, for example, France, Italy and Japan. For mobile broadband, 77 countries  experienced degradations, with 66 of those experiencing statistically significant drops. In  general, data showed that mobile networks suffered more than fixed networks, with an  average speed reduction of 9.9 % and an average speed increase of 8.9 %, which points at a  more symmetrical difference.  According to the Europe, Middle East and Africa Satellite Operators Association, since the  start of the pandemic satellite operators providing broadband connectivity directly to  consumers have experienced a 15–70 % increase in data traffic across Europe and America  (depending on the country) and an increase in subscriptions in Brazil, Mexico and the United  States Satellite networks primarily served broadband consumers, while remote enterprise  connectivity was mostly idle due to the pandemic. Application proportions in the total volume  of traffic were similar to those seen on fixed broadband networks, with two exceptions, a huge  portion of WhatsApp traffic accounting for 12.78 % of the entire volume and much lower  percentages of gaming traffic compared to typical fixed broadband lines.  3.2.1 Impact on the internet backbone  Network backbones and the internet core demonstrated sufficient capacities to cope with the  impacts a pandemic causes with respect to increased service usage, spikes in traffic volumes  and changes in traffic patterns. Internet exchanges saw huge increases in the volume of traffic  passing through their networks. In general, a change in volume took place in all world regions,  spanning anywhere between 10 % and 40 % depending on the situation and the state of  government action.  The Deutsche Commercial Internet Exchange (DE-CIX) in Frankfurt, Germany, reported a  world record of 9.1 Terabits/s data throughput in March 2020 following an increase of 12 %  since December 2019. The reported volume corresponds to as much as two million  simultaneous HD video transmissions. A similar spike in internet traffic was also reported by  the Amsterdam Internet Exchange, who hit the 8 Tbps barrier on 30 March 2020 and reported  a 17 % growth of overall daily traffic volume. Record volumes were also reported by NAPAfrica  with evening peaks at its Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town exchanges exceeding  1.1 Tbps on 25 March 2020 (see Figure 6).  https://www.phoenix-center.org/PolicyBulletin/PCPB49Final.pdf https://www.esoa.net/press-room/keeping-people-connected-informed-and-protected https://www.sandvine.com/hubfs/Sandvine_Redesign_2019/Downloads/2020/Phenomena/COVID%20Internet%20Phenomena%20Report%2020200507.pdf https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/coronavirus-break-internet-experts/story?id=69675556 https://mybroadband.co.za/news/internet/344937-how-much-internet-traffic-in-south-africa-has-increased-due-to-the-coronavirus.html  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  15  Figure 6: Increased traffic volumes were observed at internet exchanges around the world  Hong Kong’s Internet Exchange (Source: HK IX) Milan IX (Source: MIX)  Aggregated Brazilian internet exchanges (Source: IX  Brazil)  Greek IXP (Source: GR IX)  China IX (Source: CHN IX) DE-CIX Hamburg, Germany (Source: DE CIX)  3.2.2 Increased usage of mobile and fixed voice services  Along with an increase in internet traffic, the use of more traditional communication services like  voice telephony also increased.  In France, for example, Orange reported a 100 % increase in voice calls. According to  Vodafone, voice traffic in some countries rose by 40–50 % and even up to 100 %. Vodafone  UK, for example, experienced a 25 % increase in fixed telephony traffic and a 42 % mobile  voice traffic increase. In Spain, the demands for voice services rose by 25 % within the first  weeks of confinement according to Telefónica.  Increased use of voice services was also reported in the United States, in particular with Wi-Fi  calling, which in some areas saw an increase of 100 %. Operators AT&T, Verizon and Sprint  all experienced spikes in voice calls when restrictions were initially imposed at the end of  March 2020. According to AT&T, voice calls on Sunday 22 March increased by 44 %  compared with a typical Sunday, while Wi-Fi calling increased by 88 %. Verizon reported a  https://www.hkix.net/hkix/stat/aggt/hkix-aggregate.html https://www.mix-it.net/en/statistiche/ https://ix.br/agregado/ https://ix.br/agregado/ https://www.gr-ix.gr/traffic/ http://www.chn-ix.net/serviceability.html https://www.de-cix.net/en/locations/germany/hamburg/statistics https://www.orange-business.com/fr/presse/orange-est-mobilise-pour-assurer-continuite-services-aupres-lensemble-clients-en-france https://www.vodafone.com/covid19/videos/vodafone-network-usage-stats-facts-and-insights https://newscentre.vodafone.co.uk/viewpoint/vodafone-networks-up-to-the-task-says-scott-petty/ https://newscentre.vodafone.co.uk/viewpoint/vodafone-networks-up-to-the-task-says-scott-petty/ https://www.telefonica.com/ext/westayconnected/ https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/pandemic-spurs-voice-resurgence-in-us/ https://www.mobileworldlive.com/blog/covid-19-industry-impact-february-to-march/ https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/mobile-voice-usage-dials-up-for-at-t-verizon-as-americans-stay-home https://labs.ripe.net/Members/gary_stevens_1/what-covid-19-means-for-network-security  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  16  25 % increase overall and a 10 % wireless increase in calls between 12 March and 19 March  2020, with their duration 15 % higher and the biggest portion of the increase attributed to  conference calls. Similarly, Sprint reported a 20 % increase in calls and a 25 % increase in  messaging. Mobile handoffs, on the other hand, dropped by as much as 29 % nationwide with  users staying home under quarantine. Even sharper decreases were observed in commuter  hotspot areas, such as the New York Metro (– 53 %) and Upstate New York (– 49 %).  A surge in the use of voice calls was also reported in India, with estimates reaching as high as  a 15–20 % increase in calls made through mobile phones in the initial days following the  implementation of the quarantine. Later on, the frequency of calls decreased due to large  commuter populations staying at home, but the average call duration times increased, by as  much as 30 % (1).  3.2.3 Impact on broadband traffic  Fixed consumer broadband networks experienced the biggest increases in traffic during the  pandemic (see for example the report by Sandvine). This was caused by traffic shifting from  enterprise, education and public Wi-Fi networks to residential fixed broadband networks. In  addition, Nokia reported that aggregation networks and service edge routers experienced the  biggest strain. According to Ookla, the largest performance degradation was detected in dense  residential areas where the networks are not built for such large volumes of traffic and the  network performance is optimised for evening peak hours. As a result, the available capacities  and network coverage did not suffice during specific periods of the pandemic, in particular  when quarantine measures took effect and people worked and attended school from home.  In Europe, Vodafone UK experienced broadband traffic growth of 15 % within the first 2 weeks  of quarantine alone, and reported a 30 % increase in internet traffic across its fixed and mobile  networks. On fixed broadband networks, the United Kingdom’s BT reported a 100 % increase  in daytime traffic, while volumes on the mobile part of the network decreased slightly compared  to pre-pandemic levels as a result of people staying at home and resorting to Wi-Fi instead.  Fixed broadband use in Italy and Spain increased by more than 50 %. In Spain, Vodafone  reported an increase in bandwidth demand of almost 40 % and in mobile data traffic growth of  50 %. They detected an increase in mobile broadband demand of almost 20 % and in fixed  broadband of 35 % during peak evening hours in Italy and Spain. Telefónica saw a 35 %  overall data increase across its networks in Spain, with 26 % increases in the fixed network  and 48 % in the mobile network. Considerable increases in the volume were also reported by  Telia operating in Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden with a  more than 50 % overall traffic increase, mostly visible during off-peak hours and with major  regional differences, whereas peak traffic levels were up by approximately 35 % as of  29 March 2020.  In the United States, operators reported a rise in network usage of 20–35 % for fixed networks  and of 10–20 % for mobile networks in the first weeks following the declared state of  emergency. The demands increased in particular in suburban, exurban and residential areas  as a result of remote work and schooling. Similar trends were observed on the American cable  networks as reported by NCTA’s Altice, CableOne, Charter, Comcast, Cox, GCI, Mediacom,  Midco and Sjoberg’s, reporting a 14 % increase in national downstream peak growth and a  32 % increase in national upstream peak growth since 1 March 2020.  (1) Nepali Telecom, on the other hand, reported a decline in voice business of approximately 25 % due to most  business coming to a halt and most people using social media to communicate. Mobile voice usage with China  Telecom also saw a decrease of almost 19 % in Q1 2020 compared to Q4 2019, with wireline voice usage  decreasing by 25 %.  https://www.lightreading.com/4g-3g-wifi/us-wireless-networks-are-holding-up-to-covid-19/d/d-id/758446 https://www.telecompetitor.com/verizon-covid-19-network-traffic-trends-highlight-stay-at-home-impact-as-mobile-handoffs-are-down-29/ https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/india-witnesses-a-surge-in-voice-calls-during-lockdown/articleshow/75133756.cms https://www.sandvine.com/hubfs/Sandvine_Redesign_2019/Downloads/2020/Phenomena/COVID%20Internet%20Phenomena%20Report%2020200507.pdf https://www.nokia.com/blog/early-effects-covid-19-lockdowns-service-provider-networks-networks-soldier/ https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/coronavirus-break-internet-experts/story?id=69675556 https://newscentre.vodafone.co.uk/viewpoint/vodafone-networks-up-to-the-task-says-scott-petty/ https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/press-release/covid-19-network-traffic-surge-isnt-impacting-environment-confirm-telecom-operators/ https://www.lightwaveonline.com/network-design/high-speed-networks/article/14173544/service-providers-offer-new-updates-on-covid19-coronavirus-network-effects https://www.telefonica.com/ext/westayconnected/ https://blog.teliacarrier.com/2020/04/01/covid-19-network-trends-and-modelling/ https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-363493A1.pdf https://www.ncta.com/COVIDdashboard https://www.nepalitelecom.com/2020/05/nepal-telecom-role-covid19-pandemic-impact-challenges-opportunities.html https://www.chinatelecom-h.com/en/regulatory/announcements/a200423.pdf https://www.chinatelecom-h.com/en/regulatory/announcements/a200423.pdf  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  17  In South-East Asia, peak traffic increases reached 38 % by the end of March and average  throughput increased by 12 %. Nepali Telekom, for example, saw a 40 % increase in data  usage compared to the pre-lockdown period, mainly accounted to YouTube, social media and  online learning apps. Due to limited resources, data caps were not removed and the internet  usage experience deteriorated due to high spikes in communication demands. Zain reported a  20–50 % increase in high-speed broadband data traffic across various markets since March  2020. Similarly, an increase of 25 % in data traffic volumes was reported in India between early  February and late March. In Malaysia, Telecom Malaysia reported a 30 % increase in usage  trending, and of this, the increase of international link traffic was 5 %. China Telecom saw a  37.4 % increase in mobile handset data traffic on 3G, 4G and 5G networks in Q1 2020  compared to the same period last year and reported continued and rapid growth. They  reported an increase in average daily network traffic in April 2020 on 4G of 17.78 % and on  broadband network of 22.61 %, with video and image processing the two primary driving  forces.  The situation was similar in Africa. Vodafone, for instance, reported traffic increases in some  African countries similar to those in Europe, with increases ranging between 25 % and 50 %.  South America saw an average growth of traffic volume of 25–30 %. Vodacom Group for  instance reported a 40 % increase in data traffic during the lockdown period. The data increase  was said to have been driven by paid traffic for businesses resorting to remote work and an  increase in the use of streaming services. An increase in free traffic for education, government  and health portals was also reported. South Africa’s Seacom, operating major undersea fibre  cables, also saw a 15 % increase in internet traffic across its network.

AT&T, for example, reported a 27 % drop in mobile handoffs in March versus a typical  week. In New York City, T-Mobile saw an 86 % increase in subscribers with limited  mobility, meaning they connect to cell sites in their primary location only, and similar  volumes in the San Francisco Bay Area with a 77 % increase in limited subscriber mobility.  Another effect of people staying at home and all travel being banned was a significant drop in  the volume of traffic seen on GPRS roaming exchange (GRX) networks (see Figure 8).  Figure 8: Decreased traffic volumes on the Amsterdam GRX from March 2020 (Source: AMS IXP)  This is also confirmed by reports from roaming operators, such as Vivo Brazil and Syniverse,  who experienced significant drops in traffic as a result of global travel restrictions.  Nepali Telecom also reported a considerable decline in international long distance traffic, by  as much as 20 %, which was attributed to the impeding recession and people experiencing a  shortage of available resources to be spent on communications services. A similar  phenomenon was reported by China Telecom. However, according to i3Forum, while there  was a 30 % drop in international traffic overall, international voice traffic increased by 20 %  year-on-year in March 2020, and the duration of calls increased by 30 % in March 2020 and  by more than 60 % in April 2020 compared to 2019.  Network backbones and the internet core demonstrated sufficient capacities to cope  with the consequences of the pandemic with respect to increased service usage, spikes in  traffic volumes and changes in traffic patterns. Internet exchanges saw huge increases in the  volume of traffic passing through their networks. In general, changes in volume took place in  all world regions, spanning anywhere between 10 % and 40 % depending on the situation and  the state of government action.  https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/at-t-wi-fi-calling-up-76 https://www.fiercewireless.com/operators/t-mobile-tracks-dramatic-spike-messaging-launches-low-cost-phone-plan https://stats.ams-ix.net/grx.html https://owmobility.com/how-are-italian-and-spanish-mobile-operators-managing-the-coronavirus-crisis/ https://www.nepalitelecom.com/2020/03/internet-usage-increases-corona-speed-slow.html https://www.nepalitelecom.com/2020/05/nepal-telecom-role-covid19-pandemic-impact-challenges-opportunities.html https://2ja3zj1n4vsz2sq9zh82y3wi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/COVID-19-Chinas-digital-health-strategies-against-the-global-pandemic_Yuan-Zhang.pdf https://telecoms.com/504682/international-voice-traffic-spikes-20-during-covid-19/ https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/coronavirus-break-internet-experts/story?id=69675556  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  19  3.3 NEW NORMAL  The strain on the networks started to decrease once the pandemic situation stabilised and  countries around the world progressed with relaxing the social distancing measures. Providers  have indicated that even after lockdown restrictions were lifted, a number of traffic pattern  changes have remained.  Since the implementation of Phase 0 of deconfinement in Spain, for example, Telefónica  reported a 13 % drop in fixed data traffic in certain timeslots as people over 14 years of age  are allowed to leave home in the mornings and in the evenings. There was also a drop in  mobile data traffic, although to a lesser extent, with a 6 % decline compared to a week  earlier at the highest daily peak in the evenings. In addition, there was a 9 % decrease in the  evening peak time of voice traffic usage compared to a week earlier.  In the United States, Comcast data also showed that the traffic volumes eventually  plateaued. The new volumes and patterns persisted, however, driven primarily by remote  work. VoIP and video conferencing continued to dominate weekday usage at 210–285 %,  and VPN traffic was up by 30–40 %. Since 1 March the upload traffic increased by 32 % and  downstream by 11 %, and downstream peak hours shifted from 9 p.m. to between 7 p.m.  and 8 p.m., while upload peak traffic times shifted from 9 p.m. to daytime hours between  8 a.m. and 6 p.m. On wireless, a 17 % decline in LTE data usage was reported and a 36 %  increase in mobile data usage over Wi-Fi. Weekend usage was driven by entertainment,  streaming and gaming services with peak hours continuing in the evenings. Gaming  downloads were up by anywhere between 20 % and 80 %, depending on new releases. The  stabilisation of the increased volume trends was also reported by US Telecom. A 10.4 %  mean traffic increase was reported in the second week of June 2020 compared to the record  peak increase of 27 % reported earlier on 16 April 2020. (see Figure 9).  Figure 9: Comcast traffic volume growth trends between March and May 2020  https://www.telefonica.com/ext/westayconnected/ https://corporate.comcast.com/covid-19/network https://www.ustelecom.org/research/network-performance-data/ https://corporate.comcast.com/covid-19/network  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  20  3.4 NETWORK MANAGEMENT AND MAINTENANCE DURING A  PANDEMIC  In response to changed usage behaviour and increased traffic, telecommunications operators  took different measures. In addition to monitoring their networks 24/7, many network  management interventions took place to cope with the increased loads, such as:   changing network configurations;   deploying new technologies;   securing additional spectrum, where needed, or sharing spectrum with peers;   engaging emergency deployments, including using new technologies, such as 5G.  3.4.1 Management of network capacity and performance  To deal with the increased traffic peaks and pattern changes, telecom providers responded in a  variety of different ways, depending on the situation. Measures included increasing capacity,  implementing call gaping, codec reconfigurations to reduce voice quality, time limits, direct retry,  dynamic quality and data consumption balancing, and configuration of traffic prioritisation, in  particular to support emergency communications and essential services.  In Europe, Ekinops in the Paris area in France, for example, increased the bandwidth of its  single fibre network to assist a local telecom provider CM’IN, in keeping the city of Chartres  online. Orange France reported having reconfigured network parameters in response to  mobile voice traffic doubling in volume. Telecom Italia reported on conducting a series of  network improvements, which led to an increase in bandwidth of up to 37 % on selected  routes compared to the pre-pandemic situation. It activated 5 000 new cabinets to offer high-  capacity broadband connectivity for the so-called white areas, which are not subject to public  tenders for broadband infrastructure, and set up a dedicated control room for monitoring  network traffic. Telenor increased the capacities of 300 base stations. Comcast reported that  they performed more than 700 000 diagnostic speed tests each day.  Operators in Iran took measures to expand the capacity and data rates of their networks,  including increasing the speed of fixed internet services, capacity enhancements of country-  wide backbone network and gateways as well as the expansion of capacity of high-speed links  to fixed and mobile network operators.  In China, 5G was deployed specifically for fixed wireless applications to deliver connectivity.  The Chinese telecommunications industry reportedly installed more than 63 000 new 4G and  5G base stations between late January and the end of March 2020. Subisu Cablenet in Nepal  increased local cache for YouTube and Facebook to manage internet bandwidth shortage. In  India, a Tier 1 operator implemented a mechanism to feed the core network back with radio  congestion indicators in order to monitor congestions and implement real-time balancing of  video traffic quality and data consumption in an attempt to deliver a consistent Quality of  Experience (QoE) for subscribers without impacting essential services on the frontline of the  pandemic.  Liquid Telecom, operating in Africa, enhanced connectivity capacities across its east Africa  backbone by deploying Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) across a closed wide area  network to enable video conferencing services and the use of digital tools for the members of  the parliament and East African Community ministries and businesses resorting to remote  work. It upgraded major fibre network links in Kenya for improved bandwidth performances  available to their enterprise and wholesale customers. Vodacome South Africa was said to  have increased its network capacity with an investment worth USD 26.7 million. Australian  NBN opened up network capacity free of charge to allow for up to 40 % more bandwidth  https://www.capacitymedia.com/articles/3825351/live-covid-19-coronavirus-news-how-the-telecoms-world-is-dealing-with-the-pandemic https://www.orange.com/en/Press-Room/press-releases/press-releases-2020/Orange-is-mobilised-to-ensure-continuity-of-service-for-all-customers-in-France-and-around-the-world https://www.telecomitalia.com/it/sostenibilita/dialogo-azioni/news/covid-impegno-tim.html https://www.telenor.no/privat/artikler/telenor-og-korona/tiltak/ https://corporate.comcast.com/covid-19/network https://www.cra.ir/Portal/View/Page.aspx?PageId=aad0ae9a-9c85-4c53-a6de-9aa909303648&ObjectId=6288a96a-29c7-4f50-95da-67f5f6d9e103&WebpartId=4986a228-f6b9-4a54-8b08-e62c6f09bd56 https://www.gsma.com/greater-china/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Mobile-Industry-Response-to-COVID19-China-en.pdf https://www.nepalitelecom.com/2020/04/challenges-ISP-home-internet.html https://owmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/Managing-your-network-in-the-coronavirus-crisis-v1.pdf https://africabusinesscommunities.com/tech/tech-news/liquid-telecoms-east-africa-connectivity-backbone-deepens-eac-integration/ https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/vodacom-sa-hikes-capacity-to-match-covid-19-demand/ https://minister.infrastructure.gov.au/fletcher/media-release/nbn-boosts-capacity-australians-working-home  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  21  across all technologies, including fixed wireless and satellite services, to improve network  performance.  Some national authorities and European bodies issued guidance to providers about traffic  management, i.e. about what measures operators are allowed to take to deal with network  traffic changes and to avoid congestion. Following are two examples:   The Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) issued,  together with the Commission, a joint statement on coping with the increased demand  for network connectivity due to the COVID-19 pandemic.   The German Federal Network Agency, issued guidance for operators on acceptable  traffic management measures in the event of network overload during the COVID-19  pandemic.  3.4.2 Management of spectrum resources  In addition to technical reconfigurations within the network, increasing spectrum resources to  overcome network capacity and coverage issues was another strategy used during the  COVID-19 pandemic. This included applying for licenses for unallocated spectrum bands as  well as for shared spectrum use in agreement with license owners, securing licenses for the  deployment of new technologies, such as 5G, to support ad hoc augmentation, and applying  for access to backhaul spectrum where needed. Actions included cooperation with the national  regulatory authorities (NRAs) and other operators to gain regulatory approvals, followed by  spectrum relocation, reconfiguration of existing and placement of additional network  equipment, including COW/COLT, RDUs, permanent large-radio-zone BTS, VSAT, high-  performance antennas, etc.  During COVID-19, fast and flexible changes to regulations proved essential. Formal procedures  were expedited to enable fast awarding of licenses and management of license fees under  emergency conditions.  Cooperation and regulatory initiatives are further analysed in Section 4.  3.4.3 Network maintenance  At the start of the crisis, providers delayed all non-essential investments and non-essential  maintenance operations. Over the course of the next weeks and months, however,  maintenance operations restarted. In order to help operators maintain the essential  communications services operational, the telecommunications services were declared as  essential so that operators could be granted travel and access permissions during lockdown.  In many countries, network maintenance operations had to be adapted to limit the exposure of  essential workers. For example, providers used remote and unmanned monitoring, remote  surveillance of the infrastructure and online diagnostics, remote (online) access to networking  equipment and even drones. Redundant teams of essential technicians and non-overlapping  work shifts were organised to limit risk exposure. Contacts with suppliers and subcontractors  were limited. Following are some specific examples.  Deutsche Telekom reported that regular network maintenance and upgrades continued.  Within 2 weeks of April alone, they reported to have carried out around 9 000 interference  elimination in the fixed network and connected 20 000 households to Fiber to the Home  (FTTH). In addition, they provided 100 000 households with vectoring or super vectoring  delivering speeds of up to 250 Mbps. 1 700 technical field interventions were reported  servicing or troubleshooting mobile rad+io systems. Within a week, they also reported to  https://berec.europa.eu/eng/document_register/subject_matter/berec/download/0/9236-joint-statement-from-the-commission-and-_0.pdf https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/Areas/Telecommunications/Companies/TelecomRegulation/NetNeutrality/Corona/Guidelines%20on%20traffic%20management%20measures.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=1 https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/blog/keeping-everyone-and-everything-connected-how-temporary-access-to-spectrum-can-ease-congestion-during-the-covid-19-crisis/ https://www.telekom.com/de/blog/netz/artikel/mobilfunk-sonderversorgung-krankenhaus-harlaching-598646  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  22  have integrated 180 new LTE stations into the network. The state of pandemic had not  considerably negatively impacted maintenance of and investments in their network, and in  some cases even worked in their interest, for example the closure of schools in Germany  allowed them to proceed with installing fiber optics in schools.  As part of its business continuity plan, Orange defined a list of priority activities, including  network supervision, essential maintenance operations, technical support and commercial  assistance. They reported 130 additional customer operations per day managed by their  field teams to increase the speed of their internet connections or at their data centres.  From late January 2020 until 25 March 2020, the telecommunications industry in China  mobilised a total number of dispatches for 375 000 communications support personnel and  174 000 communications support vehicles.  Another considerable challenge was the mitigation of delays in shipping essential supplies. A  plan is typically available with operators as part of capacity planning to make sure essential  equipment is on stock. Whereas transportation itself was not such an issue as with other types  of emergencies that cause extensive physical damage and trouble with accessing the affected  sites (e.g., a hurricane or a destructive earthquake catastrophe), logistics delays took place  during the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of measures taken to limit or even fully stop  movements of people and goods across borders in an attempt to limit the spread. Increased  border controls and border crossings, ports and airports closing down were paralysing to  logistics and transportation, and the countries and operators that depend on imports from other  countries were affected more.  According to information provided by Nepal Telecom, for example, increases in internet  bandwidth were not possible because of Nepal’s dependence on capacities supplied from  India, where there was also a shortage, as well as due to expected delays in shipping of the  required equipment.  Equipment manufacturing factories closing down, in particular in China, was an additional factor  in delays with availability of essential equipment.  South Korean vendor LG Electronics, for example, reported on the effects of the pandemic  that caused disruption to its supply chain, which was cited as a factor in the 34 % annual  decline in revenue from its mobile business. The smartphone industry sustained an  unprecedented decline as a result of the production and supply issues resulting from  COVID-19, with worldwide smartphone shipments dropping by 11.7 % year over year in just  Q1 of 2020. China sustained the largest regional impact, which caused worldwide  implications because of global dependency on China’s smartphone supply chain. The 5G  industry was also impacted, with 5G deployments in Europe and the Middle East expected  to experience delays in 2020 because of supply chain constraints, particularly if involving  the Chinese vendors Huawei and ZTE.  Overall, it seems that despite the pandemic, most of the network maintenance and updates  continued without much delay. A report from RIPE Labs, based on an analysis of BGP data,  which analyses reconfiguration activities (IP prefix announcements, withdrawals, changes in  origin), found no visible decreases in the volume of changes on networks in March 2020  compared to earlier months.  https://www.telekom.com/de/blog/netz/artikel/netzausbau-corona-virus-598072 https://www.orange-business.com/fr/presse/orange-est-mobilise-pour-assurer-continuite-services-aupres-lensemble-clients-en-france https://www.gsma.com/greater-china/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Mobile-Industry-Response-to-COVID19-China-en.pdf https://www.nepalitelecom.com/2020/03/internet-usage-increases-corona-speed-slow.html https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/lg-mobile-division-woes-deepen/ https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS46264320 https://data.gsmaintelligence.com/api-web/v2/research-file-download?id=51249608&file=030420-Covid-mobile-networks.pdf https://data.gsmaintelligence.com/api-web/v2/research-file-download?id=51249608&file=030420-Covid-mobile-networks.pdf https://labs.ripe.net/Members/emileaben/internet-stability-in-times-of-corona  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  23  3.4.4 Network investments and 5G  Triggered by the pandemic, governments around the world took steps to encourage  investments in the telecommunications networks and services, in particular in 5G.  The Chinese government, for instance, urged mobile operators to ramp up 5G investment.  The Chilean regulator updated antenna regulations to drive 5G infrastructure deployment  by reducing permit approval times. The motivation was in several cases clear also with  telecommunications operators themselves. In the United States for example, the interest  to invest in 5G fixed-wireless access solutions increased in response to increased  demands because of work and schooling from home. The operators Verizon, T-Mobile US  and US Cellular confirmed to continue with their 5G deployment plans, whereas AT&T,  Verizon and T-Mobile were clearly said to have interests in expanding their business in to  5G FWA. However, with the length and depth of the recession yet to be seen and  understood, the long-term network investment outlook has remained uncertain.  3.4.5 Adapting customer care services  Numerous operators around the world responded in support of their subscribers’ increased  communications demands by releasing data caps and offering discounted or even free  allowances, which further stimulated increases in the overall use of communications services.  Taking a closer look at the ways operators supported their subscribers, numerous initiatives  and calls for action were issued on the international and the national levels. Operators around  the world proceeded with measures such as increasing or removing data caps, offering free  unlimited internet service and access to entertainment and educational contents, flexible  payment options and the temporary suspension of long-distance and international roaming  fees for their subscribers.  In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) launched a Keep  Americans Connected initiative in response to the need to protect the most vulnerable  consumers, which was pledged by more than 700 companies and associations, including  AT&T, T-Mobile, Comcast, Verizon and CenturyLink. In Europe, a similar initiative was  launched by Telecommunications Industry Ireland, with BT Ireland, EIR, Pure Telecom,  Sky Ireland, Tesco Mobile Ireland, Three Ireland, Virgin Media Ireland and Vodafone, and  by the British regulator Ofcom in the United Kingdom with O2 UK, Vodafone UK, 3UK,  BT/EE, Openreach, Virgin Media, Sky, TalkTalk, Hyperoptic, Gigaclear and KCOM.  Another such initiative was launched by the Comisión Nacional de Telecomunicaciones  and telecommunications operators in Honduras. Operators in other countries followed suit,  for example Vodafone Hungary, Spanish Telefónica, Post Luxembourg, Belgian Proximus,  Orange in France, Ukranian Intertelecom, Beeline in Armenia, Kygyzstan and Georgia,  Unite and Moldtelecom networks in Moldova. Zain Kuwait, Zain Saudi Arabia, VNPT  Group, Viettel and MobiFone in Vietnam, Nepal Telecom, Airtel in India, Guatemalan Tigo,  Cuban Telecommunications Enterprise, Chilean Claro, Entel, GTD, Movistar and VTR,  and Liquid Telecom and Orange Mali in Africa.  Support measures were also launched by backbone and satellite providers; TOMIA, for  instance, an inter-carrier connectivity provider in the United States, offered a number of  free roaming services to their existing customers, and NBN in Australia provided a  temporary boost to data allowances for Sky Muster satellite customers to support those in  remote areas.  Services to reach government and healthcare websites and hotlines were zero-rated,  including for example with Tesco, O2, EE and Vodafone in the United Kingdom, and with  https://data.gsmaintelligence.com/api-web/v2/research-file-download?id=51249608&file=030420-Covid-mobile-networks.pdf https://www.mobileworldlive.com/blog/intelligence-brief-how-are-regulators-responding-to-covid-19/ https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/us-operators-press-on-with-5g-work/ https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/us-operators-press-on-with-5g-work/ https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/home-banner/bt-head-runs-business-remotely-after-virus-infection/ https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/home-banner/bt-head-runs-business-remotely-after-virus-infection/ https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/att-verizon-hungrily-eye-fixed-5g-progress/ https://www.fcc.gov/keep-americans-connected https://www.fcc.gov/keep-americans-connected https://www.comreg.ie/consumer-information/covid-19-information/consumer-commitments/ https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-agrees-measures-with-telecoms-companies-to-support-vulnerable-consumers-through-covid-19 http://www.conatel.gob.hn/index.php/2020/04/08/conatel-y-operadores-de-telecomunicaciones-garantizan-en-consenso-la-continuidad-de-los-servicios-para-todos-los-hondurenos/ https://www.vodafone.com/covid19/videos/vodafone-hungary https://www.telefonica.com/es/web/sala-de-prensa/-/telefonica-ante-el-coronavirus https://www.post.lu/particuliers/informations-covid-19 https://www.proximus.be/en/id_b_cr_proximus_helps/personal/blog/news/be-the-first-to-know/proximus-helps.html https://www.orange-business.com/fr/presse/dans-contexte-crise-liee-pandemie-covid-19-orange-accompagne-clients-pros-et-entreprises-0 https://www.intertelecom.ua/view/news/stayathome https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=53935 https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=53936 ttps://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=53934 http://unite.md/ro/personal/news/239 https://www.zain.com/en/covid19/kuwait/ https://www.zain.com/en/covid19/saudiarabia/ https://english.mic.gov.vn/Pages/TinTuc/141062/Telecom-companies-speed-up-internet--discount-services-amid-COVID-19.html https://english.mic.gov.vn/Pages/TinTuc/141062/Telecom-companies-speed-up-internet--discount-services-amid-COVID-19.html https://www.nepalitelecom.com/2020/05/nepal-telecom-role-covid19-pandemic-impact-challenges-opportunities.html https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=50294 https://ayuda.tigo.com.gt/hc/es/articles/360045620733-Medidas-sustitutivas-por-COVID-19-a-usuarios-Postpago-M%C3%B3vil%E2%80%8B https://twitter.com/ETECSA_Cuba/status/1245385347929948161?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1245385347929948161&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Foncubanews.com%2Fen%2Fcuba%2Fetecsa-lowers-rates-and-extends-validity-of-services%2F https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=51418 https://www.liquidtelecom.com/about-us/news/Liquid%20Telecom%20keeps%20home%20fibre%20users%20connected%20with%20unlimited%20high%20capacity%20broadband%20at%20zero%20extra%20cost https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=53952 https://www.channelmiddleeast.com/business-strategy/90892-tomia-offers-roaming-services-free-of-charge-to-network-operators https://www.communications.gov.au/telecommunications-sector https://www.tescomobile.com/coronavirus https://www.o2.co.uk/business/why-o2/our-approach/covid-19 https://ee.co.uk/business/small/help/contact-us/coronavirus/ https://newscentre.vodafone.co.uk/press-release/mobile-customers-free-access-to-nhs-online-services/  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  24  Airtel Nigeria in Africa. Consular services were free with many operators as well, for  example Megafon, Beeline and Tele2 provided free calls for roaming hotline numbers to  help Russian citizens abroad through teleconsultations, and A1 Belarus provided their  subscribers with free calls to the ‘hotlines’ of Belarusian diplomatic missions.  The way customer care services were organised also needed to be adapted, in an attempt to  limit personal contacts to prevent the disease from spreading further and to ensure the safety  of both the employees and the customers, as well as to cope with the increased volumes of  customer care inquiries as a result of increased usage demands.  3.4.6 In-store services move online  Following the implementation of social distancing measures, physical shops adapted in  various ways, including shorter working hours, specific protocols within stores of how  customers were served and segregating vulnerable customer groups (e.g. the elderly,  pregnant women), and in numerous countries even the complete closure of stores for the  period when the pandemic was at its worst. These limitations led operators to encourage or  set up new customer care services through other channels, in particular in the form of online  portals, virtual assistants, virtual rooms, etc.  Most operators in Europe closed their shops following the outbreak of COVID-19. French  Orange encouraged customers to make use of customer assistance, subscription  management services and purchases through their websites, mobile apps and chat  services. They scaled up customer relations resources accordingly, including contact  numbers, voice guides, chatbots, call centres and multichannel messaging services. Their  customer operations were managing an additional 130 inquires per day in response to  increased demands for upgrading internet connection speeds and data centre support.  Nearly 3 500 additional business services employees were mobilised to manage critical  customer care activities. They also reported on their capacity to transfer and distribute  their operational customer support activities to one of their five major service centres  around the world if required.  In Sweden, Telenor offered its customers the possibility to book a digital meeting remotely  to get help from the store in place of an in-person visit. Deutsche Telekom closed  approximately 500 stores in mid March in Germany as well as all stores in the Netherlands  and 80 % of shops in the United States. They integrated a voice bot into the voice portal to  automatically answer selected inquiries using artificial intelligence. Belgian Proximus  encouraged its subscribers to make an appointment in their physical stores or use video  chat instead. Vodafone UK, after closing their stores, encouraged its customers to use  their mobile application, website resources, helpline and self-help guides instead, as well  as a newly set up chatbot. O2 in the United Kingdom used a virtual queue system to  manage in-person visits to their stores.  In the United States, Sprint closed 71 % of its stores nationwide and AT&T 40 %, and both  operators adopted reduced operating hours for those that remained open. Shaw in  Canada closed all its stores and encouraged the use of other service platforms instead,  such as the MyShaw App, online chat, Facebook Messenger, Twitter or phone. In New  Zealand, Vodafone New Zealand, Spark and 2degrees closed their stores for foot traffic  while turning them into no-contact distribution sites aimed at providing essential  connectivity gear for their customers, in particular handsets, modems and replacement  SIMs. Vodafone Australia closed part of its stores in Sydney, redeployed employees to  customer care lines and encouraged its customers to use self-service channels in an  attempt to manage increased call volumes and reduced availability of its employees in  https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=53887 https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=53860 https://www.mpt.gov.by/ru/news/17-03-2020-6114 https://www.orange.com/en/Press-Room/press-releases/press-releases-2020/Orange-is-mobilised-to-ensure-continuity-of-service-for-all-customers-in-France-and-around-the-world https://www.orange.com/en/Press-Room/press-releases/press-releases-2020/Orange-is-mobilised-to-ensure-continuity-of-service-for-all-customers-in-France-and-around-the-world https://www.orange-business.com/fr/presse/orange-est-mobilise-pour-assurer-continuite-services-aupres-lensemble-clients-en-france https://www.orange-business.com/fr/presse/orange-est-mobilise-pour-assurer-continuite-services-aupres-lensemble-clients-en-france https://www.telenor.se/aktuell-information-corona/ https://www.telekom.com/de/blog/karriere/karriere/die-magische-it-welt-hinter-der-service-hotline-598868 https://www.proximus.be/en/id_b_cr_proximus_helps/personal/blog/news/be-the-first-to-know/proximus-helps.html https://newscentre.vodafone.co.uk/viewpoint/store-closures-how-we-can-help-our-customers/ https://www.o2.co.uk/covid-19 https://www.mobileworldlive.com/blog/covid-19-industry-impact-february-to-march/ https://www.shaw.ca/covid-19 https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/nz-operators-adapt-retail-model-during-lockdown/  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  25  Mumbai following measures implemented in India. Telekom Malaysia closed all retail  outlets.  In some countries, however, in particular in underserved world regions, the closure of  physical shops significantly affected both the operators and the customers. In India, for  example, where 90 % of the population uses prepaid accounts, the operators recorded a  35 % decline in balance top-ups due to customers being unable to visit retail stores. To  manage this situation, some operators, including Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel,  extended the validity period and offered additional allowances after India’s regulator  issued a request to prevent people from visiting the stores. In addition, the three major  operators offered customer incentives to recharge the accounts of other subscribers  online who might not be proficient with such services (Vodafone’s ‘Recharge for Good’  scheme, Airtel’s ‘Earn from Home’ program, Reliance Jio’s JIOPos Lite App). Airtel  launched a programme to incentivise micro entrepreneurs with large fleets of workers,  such as delivery services and transport companies (e.g. Uber), to provide recharging  services for citizens in return for a 4 % margin, thus providing income for such companies  as well.  3.4.7 In-house visits  To ensure the safety of personnel and customers, customer care services requiring house  visits or visits at the operator’s premises were also adapted. Operators took steps to limit  physical contact between their employees and customers by replacing house visits with  remote diagnostics and encouraging self-install/repair by the users themselves with  online/remote support where possible in the form of online instructions and manuals, video  guides and live support via voice or video service. For essential house visits that could be  preplaced with other forms of support, safety protocols were established. This included, for  example, qualifying customer contacts, e.g. by checking if any infected people were on the  premises by calling prior to the appointment and again immediately upon arrival, and providing  personal protective equipment for technicians and customers (gloves, face masks, hand  sanitisers, washing protocols, physical distancing instructions, protective gear and eyewear,  etc.).  In the United Kingdom, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media amd Sport issued  COVID-19 guidance for telecommunications infrastructure deployment in England, which  included guidance for works that have to take place at other people’s homes. Norwegian  Telenor and the United Kingdom’s Virgin Media, Openreach and CommunityFibre,  developed protocols for in-house visits of its personnel and subcontractors. These  included contacting the customer in advance to agree on the visit protocol, contacting  them again a few days before and on the day of the visit to clarify if there were any  conditions related to quarantine or isolation that would require postponing the visit. The  customer was also required to inform the operator in case an infection was detected with  them in the days following the visit. In Belgium, Proximus also adapted their in-house  visits accordingly to limit the chance of exposure and respect social distancing when on  site.  https://www.mobileworldlive.com/asia/asia-news/lockdown-takes-toll-on-india-prepaid-revenue/ https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/techook/jiopos-lite-airtel-superhero-vodafone-idea-rechargeforgood-benefits-6355150/ https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=50293 https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-guidance-for-telecommunications-infrastructure-deployment-in-england https://www.telenor.no/privat/internett/teknisk-arbeid-korona/ https://www.virginmedia.com/help/coronavirus-update https://www.openreach.com/covid-19-coronavirus https://communityfibre.co.uk/covid-19-faqs https://www.proximus.be/en/id_b_cr_proximus_helps/personal/blog/news/be-the-first-to-know/proximus-helps.html  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  26  4. RESPONSE BY  AUTHORITIES AND INDUSTRY  INITIATIVES  4.1 RESPONSE BY THE NATIONAL TELECOM AUTHORITIES  Across the EU, national telecom security authorities and other national competent authorities  cooperated closely with the operators and with crisis centres. Reporting mechanisms were set  up from the beginning of the pandemic. Operators and national internet exchanges exchanged  information on the evolution of network traffic as the pandemic evolved and on the response of  the networks and services to the increased communication needs.  In Austria, the Authority for telecom security (https://www.rtr.at/en ) remained in close contact  with the operators, with weekly exchanges of information.  In Belgium, the authority for post and telecoms (https://www.bipt.be/operators) set up a daily  reporting mechanism on network traffic with the largest operators. Over the following months  the frequency was reduced to successively thrice, twice and once a week. Reporting was  suspended at the beginning of June. They also coordinated contact between operators and the  crisis centre to allow lockdown exceptions, like the opening of telecom shops. Conference calls  with the operators proved to be useful.  In Bulgaria, the telecommunications authority (https://crc.bg/en) acted as a coordination centre,  supporting the measures of the government and the national crisis centre. They urged the public  to use fixed telephony rather than mobile telephony in an effort to reduce mobile traffic, which  was severely increased.  In Croatia, the national competent authority for telecoms (https://www.hakom.hr/) provided the  relevant state institutions with daily/weekly reports about the status of their networks and the  internet traffic situation. Planned upgrades were accelerated (e.g. expansions on intercity  capacities; internet upstream interconnection capacity; increase of cell capacity by adding all  available spectrum for LTE).The ISPs were well prepared for an increase in data traffic,  maximum capacities were not reached and the networks have the capacity to absorb an even  bigger increase in traffic.  In Cyprus, the authority for electronic communications (http://www.ocecpr.org.cy/) ensured the  frequent exchange of information between the NRA and the operators. The public was  informed about teleworking and the basic security measures to be more prepared against  phishing emails during the COVID-19 crisis.  In Czechia, the Czech Telecommunication Office (https://www.ctu.eu/) collected monitoring  reports of the telecom and the postal services operators. The initial increase in data due to the  use of videoconferencing tools was analysed from these reports and there were no problems in  public communication nets.  In Denmark, the competent authority (https://www.cybersecurityintelligence.com/centre-for-  cyber-security-cfcs-3071.html) handled the situation with a more or less closed down society in  close collaboration with the 10–15 most essential providers. They reported on a regular basis  in accordance with the guidelines the authority had set out, i.e. about operating status on net  and services, special challenges and problems, risks related especially to COVID-19 and any  https://www.rtr.at/en https://www.bipt.be/operators https://crc.bg/en https://www.hakom.hr/ http://www.ocecpr.org.cy/ https://www.ctu.eu/ https://www.cybersecurityintelligence.com/centre-for-cyber-security-cfcs-3071.html https://www.cybersecurityintelligence.com/centre-for-cyber-security-cfcs-3071.html  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  27  unusual cyber related activities and incidents. Emergency legislation was put in place, so that  the police could carry out DNS-blocking to prevent access to unauthorised homepages.  In France, the competent authority (https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/agence/cybersecurite/ssi-en-  france/) took measures to enable them to take down abusive websites more quickly (related to  COVID-19 misinformation and scams).  In Germany, according to the NRA (https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/  EN/Home/home_node.html), from week 14 to week 22, the pandemic affected the electronic  communications networks to a very small extent only. Despite considerable increases in voice  and data traffic in some cases, the networks remained stable.  In Greece, the NRA (www.eett.gr) monitored the situation and regularly collected data from  network operators. They reported weekly on the status of internet capacity, regulatory and  other measures. Teleconferencing proved to be effective way to establish trust between the  NRA and the operators when dealing with crises like the recent pandemic.  The Greek communications security authority (www.adae.gr) disseminated a two-pillar  questionnaire to the operators. Providers were asked about potential alterations that occurred  in their BCP or in their systems’ RTOs, in the contracts with third parties or with their suppliers.  They were also asked to audit their internal critical departments and the most critical business  processes, and to identify potential alterations. The second pillar of the questionnaire  contained technical questions about specific parts of their networks and specific systems that  were mostly overloaded either in the core, aggregation or the access part of the network.  Finally, the authority performed audits on the new SMS platform that managed all the SMS  messages sent during lockdown by Greek citizens to declare their will and reason for leaving  their house as well as the authorisation answers sent by the server.  In Hungary, the NRA (http://english.nmhh.hu/) issued a statement that residential users should  save internet capacity by using lower resolution video downloads and limiting their internet  usage to the minimum necessary. Regardless of these measures the networks were in a very  good condition.  In Ireland, ComReg (https://www.comreg.ie/) released additional radio spectrum on a  temporary basis to MNOs to mitigate this extra traffic demand  (https://www.comreg.ie/industry/radio-spectrum/spectrum-awards/covid-19-temporary-  spectrum-management-measures/). Clarifications were made as to who is considered essential  worker. ComReg also provided weekly updates to the Department of Communications Climate  Action and Environment based on the information provided by operators on their network traffic  and capacity for voice and data; weekly industry preparedness team meetings were hosted  and attended by all operators, in order to discuss and deal with urgent issues.  In Luxembourg the NRA (https://web.ilr.lu/FR/ILR) received updates from the national internet  exchange. There were no congestions. Some problems arose with customer installation and  fault management, due to the refusal of customers to let operator field personnel inside their  homes.  In Malta, there were two distinct streams of activities carried out by the government and the  competent authority (https://www.mca.org.mt/). Before the restrictive period and eventual  partial lockdown was in place, the government, through the relevant ministry, requested that  providers of ECS provide detailed business continuity plans covering plans to tackle growth in  traffic, situations where there could be power losses and/or shortages of fuel supply as well as  situations where staff are impaired to travel or quarantined. The authority requested that  providers monitor and report on traffic evolution, initially three times a week, down to once  https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/agence/cybersecurite/ssi-en-france/ https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/agence/cybersecurite/ssi-en-france/ https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/%20EN/Home/home_node.html https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/%20EN/Home/home_node.html http://www.eett.gr/ http://www.adae.gr/ http://english.nmhh.hu/ https://www.comreg.ie/ https://www.comreg.ie/industry/radio-spectrum/spectrum-awards/covid-19-temporary-spectrum-management-measures/ https://www.comreg.ie/industry/radio-spectrum/spectrum-awards/covid-19-temporary-spectrum-management-measures/ https://web.ilr.lu/FR/ILR https://www.mca.org.mt/  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  28  every 2 weeks as the traffic situation quickly become stable. Providers were also requested to  alert the NRA of any arising situations that might alter the risk of a security or integrity incident.  In the Netherlands, the radio communications agency (https://www.agentschaptelecom.nl/) was  in daily contact with the providers to share information.  In Norway, in the early stages of the pandemic, the competent authority (https://www.nkom.no/)  ensured that providers reviewed their contingency plans. Status reports from providers on  ongoing incidents, capacity status, availability of critical personnel and equipment were  collected. Information on regulatory decisions relevant to the sector was coordinated.  In Poland, the NRA (https://uke.gov.pl/en/) received reports from the 16 largest operators on  voice and data load on networks and other phenomena that threatened the security and  continuity of services. On the basis of this information, a message was published on the  authority’s website and Facebook/Twitter profiles that the situation related to quality and  continuity of telecommunications services was under control. Individual operators published  similar information.  In Romania, ANCOM(https://www.ancom.ro/en/) sent a questionnaire to the most important  electronic communication providers regarding traffic evolution and the security measures  implemented in the context of COVID-19. Providers had to answer the questionnaire every  2 weeks and significant changes as soon as possible. Based on this information, ANCOM  reported to ENISA and BEREC. ANCOM also asked electronic communication providers not to  suspend or disconnect their subscribers in case of non-payment of invoices during the state of  emergency. ANCOM also had a dialogue with the Ministry of Internal Affairs, highlighting the  importance of cooperation between the electronic communication providers and the national  crisis cell.  In Serbia, RATEL (https://www.ratel.rs/en/) provided information, advice and  recommendations on relevant topics on its official website. The first instructions were released  immediately and they concerned the procedure for obtaining lockdown exemption permits for  operators’ employees in order to be able to carry out essential repairs and maintenance  during lockdown. A number of suggestions to users and recommendations for optimal network  configuration and connections made from home have also been provided in the media as well  as on social media platforms (Facebook and LinkedIn). Responsible use of the internet and  warnings about possible misuse were also promoted. The largest EC operators and ISPs  updated RATEL daily on their networks and services status, network load, usage, congestion  and demands for additional capacity.  In Slovenia, (https://www.akos-rs.si/), the government started the national plan for protection  of rescue in the event of a pandemic. Most of bigger telecom providers in the country had  pandemic contingency plans in place. Higher demand was solved with additional links and by  setting additional base stations and network elements.  In Slovakia, the NRA (https://www.teleoff.gov.sk) established a special pandemic commission,  which met regularly in order to promptly solve operational issues related to the pandemic. In  accordance with ENISA requirements, a questionnaire was sent to the main telco operators.  The NRA also provided recommendations for operators on how to manage their networks  during the COVID-19 crisis, in accordance with recommendations from the International  Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute.  In Sweden, PTS (https://www.pts.se/en/) activated its crisis management organisation at an  early stage to be able to monitor the situation closely and to be prepared to act if necessary.  Telcos made use of their respective pandemic plans (produced during the ‘bird-flu’ H5N1 in  2009) and updated them. The government clarified which sectors in society should be  https://www.agentschaptelecom.nl/ https://www.nkom.no/ https://uke.gov.pl/en/ https://www.ancom.ro/en/ https://www.ratel.rs/en/ https://www.akos-rs.si/ https://www.teleoff.gov.sk/ https://www.pts.se/en/  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  29  prioritised when it came to testing for COVID-19 and childcare (legislation was implemented),  so society could still function. PTS analysed and indicated which functions within electronic  communications and postal services should be prioritised.  The National Telecommunications Coordination Group (a voluntary forum for cooperation  between different telecommunications providers and PTS, with the aim to restore national  infrastructure for electronic communications during severe strains or difficulties in society),  started to meet in February and have had regular meetings since then. Members of the group  have tried to foresee what could happen to electronic communications given different scenarios  related to COVID-19 to be able to prepare for different situations and reduce the impact on  society.  In Switzerland, the COVID-19 crisis triggered the declaration of the highest national state of  emergency. The crisis committee, of which BAKOM (https://www.bakom.admin.ch/) is a  member, was called up and met weekly. The state of emergency was relaxed to the second  level on 19 June. The overload of telephony at the beginning of the lockdown was quickly  solved by increasing the capacity of the affected interconnection links. A mechanism was  activated, whereby essential staff of the operators could be exempted from civil protection duty.  An emergency decree was prepared intended to limit telecom traffic, e.g. in the event of a  severe overload. It was not necessary to enact the decree.  4.2 INDUSTRY INITIATIVES  Numerous cooperative initiatives and joint actions were launched around the world in order to  support the industry in its response and to facilitate cooperation and exchange of practices.  Twenty eight trade associations from around the world joined the Information Technology  Industry Council’s (ITI) call for governments at all levels worldwide to adopt clear and uniform  guidance regarding essential ICT workers for the purpose of their business continuity and  maintenance operations. The call came when increasing numbers of jurisdictions issued  orders restricting individuals’ freedom of movement in reaction to COVID-19. ITI specifically  addressed the authorities in the United States, Brazil, India and Malaysia where such issues  were identified. In Colombia, the Comision de Regulacion de Communicaciones  facilitated  work with territorial entities to guarantee digital attention and the movement of technical crews  so that communication networks could continue to operate during curfews and other  measures associated with the pandemic.  However, the implementation of such measures of national levels was not always trivial. In  India for example, despite telecommunications networks having been recognised as critical  infrastructure, the Cellular Operators Association of India  had to intervene with state  authorities after operators experienced issues with their technicians being denied access to  telecom sites located in COVID-19 hotspots by local authorities, posing a significant threat to  the uninterrupted operation of services. German 1&1 Drillisch announced delays in its 5G  network build due to issues with permissions to access sites during the ongoing lockdown in  the country.  4.2.1 Exchanging good practices  Several platforms were set up to support the monitoring of the COVID-19 situation with  networks and internet traffic and to share best practices and measures taken to keep the  communications services running.  https://www.bakom.admin.ch/ https://www.itic.org/news-events/news-releases/momentum-builds-as-28-associations-from-around-the-world-join-call-for-uniform-guidance-for-essential-tech-workers-during-covid-19-pandemic https://www.crcom.gov.co/es/noticia/crc-contin-a-implementando-medidas-para-garantizar-el-acceso-a-servicios-de-comunicaciones-por-parte-de-los-ciudadanos-en-medio-de-la-contingencia-por-covid-19 https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/telcos-warn-of-full-service-breakdown-in-virus-hotspots/articleshow/75111780.cms?from=mdr https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/german-newcomer-5g-build-delayed-by-virus/  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  30  The WHO published a WHO COVID-19 SMS message library and together with ITU they called  on all telecommunications companies worldwide to support the delivery of these messages in  communication with the general public via SMS and voice messages.  During COVID-19, the European Emergency Number Association data and strategies per  country on emergency calls and public warning during COVID-19 outbreak was tracking the use  of Public Warning Systems (PWS) in Europe and comprehensive reports per country were  provided.  ITU launched the Global Network Resiliency Platform (#REG4COVID), where regulators,  policymakers and other interested stakeholders were able to share information, view what  initiatives and measures have been introduced around the world, and discuss and exchange  experiences, ongoing initiatives and innovative policy and regulatory measures designed in  response to COVID-19.  The Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development, the UN’s high-level public–private  partnership, released the Agenda for Action, with the intention to bring together  intergovernmental, regional, national, industry, civil society and technical and academic  communities to shape strategies around three main pillars of resilient connectivity, affordable  access and safe use of online services for informed and educated societies, in order to mitigate  the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, ease its immediate adverse impacts and contribute to  long-term development for better preparedness and resilience.  As part of the RIPE hackathon on the health of the internet during the COVID-19 crisis, an  experimental interface was developed from the RIPE Atlas database, the RIPE Atlas  dashboard: Network delays during national lockdowns on the health of the internet to monitor  and study congestion that could occur at large eyeball networks during mass quarantines.  ITU released new guidelines for countries to develop national emergency telecommunications  plans to keep networks online during national emergencies. Contingency planning also includes  specific elements relevant to COVID-19.  NCTA members in the United States and other providers joined to report key metrics during the  pandemic in an online dashboard: COVID-19: How cable’s internet networks are performing.  In the Caribbean, a COVID-19 taskforce was launched, consisting of telecom operators and  industry experts, to engage governments and regulators and share best practices during the  pandemic.  The Digital development joint action plan and call for action, initiated by the World Bank, ITU,  GSMA and the World Economic Forum, provided a set of guidelines for regulators and  decision-makers on a number of ICT-enabled pandemic response objectives.  In 2018, the Broadband Commission published a report on epidemic preparedness: Preventing  the spread of epidemics using ICT, extensively elaborating on the use of ICT and mobile  networks in particular for pandemic response. This report provides numerous examples from  past incidents, such as the Ebola and Zika outbreaks, as well as useful resources on the use of  text messaging services for epidemic information and infection management, for example SMS  messages sent to at-risk travellers, and the use of mobile data for pandemic tracking and  prediction. It also provided guidelines and examples on the use of various mobile technologies  for sharing vital information with the public, such as IVR, SMS and USSD, as well as, for  example, suggested messaging content, user journeys and messaging frequency.  https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/covid-19-message-library https://eena.org/data-strategies-emergency-calls-public-warning-covid19/ https://eena.org/data-strategies-emergency-calls-public-warning-covid19/ https://reg4covid.itu.int/ https://www.broadbandcommission.org/COVID19/Pages/default.aspx https://ihr.iijlab.net/ihr/en-us/covid19 https://ihr.iijlab.net/ihr/en-us/covid19 https://www.gsma.com/betterfuture/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/COVID-19_Digital-Development-Joint-Action-Plan-GSMA_TheWorldBank_ITU_WEF.pdf https://www.ncta.com/COVIDdashboard https://www.gsma.com/betterfuture/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/COVID-19_Digital-Development-Joint-Action-Plan-GSMA_TheWorldBank_ITU_WEF.pdf https://www.gsma.com/betterfuture/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Digital-Development-Joint-Action-Plan_Call-for-Action-Report-2020.pdf https://www.broadbandcommission.org/Documents/working-groups/BBCOM%20WG%20Epidemic%20Preparedness%20Final%20Print%20(Executive%20Summary).pdf https://www.broadbandcommission.org/Documents/working-groups/BBCOM%20WG%20Epidemic%20Preparedness%20Final%20Print%20(Executive%20Summary).pdf  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  31  Ookla set up interactive dashboards with per-country insights into their data to monitor the  impact of COVID-19 on the performance and quality of global mobile and broadband internet  networks.  The European Commission and BEREC, with the support of NRAs, set up a reporting  mechanism to monitor internet traffic in the EU Member States.  4.2.2 Adaptation of streaming quality and scheduling of popular releases  To manage the increased demand in communications, cooperation within the industry as well as  with the end users was essential, and at the same time a cost-efficient measure, in particular to  promote responsibility with regards to how the content was served during the pandemic.  The telecommunications industry reached out to content providers with agreements on reducing  the bitrates for specific types of content to preserve the operation of vital communications services,  and to agree on careful scheduling of downloads of popular new content, such as gaming updates.  In March 2020, the European Broadcasting Union prepared a strategy for adapting streaming  quality during the crisis. Among other provisions, the strategy provided guidance on the adaptation  of streaming services in respect of network congestion issues through streaming bitrate reduction,  in particular during office hours, and arranging adaptive streaming manifests for premium quality to  fixed large screen devices over mobile devices. Some reports speculate that without the OTT video  streaming service providers shifting to standard definition, networks in many regions of the world  would have seen the percentage of the overall traffic volume reach as high as 70 % and the quality  of service would have been severely affected on many networks, especially during evening peak  hours.  In Europe, the strain on communications networks was considerably relieved following a call by  the EU’s Commissioner for Internal Market, Thierry Breton, to major streaming content  providers, including Netflix, YouTube, Amazon and Disney, to take action in reducing the  bitrates and switching to standard definition in response to increased connectivity demands  resulting from social distancing measures. Netflix for example, reduced their bitrates across all  streams in Europe, thus reducing its traffic on European networks by 25 %. They did not restrict  higher resolutions; instead, they readjusted and changed encoding for the existing qualities.

Akami, for example, cooperated with Microsoft and Sony to agree on  dynamic rescheduling for downloads of new gaming updates to off-peak times. Sony, Ubisoft  and Xbox limited their internet footprints. In Colombia, the ICT ministry requested that internet  platforms offer services in standard definition as opposed to more data intensive higher  definitions that could overload already stressed networks.  4.2.3 Promoting responsible use of network resources  Once networks experienced spikes in the volume of traffic and congestions, numerous  telecommunications operators and regulators also reached out to their customers asking them  to use the resources responsibly. From past emergency experience, this is one of the most  cost-effective measures to be taken in managing network overloads during high consumption  demands.  The United Kingdom’s Ofcom, in cooperation with the biggest telcos including BT, Sky, O2,  Vodafone and Virgin Media, launched a Stay Connected campaign and provided guidelines to  its subscribers on how to adapt their usage to help keep the network operational. Telefónica’s  Movistar, Orange, Vodafone, Masmovil and Euskaltel in Spain, as well as regulators such as  the United States’ FCC took similar measures in an attempt to raise awareness with the end  users. In Italy, a joint letter was issued by the country’s fixed and mobile operators in March  2020 urging consumers to take a number of measures to keep network bandwidth available for  critical services and teleworking. The operators suggested delaying video streaming and  gaming to outside of peak working hours, using landlines rather than mobile services for voice  calls, avoiding video in work collaboration tools and avoiding massive emails with sizeable  attachments.  In Nepal, ISPAN, NTA and Nepali Telecom issued a request to people to use the internet  responsibly and avoid binge watching and gaming, and also to not change their internet settings  because of limited possibilities to provide assistance through at-home visits. Similar guidelines  were provided by numerous other operators and organisations around the world, including the  Secretariat of the Inter-American Telecommunication Commission, the Communications  Regulatory Authority of the Republic of Lithuania , the Mexican Ministry of Communications and  Transportation in coordination with other federal government institutions, the Communications  Regulatory Agency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, CenturyLink, OGERO in Lebanon, French  ARCEP and Greece’s Ministry of Digital Governance. The importance of governments  promoting smart and responsible use of network resources by the general public during times of  crisis was also emphasised by numerous other national and international organisations,  including for example the World Economic Forum, NCTA and Cablelabs.  4.2.4 Management of spectrum resources  The NRAs worldwide handled demand for additional spectrum resources.  In addition to providing access to additional spectrum capacities, regulators in numerous countries,  including Malaysia, Argentina, Canada, Romania, Kenya, Yemen and Mauritius, have delayed or  even partially waived payments of spectrum fees, thus supporting additional investments into  providing sufficient connectivity capacities. In April 2020, for example, the Ministry of Internal Affairs  and Communications of Japan deferred the collection of payments for spectrum user fees in areas  where emergency measures were to be taken due to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.  https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2020/03/26/game-companies-go-off-peak-to-reduce-bandwidth-usage https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Emergency-Telecommunications/Documents/2020/NETP-guidelines.pdf https://www.capacitymedia.com/articles/3825122/live-covid-19-coronavirus-news-how-the-telecoms-world-is-dealing-with-the-pandemic https://news.o2.co.uk/press-release/uk-telecoms-industry-joins-together-to-help-the-country-stay-connected/ https://www.fiercetelecom.com/telecom/spainish-carriers-see-a-40-spike-network-traffic-due-to-covid-19 https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/spain-set-to-suspend-operator-switching-in-virus-fight/ https://www.nepalitelecom.com/2020/03/nta-requests-use-internet-corona.html https://www.nepalitelecom.com/2020/03/internet-usage-increases-corona-speed-slow.html https://www.citel.oas.org/en/Pages/default.aspx https://www.rrt.lt/en/covid-19-important-information/covid-19/ https://www.rrt.lt/en/covid-19-important-information/covid-19/ https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/545575/Gui_a_para_el_uso_TIC_quedate_en_casa_Abril_2020.pdf https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/545575/Gui_a_para_el_uso_TIC_quedate_en_casa_Abril_2020.pdf https://rak.ba/en/news/1657 https://rak.ba/en/news/1657 https://news.centurylink.com/connections-1?item=873 https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=50372 https://www.arcep.fr/demarches-et-services/utilisateurs/teletravail-et-connexion-internet.html https://greekcitytimes.com/2020/03/17/greek-government-issues-ten-commandments-for-responsible-internet-use-during-pandemic/ https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/covid-19-5-ways-to-protect-critical-digital-connectivity/ https://www.ncta.com/whats-new/what-know-about-covid-19-and-the-internet-experience https://www.cablelabs.com/tips-to-improve-your-home-wi-fi-performance https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=50267 https://www.icta.mu/mediaoffice/2020/licence_extends.pdf https://www.soumu.go.jp/main_sosiki/joho_tsusin/eng/COVID-19/141289_04.html https://www.soumu.go.jp/main_sosiki/joho_tsusin/eng/COVID-19/141289_04.html  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  33  Demands for additional spectrum resources were particularly high in the United States, where  the FCC granted special temporary authority to multiple wireless carriers in coverage (600–  700 MHz) and capacity (1.7–2.2 GHz) bands, including to operators AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, US  Cellular, Verizon, and several service providers in rural communities. This constituted granting  special temporary authorities either on a secondary non-interference basis for operating in  spectrum licensed to other operators, or for spectrum bands that are not licensed. For example,  on 17 March 2020 the FCC approved a move by US Cellular to access AWS-3 spectrum held  by Advantage Spectrum for a period of 60 days to boost capacity in parts of California, Oregon,  Washington and Wisconsin, and on 16 March 2020 cleared T-Mobile US to use the additional  600 MHz of spectrum licensed to several broadcast companies, including Dish Network,  Comcast, NewLevel, LB License Co, Channel 51, Omega, Bluewater and TStar License  Holdings, to allow the operator to respond to increased usage demands. AT&T secured new  access to AWS-4 and 700 MHz spectrum, including in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.  Bluegrass Cellular was granted access to AWS-1 spectrum in Kentucky and Union Wireless in  Wyoming. On 27 March 2020 temporary spectrum access was granted to 33 wireless internet  service providers serving 330 counties in 29 states to help support rural communities facing an  increase in broadband needs during the pandemic and for telework, remote learning and  telehealth in particular.  In Europe, similar demands were reported in Ireland, where the regulator ComReg released  additional spectrum capacities in the 700 MHz and 2.6 GHz spectrum bands available for  temporary licensing at low costs, with changed conditions for 2.1 GHz to ensure it can be used  for 4G connectivity. Regulators and operators in the United Kingdom, France and Italy, on the  other hand, reported that the available spectrum was sufficient and no requests for additional  capacities were made.  In the Middle East, Jordan released available spectrum on a short-term basis to MNOs in  capacity bands, sub-1 GHz and fixed wireless access, followed by similar measures in Saudi  Arabia for capacity bands and sub-1 GHz (an additional 40 MHz in the 700 MHz and 800 MHz  bands). Oman’s regulator TRA has temporarily allocated additional spectrum in the 1.8 GHz  and 2.1 GHz bands for free, proceeded with allowing licensees to activate wireless broadband  service through WFBB-LTE-FDD using the 4G frequencies, and encouraged operation of the  national roaming facility. In the United Arab Emirates, the national regulator extended the  validity of all wireless permits to hospitals and medical centres as well as provided a package of  wireless frequency as backup to support the Health sector’s wireless communication systems.  In South America, Panama’s NRA announced granting of temporary spectrum licenses to  MNOs upon request and similar actions have also been announced in Brazil. The Secretariat of  the Inter-American Telecommunication Commission, took a number of actions to encourage the  expansion of internet coverage and other telecommunications services, especially in areas that  do not have access, including agile granting of permits for temporary use of spectrum and for  the deployment of infrastructure in order to expand network coverage. National Authority of  Public Services in Panama authorised free access for 90 days to an additional 30 MHz band of  the AWS band to all mobile operators, thus making available in total an additional 120 MHz of  spectrum.  In Africa, the African Telecommunications Union issued a set of guidelines to governments in  order to make the necessary spectrum available for different types of services as well as  availability of different combinations of spectrum bands free of charge for emergency  communications to support rapid deployment of terrestrial and satellite systems with limited  interference. In Ghana, Vodafone and MTN were granted free access to additional spectrum  bands for capacity augmentation. Tunisia made all IMT spectrum tech-neutral on a short-term  basis while South Africa’s regulator ICASA granted temporary access to spectrum bands in the  700 MHz, 800 MHz, 2.3 GHz, 2.6 GHz and 3.5 GHz bands.

In Sudan, NRAs have  granted additional radio frequency spectrum free of charge to Zain on a temporary basis. Kenya  fast-tracked approval of Alphabet’s Loon project to expedite the commercial deployment of  internet-enabled balloons in partnership with Telkom Kenya, delivering 4G coverage to remote,  previously unserved communities. Agência Reguladora Multissetorial da Economía of the  African Cape Verde proceeded with allocating additional spectrum to mobile operators and also  implemented technological neutrality of the 900 MHz band for the operators to reinforce 2G, 3G  and 4G networks.  In Malaysia, the regulator granted Telekom Malaysia early access to 700 MHz and 3.5 GHz on  a trial basis to support 5G operation in COVID-19 quarantine hotspots, followed by awarding  operators Telekom Malaysia, Celcom Axiata, and units from Maxis and DiGi.Com access to the  700 MHz band of 5G network on 15 May 2020.  New Zealand completed direct allocation of spectrum in the 3.5 GHz band for an interim period  until November 2022, with Spark and 2degrees gaining rights to 60 MHz and Dense Air  40 MHz. The move followed postponement of the 5G spectrum auction in an attempt to boost  5G rollout throughout 2020 in response to the pandemic.  https://ca.go.ke/leveraging-icts-in-the-fight-against-covid-19-pandemic/ https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=54002 https://www.mobileworldlive.com/blog/intelligence-brief-how-are-regulators-responding-to-covid-19/ https://www.arme.cv/index.php/noticia-geral/528-covid-19-arme-emite-recomendacoes-e-fixa-medidas-excecionais-para-sectores-regulados https://www.arme.cv/index.php/noticia-geral/528-covid-19-arme-emite-recomendacoes-e-fixa-medidas-excecionais-para-sectores-regulados https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/govt-awards-700-mhz-band-tm-celcom-digi-maxis-and-altel https://www.mobileworldlive.com/asia/asia-news/nz-skips-5g-auction-allocates-airwaves-direct/  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  35  5. CONCLUSIONS AND  LESSONS LEARNED  The experiences collected so far have shown that the emergency caused by the pandemic  lasted for a much longer period of time compared to any other crisis. The operators were forced  to address many security and resilience challenges through established business continuity  management practices as well as a good measure of flexibility and creativity.  The exact situation and lessons learned were unique with practically each country and operator.  Larger negative effects appeared more often in fragile and conflict-affected countries and  regions, although there were exceptions in more stable and higher-income countries as well.  The most interesting lessons learned as described in Sections 2, 3 and 4 are gathered as  follows.  5.1 LESSONS LEARNED FOR OPERATORS  Telecommunications operators should support emergency services.  There should be support plans established for frontline professionals involved in the  crisis response activities, and measures to ensure sufficient communications  capacities and coverage to support emergency response services in staying connected  and being able to communicate smoothly. The measures could include coverage in  hotspot zones and in locations where critical response infrastructures are located  permanently (e.g. hospitals) or deployed temporarily.  Cooperative initiatives to support the monitoring of the situation and the sharing of best  practices are necessary. Continuous cooperation within the industry is essential in  addressing the challenges as they emerge.  The crisis plans of the operators and the related decision-making processes should  stay flexible and adapt dynamically through time as the crisis evolves. It is important to  set up committees and boards with sufficient know-how to guide the decision-making  process.  There is need for subscriber support during all stages of a crisis.   Alleviating measures could include increasing or removing data caps, offering  free unlimited internet service and access to entertainment and educational  contents, flexible payment options and temporary suspension of long-distance  and international roaming.   Setting up new customer care services, mostly in the form of online portals,  virtual assistants and virtual rooms is essential for enhanced customer  support during crisis. House visits should be replaced, where possible, with  remote diagnostics and encouraging self-install/repair by the users  themselves with online/remote support where possible in the form of online  instructions and manuals, video guides as well as live support via voice or  video service. For essential house visits, safety protocols should be  established.  The management of exceptionally high demands as a result of the pandemic calls for  reconfigurations of existing network equipment and placement of additional network  equipment, securing of additional spectrum resources, resource sharing between  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  36  operators, applying for access to backhaul spectrum, as well as emergency  deployments, including using new technologies.  Interesting practices include capacity increases, implementation of call gaping, codec  reconfigurations resulting in voice quality reduction, time limits, direct retry, dynamic  quality and data consumption balancing, configuration of traffic prioritisation to support  emergency communications and essential services.  Using remote and unmanned monitoring, surveillance of the infrastructure and  diagnostics, e.g. remote access to networking equipment and even drones, limits the  exposure of essential personnel of the operators. Redundant teams of essential  technicians and non-overlapping work shifts should be organised to limit risk exposure,  and contacts with suppliers and subcontractors limited.  5.2 LESSONS LEARNED FOR AUTHORITIES  Responsible use of telecommunications resources with regards to how the content is  served and consumed during the emergency should be promoted through awareness-  raising initiatives.  Guidelines can include both general things users can do to keep spikes in traffic load  smaller as well as measures they can take themselves in case they experience  interruptions or degraded service quality. Some examples include:   using fixed or Wi-Fi telephony, or over-the-top apps, instead of mobile voice  services if interruptions start to occur;   prioritising traffic for important use, such as access to information, remote  work and education, and rescheduling consumption of non-essential services  such as streamed video entertainment and online games to off-peak hours;   applying settings that reduce data consumption, including the use of Wi-Fi or  lower resolution for content, avoiding sending large files, such as videos and  presentations, and using e.g. cloud sharing services instead or compressing  the contents;   choosing online collaborative work tools instead of video conference calls.  Agreements should be reached for reducing the bitrates for specific types of content to  preserve the operation of vital communications services and for careful scheduling of  downloads of popular new content, such as gaming updates.  Cooperation with the competent authorities and supervising ministries, policy alignment  and fast and flexible responses of the regulatory initiatives are essential. There is a  need for fast awarding of licenses and management of license fees under emergency  conditions. Temporary release of additional radio spectrum and increase of  interconnection voice circuits among operators are some interesting initiatives on  behalf of the states.  Information to do with the handling of crisis has to be disseminated in a timely way to  key stakeholders, so that they can successfully adjust and apply their business  continuity plans.  Declaring the telecommunications services as an essential service is necessary for  granting the operators travel and access permissions during potential lockdowns, or for  keeping the telecommunication stores open.  Reporting mechanisms should be set up for the competent authorities to gather  information on the evolution of network traffic and on the response of the networks and  services in the increased communication needs.  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  37  Underserved communities become even more vulnerable in crises times. Therefore,  network capacity and coverage should be enhanced in rural areas, and investments  and innovation should be encouraged.  5.3 CONCLUSIONS  Overall we can draw the following conclusions:   The general take away from the pandemic so far is that the services and the networks  have been resilient during the crisis, despite major changes in usage and traffic.   Overall the business continuity plans of operators worked well. Business continuity has  always been an important point of focus for the sector.   There has been good collaboration between providers and national authorities, not  only at the beginning of the pandemic but also in the later stages.   The perception of consumers has changed: Electronic communications are now  considered a lifeline for citizens and key enablers for the economy and society.

In this paper, we look at the role telecom providers played in ensuring the security  and resilience of the services and networks during the pandemic.  This paper focuses on the telecom networks and services themselves, not the  endpoints. So COVID-related cyberattacks like COVID phishing emails and scam  domain names are out of scope here. Also we don’t discuss the arson attacks on  base stations inspired by the conspiracy theories about the pandemic.  Throughout this paper we give examples of good practices and we conclude with  lessons learned. We look at the following three aspects.   Early response phase: in this phase, providers activated their business  continuity plans and supported emergency communications and public  warnings. We give examples of such activities in the EU and across the  globe.   From initial strain to the new normal: providers had to deal with major  surges and shifts in usage and traffic patterns from the start of the  pandemic. This gradually stabilised to what is now considered the new  normal. We look in detail at the changes in usage and traffic patterns and  the network performance monitoring during the pandemic, and examine how  providers managed the increased network loads.   Response by the national authorities and collaboration with the sector:  we give a brief country-by-country summary of the pandemic response by  the national telecom security authorities in the EU and we give examples of  collaboration initiatives and information sharing between providers and  authorities as well as in the private sector.  The general take away from the pandemic so far is that the services and the  networks have been resilient during the crisis, despite major changes in usage and  traffic.  The pandemic also had a lasting effect on the perception of consumers about  telecoms: Electronic communication networks are now considered as a lifeline for  citizens and they are crucial to keep the economy and society going.  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  5  From discussions with experts in the sector and the national authorities, we can also draw the  following first lessons and ideas for improvements:  There is a need for intense cooperation and policy alignment between the various  stakeholders in the public sector (competent authorities/ministries) but also between  the public and the private sector, among the industry and with the citizens.  There is a need to build trust between the public sector and critical infrastructure  operators. Information relevant to the handling of the crisis has to be disseminated in a  timely way to key stakeholders, so that they can successfully adjust and apply their  business continuity plans.  It is a crucial in this period to provide enhanced support to digitalisation, focusing on:  • enhancing network capacity and coverage in rural areas;  • encouraging investments and innovation (broadband/fibre vouchers,  teleworking, e-government).  The internal operations of the providers have to be flexible, able to adapt to emerging  situations and aligned with the company’s business continuity plan. Remote and  unmanned monitoring and surveillance of the infrastructure and diagnostic, as well as  remote access to networking equipment should be promoted.  Telecom customers should be supported with advanced customer care services.  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  6  1. INTRODUCTION  The COVID-19 pandemic required an immediate response from the EU’s telecom sector. In this  paper, we look at the role of telecom providers in ensuring the security and resilience of the  telecom networks during the pandemic.  We focus on the networks and services, the telecommunication infrastructure. Out of scope are  COVID related attacks on endpoints like COVID phishing emails and COVID scam domain  names. The ENISA Threat Landscape 2020 gives an overview of such attacks.  The paper focuses on the following three aspects:   Early response phase: this section summarises the steps taken by providers in the  early response phase, in activating business continuity plans and supporting  emergency services and communications.   From initial strain to the new normal: this section looks in detail at the network traffic  changes. It gives examples of how providers are coping with the load and the need to  manage the network traffic.   Response by the authorities and collaboration with the industry: this section  summarises the response of national authorities in the EU, country-by-country. It  contains some examples of collaboration between the authorities and the industry and  within the industry.  Note that throughout the paper, we highlight a few examples from the real world, using  information from public sources, for the sake of illustration (not to single out a single provider for  criticism or praise).  This paper does not intend to give a full and complete overview of how EU providers reacted to  overcome the crisis, but it gives a number of interesting examples from providers in the EU and  in the rest of the world.  1.1 TARGET AUDIENCE  The paper targets security and resilience experts in the telecom sector, cybersecurity experts  and experts at national authorities and ministries.  1.2 SCOPE  The scope of this report is the impact of the pandemic on electronic communication networks  and services. The goal is to give an overview of the different activities telecom providers  undertook to safeguard the security and resilience of their networks and services during the  pandemic.  1.3 METHODOLOGY  The methodology for this paper was a stock-taking desktop research to collect a wide range of  examples, statistics, and good practices, followed by targeted interviews with sector experts.  At the start of this work, the Article 13a Expert Group provided direction and provided  information about the reaction to the pandemic by the EU telecom security telecom authorities  (see Chapter 4 of this report). The group also reviewed a final draft of the paper.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-threat-landscape-2020 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  7  2. EARLY RESPONSE PHASE  In this section, we look at the role of telecom providers in the early response to the pandemic.  We examine at two key activities:   providers activating their business continuity plans;   providers supporting emergency services and emergency communications.  2.1 ACTIVATION OF BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANS  Following the outbreak of the pandemic, telecommunications networks and services were given  the status of critical infrastructure across the globe. Telecom providers quickly adapted and  activated their business continuity plans.  Providers implemented changes to the workplace, including protection measures such as  contact limitation, turns/shifts, remote working and decentralizing key engineering staff, to avoid  that one infection would affect an entire engineering or security function.  Most providers, from the onset, reduced physical meetings, events and business travel,  gradually moving to a complete halt of all (non-essential) travel. Note that the approach of  individual operators was different depending on the rules and the government strategy in each  country.  Remote work was a global recommendation adopted by most organisations and institutions,  including the World Health Organization (WHO). Most telecommunication operators followed  suit and advised employees to work from home whenever possible.  Telstra in Australia, for example, ordered 20 000 of their staff to work from home despite not  having detected a COVID-19 case within their organisation. Telefónica in Europe, Orange  Global and Liquid Telecom in Africa are just some of the organisations that took similar  measures. Verizon reported 100 000 of their employees working from home. In addition to  office jobs, people that worked in distributed call centres, helpdesks and even network  operations centres resorted to teleworking. VEON, for example, closed their offices in  Amsterdam, London and Luxembourg and provided work from home arrangements for call  centre services. Orange reported on the capacity to transfer and distribute its operational  customer support activities to one of its five major service centres around the world. Airtel  India activated remote network operations centres with only 2 % of its staff required on site.  2.2 SUPPORTING EMERGENCY SERVICES AND COMMUNICATIONS  At the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, many countries started using emergency  communications and public warning systems to inform the public about the pandemic,  movement restrictions, social distancing measures, contact information (about how to get  medical support) and accurate health information. Often this involved telecom providers, for  example, by broadcasting text messages (SMS) to citizens.  In the Netherlands, Greece, Romania, the United Arab Emirates, Azerbaijan and New  Zealand, for example, cell broadcast messages were used to alert the public on the specific  measures taken to fight the outbreak. Wireless emergency alerts were used to send city-wide  and state-wide messages regarding social distancing and shelter-in-place measures in the  United States, while the Canadian provinces used their Common Alert Protocol (CAP) - based  https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/telstra-tells-20-000-staff-to-work-from-home-for-rest-of-month-20200313-p549za.html https://www.telefonica.com/en/web/press-office/-/telefonica-announces-measures-related-to-covid-19 https://www.orange-business.com/en/case-study/working-home-key-part-industrial-groups-business-continuity https://www.orange-business.com/en/case-study/working-home-key-part-industrial-groups-business-continuity https://www.capacitymedia.com/articles/3825122/live-covid-19-coronavirus-news-how-the-telecoms-world-is-dealing-with-the-pandemic https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/19/verizon-ceo-web-traffic-up-20percent-in-one-week-amid-coronavirus-shutdown.html https://www.capacitymedia.com/articles/3825122/live-covid-19-coronavirus-news-how-the-telecoms-world-is-dealing-with-the-pandemic https://www.orange-business.com/fr/presse/orange-est-mobilise-pour-assurer-continuite-services-aupres-lensemble-clients-en-france https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=50296 https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=50296 https://eena.org/document/data-and-strategies-per-country-on-emergency-calls-public-warning-during-covid-19 https://www.tra.gov.ae/en/about-tra/tra-initiatives-in-response-to-covid-19.aspx https://www.tra.gov.ae/en/about-tra/tra-initiatives-in-response-to-covid-19.aspx https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12319899 https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12319899 https://www.radioworld.com/news-and-business/covid19-eas-best-practices https://eena.org/document/data-and-strategies-per-country-on-emergency-calls-public-warning-during-covid-19  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  8  broadcast immediate mobile alert system. France, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, Portugal,  Slovenia, Denmark, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Sudan sent nation-wide SMS messages to the  entire population. In Czechia, O2 disseminated SMS messages to roaming visitors in  agreement with the national health authorities. Nepal Telecom, Etisalat and Du in the United  Arab Emirates and Zain in Sudan and Iraq used ringtone messages to alert the public. Zain in  Sudan used automated message calls. Vodacom Democratic Republic of the Congo used an  SMS broadcast to notify the population. Ncell Nepal used outbound dialling, SMS messaging  and call tone messages to distribute government announcements.  Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic meant that emergency call centres came under  unprecedented strain. In some countries congestions of emergency call centres occurred.  In Italy, for example, the number of calls to 112 doubled within a day when the first positive  COVID-19 case was confirmed. In Croatia, the number of calls to 112 increased by  approximately 50 % in the first 3 weeks, as did the average call duration. Other helplines  experienced similar increases. The helpline of the Ministry of Health in Portugal, for example,  reached a historic record shortly after confirmation of the first two cases of COVID-19 in  Portugal. The non-emergency online service 111 in the United Kingdom saw a record number  of enquiries reaching as high as 210 000 in a single day. More than 15 000 calls to the 1135  line were reported within 24 hours in Greece following the outbreak, with the trend increasing  to reach 20 000 calls per day by the end of the first week. In the United States, the authorities  reported a temporary rise in the number of 911 calls in regions where shelter-in-place orders  were issued, as well as in COVID-19 hotspot areas, such as New York City, where the  number of reported 911 calls surpassed those recorded during the terrorist attack on the  World Trade Center on 11 September 2001. (source: European Emergency Number  Association –EENA)  The measures taken by telecommunications operators to ensure sufficient communications  capacities and coverage for emergency response were critical from the very beginning.  Telecommunications providers around the world took proactive measures in offering support  plans for other front-line professionals involved in the COVID-19 response activities, whose  effective and efficient operations depended on communications services.  Vodafone UK doubled the calling capacity for the NHS 111 telephone advice service to reach  a capacity of 2 400 simultaneous calls, after the volume of calls has surged by as much as  400 % compared to the pre-pandemic peak.  In Sri Lanka, Dialog Axiata partnered with Wavenet International and MyDoctor to launch a  free trilingual hotline offering information and advice and providing online access to doctors.  Operators in numerous other countries worldwide provided various forms of discounted or free  hotline services, portals and short codes, including Vodacom Mozambique and Lesotho, O2,  O2 Family, T-Mobile and Vodafone in Czechia , Liquid Telecom in Zimbabwe, Cosmote in  Greece, operators in Greenland and the United Kingdom’s Tesco and O2. Providers set up  zero-rated short code numbers for call centres in Azerbaijan. In the Dominican Republic, the  Dominican Telecommunications Institute and the Emergency Operations Center launched a  call centre dedicated to the pandemic.

FROM INITIAL STRAIN TO  THE NEW NORMAL  From the start of the pandemic, the normal service usage and network traffic changed  drastically. Telecom providers reported several changes in the usage of telecom services and in  traffic patterns.  INITIAL CHANGES IN USAGE AND TRAFFIC PATTERNS   An initial spike in traffic volumes as users attempted to be informed and connected  with family and friends.   Increased consumption of voice services along with a significant drop in the volume  of mobile handoffs.   Increased and persistent upstream traffic volumes as a result of increased use of  online collaboration tools for remote work and schooling.   Usage hotspots in business and commute areas relocated to residential and rural  areas.   A persistent and long-lasting burden on the network, measured in weeks and  months.  Figure 1 shows the number of COVID-19 infections and the network traffic on a single timeline.  This is an example of one EU country, but this timeline is representative of the traffic changes  experienced by other operators in Europe and the United States.  Figure 1: A schema of the volume of traffic on the telecommunications networks as the  pandemic evolved (Source: Fastly)  https://www.fastly.com/blog/how-covid-19-is-affecting-internet-performance  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  11  The figure shows that at the start of the pandemic, the networks experienced an initial strain,  primarily due to people connecting with families and friends, and trying to access information  about the pandemic. A number of consecutive spikes in traffic took place following major  announcements and new measures. The biggest spikes were seen following the declaration of  a nationwide lockdown, and following the closure of businesses and schools.  Following this initial period of changes and peaks, the volume of traffic continued to grow,  marking the new normal, where changed consumption habits are consolidating. In comparison  to other crises, during the current pandemic the traffic changes lasted for a long time and it is  expected that the pandemic will leave a permanent mark on network traffic patterns and the  consumption habits of citizens.  The rest of this section will focus on these three phases: the initial strain, the increased demand  under lockdown and the new normal.  3.1 THE INITIAL STRAIN  At the start of the pandemic there was a sudden and large increase in the overall  communications demands. Several providers experienced overloads and brief congestions.  For example, in some areas in Europe and the United States, the increase in mobile traffic  volume was similar to Christmas and New Year peak times, except they lasted longer.  According to Nokia, networks saw an increase of 20–40 % in the regions impacted by the  pandemic. In Europe, the biggest spikes were measured in Italy and Spain. A 70 % increase  in traffic was reported by Italian operators. Mobile networks in Italy experienced increases in  peak throughput by as much as 90 % and average mobile data usage by 50 %. Vodafone  Italy reported peak traffic throughputs reaching and even exceeding 90 %, while average  throughput increased by 80 %. According to Telecom Italia, the internet traffic on their fixed  network rose by 70 % following a lockdown, a large portion of which was attributed to gaming.  During the first week of quarantine, Spanish mobile networks experienced a 35 % increase in  throughput and fixed networks a 50 % increase. Telefónica’s Movistar, Orange, Vodafone,  Másmóvil and Euskaltel reported a 40 % increase in traffic on IP networks within just the first  few days and a 50 % increase in the use of mobile voice and 25 % in mobile data when  quarantine was enforced in certain regions of Spain. WhatsApp usage in Spain was said to  have increased fivefold in a matter of days.  Large strain and network disruptions were reported in several other European countries as  well, including, for example, Lithuania, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. For instance,  several operators in the United Kingdom, including Vodafone, O2, Three, Virgin, Tesco,  GiffGaff and EE, experienced issues on 17 March 2020 around 9 a.m., when social distancing  measures were enforced and millions of users were forced to work remotely. Voice services  on 2G, 3G and 4G networks were affected the most with anywhere between 3 % and 9 % of  calls not getting through, whereas mobile data, Wi-Fi and messaging services were not  affected.  In the United Kingdom, government announcements and the enforcement of social distancing  measures resulted in spikes and traffic pattern changes. Looking closer at reports from EE  and Virgin, two UK broadband providers, there were spikes in mobile data traffic following the  Prime Minister’s daily 5 p.m. briefings. Additionally, when quarantine measures were  announced at 8.30 p.m. on Monday 23 March 2020, data traffic on EE’s mobile network  increased by more than five times compared to just 1 hour before.  https://www.nokia.com/blog/early-effects-covid-19-lockdowns-service-provider-networks-networks-soldier/ https://news.itu.int/telecoms-coronavirus-and-keeping-the-networks-running-time-for-leadership/ https://owmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/Managing-your-network-in-the-coronavirus-crisis-v1.pdf https://owmobility.com/how-are-italian-and-spanish-mobile-operators-managing-the-coronavirus-crisis/ https://owmobility.com/how-are-italian-and-spanish-mobile-operators-managing-the-coronavirus-crisis/ https://blog.telegeography.com/internet-traffic-surges-as-covid-19-spreads https://www.telefonica.com/en/web/press-office/-/operators-advise-a-rational-and-responsible-use-of-telecommunication-networks-to-cope-with-traffic-increases https://www.telefonica.com/en/web/press-office/-/operators-advise-a-rational-and-responsible-use-of-telecommunication-networks-to-cope-with-traffic-increases https://blog.telegeography.com/internet-traffic-surges-as-covid-19-spreads https://news.itu.int/telecoms-coronavirus-and-keeping-the-networks-running-time-for-leadership/ https://www.capacitymedia.com/articles/3825121/uk-mobile-networks-go-into-meltdown-as-coronavirus-forces-home-working https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2020/03/covid-19-snapshot-of-internet-traffic-from-ee-and-virgin-media.html https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2020/03/covid-19-snapshot-of-internet-traffic-from-ee-and-virgin-media.html  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  12  Figure 2: EE’s network traffic volumes displaying volume spikes as a result of large number  of subscribers watching the 5 p.m. briefings (left), and a significant spike in network traffic on  18 March after social distancing measures were announced and when lockdown was  announced on 23 March (right) (Souce: EE)  Nokia’s statistics from the week of 9 March when several European countries declared a state  of emergency and implemented lockdown measures showed an increase in the overall traffic  on day 1 of the lockdown reaching anywhere between 30 % (5 p.m.) and 80 % (9 a.m.), with  boosts between 50 % and 70 % for most of the day. On the first Sunday of lockdown, traffic  rose even further, reaching increases of anywhere between 34 % and 97 % during the day.  Further analysis of Nokia’s traffic volumes per type of communications service on the first day  and the first Sunday of lockdown revealed spikes in the use of messaging, social media  services and streamed video (see Figure 3).  Figure 3: Total network traffic statistics from several western European networks for the first  day of lockdown (left) and the first Sunday following the declared lockdown (right) (Source:  Nokia)  The difference in network resilience across different countries was observed in Cloudflare’s  data in a comparison between the United Kingdom and Italy. The graphs show significant  increases in the TCP round trip time along with increased traffic volumes in Italy, whereas in  the United Kingdom despite the spikes in the traffic volume the TCP round trip time was not  affected as drastically (see Figure 4).  Figure 4: Increased internet traffic volumes (grey) did not have impact on the TCP round trip  timed (green) in the United Kingdom (left), whereas in Italy (right) both median and 95  percentile TCP round trip time increased along with the traffic volumes. This confirms that  networks in Italy were under more strain (Source: Cloudfare)  https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2020/03/covid-19-snapshot-of-internet-traffic-from-ee-and-virgin-media.html https://www.nokia.com/blog/early-effects-covid-19-lockdowns-service-provider-networks-networks-soldier/ https://www.nokia.com/blog/early-effects-covid-19-lockdowns-service-provider-networks-networks-soldier/ https://blog.cloudflare.com/recent-trends-in-internet-traffic/ https://blog.cloudflare.com/recent-trends-in-internet-traffic/  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  13  3.2 CHANGED DEMANDS UNDER LOCKDOWN  During the lockdown, the demand for communication services continued to grow and the usage  patterns changed. There were the three following major changes.   Shift of peak hours. According to Cloudflare, for instance, in addition to the normal  evening peak hour, two additional peak times occurred, one in the morning and  another in the afternoon. The same patterns were observed by Sandvine. According to  BT in the United Kingdom and AT&T in the United States, for example, daytime traffic  rose by 30 % to 50 %.   Changes in upload traffic volumes. Changes in service consumption and, in  particular, increased use of videoconferencing and online collaboration tools, led to a  considerable increase in upload traffic volumes.   Shift of hotspot locations. There was a visible shift of service consumption  hotspots, causing unexpected strains, in particular in residential broadband access  networks. The volume of traffic dropped significantly in city centres, business districts  and industrial centres (including, for example, airports, major metro stations and  tourist attractions).  Sandvine saw an almost 40 % growth of internet traffic across different types of consumer  networks between February and mid April. Sandvine reported increased demands on both the  fixed and wireless networks, whereas the biggest volume increase was seen on Tier 1 fixed  broadband networks (cable, DSL, FTTx).  According to data provided by Fastly, over the roughly 1-month period from the end of  February to the end of March, traffic increased in Italy by 109.3 % (more than doubling). The  increase was 78.6 % in the United States, 39.4 % in Spain, 38.4 % in France and 31.5 % in  Japan Kingdom. These increases in traffic volume coincided with decreases in download  speeds (35.4 % in Italy, 30.3 % in the United Kingdom, 13.9 % in France and 8 % in Spain). In  Japan and California on the other hand, average download speeds actually increased, by  9.7 % and 1.2 %, respectively.  Figure 5: Increased internet traffic volumes in selected European countries and US states  that were significantly hit by the pandemic, and the corresponding download speed  deteriorations (Source: Fastly)  https://blog.cloudflare.com/on-the-shoulders-of-giants-recent-changes-in-internet-traffic/ https://www.sandvine.com/hubfs/Sandvine_Redesign_2019/Downloads/2020/Phenomena/COVID%20Internet%20Phenomena%20Report%2020200507.pdf https://www.sandvine.com/hubfs/Sandvine_Redesign_2019/Downloads/2020/Phenomena/COVID%20Internet%20Phenomena%20Report%2020200507.pdf https://www.fastly.com/blog/how-covid-19-is-affecting-internet-performance https://www.fastly.com/blog/how-covid-19-is-affecting-internet-performance  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  14  A statistical analysis of average download speed data for individual countries was prepared  by the Phoenix Center, based on data provided by Ookla for fixed and mobile connections  covering 116 countries between 16 December 2019 and 11 May 11 2020. It showed that for  fixed connections, 54 out of 108 countries experienced speed degradations, and 33 % of  these were statistically significant with levels of 10 % or higher. The average speed reduction  was estimated at 9.2 %, while the average speed increase was estimated at 6.6 %, indicating  considerable differences between countries. Most of the countries that experienced  degradations of 5 % or more have relatively low per-capita gross domestic product, but there  were exceptions, for example, France, Italy and Japan. For mobile broadband, 77 countries  experienced degradations, with 66 of those experiencing statistically significant drops. In  general, data showed that mobile networks suffered more than fixed networks, with an  average speed reduction of 9.9 % and an average speed increase of 8.9 %, which points at a  more symmetrical difference.  According to the Europe, Middle East and Africa Satellite Operators Association, since the  start of the pandemic satellite operators providing broadband connectivity directly to  consumers have experienced a 15–70 % increase in data traffic across Europe and America  (depending on the country) and an increase in subscriptions in Brazil, Mexico and the United  States Satellite networks primarily served broadband consumers, while remote enterprise  connectivity was mostly idle due to the pandemic. Application proportions in the total volume  of traffic were similar to those seen on fixed broadband networks, with two exceptions, a huge  portion of WhatsApp traffic accounting for 12.78 % of the entire volume and much lower  percentages of gaming traffic compared to typical fixed broadband lines.  3.2.1 Impact on the internet backbone  Network backbones and the internet core demonstrated sufficient capacities to cope with the  impacts a pandemic causes with respect to increased service usage, spikes in traffic volumes  and changes in traffic patterns. Internet exchanges saw huge increases in the volume of traffic  passing through their networks. In general, a change in volume took place in all world regions,  spanning anywhere between 10 % and 40 % depending on the situation and the state of  government action.  The Deutsche Commercial Internet Exchange (DE-CIX) in Frankfurt, Germany, reported a  world record of 9.1 Terabits/s data throughput in March 2020 following an increase of 12 %  since December 2019. The reported volume corresponds to as much as two million  simultaneous HD video transmissions. A similar spike in internet traffic was also reported by  the Amsterdam Internet Exchange, who hit the 8 Tbps barrier on 30 March 2020 and reported  a 17 % growth of overall daily traffic volume. Record volumes were also reported by NAPAfrica  with evening peaks at its Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town exchanges exceeding  1.1 Tbps on 25 March 2020 (see Figure 6).  https://www.phoenix-center.org/PolicyBulletin/PCPB49Final.pdf https://www.esoa.net/press-room/keeping-people-connected-informed-and-protected https://www.sandvine.com/hubfs/Sandvine_Redesign_2019/Downloads/2020/Phenomena/COVID%20Internet%20Phenomena%20Report%2020200507.pdf https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/coronavirus-break-internet-experts/story?id=69675556 https://mybroadband.co.za/news/internet/344937-how-much-internet-traffic-in-south-africa-has-increased-due-to-the-coronavirus.html  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  15  Figure 6: Increased traffic volumes were observed at internet exchanges around the world  Hong Kong’s Internet Exchange (Source: HK IX) Milan IX (Source: MIX)  Aggregated Brazilian internet exchanges (Source: IX  Brazil)  Greek IXP (Source: GR IX)  China IX (Source: CHN IX) DE-CIX Hamburg, Germany (Source: DE CIX)  3.2.2 Increased usage of mobile and fixed voice services  Along with an increase in internet traffic, the use of more traditional communication services like  voice telephony also increased.  In France, for example, Orange reported a 100 % increase in voice calls. According to  Vodafone, voice traffic in some countries rose by 40–50 % and even up to 100 %. Vodafone  UK, for example, experienced a 25 % increase in fixed telephony traffic and a 42 % mobile  voice traffic increase. In Spain, the demands for voice services rose by 25 % within the first  weeks of confinement according to Telefónica.  Increased use of voice services was also reported in the United States, in particular with Wi-Fi  calling, which in some areas saw an increase of 100 %. Operators AT&T, Verizon and Sprint  all experienced spikes in voice calls when restrictions were initially imposed at the end of  March 2020. According to AT&T, voice calls on Sunday 22 March increased by 44 %  compared with a typical Sunday, while Wi-Fi calling increased by 88 %.

Similarly, Sprint reported a 20 % increase in calls and a 25 % increase in  messaging. Mobile handoffs, on the other hand, dropped by as much as 29 % nationwide with  users staying home under quarantine. Even sharper decreases were observed in commuter  hotspot areas, such as the New York Metro (– 53 %) and Upstate New York (– 49 %).  A surge in the use of voice calls was also reported in India, with estimates reaching as high as  a 15–20 % increase in calls made through mobile phones in the initial days following the  implementation of the quarantine. Later on, the frequency of calls decreased due to large  commuter populations staying at home, but the average call duration times increased, by as  much as 30 % (1).  3.2.3 Impact on broadband traffic  Fixed consumer broadband networks experienced the biggest increases in traffic during the  pandemic (see for example the report by Sandvine). This was caused by traffic shifting from  enterprise, education and public Wi-Fi networks to residential fixed broadband networks. In  addition, Nokia reported that aggregation networks and service edge routers experienced the  biggest strain. According to Ookla, the largest performance degradation was detected in dense  residential areas where the networks are not built for such large volumes of traffic and the  network performance is optimised for evening peak hours. As a result, the available capacities  and network coverage did not suffice during specific periods of the pandemic, in particular  when quarantine measures took effect and people worked and attended school from home.  In Europe, Vodafone UK experienced broadband traffic growth of 15 % within the first 2 weeks  of quarantine alone, and reported a 30 % increase in internet traffic across its fixed and mobile  networks. On fixed broadband networks, the United Kingdom’s BT reported a 100 % increase  in daytime traffic, while volumes on the mobile part of the network decreased slightly compared  to pre-pandemic levels as a result of people staying at home and resorting to Wi-Fi instead.  Fixed broadband use in Italy and Spain increased by more than 50 %. In Spain, Vodafone  reported an increase in bandwidth demand of almost 40 % and in mobile data traffic growth of  50 %. They detected an increase in mobile broadband demand of almost 20 % and in fixed  broadband of 35 % during peak evening hours in Italy and Spain. Telefónica saw a 35 %  overall data increase across its networks in Spain, with 26 % increases in the fixed network  and 48 % in the mobile network. Considerable increases in the volume were also reported by  Telia operating in Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden with a  more than 50 % overall traffic increase, mostly visible during off-peak hours and with major  regional differences, whereas peak traffic levels were up by approximately 35 % as of  29 March 2020.  In the United States, operators reported a rise in network usage of 20–35 % for fixed networks  and of 10–20 % for mobile networks in the first weeks following the declared state of  emergency. The demands increased in particular in suburban, exurban and residential areas  as a result of remote work and schooling. Similar trends were observed on the American cable  networks as reported by NCTA’s Altice, CableOne, Charter, Comcast, Cox, GCI, Mediacom,  Midco and Sjoberg’s, reporting a 14 % increase in national downstream peak growth and a  32 % increase in national upstream peak growth since 1 March 2020.  (1) Nepali Telecom, on the other hand, reported a decline in voice business of approximately 25 % due to most  business coming to a halt and most people using social media to communicate. Mobile voice usage with China  Telecom also saw a decrease of almost 19 % in Q1 2020 compared to Q4 2019, with wireline voice usage  decreasing by 25 %.  https://www.lightreading.com/4g-3g-wifi/us-wireless-networks-are-holding-up-to-covid-19/d/d-id/758446 https://www.telecompetitor.com/verizon-covid-19-network-traffic-trends-highlight-stay-at-home-impact-as-mobile-handoffs-are-down-29/ https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/india-witnesses-a-surge-in-voice-calls-during-lockdown/articleshow/75133756.cms https://www.sandvine.com/hubfs/Sandvine_Redesign_2019/Downloads/2020/Phenomena/COVID%20Internet%20Phenomena%20Report%2020200507.pdf https://www.nokia.com/blog/early-effects-covid-19-lockdowns-service-provider-networks-networks-soldier/ https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/coronavirus-break-internet-experts/story?id=69675556 https://newscentre.vodafone.co.uk/viewpoint/vodafone-networks-up-to-the-task-says-scott-petty/ https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/press-release/covid-19-network-traffic-surge-isnt-impacting-environment-confirm-telecom-operators/ https://www.lightwaveonline.com/network-design/high-speed-networks/article/14173544/service-providers-offer-new-updates-on-covid19-coronavirus-network-effects https://www.telefonica.com/ext/westayconnected/ https://blog.teliacarrier.com/2020/04/01/covid-19-network-trends-and-modelling/ https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-363493A1.pdf https://www.ncta.com/COVIDdashboard https://www.nepalitelecom.com/2020/05/nepal-telecom-role-covid19-pandemic-impact-challenges-opportunities.html https://www.chinatelecom-h.com/en/regulatory/announcements/a200423.pdf https://www.chinatelecom-h.com/en/regulatory/announcements/a200423.pdf  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  17  In South-East Asia, peak traffic increases reached 38 % by the end of March and average  throughput increased by 12 %. Nepali Telekom, for example, saw a 40 % increase in data  usage compared to the pre-lockdown period, mainly accounted to YouTube, social media and  online learning apps. Due to limited resources, data caps were not removed and the internet  usage experience deteriorated due to high spikes in communication demands. Zain reported a  20–50 % increase in high-speed broadband data traffic across various markets since March  2020. Similarly, an increase of 25 % in data traffic volumes was reported in India between early  February and late March. In Malaysia, Telecom Malaysia reported a 30 % increase in usage  trending, and of this, the increase of international link traffic was 5 %. China Telecom saw a  37.4 % increase in mobile handset data traffic on 3G, 4G and 5G networks in Q1 2020  compared to the same period last year and reported continued and rapid growth. They  reported an increase in average daily network traffic in April 2020 on 4G of 17.78 % and on  broadband network of 22.61 %, with video and image processing the two primary driving  forces.  The situation was similar in Africa. Vodafone, for instance, reported traffic increases in some  African countries similar to those in Europe, with increases ranging between 25 % and 50 %.  South America saw an average growth of traffic volume of 25–30 %. Vodacom Group for  instance reported a 40 % increase in data traffic during the lockdown period. The data increase  was said to have been driven by paid traffic for businesses resorting to remote work and an  increase in the use of streaming services. An increase in free traffic for education, government  and health portals was also reported. South Africa’s Seacom, operating major undersea fibre  cables, also saw a 15 % increase in internet traffic across its network.

AT&T, for example, reported a 27 % drop in mobile handoffs in March versus a typical  week. In New York City, T-Mobile saw an 86 % increase in subscribers with limited  mobility, meaning they connect to cell sites in their primary location only, and similar  volumes in the San Francisco Bay Area with a 77 % increase in limited subscriber mobility.  Another effect of people staying at home and all travel being banned was a significant drop in  the volume of traffic seen on GPRS roaming exchange (GRX) networks (see Figure 8).  Figure 8: Decreased traffic volumes on the Amsterdam GRX from March 2020 (Source: AMS IXP)  This is also confirmed by reports from roaming operators, such as Vivo Brazil and Syniverse,  who experienced significant drops in traffic as a result of global travel restrictions.  Nepali Telecom also reported a considerable decline in international long distance traffic, by  as much as 20 %, which was attributed to the impeding recession and people experiencing a  shortage of available resources to be spent on communications services. A similar  phenomenon was reported by China Telecom. However, according to i3Forum, while there  was a 30 % drop in international traffic overall, international voice traffic increased by 20 %  year-on-year in March 2020, and the duration of calls increased by 30 % in March 2020 and  by more than 60 % in April 2020 compared to 2019.  Network backbones and the internet core demonstrated sufficient capacities to cope  with the consequences of the pandemic with respect to increased service usage, spikes in  traffic volumes and changes in traffic patterns. Internet exchanges saw huge increases in the  volume of traffic passing through their networks. In general, changes in volume took place in  all world regions, spanning anywhere between 10 % and 40 % depending on the situation and  the state of government action.  https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/at-t-wi-fi-calling-up-76 https://www.fiercewireless.com/operators/t-mobile-tracks-dramatic-spike-messaging-launches-low-cost-phone-plan https://stats.ams-ix.net/grx.html https://owmobility.com/how-are-italian-and-spanish-mobile-operators-managing-the-coronavirus-crisis/ https://www.nepalitelecom.com/2020/03/internet-usage-increases-corona-speed-slow.html https://www.nepalitelecom.com/2020/05/nepal-telecom-role-covid19-pandemic-impact-challenges-opportunities.html https://2ja3zj1n4vsz2sq9zh82y3wi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/COVID-19-Chinas-digital-health-strategies-against-the-global-pandemic_Yuan-Zhang.pdf https://telecoms.com/504682/international-voice-traffic-spikes-20-during-covid-19/ https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/coronavirus-break-internet-experts/story?id=69675556  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  19  3.3 NEW NORMAL  The strain on the networks started to decrease once the pandemic situation stabilised and  countries around the world progressed with relaxing the social distancing measures. Providers  have indicated that even after lockdown restrictions were lifted, a number of traffic pattern  changes have remained.  Since the implementation of Phase 0 of deconfinement in Spain, for example, Telefónica  reported a 13 % drop in fixed data traffic in certain timeslots as people over 14 years of age  are allowed to leave home in the mornings and in the evenings. There was also a drop in  mobile data traffic, although to a lesser extent, with a 6 % decline compared to a week  earlier at the highest daily peak in the evenings. In addition, there was a 9 % decrease in the  evening peak time of voice traffic usage compared to a week earlier.  In the United States, Comcast data also showed that the traffic volumes eventually  plateaued. The new volumes and patterns persisted, however, driven primarily by remote  work. VoIP and video conferencing continued to dominate weekday usage at 210–285 %,  and VPN traffic was up by 30–40 %. Since 1 March the upload traffic increased by 32 % and  downstream by 11 %, and downstream peak hours shifted from 9 p.m. to between 7 p.m.  and 8 p.m., while upload peak traffic times shifted from 9 p.m. to daytime hours between  8 a.m. and 6 p.m. On wireless, a 17 % decline in LTE data usage was reported and a 36 %  increase in mobile data usage over Wi-Fi. Weekend usage was driven by entertainment,  streaming and gaming services with peak hours continuing in the evenings. Gaming  downloads were up by anywhere between 20 % and 80 %, depending on new releases. The  stabilisation of the increased volume trends was also reported by US Telecom. A 10.4 %  mean traffic increase was reported in the second week of June 2020 compared to the record  peak increase of 27 % reported earlier on 16 April 2020. (see Figure 9).  Figure 9: Comcast traffic volume growth trends between March and May 2020  https://www.telefonica.com/ext/westayconnected/ https://corporate.comcast.com/covid-19/network https://www.ustelecom.org/research/network-performance-data/ https://corporate.comcast.com/covid-19/network  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  20  3.4 NETWORK MANAGEMENT AND MAINTENANCE DURING A  PANDEMIC  In response to changed usage behaviour and increased traffic, telecommunications operators  took different measures. In addition to monitoring their networks 24/7, many network  management interventions took place to cope with the increased loads, such as:   changing network configurations;   deploying new technologies;   securing additional spectrum, where needed, or sharing spectrum with peers;   engaging emergency deployments, including using new technologies, such as 5G.  3.4.1 Management of network capacity and performance  To deal with the increased traffic peaks and pattern changes, telecom providers responded in a  variety of different ways, depending on the situation. Measures included increasing capacity,  implementing call gaping, codec reconfigurations to reduce voice quality, time limits, direct retry,  dynamic quality and data consumption balancing, and configuration of traffic prioritisation, in  particular to support emergency communications and essential services.  In Europe, Ekinops in the Paris area in France, for example, increased the bandwidth of its  single fibre network to assist a local telecom provider CM’IN, in keeping the city of Chartres  online. Orange France reported having reconfigured network parameters in response to  mobile voice traffic doubling in volume. Telecom Italia reported on conducting a series of  network improvements, which led to an increase in bandwidth of up to 37 % on selected  routes compared to the pre-pandemic situation. It activated 5 000 new cabinets to offer high-  capacity broadband connectivity for the so-called white areas, which are not subject to public  tenders for broadband infrastructure, and set up a dedicated control room for monitoring  network traffic. Telenor increased the capacities of 300 base stations. Comcast reported that  they performed more than 700 000 diagnostic speed tests each day.  Operators in Iran took measures to expand the capacity and data rates of their networks,  including increasing the speed of fixed internet services, capacity enhancements of country-  wide backbone network and gateways as well as the expansion of capacity of high-speed links  to fixed and mobile network operators.  In China, 5G was deployed specifically for fixed wireless applications to deliver connectivity.  The Chinese telecommunications industry reportedly installed more than 63 000 new 4G and  5G base stations between late January and the end of March 2020. Subisu Cablenet in Nepal  increased local cache for YouTube and Facebook to manage internet bandwidth shortage. In  India, a Tier 1 operator implemented a mechanism to feed the core network back with radio  congestion indicators in order to monitor congestions and implement real-time balancing of  video traffic quality and data consumption in an attempt to deliver a consistent Quality of  Experience (QoE) for subscribers without impacting essential services on the frontline of the  pandemic.  Liquid Telecom, operating in Africa, enhanced connectivity capacities across its east Africa  backbone by deploying Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) across a closed wide area  network to enable video conferencing services and the use of digital tools for the members of  the parliament and East African Community ministries and businesses resorting to remote  work. It upgraded major fibre network links in Kenya for improved bandwidth performances  available to their enterprise and wholesale customers. Vodacome South Africa was said to  have increased its network capacity with an investment worth USD 26.7 million. Australian  NBN opened up network capacity free of charge to allow for up to 40 % more bandwidth  https://www.capacitymedia.com/articles/3825351/live-covid-19-coronavirus-news-how-the-telecoms-world-is-dealing-with-the-pandemic https://www.orange.com/en/Press-Room/press-releases/press-releases-2020/Orange-is-mobilised-to-ensure-continuity-of-service-for-all-customers-in-France-and-around-the-world https://www.telecomitalia.com/it/sostenibilita/dialogo-azioni/news/covid-impegno-tim.html https://www.telenor.no/privat/artikler/telenor-og-korona/tiltak/ https://corporate.comcast.com/covid-19/network https://www.cra.ir/Portal/View/Page.aspx?PageId=aad0ae9a-9c85-4c53-a6de-9aa909303648&ObjectId=6288a96a-29c7-4f50-95da-67f5f6d9e103&WebpartId=4986a228-f6b9-4a54-8b08-e62c6f09bd56 https://www.gsma.com/greater-china/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Mobile-Industry-Response-to-COVID19-China-en.pdf https://www.nepalitelecom.com/2020/04/challenges-ISP-home-internet.html https://owmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/Managing-your-network-in-the-coronavirus-crisis-v1.pdf https://africabusinesscommunities.com/tech/tech-news/liquid-telecoms-east-africa-connectivity-backbone-deepens-eac-integration/ https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/vodacom-sa-hikes-capacity-to-match-covid-19-demand/ https://minister.infrastructure.gov.au/fletcher/media-release/nbn-boosts-capacity-australians-working-home  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  21  across all technologies, including fixed wireless and satellite services, to improve network  performance.  Some national authorities and European bodies issued guidance to providers about traffic  management, i.e. about what measures operators are allowed to take to deal with network  traffic changes and to avoid congestion. Following are two examples:   The Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) issued,  together with the Commission, a joint statement on coping with the increased demand  for network connectivity due to the COVID-19 pandemic.   The German Federal Network Agency, issued guidance for operators on acceptable  traffic management measures in the event of network overload during the COVID-19  pandemic.  3.4.2 Management of spectrum resources  In addition to technical reconfigurations within the network, increasing spectrum resources to  overcome network capacity and coverage issues was another strategy used during the  COVID-19 pandemic. This included applying for licenses for unallocated spectrum bands as  well as for shared spectrum use in agreement with license owners, securing licenses for the  deployment of new technologies, such as 5G, to support ad hoc augmentation, and applying  for access to backhaul spectrum where needed. Actions included cooperation with the national  regulatory authorities (NRAs) and other operators to gain regulatory approvals, followed by  spectrum relocation, reconfiguration of existing and placement of additional network  equipment, including COW/COLT, RDUs, permanent large-radio-zone BTS, VSAT, high-  performance antennas, etc.  During COVID-19, fast and flexible changes to regulations proved essential. Formal procedures  were expedited to enable fast awarding of licenses and management of license fees under  emergency conditions.  Cooperation and regulatory initiatives are further analysed in Section 4.  3.4.3 Network maintenance  At the start of the crisis, providers delayed all non-essential investments and non-essential  maintenance operations. Over the course of the next weeks and months, however,  maintenance operations restarted. In order to help operators maintain the essential  communications services operational, the telecommunications services were declared as  essential so that operators could be granted travel and access permissions during lockdown.  In many countries, network maintenance operations had to be adapted to limit the exposure of  essential workers. For example, providers used remote and unmanned monitoring, remote  surveillance of the infrastructure and online diagnostics, remote (online) access to networking  equipment and even drones. Redundant teams of essential technicians and non-overlapping  work shifts were organised to limit risk exposure. Contacts with suppliers and subcontractors  were limited. Following are some specific examples.  Deutsche Telekom reported that regular network maintenance and upgrades continued.  Within 2 weeks of April alone, they reported to have carried out around 9 000 interference  elimination in the fixed network and connected 20 000 households to Fiber to the Home  (FTTH). In addition, they provided 100 000 households with vectoring or super vectoring  delivering speeds of up to 250 Mbps. 1 700 technical field interventions were reported  servicing or troubleshooting mobile rad+io systems. Within a week, they also reported to  https://berec.europa.eu/eng/document_register/subject_matter/berec/download/0/9236-joint-statement-from-the-commission-and-_0.pdf https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/Areas/Telecommunications/Companies/TelecomRegulation/NetNeutrality/Corona/Guidelines%20on%20traffic%20management%20measures.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=1 https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/blog/keeping-everyone-and-everything-connected-how-temporary-access-to-spectrum-can-ease-congestion-during-the-covid-19-crisis/ https://www.telekom.com/de/blog/netz/artikel/mobilfunk-sonderversorgung-krankenhaus-harlaching-598646  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  22  have integrated 180 new LTE stations into the network. The state of pandemic had not  considerably negatively impacted maintenance of and investments in their network, and in  some cases even worked in their interest, for example the closure of schools in Germany  allowed them to proceed with installing fiber optics in schools.  As part of its business continuity plan, Orange defined a list of priority activities, including  network supervision, essential maintenance operations, technical support and commercial  assistance. They reported 130 additional customer operations per day managed by their  field teams to increase the speed of their internet connections or at their data centres.  From late January 2020 until 25 March 2020, the telecommunications industry in China  mobilised a total number of dispatches for 375 000 communications support personnel and  174 000 communications support vehicles.  Another considerable challenge was the mitigation of delays in shipping essential supplies. A  plan is typically available with operators as part of capacity planning to make sure essential  equipment is on stock. Whereas transportation itself was not such an issue as with other types  of emergencies that cause extensive physical damage and trouble with accessing the affected  sites (e.g., a hurricane or a destructive earthquake catastrophe), logistics delays took place  during the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of measures taken to limit or even fully stop  movements of people and goods across borders in an attempt to limit the spread. Increased  border controls and border crossings, ports and airports closing down were paralysing to  logistics and transportation, and the countries and operators that depend on imports from other  countries were affected more.  According to information provided by Nepal Telecom, for example, increases in internet  bandwidth were not possible because of Nepal’s dependence on capacities supplied from  India, where there was also a shortage, as well as due to expected delays in shipping of the  required equipment.  Equipment manufacturing factories closing down, in particular in China, was an additional factor  in delays with availability of essential equipment.  South Korean vendor LG Electronics, for example, reported on the effects of the pandemic  that caused disruption to its supply chain, which was cited as a factor in the 34 % annual  decline in revenue from its mobile business. The smartphone industry sustained an  unprecedented decline as a result of the production and supply issues resulting from  COVID-19, with worldwide smartphone shipments dropping by 11.7 % year over year in just  Q1 of 2020. China sustained the largest regional impact, which caused worldwide  implications because of global dependency on China’s smartphone supply chain. The 5G  industry was also impacted, with 5G deployments in Europe and the Middle East expected  to experience delays in 2020 because of supply chain constraints, particularly if involving  the Chinese vendors Huawei and ZTE.  Overall, it seems that despite the pandemic, most of the network maintenance and updates  continued without much delay. A report from RIPE Labs, based on an analysis of BGP data,  which analyses reconfiguration activities (IP prefix announcements, withdrawals, changes in  origin), found no visible decreases in the volume of changes on networks in March 2020  compared to earlier months.  https://www.telekom.com/de/blog/netz/artikel/netzausbau-corona-virus-598072 https://www.orange-business.com/fr/presse/orange-est-mobilise-pour-assurer-continuite-services-aupres-lensemble-clients-en-france https://www.gsma.com/greater-china/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Mobile-Industry-Response-to-COVID19-China-en.pdf https://www.nepalitelecom.com/2020/03/internet-usage-increases-corona-speed-slow.html https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/lg-mobile-division-woes-deepen/ https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS46264320 https://data.gsmaintelligence.com/api-web/v2/research-file-download?id=51249608&file=030420-Covid-mobile-networks.pdf https://data.gsmaintelligence.com/api-web/v2/research-file-download?id=51249608&file=030420-Covid-mobile-networks.pdf https://labs.ripe.net/Members/emileaben/internet-stability-in-times-of-corona  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  23  3.4.4 Network investments and 5G  Triggered by the pandemic, governments around the world took steps to encourage  investments in the telecommunications networks and services, in particular in 5G.  The Chinese government, for instance, urged mobile operators to ramp up 5G investment.  The Chilean regulator updated antenna regulations to drive 5G infrastructure deployment  by reducing permit approval times. The motivation was in several cases clear also with  telecommunications operators themselves. In the United States for example, the interest  to invest in 5G fixed-wireless access solutions increased in response to increased  demands because of work and schooling from home. The operators Verizon, T-Mobile US  and US Cellular confirmed to continue with their 5G deployment plans, whereas AT&T,  Verizon and T-Mobile were clearly said to have interests in expanding their business in to  5G FWA. However, with the length and depth of the recession yet to be seen and  understood, the long-term network investment outlook has remained uncertain.  3.4.5 Adapting customer care services  Numerous operators around the world responded in support of their subscribers’ increased  communications demands by releasing data caps and offering discounted or even free  allowances, which further stimulated increases in the overall use of communications services.  Taking a closer look at the ways operators supported their subscribers, numerous initiatives  and calls for action were issued on the international and the national levels. Operators around  the world proceeded with measures such as increasing or removing data caps, offering free  unlimited internet service and access to entertainment and educational contents, flexible  payment options and the temporary suspension of long-distance and international roaming  fees for their subscribers.  In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) launched a Keep  Americans Connected initiative in response to the need to protect the most vulnerable  consumers, which was pledged by more than 700 companies and associations, including  AT&T, T-Mobile, Comcast, Verizon and CenturyLink. In Europe, a similar initiative was  launched by Telecommunications Industry Ireland, with BT Ireland, EIR, Pure Telecom,  Sky Ireland, Tesco Mobile Ireland, Three Ireland, Virgin Media Ireland and Vodafone, and  by the British regulator Ofcom in the United Kingdom with O2 UK, Vodafone UK, 3UK,  BT/EE, Openreach, Virgin Media, Sky, TalkTalk, Hyperoptic, Gigaclear and KCOM.  Another such initiative was launched by the Comisión Nacional de Telecomunicaciones  and telecommunications operators in Honduras. Operators in other countries followed suit,  for example Vodafone Hungary, Spanish Telefónica, Post Luxembourg, Belgian Proximus,  Orange in France, Ukranian Intertelecom, Beeline in Armenia, Kygyzstan and Georgia,  Unite and Moldtelecom networks in Moldova. Zain Kuwait, Zain Saudi Arabia, VNPT  Group, Viettel and MobiFone in Vietnam, Nepal Telecom, Airtel in India, Guatemalan Tigo,  Cuban Telecommunications Enterprise, Chilean Claro, Entel, GTD, Movistar and VTR,  and Liquid Telecom and Orange Mali in Africa.  Support measures were also launched by backbone and satellite providers; TOMIA, for  instance, an inter-carrier connectivity provider in the United States, offered a number of  free roaming services to their existing customers, and NBN in Australia provided a  temporary boost to data allowances for Sky Muster satellite customers to support those in  remote areas.  Services to reach government and healthcare websites and hotlines were zero-rated,  including for example with Tesco, O2, EE and Vodafone in the United Kingdom, and with  https://data.gsmaintelligence.com/api-web/v2/research-file-download?id=51249608&file=030420-Covid-mobile-networks.pdf https://www.mobileworldlive.com/blog/intelligence-brief-how-are-regulators-responding-to-covid-19/ https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/us-operators-press-on-with-5g-work/ https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/us-operators-press-on-with-5g-work/ https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/home-banner/bt-head-runs-business-remotely-after-virus-infection/ https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/home-banner/bt-head-runs-business-remotely-after-virus-infection/ https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/att-verizon-hungrily-eye-fixed-5g-progress/ https://www.fcc.gov/keep-americans-connected https://www.fcc.gov/keep-americans-connected https://www.comreg.ie/consumer-information/covid-19-information/consumer-commitments/ https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-agrees-measures-with-telecoms-companies-to-support-vulnerable-consumers-through-covid-19 http://www.conatel.gob.hn/index.php/2020/04/08/conatel-y-operadores-de-telecomunicaciones-garantizan-en-consenso-la-continuidad-de-los-servicios-para-todos-los-hondurenos/ https://www.vodafone.com/covid19/videos/vodafone-hungary https://www.telefonica.com/es/web/sala-de-prensa/-/telefonica-ante-el-coronavirus https://www.post.lu/particuliers/informations-covid-19 https://www.proximus.be/en/id_b_cr_proximus_helps/personal/blog/news/be-the-first-to-know/proximus-helps.html https://www.orange-business.com/fr/presse/dans-contexte-crise-liee-pandemie-covid-19-orange-accompagne-clients-pros-et-entreprises-0 https://www.intertelecom.ua/view/news/stayathome https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=53935 https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=53936 ttps://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=53934 http://unite.md/ro/personal/news/239 https://www.zain.com/en/covid19/kuwait/ https://www.zain.com/en/covid19/saudiarabia/ https://english.mic.gov.vn/Pages/TinTuc/141062/Telecom-companies-speed-up-internet--discount-services-amid-COVID-19.html https://english.mic.gov.vn/Pages/TinTuc/141062/Telecom-companies-speed-up-internet--discount-services-amid-COVID-19.html https://www.nepalitelecom.com/2020/05/nepal-telecom-role-covid19-pandemic-impact-challenges-opportunities.html https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=50294 https://ayuda.tigo.com.gt/hc/es/articles/360045620733-Medidas-sustitutivas-por-COVID-19-a-usuarios-Postpago-M%C3%B3vil%E2%80%8B https://twitter.com/ETECSA_Cuba/status/1245385347929948161?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1245385347929948161&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Foncubanews.com%2Fen%2Fcuba%2Fetecsa-lowers-rates-and-extends-validity-of-services%2F https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=51418 https://www.liquidtelecom.com/about-us/news/Liquid%20Telecom%20keeps%20home%20fibre%20users%20connected%20with%20unlimited%20high%20capacity%20broadband%20at%20zero%20extra%20cost https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=53952 https://www.channelmiddleeast.com/business-strategy/90892-tomia-offers-roaming-services-free-of-charge-to-network-operators https://www.communications.gov.au/telecommunications-sector https://www.tescomobile.com/coronavirus https://www.o2.co.uk/business/why-o2/our-approach/covid-19 https://ee.co.uk/business/small/help/contact-us/coronavirus/ https://newscentre.vodafone.co.uk/press-release/mobile-customers-free-access-to-nhs-online-services/  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  24  Airtel Nigeria in Africa. Consular services were free with many operators as well, for  example Megafon, Beeline and Tele2 provided free calls for roaming hotline numbers to  help Russian citizens abroad through teleconsultations, and A1 Belarus provided their  subscribers with free calls to the ‘hotlines’ of Belarusian diplomatic missions.  The way customer care services were organised also needed to be adapted, in an attempt to  limit personal contacts to prevent the disease from spreading further and to ensure the safety  of both the employees and the customers, as well as to cope with the increased volumes of  customer care inquiries as a result of increased usage demands.  3.4.6 In-store services move online  Following the implementation of social distancing measures, physical shops adapted in  various ways, including shorter working hours, specific protocols within stores of how  customers were served and segregating vulnerable customer groups (e.g. the elderly,  pregnant women), and in numerous countries even the complete closure of stores for the  period when the pandemic was at its worst. These limitations led operators to encourage or  set up new customer care services through other channels, in particular in the form of online  portals, virtual assistants, virtual rooms, etc.  Most operators in Europe closed their shops following the outbreak of COVID-19. French  Orange encouraged customers to make use of customer assistance, subscription  management services and purchases through their websites, mobile apps and chat  services. They scaled up customer relations resources accordingly, including contact  numbers, voice guides, chatbots, call centres and multichannel messaging services. Their  customer operations were managing an additional 130 inquires per day in response to  increased demands for upgrading internet connection speeds and data centre support.  Nearly 3 500 additional business services employees were mobilised to manage critical  customer care activities. They also reported on their capacity to transfer and distribute  their operational customer support activities to one of their five major service centres  around the world if required.  In Sweden, Telenor offered its customers the possibility to book a digital meeting remotely  to get help from the store in place of an in-person visit. Deutsche Telekom closed  approximately 500 stores in mid March in Germany as well as all stores in the Netherlands  and 80 % of shops in the United States. They integrated a voice bot into the voice portal to  automatically answer selected inquiries using artificial intelligence. Belgian Proximus  encouraged its subscribers to make an appointment in their physical stores or use video  chat instead. Vodafone UK, after closing their stores, encouraged its customers to use  their mobile application, website resources, helpline and self-help guides instead, as well  as a newly set up chatbot. O2 in the United Kingdom used a virtual queue system to  manage in-person visits to their stores.  In the United States, Sprint closed 71 % of its stores nationwide and AT&T 40 %, and both  operators adopted reduced operating hours for those that remained open. Shaw in  Canada closed all its stores and encouraged the use of other service platforms instead,  such as the MyShaw App, online chat, Facebook Messenger, Twitter or phone. In New  Zealand, Vodafone New Zealand, Spark and 2degrees closed their stores for foot traffic  while turning them into no-contact distribution sites aimed at providing essential  connectivity gear for their customers, in particular handsets, modems and replacement  SIMs. Vodafone Australia closed part of its stores in Sydney, redeployed employees to  customer care lines and encouraged its customers to use self-service channels in an  attempt to manage increased call volumes and reduced availability of its employees in  https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=53887 https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=53860 https://www.mpt.gov.by/ru/news/17-03-2020-6114 https://www.orange.com/en/Press-Room/press-releases/press-releases-2020/Orange-is-mobilised-to-ensure-continuity-of-service-for-all-customers-in-France-and-around-the-world https://www.orange.com/en/Press-Room/press-releases/press-releases-2020/Orange-is-mobilised-to-ensure-continuity-of-service-for-all-customers-in-France-and-around-the-world https://www.orange-business.com/fr/presse/orange-est-mobilise-pour-assurer-continuite-services-aupres-lensemble-clients-en-france https://www.orange-business.com/fr/presse/orange-est-mobilise-pour-assurer-continuite-services-aupres-lensemble-clients-en-france https://www.telenor.se/aktuell-information-corona/ https://www.telekom.com/de/blog/karriere/karriere/die-magische-it-welt-hinter-der-service-hotline-598868 https://www.proximus.be/en/id_b_cr_proximus_helps/personal/blog/news/be-the-first-to-know/proximus-helps.html https://newscentre.vodafone.co.uk/viewpoint/store-closures-how-we-can-help-our-customers/ https://www.o2.co.uk/covid-19 https://www.mobileworldlive.com/blog/covid-19-industry-impact-february-to-march/ https://www.shaw.ca/covid-19 https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/nz-operators-adapt-retail-model-during-lockdown/  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  25  Mumbai following measures implemented in India. Telekom Malaysia closed all retail  outlets.  In some countries, however, in particular in underserved world regions, the closure of  physical shops significantly affected both the operators and the customers. In India, for  example, where 90 % of the population uses prepaid accounts, the operators recorded a  35 % decline in balance top-ups due to customers being unable to visit retail stores. To  manage this situation, some operators, including Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel,  extended the validity period and offered additional allowances after India’s regulator  issued a request to prevent people from visiting the stores. In addition, the three major  operators offered customer incentives to recharge the accounts of other subscribers  online who might not be proficient with such services (Vodafone’s ‘Recharge for Good’  scheme, Airtel’s ‘Earn from Home’ program, Reliance Jio’s JIOPos Lite App). Airtel  launched a programme to incentivise micro entrepreneurs with large fleets of workers,  such as delivery services and transport companies (e.g. Uber), to provide recharging  services for citizens in return for a 4 % margin, thus providing income for such companies  as well.  3.4.7 In-house visits  To ensure the safety of personnel and customers, customer care services requiring house  visits or visits at the operator’s premises were also adapted. Operators took steps to limit  physical contact between their employees and customers by replacing house visits with  remote diagnostics and encouraging self-install/repair by the users themselves with  online/remote support where possible in the form of online instructions and manuals, video  guides and live support via voice or video service. For essential house visits that could be  preplaced with other forms of support, safety protocols were established. This included, for  example, qualifying customer contacts, e.g. by checking if any infected people were on the  premises by calling prior to the appointment and again immediately upon arrival, and providing  personal protective equipment for technicians and customers (gloves, face masks, hand  sanitisers, washing protocols, physical distancing instructions, protective gear and eyewear,  etc.).  In the United Kingdom, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media amd Sport issued  COVID-19 guidance for telecommunications infrastructure deployment in England, which  included guidance for works that have to take place at other people’s homes. Norwegian  Telenor and the United Kingdom’s Virgin Media, Openreach and CommunityFibre,  developed protocols for in-house visits of its personnel and subcontractors. These  included contacting the customer in advance to agree on the visit protocol, contacting  them again a few days before and on the day of the visit to clarify if there were any  conditions related to quarantine or isolation that would require postponing the visit. The  customer was also required to inform the operator in case an infection was detected with  them in the days following the visit. In Belgium, Proximus also adapted their in-house  visits accordingly to limit the chance of exposure and respect social distancing when on  site.  https://www.mobileworldlive.com/asia/asia-news/lockdown-takes-toll-on-india-prepaid-revenue/ https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/techook/jiopos-lite-airtel-superhero-vodafone-idea-rechargeforgood-benefits-6355150/ https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=50293 https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-guidance-for-telecommunications-infrastructure-deployment-in-england https://www.telenor.no/privat/internett/teknisk-arbeid-korona/ https://www.virginmedia.com/help/coronavirus-update https://www.openreach.com/covid-19-coronavirus https://communityfibre.co.uk/covid-19-faqs https://www.proximus.be/en/id_b_cr_proximus_helps/personal/blog/news/be-the-first-to-know/proximus-helps.html  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  26  4. RESPONSE BY  AUTHORITIES AND INDUSTRY  INITIATIVES  4.1 RESPONSE BY THE NATIONAL TELECOM AUTHORITIES  Across the EU, national telecom security authorities and other national competent authorities  cooperated closely with the operators and with crisis centres. Reporting mechanisms were set  up from the beginning of the pandemic. Operators and national internet exchanges exchanged  information on the evolution of network traffic as the pandemic evolved and on the response of  the networks and services to the increased communication needs.  In Austria, the Authority for telecom security (https://www.rtr.at/en ) remained in close contact  with the operators, with weekly exchanges of information.  In Belgium, the authority for post and telecoms (https://www.bipt.be/operators) set up a daily  reporting mechanism on network traffic with the largest operators. Over the following months  the frequency was reduced to successively thrice, twice and once a week. Reporting was  suspended at the beginning of June. They also coordinated contact between operators and the  crisis centre to allow lockdown exceptions, like the opening of telecom shops. Conference calls  with the operators proved to be useful.  In Bulgaria, the telecommunications authority (https://crc.bg/en) acted as a coordination centre,  supporting the measures of the government and the national crisis centre. They urged the public  to use fixed telephony rather than mobile telephony in an effort to reduce mobile traffic, which  was severely increased.  In Croatia, the national competent authority for telecoms (https://www.hakom.hr/) provided the  relevant state institutions with daily/weekly reports about the status of their networks and the  internet traffic situation. Planned upgrades were accelerated (e.g. expansions on intercity  capacities; internet upstream interconnection capacity; increase of cell capacity by adding all  available spectrum for LTE).The ISPs were well prepared for an increase in data traffic,  maximum capacities were not reached and the networks have the capacity to absorb an even  bigger increase in traffic.  In Cyprus, the authority for electronic communications (http://www.ocecpr.org.cy/) ensured the  frequent exchange of information between the NRA and the operators. The public was  informed about teleworking and the basic security measures to be more prepared against  phishing emails during the COVID-19 crisis.  In Czechia, the Czech Telecommunication Office (https://www.ctu.eu/) collected monitoring  reports of the telecom and the postal services operators. The initial increase in data due to the  use of videoconferencing tools was analysed from these reports and there were no problems in  public communication nets.  In Denmark, the competent authority (https://www.cybersecurityintelligence.com/centre-for-  cyber-security-cfcs-3071.html) handled the situation with a more or less closed down society in  close collaboration with the 10–15 most essential providers. They reported on a regular basis  in accordance with the guidelines the authority had set out, i.e. about operating status on net  and services, special challenges and problems, risks related especially to COVID-19 and any  https://www.rtr.at/en https://www.bipt.be/operators https://crc.bg/en https://www.hakom.hr/ http://www.ocecpr.org.cy/ https://www.ctu.eu/ https://www.cybersecurityintelligence.com/centre-for-cyber-security-cfcs-3071.html https://www.cybersecurityintelligence.com/centre-for-cyber-security-cfcs-3071.html  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  27  unusual cyber related activities and incidents. Emergency legislation was put in place, so that  the police could carry out DNS-blocking to prevent access to unauthorised homepages.  In France, the competent authority (https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/agence/cybersecurite/ssi-en-  france/) took measures to enable them to take down abusive websites more quickly (related to  COVID-19 misinformation and scams).  In Germany, according to the NRA (https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/  EN/Home/home_node.html), from week 14 to week 22, the pandemic affected the electronic  communications networks to a very small extent only. Despite considerable increases in voice  and data traffic in some cases, the networks remained stable.  In Greece, the NRA (www.eett.gr) monitored the situation and regularly collected data from  network operators. They reported weekly on the status of internet capacity, regulatory and  other measures. Teleconferencing proved to be effective way to establish trust between the  NRA and the operators when dealing with crises like the recent pandemic.  The Greek communications security authority (www.adae.gr) disseminated a two-pillar  questionnaire to the operators. Providers were asked about potential alterations that occurred  in their BCP or in their systems’ RTOs, in the contracts with third parties or with their suppliers.  They were also asked to audit their internal critical departments and the most critical business  processes, and to identify potential alterations. The second pillar of the questionnaire  contained technical questions about specific parts of their networks and specific systems that  were mostly overloaded either in the core, aggregation or the access part of the network.  Finally, the authority performed audits on the new SMS platform that managed all the SMS  messages sent during lockdown by Greek citizens to declare their will and reason for leaving  their house as well as the authorisation answers sent by the server.  In Hungary, the NRA (http://english.nmhh.hu/) issued a statement that residential users should  save internet capacity by using lower resolution video downloads and limiting their internet  usage to the minimum necessary. Regardless of these measures the networks were in a very  good condition.  In Ireland, ComReg (https://www.comreg.ie/) released additional radio spectrum on a  temporary basis to MNOs to mitigate this extra traffic demand  (https://www.comreg.ie/industry/radio-spectrum/spectrum-awards/covid-19-temporary-  spectrum-management-measures/). Clarifications were made as to who is considered essential  worker. ComReg also provided weekly updates to the Department of Communications Climate  Action and Environment based on the information provided by operators on their network traffic  and capacity for voice and data; weekly industry preparedness team meetings were hosted  and attended by all operators, in order to discuss and deal with urgent issues.  In Luxembourg the NRA (https://web.ilr.lu/FR/ILR) received updates from the national internet  exchange. There were no congestions. Some problems arose with customer installation and  fault management, due to the refusal of customers to let operator field personnel inside their  homes.  In Malta, there were two distinct streams of activities carried out by the government and the  competent authority (https://www.mca.org.mt/). Before the restrictive period and eventual  partial lockdown was in place, the government, through the relevant ministry, requested that  providers of ECS provide detailed business continuity plans covering plans to tackle growth in  traffic, situations where there could be power losses and/or shortages of fuel supply as well as  situations where staff are impaired to travel or quarantined. The authority requested that  providers monitor and report on traffic evolution, initially three times a week, down to once  https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/agence/cybersecurite/ssi-en-france/ https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/agence/cybersecurite/ssi-en-france/ https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/%20EN/Home/home_node.html https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/%20EN/Home/home_node.html http://www.eett.gr/ http://www.adae.gr/ http://english.nmhh.hu/ https://www.comreg.ie/ https://www.comreg.ie/industry/radio-spectrum/spectrum-awards/covid-19-temporary-spectrum-management-measures/ https://www.comreg.ie/industry/radio-spectrum/spectrum-awards/covid-19-temporary-spectrum-management-measures/ https://web.ilr.lu/FR/ILR https://www.mca.org.mt/  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  28  every 2 weeks as the traffic situation quickly become stable. Providers were also requested to  alert the NRA of any arising situations that might alter the risk of a security or integrity incident.  In the Netherlands, the radio communications agency (https://www.agentschaptelecom.nl/) was  in daily contact with the providers to share information.  In Norway, in the early stages of the pandemic, the competent authority (https://www.nkom.no/)  ensured that providers reviewed their contingency plans. Status reports from providers on  ongoing incidents, capacity status, availability of critical personnel and equipment were  collected. Information on regulatory decisions relevant to the sector was coordinated.  In Poland, the NRA (https://uke.gov.pl/en/) received reports from the 16 largest operators on  voice and data load on networks and other phenomena that threatened the security and  continuity of services. On the basis of this information, a message was published on the  authority’s website and Facebook/Twitter profiles that the situation related to quality and  continuity of telecommunications services was under control. Individual operators published  similar information.  In Romania, ANCOM(https://www.ancom.ro/en/) sent a questionnaire to the most important  electronic communication providers regarding traffic evolution and the security measures  implemented in the context of COVID-19. Providers had to answer the questionnaire every  2 weeks and significant changes as soon as possible. Based on this information, ANCOM  reported to ENISA and BEREC. ANCOM also asked electronic communication providers not to  suspend or disconnect their subscribers in case of non-payment of invoices during the state of  emergency. ANCOM also had a dialogue with the Ministry of Internal Affairs, highlighting the  importance of cooperation between the electronic communication providers and the national  crisis cell.  In Serbia, RATEL (https://www.ratel.rs/en/) provided information, advice and  recommendations on relevant topics on its official website. The first instructions were released  immediately and they concerned the procedure for obtaining lockdown exemption permits for  operators’ employees in order to be able to carry out essential repairs and maintenance  during lockdown. A number of suggestions to users and recommendations for optimal network  configuration and connections made from home have also been provided in the media as well  as on social media platforms (Facebook and LinkedIn). Responsible use of the internet and  warnings about possible misuse were also promoted. The largest EC operators and ISPs  updated RATEL daily on their networks and services status, network load, usage, congestion  and demands for additional capacity.  In Slovenia, (https://www.akos-rs.si/), the government started the national plan for protection  of rescue in the event of a pandemic. Most of bigger telecom providers in the country had  pandemic contingency plans in place. Higher demand was solved with additional links and by  setting additional base stations and network elements.  In Slovakia, the NRA (https://www.teleoff.gov.sk) established a special pandemic commission,  which met regularly in order to promptly solve operational issues related to the pandemic. In  accordance with ENISA requirements, a questionnaire was sent to the main telco operators.  The NRA also provided recommendations for operators on how to manage their networks  during the COVID-19 crisis, in accordance with recommendations from the International  Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute.  In Sweden, PTS (https://www.pts.se/en/) activated its crisis management organisation at an  early stage to be able to monitor the situation closely and to be prepared to act if necessary.  Telcos made use of their respective pandemic plans (produced during the ‘bird-flu’ H5N1 in  2009) and updated them. The government clarified which sectors in society should be  https://www.agentschaptelecom.nl/ https://www.nkom.no/ https://uke.gov.pl/en/ https://www.ancom.ro/en/ https://www.ratel.rs/en/ https://www.akos-rs.si/ https://www.teleoff.gov.sk/ https://www.pts.se/en/  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  29  prioritised when it came to testing for COVID-19 and childcare (legislation was implemented),  so society could still function. PTS analysed and indicated which functions within electronic  communications and postal services should be prioritised.  The National Telecommunications Coordination Group (a voluntary forum for cooperation  between different telecommunications providers and PTS, with the aim to restore national  infrastructure for electronic communications during severe strains or difficulties in society),  started to meet in February and have had regular meetings since then. Members of the group  have tried to foresee what could happen to electronic communications given different scenarios  related to COVID-19 to be able to prepare for different situations and reduce the impact on  society.  In Switzerland, the COVID-19 crisis triggered the declaration of the highest national state of  emergency. The crisis committee, of which BAKOM (https://www.bakom.admin.ch/) is a  member, was called up and met weekly. The state of emergency was relaxed to the second  level on 19 June. The overload of telephony at the beginning of the lockdown was quickly  solved by increasing the capacity of the affected interconnection links. A mechanism was  activated, whereby essential staff of the operators could be exempted from civil protection duty.  An emergency decree was prepared intended to limit telecom traffic, e.g. in the event of a  severe overload. It was not necessary to enact the decree.  4.2 INDUSTRY INITIATIVES  Numerous cooperative initiatives and joint actions were launched around the world in order to  support the industry in its response and to facilitate cooperation and exchange of practices.  Twenty eight trade associations from around the world joined the Information Technology  Industry Council’s (ITI) call for governments at all levels worldwide to adopt clear and uniform  guidance regarding essential ICT workers for the purpose of their business continuity and  maintenance operations. The call came when increasing numbers of jurisdictions issued  orders restricting individuals’ freedom of movement in reaction to COVID-19. ITI specifically  addressed the authorities in the United States, Brazil, India and Malaysia where such issues  were identified. In Colombia, the Comision de Regulacion de Communicaciones  facilitated  work with territorial entities to guarantee digital attention and the movement of technical crews  so that communication networks could continue to operate during curfews and other  measures associated with the pandemic.  However, the implementation of such measures of national levels was not always trivial. In  India for example, despite telecommunications networks having been recognised as critical  infrastructure, the Cellular Operators Association of India  had to intervene with state  authorities after operators experienced issues with their technicians being denied access to  telecom sites located in COVID-19 hotspots by local authorities, posing a significant threat to  the uninterrupted operation of services. German 1&1 Drillisch announced delays in its 5G  network build due to issues with permissions to access sites during the ongoing lockdown in  the country.  4.2.1 Exchanging good practices  Several platforms were set up to support the monitoring of the COVID-19 situation with  networks and internet traffic and to share best practices and measures taken to keep the  communications services running.  https://www.bakom.admin.ch/ https://www.itic.org/news-events/news-releases/momentum-builds-as-28-associations-from-around-the-world-join-call-for-uniform-guidance-for-essential-tech-workers-during-covid-19-pandemic https://www.crcom.gov.co/es/noticia/crc-contin-a-implementando-medidas-para-garantizar-el-acceso-a-servicios-de-comunicaciones-por-parte-de-los-ciudadanos-en-medio-de-la-contingencia-por-covid-19 https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/telcos-warn-of-full-service-breakdown-in-virus-hotspots/articleshow/75111780.cms?from=mdr https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/german-newcomer-5g-build-delayed-by-virus/  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  30  The WHO published a WHO COVID-19 SMS message library and together with ITU they called  on all telecommunications companies worldwide to support the delivery of these messages in  communication with the general public via SMS and voice messages.  During COVID-19, the European Emergency Number Association data and strategies per  country on emergency calls and public warning during COVID-19 outbreak was tracking the use  of Public Warning Systems (PWS) in Europe and comprehensive reports per country were  provided.  ITU launched the Global Network Resiliency Platform (#REG4COVID), where regulators,  policymakers and other interested stakeholders were able to share information, view what  initiatives and measures have been introduced around the world, and discuss and exchange  experiences, ongoing initiatives and innovative policy and regulatory measures designed in  response to COVID-19.  The Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development, the UN’s high-level public–private  partnership, released the Agenda for Action, with the intention to bring together  intergovernmental, regional, national, industry, civil society and technical and academic  communities to shape strategies around three main pillars of resilient connectivity, affordable  access and safe use of online services for informed and educated societies, in order to mitigate  the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, ease its immediate adverse impacts and contribute to  long-term development for better preparedness and resilience.  As part of the RIPE hackathon on the health of the internet during the COVID-19 crisis, an  experimental interface was developed from the RIPE Atlas database, the RIPE Atlas  dashboard: Network delays during national lockdowns on the health of the internet to monitor  and study congestion that could occur at large eyeball networks during mass quarantines.  ITU released new guidelines for countries to develop national emergency telecommunications  plans to keep networks online during national emergencies. Contingency planning also includes  specific elements relevant to COVID-19.  NCTA members in the United States and other providers joined to report key metrics during the  pandemic in an online dashboard: COVID-19: How cable’s internet networks are performing.  In the Caribbean, a COVID-19 taskforce was launched, consisting of telecom operators and  industry experts, to engage governments and regulators and share best practices during the  pandemic.  The Digital development joint action plan and call for action, initiated by the World Bank, ITU,  GSMA and the World Economic Forum, provided a set of guidelines for regulators and  decision-makers on a number of ICT-enabled pandemic response objectives.  In 2018, the Broadband Commission published a report on epidemic preparedness: Preventing  the spread of epidemics using ICT, extensively elaborating on the use of ICT and mobile  networks in particular for pandemic response. This report provides numerous examples from  past incidents, such as the Ebola and Zika outbreaks, as well as useful resources on the use of  text messaging services for epidemic information and infection management, for example SMS  messages sent to at-risk travellers, and the use of mobile data for pandemic tracking and  prediction. It also provided guidelines and examples on the use of various mobile technologies  for sharing vital information with the public, such as IVR, SMS and USSD, as well as, for  example, suggested messaging content, user journeys and messaging frequency.  https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/covid-19-message-library https://eena.org/data-strategies-emergency-calls-public-warning-covid19/ https://eena.org/data-strategies-emergency-calls-public-warning-covid19/ https://reg4covid.itu.int/ https://www.broadbandcommission.org/COVID19/Pages/default.aspx https://ihr.iijlab.net/ihr/en-us/covid19 https://ihr.iijlab.net/ihr/en-us/covid19 https://www.gsma.com/betterfuture/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/COVID-19_Digital-Development-Joint-Action-Plan-GSMA_TheWorldBank_ITU_WEF.pdf https://www.ncta.com/COVIDdashboard https://www.gsma.com/betterfuture/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/COVID-19_Digital-Development-Joint-Action-Plan-GSMA_TheWorldBank_ITU_WEF.pdf https://www.gsma.com/betterfuture/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Digital-Development-Joint-Action-Plan_Call-for-Action-Report-2020.pdf https://www.broadbandcommission.org/Documents/working-groups/BBCOM%20WG%20Epidemic%20Preparedness%20Final%20Print%20(Executive%20Summary).pdf https://www.broadbandcommission.org/Documents/working-groups/BBCOM%20WG%20Epidemic%20Preparedness%20Final%20Print%20(Executive%20Summary).pdf  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  31  Ookla set up interactive dashboards with per-country insights into their data to monitor the  impact of COVID-19 on the performance and quality of global mobile and broadband internet  networks.  The European Commission and BEREC, with the support of NRAs, set up a reporting  mechanism to monitor internet traffic in the EU Member States.  4.2.2 Adaptation of streaming quality and scheduling of popular releases  To manage the increased demand in communications, cooperation within the industry as well as  with the end users was essential, and at the same time a cost-efficient measure, in particular to  promote responsibility with regards to how the content was served during the pandemic.  The telecommunications industry reached out to content providers with agreements on reducing  the bitrates for specific types of content to preserve the operation of vital communications services,  and to agree on careful scheduling of downloads of popular new content, such as gaming updates.  In March 2020, the European Broadcasting Union prepared a strategy for adapting streaming  quality during the crisis. Among other provisions, the strategy provided guidance on the adaptation  of streaming services in respect of network congestion issues through streaming bitrate reduction,  in particular during office hours, and arranging adaptive streaming manifests for premium quality to  fixed large screen devices over mobile devices. Some reports speculate that without the OTT video  streaming service providers shifting to standard definition, networks in many regions of the world  would have seen the percentage of the overall traffic volume reach as high as 70 % and the quality  of service would have been severely affected on many networks, especially during evening peak  hours.  In Europe, the strain on communications networks was considerably relieved following a call by  the EU’s Commissioner for Internal Market, Thierry Breton, to major streaming content  providers, including Netflix, YouTube, Amazon and Disney, to take action in reducing the  bitrates and switching to standard definition in response to increased connectivity demands  resulting from social distancing measures. Netflix for example, reduced their bitrates across all  streams in Europe, thus reducing its traffic on European networks by 25 %. They did not restrict  higher resolutions; instead, they readjusted and changed encoding for the existing qualities.

Akami, for example, cooperated with Microsoft and Sony to agree on  dynamic rescheduling for downloads of new gaming updates to off-peak times. Sony, Ubisoft  and Xbox limited their internet footprints. In Colombia, the ICT ministry requested that internet  platforms offer services in standard definition as opposed to more data intensive higher  definitions that could overload already stressed networks.  4.2.3 Promoting responsible use of network resources  Once networks experienced spikes in the volume of traffic and congestions, numerous  telecommunications operators and regulators also reached out to their customers asking them  to use the resources responsibly. From past emergency experience, this is one of the most  cost-effective measures to be taken in managing network overloads during high consumption  demands.  The United Kingdom’s Ofcom, in cooperation with the biggest telcos including BT, Sky, O2,  Vodafone and Virgin Media, launched a Stay Connected campaign and provided guidelines to  its subscribers on how to adapt their usage to help keep the network operational. Telefónica’s  Movistar, Orange, Vodafone, Masmovil and Euskaltel in Spain, as well as regulators such as  the United States’ FCC took similar measures in an attempt to raise awareness with the end  users. In Italy, a joint letter was issued by the country’s fixed and mobile operators in March  2020 urging consumers to take a number of measures to keep network bandwidth available for  critical services and teleworking. The operators suggested delaying video streaming and  gaming to outside of peak working hours, using landlines rather than mobile services for voice  calls, avoiding video in work collaboration tools and avoiding massive emails with sizeable  attachments.  In Nepal, ISPAN, NTA and Nepali Telecom issued a request to people to use the internet  responsibly and avoid binge watching and gaming, and also to not change their internet settings  because of limited possibilities to provide assistance through at-home visits. Similar guidelines  were provided by numerous other operators and organisations around the world, including the  Secretariat of the Inter-American Telecommunication Commission, the Communications  Regulatory Authority of the Republic of Lithuania , the Mexican Ministry of Communications and  Transportation in coordination with other federal government institutions, the Communications  Regulatory Agency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, CenturyLink, OGERO in Lebanon, French  ARCEP and Greece’s Ministry of Digital Governance. The importance of governments  promoting smart and responsible use of network resources by the general public during times of  crisis was also emphasised by numerous other national and international organisations,  including for example the World Economic Forum, NCTA and Cablelabs.  4.2.4 Management of spectrum resources  The NRAs worldwide handled demand for additional spectrum resources.  In addition to providing access to additional spectrum capacities, regulators in numerous countries,  including Malaysia, Argentina, Canada, Romania, Kenya, Yemen and Mauritius, have delayed or  even partially waived payments of spectrum fees, thus supporting additional investments into  providing sufficient connectivity capacities. In April 2020, for example, the Ministry of Internal Affairs  and Communications of Japan deferred the collection of payments for spectrum user fees in areas  where emergency measures were to be taken due to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.  https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2020/03/26/game-companies-go-off-peak-to-reduce-bandwidth-usage https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Emergency-Telecommunications/Documents/2020/NETP-guidelines.pdf https://www.capacitymedia.com/articles/3825122/live-covid-19-coronavirus-news-how-the-telecoms-world-is-dealing-with-the-pandemic https://news.o2.co.uk/press-release/uk-telecoms-industry-joins-together-to-help-the-country-stay-connected/ https://www.fiercetelecom.com/telecom/spainish-carriers-see-a-40-spike-network-traffic-due-to-covid-19 https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/spain-set-to-suspend-operator-switching-in-virus-fight/ https://www.nepalitelecom.com/2020/03/nta-requests-use-internet-corona.html https://www.nepalitelecom.com/2020/03/internet-usage-increases-corona-speed-slow.html https://www.citel.oas.org/en/Pages/default.aspx https://www.rrt.lt/en/covid-19-important-information/covid-19/ https://www.rrt.lt/en/covid-19-important-information/covid-19/ https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/545575/Gui_a_para_el_uso_TIC_quedate_en_casa_Abril_2020.pdf https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/545575/Gui_a_para_el_uso_TIC_quedate_en_casa_Abril_2020.pdf https://rak.ba/en/news/1657 https://rak.ba/en/news/1657 https://news.centurylink.com/connections-1?item=873 https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=50372 https://www.arcep.fr/demarches-et-services/utilisateurs/teletravail-et-connexion-internet.html https://greekcitytimes.com/2020/03/17/greek-government-issues-ten-commandments-for-responsible-internet-use-during-pandemic/ https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/covid-19-5-ways-to-protect-critical-digital-connectivity/ https://www.ncta.com/whats-new/what-know-about-covid-19-and-the-internet-experience https://www.cablelabs.com/tips-to-improve-your-home-wi-fi-performance https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=50267 https://www.icta.mu/mediaoffice/2020/licence_extends.pdf https://www.soumu.go.jp/main_sosiki/joho_tsusin/eng/COVID-19/141289_04.html https://www.soumu.go.jp/main_sosiki/joho_tsusin/eng/COVID-19/141289_04.html  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  33  Demands for additional spectrum resources were particularly high in the United States, where  the FCC granted special temporary authority to multiple wireless carriers in coverage (600–  700 MHz) and capacity (1.7–2.2 GHz) bands, including to operators AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, US  Cellular, Verizon, and several service providers in rural communities. This constituted granting  special temporary authorities either on a secondary non-interference basis for operating in  spectrum licensed to other operators, or for spectrum bands that are not licensed. For example,  on 17 March 2020 the FCC approved a move by US Cellular to access AWS-3 spectrum held  by Advantage Spectrum for a period of 60 days to boost capacity in parts of California, Oregon,  Washington and Wisconsin, and on 16 March 2020 cleared T-Mobile US to use the additional  600 MHz of spectrum licensed to several broadcast companies, including Dish Network,  Comcast, NewLevel, LB License Co, Channel 51, Omega, Bluewater and TStar License  Holdings, to allow the operator to respond to increased usage demands. AT&T secured new  access to AWS-4 and 700 MHz spectrum, including in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.  Bluegrass Cellular was granted access to AWS-1 spectrum in Kentucky and Union Wireless in  Wyoming. On 27 March 2020 temporary spectrum access was granted to 33 wireless internet  service providers serving 330 counties in 29 states to help support rural communities facing an  increase in broadband needs during the pandemic and for telework, remote learning and  telehealth in particular.  In Europe, similar demands were reported in Ireland, where the regulator ComReg released  additional spectrum capacities in the 700 MHz and 2.6 GHz spectrum bands available for  temporary licensing at low costs, with changed conditions for 2.1 GHz to ensure it can be used  for 4G connectivity. Regulators and operators in the United Kingdom, France and Italy, on the  other hand, reported that the available spectrum was sufficient and no requests for additional  capacities were made.  In the Middle East, Jordan released available spectrum on a short-term basis to MNOs in  capacity bands, sub-1 GHz and fixed wireless access, followed by similar measures in Saudi  Arabia for capacity bands and sub-1 GHz (an additional 40 MHz in the 700 MHz and 800 MHz  bands). Oman’s regulator TRA has temporarily allocated additional spectrum in the 1.8 GHz  and 2.1 GHz bands for free, proceeded with allowing licensees to activate wireless broadband  service through WFBB-LTE-FDD using the 4G frequencies, and encouraged operation of the  national roaming facility. In the United Arab Emirates, the national regulator extended the  validity of all wireless permits to hospitals and medical centres as well as provided a package of  wireless frequency as backup to support the Health sector’s wireless communication systems.  In South America, Panama’s NRA announced granting of temporary spectrum licenses to  MNOs upon request and similar actions have also been announced in Brazil. The Secretariat of  the Inter-American Telecommunication Commission, took a number of actions to encourage the  expansion of internet coverage and other telecommunications services, especially in areas that  do not have access, including agile granting of permits for temporary use of spectrum and for  the deployment of infrastructure in order to expand network coverage. National Authority of  Public Services in Panama authorised free access for 90 days to an additional 30 MHz band of  the AWS band to all mobile operators, thus making available in total an additional 120 MHz of  spectrum.  In Africa, the African Telecommunications Union issued a set of guidelines to governments in  order to make the necessary spectrum available for different types of services as well as  availability of different combinations of spectrum bands free of charge for emergency  communications to support rapid deployment of terrestrial and satellite systems with limited  interference. In Ghana, Vodafone and MTN were granted free access to additional spectrum  bands for capacity augmentation. Tunisia made all IMT spectrum tech-neutral on a short-term  basis while South Africa’s regulator ICASA granted temporary access to spectrum bands in the  700 MHz, 800 MHz, 2.3 GHz, 2.6 GHz and 3.5 GHz bands.

In Sudan, NRAs have  granted additional radio frequency spectrum free of charge to Zain on a temporary basis. Kenya  fast-tracked approval of Alphabet’s Loon project to expedite the commercial deployment of  internet-enabled balloons in partnership with Telkom Kenya, delivering 4G coverage to remote,  previously unserved communities. Agência Reguladora Multissetorial da Economía of the  African Cape Verde proceeded with allocating additional spectrum to mobile operators and also  implemented technological neutrality of the 900 MHz band for the operators to reinforce 2G, 3G  and 4G networks.  In Malaysia, the regulator granted Telekom Malaysia early access to 700 MHz and 3.5 GHz on  a trial basis to support 5G operation in COVID-19 quarantine hotspots, followed by awarding  operators Telekom Malaysia, Celcom Axiata, and units from Maxis and DiGi.Com access to the  700 MHz band of 5G network on 15 May 2020.  New Zealand completed direct allocation of spectrum in the 3.5 GHz band for an interim period  until November 2022, with Spark and 2degrees gaining rights to 60 MHz and Dense Air  40 MHz. The move followed postponement of the 5G spectrum auction in an attempt to boost  5G rollout throughout 2020 in response to the pandemic.  https://ca.go.ke/leveraging-icts-in-the-fight-against-covid-19-pandemic/ https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/REG4COVID/Display.asp?ID=54002 https://www.mobileworldlive.com/blog/intelligence-brief-how-are-regulators-responding-to-covid-19/ https://www.arme.cv/index.php/noticia-geral/528-covid-19-arme-emite-recomendacoes-e-fixa-medidas-excecionais-para-sectores-regulados https://www.arme.cv/index.php/noticia-geral/528-covid-19-arme-emite-recomendacoes-e-fixa-medidas-excecionais-para-sectores-regulados https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/govt-awards-700-mhz-band-tm-celcom-digi-maxis-and-altel https://www.mobileworldlive.com/asia/asia-news/nz-skips-5g-auction-allocates-airwaves-direct/  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  35  5. CONCLUSIONS AND  LESSONS LEARNED  The experiences collected so far have shown that the emergency caused by the pandemic  lasted for a much longer period of time compared to any other crisis. The operators were forced  to address many security and resilience challenges through established business continuity  management practices as well as a good measure of flexibility and creativity.  The exact situation and lessons learned were unique with practically each country and operator.  Larger negative effects appeared more often in fragile and conflict-affected countries and  regions, although there were exceptions in more stable and higher-income countries as well.  The most interesting lessons learned as described in Sections 2, 3 and 4 are gathered as  follows.  5.1 LESSONS LEARNED FOR OPERATORS  Telecommunications operators should support emergency services.  There should be support plans established for frontline professionals involved in the  crisis response activities, and measures to ensure sufficient communications  capacities and coverage to support emergency response services in staying connected  and being able to communicate smoothly. The measures could include coverage in  hotspot zones and in locations where critical response infrastructures are located  permanently (e.g. hospitals) or deployed temporarily.  Cooperative initiatives to support the monitoring of the situation and the sharing of best  practices are necessary. Continuous cooperation within the industry is essential in  addressing the challenges as they emerge.  The crisis plans of the operators and the related decision-making processes should  stay flexible and adapt dynamically through time as the crisis evolves. It is important to  set up committees and boards with sufficient know-how to guide the decision-making  process.  There is need for subscriber support during all stages of a crisis.   Alleviating measures could include increasing or removing data caps, offering  free unlimited internet service and access to entertainment and educational  contents, flexible payment options and temporary suspension of long-distance  and international roaming.   Setting up new customer care services, mostly in the form of online portals,  virtual assistants and virtual rooms is essential for enhanced customer  support during crisis. House visits should be replaced, where possible, with  remote diagnostics and encouraging self-install/repair by the users  themselves with online/remote support where possible in the form of online  instructions and manuals, video guides as well as live support via voice or  video service. For essential house visits, safety protocols should be  established.  The management of exceptionally high demands as a result of the pandemic calls for  reconfigurations of existing network equipment and placement of additional network  equipment, securing of additional spectrum resources, resource sharing between  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  36  operators, applying for access to backhaul spectrum, as well as emergency  deployments, including using new technologies.  Interesting practices include capacity increases, implementation of call gaping, codec  reconfigurations resulting in voice quality reduction, time limits, direct retry, dynamic  quality and data consumption balancing, configuration of traffic prioritisation to support  emergency communications and essential services.  Using remote and unmanned monitoring, surveillance of the infrastructure and  diagnostics, e.g. remote access to networking equipment and even drones, limits the  exposure of essential personnel of the operators. Redundant teams of essential  technicians and non-overlapping work shifts should be organised to limit risk exposure,  and contacts with suppliers and subcontractors limited.  5.2 LESSONS LEARNED FOR AUTHORITIES  Responsible use of telecommunications resources with regards to how the content is  served and consumed during the emergency should be promoted through awareness-  raising initiatives.  Guidelines can include both general things users can do to keep spikes in traffic load  smaller as well as measures they can take themselves in case they experience  interruptions or degraded service quality. Some examples include:   using fixed or Wi-Fi telephony, or over-the-top apps, instead of mobile voice  services if interruptions start to occur;   prioritising traffic for important use, such as access to information, remote  work and education, and rescheduling consumption of non-essential services  such as streamed video entertainment and online games to off-peak hours;   applying settings that reduce data consumption, including the use of Wi-Fi or  lower resolution for content, avoiding sending large files, such as videos and  presentations, and using e.g. cloud sharing services instead or compressing  the contents;   choosing online collaborative work tools instead of video conference calls.  Agreements should be reached for reducing the bitrates for specific types of content to  preserve the operation of vital communications services and for careful scheduling of  downloads of popular new content, such as gaming updates.  Cooperation with the competent authorities and supervising ministries, policy alignment  and fast and flexible responses of the regulatory initiatives are essential. There is a  need for fast awarding of licenses and management of license fees under emergency  conditions. Temporary release of additional radio spectrum and increase of  interconnection voice circuits among operators are some interesting initiatives on  behalf of the states.  Information to do with the handling of crisis has to be disseminated in a timely way to  key stakeholders, so that they can successfully adjust and apply their business  continuity plans.  Declaring the telecommunications services as an essential service is necessary for  granting the operators travel and access permissions during potential lockdowns, or for  keeping the telecommunication stores open.  Reporting mechanisms should be set up for the competent authorities to gather  information on the evolution of network traffic and on the response of the networks and  services in the increased communication needs.  TELECOM SECURITY DURING A PANDEMIC  November 2020  37  Underserved communities become even more vulnerable in crises times. Therefore,  network capacity and coverage should be enhanced in rural areas, and investments  and innovation should be encouraged.  5.3 CONCLUSIONS  Overall we can draw the following conclusions:   The general take away from the pandemic so far is that the services and the networks  have been resilient during the crisis, despite major changes in usage and traffic.   Overall the business continuity plans of operators worked well. Business continuity has  always been an important point of focus for the sector.   There has been good collaboration between providers and national authorities, not  only at the beginning of the pandemic but also in the later stages.   The perception of consumers has changed: Electronic communications are now  considered a lifeline for citizens and key enablers for the economy and society.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic not only highlighted the importance of electronic communication networks and services for the EU’s society and economy, but it also triggered major changes and challenges in their use in the EU and worldwide. In this paper, we look at the role telecom providers played in ensuring the security and resilience of the services and networks during the pandemic highlighting good practices that providers and authorities implemented to help alleviate the pandemic’s impact on the sector. As general takeaway, services and networks have been resilient during the crisis, despite major changes in usage and traffic. Moreover, the perception of consumers shifted: electronic communication networks are now considered as a lifeline for citizens and crucial for the economy and society."

Bibliography/References 55  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  05  Executive Summary  Security certification is very limited in industrial environments despite the growing cyber attacks to what is  considered EU Member State Critical Information Infrastructure (CII). There are “good” reasons for this situation,  however, the community questions around the contribution of certification to the cyber security of the industrial CII  production line remain unanswered. Today, without an EU approved standard, harmonised testing and  corresponding certification, answering these questions is complicated and unclear. This is a major issue given the  desire and policy agenda towards a more integrated and global digital infrastructure, which is needed to support the  internal European market.  This study aims to provide a thorough description of the cyber security certification status concerning the most  critical equipment in different critical business sectors. More specifically, five sectors have been selected to  investigate in more detail and to consider a broad spectrum of different requirements and cases that could lead to  certification drivers concerning these devices. The five sectors are1 energy, ICT2, health care, rail transport and water  transport.  The key finding is that every sector has its own functional and security challenges which makes the target of a  common certification framework a challenge. The energy sector, for example, largely depends on real-time  interfaces on process automation level to provide a stable and reliable electrical power supply. The need for more  real-time data exchange is increasing due to the decentralization of the power grid, increasing penetration of  renewables and further integration of markets. On the other hand, the health care sector largely depends on  informational systems and interfaces, like centralized patient databases that are used by companies that provide  healthcare. Automation takes place on small scale, for example at hospitals to provide health monitoring.  Transportation is mostly about logistics and safety. Finally, trains on a track need to be able to communicate with  the generic infrastructure, while for the water transportation a vessel contains automation systems from office  automation to process automation concerning electric power supply and vessel control. At the same time, ICT  becomes the common processing platform which supports all these different functional and security requirements.  This underlines the (increasing) need for a common approach on standards and frameworks for certification.  Based on desk research and expert validation, an analysis is done to study the existing frameworks and standards,  and to identify certification drivers, best practices and candidate products for certification of the five selected  sectors. During this study, common findings that apply to multiple sectors have been identified:   A large part of the public infrastructure is used for data communication within and between critical  infrastructures. This introduces additional challenges to a system versus a privately-owned infrastructure  that is mostly considered as more secure.   Standalone certified devices are considered trustworthy. However, after integration in a real computing  environment this might be not the case. Appropriate planning and execution of system tests is critical,  where device certification will help to get a certain level of device quality concerning cyber security.   When it comes to building cyber security resilience in the selected sectors, it is observed that a small part  of the security will be supported by the components or devices that compose the systems while the larger  part of the security will depend on the processes and procedures that are in place.  1 Based on the findings of the 2015 ENISA study, ‘Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure  assets and services’, available at https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/methodologies-for-the-identification-of-ciis  2 While ICT is not a vital sector per se, we found that this sector is of major importance since it provides a wide range of  devices to other critical sectors.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/methodologies-for-the-identification-of-ciis  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  06   Many industries do not integrate security into their devices from the design phase. Thus, security by design  is an approach that needs to be widely adopted by vendors. A holistic approach provides a certain level of  security assurance at every level of the business value chain for critical infrastructures.   Outsourcing of specific tasks or functions increases the risk of being vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Knowledge  of the specific domain by those who deliver essential cyber security services is mandatory.   An overall concern is the use of devices like laptops, tablets and phones as entry points for potential attacks  or malware. This is a cross-sector threat where devices connected to complex and critical systems are mostly  unmonitored and can cause serious risk to the overall stability of such complex systems.  For each sector, a list of devices was identified that should be considered candidates for certification. Although this  list is not necessarily complete and exhaustive, these devices are found to have a large impact when compromised  or in case they fail to operate. Accordingly, the identified devices included in the candidates’ list provide a good  starting point for the investigation to a common approach for certification, because within critical infrastructures  every device could potentially endanger the whole system.  Based on the analysis of the drivers for certification and the market situation, it is found that the following devices  are most critical for certification in each sector: For Energy - Electricity, smart meters and Intelligent Electronic  Devices (IED); for health care, Clinical Information Systems (CIS); for ICT: firewalls, routers and switches; for  transport – railway, Automatic Train Protection (ATP); and for transport – maritime, Integrated Bridge Systems  (IBS).  The following common key recommendations are determined for these sectors:   Organisations should strive for certifying their management system because it is a powerful tool that helps  companies to achieve their business goals. Process certification and compliance is vital to support product  quality, and it is often a ticket to the market. For markets large enough, product manufacturers can test and  certify their products only once as they can have them accepted in many other markets or countries  thereafter3.   Both vendors and asset owners should take a holistic view when it comes to security certification and not  merely focus on the functional element of the devices they use. Only after verification of a system in its  entirety, including procedures for operation and maintenance, it can be considered cyber secure.   Organisations should invest more on improving the cyber security education of their engineers. This is  because they usually do not have cyber security culture as they are often confronted with new technologies,  or other domains unknown to them, until it is too late to adopt mitigation measures. Therefore, they need  to be educated, to become aware of cyber risks and to realize that the system is as strong as each individual  component, and that actions and decisions taken for a sub-part of the system can have a major impact on  the overall performance of the system itself.   Cyber security service providers are recommended to implement an IT service management framework in  their organizations as a proof that their services meet customers’ needs.   Whenever this is financially justified, customers should look for the use of security service providers who  provide a follow-the-sun support4 team in order to ensure maximum availability of their services.  Furthermore, they should seek for security service providers with an IT service management system which  is based on international and widely known standards e.g. ITIL, ISO/IEC 20000 etc.  3 Specific for EU Product Directives is the requirement on CE -marking the product  4 Follow-the-sun is a type of global workflow in which tasks are passed around daily between work sites that are many time  zones apart.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  07  1. Introduction  There are many challenges when it comes to voluntary EU wide certification for cyber security. The major gaps and  challenges revolve around the fragmentation and different approaches in the member states as well as the lack of  EU guidance by trusted oversight entities. The cybersecurity strategy of the European Union (EU) states the need to  develop industrial and technical resources for cybersecurity in emerging information communication technology  (ICT) environments (COM(2006)786). To realize an open, safe and secure cyberspace, the prime focus of the strategy  is “to create incentives to carry out appropriate risk management and adopt security standards and solutions, as  well as possibly establish voluntary EU-wide certification schemes building on existing schemes in the EU and  internationally” (JOIN(2013) 1) .  ENISA has been involved in the area of certification by, among others, supporting activities such as the workshop on  security certification for smart grid devices (2012), the joint EC/ENISA SOG-IS and ICT certification workshop (2014)  and the report on smart grid security certification (2014). One of the common findings of these activities was the  lack of systematic recording of the major challenges, together with the lack of a harmonized certification framework  in some critical business sectors.  Currently there exist different security standards and frameworks for certification from business sector to business  sector. Not surprisingly, business sectors differ a lot concerning the use and importance of the ICT platforms, like  type of system, components of different vendors, age, technologies and communication protocols. For instance,  there are sectors that use and require automation systems for the automation and the safety of their critical  operational processes, and disruption of these systems could lead to large societal impacts. Within other sectors,  emerging ICT is used for centralized databases, markets and for communication between companies, resulting into  a variety of interfaces between subsectors and companies. Furthermore, differences can be spotted between the  type of system used, like information technology (IT) and near real-time automation systems as operational  technology (OT). These varying ICT landscapes make it complex to develop and implement a common and widely  accepted certification framework in this area.  Consequently, there is no common approach on standards and frameworks for certification within the European  Union, and no certification program that focuses on the emerging ICT environments such as IoT, industry 4.0 etc.  This is a major issue, as specified in (JOIN(2013) 1), “lack of a well-functioning mechanism of certification” is an  inhibitor to the functioning of the European market as a whole. In line with the JOIN(2013) 1 and 2016/1148/EU,  there is the desire to have a more integrated and global digital infrastructure, as a means to support the global  European market. Accordingly, given the current situation and further developments, common cyber security  practices and certification schemes are of great importance because security certification schemes are considered  as a cyber security enabler which may:   bring transparency into the processing taking place in a complex computing environment (supporting an  answer to the “how secure” question),   align IT and Engineering personnel to common security goals,   help clean up responsibility questions (who is responsible for what?) and   accelerate a secure introduction of emerging ICT technologies.  Addressing the harmonization issue, requires an understanding of the current challenges for security certification  (the “good” reasons) and, subsequently, the identification of an implementation strategy which delivers results in a  coordinated, balanced and cost-efficient manner for the society and the industry.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  08  Objective  This report aims to provide decision makers with a thorough description of the security certification status  concerning the most impactful equipment in five different critical business sectors. Results of this study should help  to improve and harmonize the certification standards and frameworks in place, and pave the way towards a common  approach to security certification in these sectors in the EU. Finally, both current and upcoming certification schemes  will be considered while investigating the differences and similarities in the five selected critical sectors.  Methodology & deliverables  This report consists of two parts and adopts both a theoretical and empirical approach to investigate and answer  questions around the relation of certification and security. The main methods applied are desk research and an  observational study using questionnaires and interviews. Desk research was performed to collect publicly available  existing standards and frameworks for certification, and to identify existing certification practices and challenges in  the selected sectors. Of great help in selecting the areas of interest was the ENISA report on identification of critical  infrastructure assets and services (JOIN(2013) , 2016/1148/EU).  Subsequently, a questionnaire was developed to identify challenges, needs, success stories and lessons learned of  certification in the selected sectors. This questionnaire was used during interviews with experts of the selected  sectors, after a careful identification of a list of experts from the relevant stakeholders within the selected sectors.  The information gathered from the experts was used to validate the desk research about current challenges, risks  and needs for security and conformity assurance, and collects best practices and lessons learned.  To meet the objective of the study, the following tasks were performed:   Selection of five sectors, that cover most aspects concerning the different types of ICT environments for  which conformity assessment is considered as a key enabler for the economic development.   For each sector, identification of:  o Elements of commonly used architectures  o Different conformity assessment frameworks  o Challenges to conformity assessments  o Success stories and lessons learned  o Useful conclusions on how to overcome the identified challenges   Creation of an overview of existing standards and frameworks for certification concerning critical  infrastructure protection in emerging ICT environments.  In order to be able to define clear recommendations based on the findings, the following questions need to be  answered:   What are the needs for different conformity assurance standards and techniques for each sector?   What are different conformity assessments types for each sector?   Which organizations are relevant to security certifications in each sector and what is their relationship?   What is the role of existing international and European standards towards a harmonized certification  approach?   What are the main challenges facing the existing standards, guidelines, regulations and certification  programs?   What are the main incentives and barriers for developing the market of security certifications in Europe?  Results of this research have led to a clear overview of the challenges and the gaps in cyber security certification  schemes.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  09  Target audience  This report provides relevant information and recommendations for the Member States involved in defining  certification schemes and the development of test programs of components in critical infrastructures. Furthermore  this report is of interest to asset owners and operators engaged in securing or selecting secure component by  providing an overview of existing components used today in critical infrastructures and possible existing certification  schemes and standards.  Structure of this document  This report is structured as follows. Chapter 2 outlines which sectors are selected for further investigation. The  subsequent chapters 3 – 7 are organized by sector and provide an overview and main findings of the sectors namely  energy – electricity, health care, ICT, transportation – railway and transportation – water transport respectively.  Finally, chapter 8 presents common findings and key recommendations.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  10  2. Selected sectors  The latest Network Information Systems (NIS) directive gives an overview of sectors and subsectors that are seen as  essential services. According to the NIS directive (2016/1148/EU), an essential service is an asset or system which is  essential for the maintenance of vital societal functions. Damage to essential services, their destruction or disruption  by natural disasters, terrorism, criminal activity or malicious behavior, may have a significant negative impact on the  security of the EU and the well-being of its citizens.  The selection of the sectors for this study, is based on the results of the ENISA study on the identification of critical  infrstructures1. The following sectors and subsectors have been selected, using the naming convention as used in  the NIS directive:   Energy – Electricity   Information and Communications Technology5   Health Care   Transportation – Rail transport   Transportation – Water transport  Each sector is described in more detail in the following chapters 3 – 7 by providing a general overview of the  sector, identification of the most impactful devices (that most likely require certification), and findings on  certification drivers, best practices and recommendations to harmonize the cyber security approach in the EU.  Accordingly, the following information is presented for each sector:  GENERAL INFORMATION  Description  A short overview about the product, what is it doing, what is it used for  etc.  Products  An overview of products that have been certified or assessed by these  practices  Candidate products  An overview of products that could potentially be certified or assessed  targeting these practices  Documents  A list of the standards, technical reports, sets of rules, boundaries, etc.  that can be applied for certification of products  Certification authority  The authority that defines the certification rules and issues the final  certificate upon successful completion of testing that issues a certificate  Regulatory authority The entity that setup and regulates the certification scheme  Certification schemes/frameworks  The methodology and rules by which a certificate is granted to who  undertakes the process (only for existing)  5 It should be noted that the NIS directive does not state ICT. Sector ICT has been selected, because it fulfills an important role  by providing critical devices to each of these sectors.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  11  Certification drivers and issues  Certification drivers  The following items6 are considered when identifying certification drivers:   System criticality (does a Cyber Security attack imply a critical  damage?)   Number of devices (is it in every house?)   Safety issues (does it affect people lives?)   Security issues (does a Cyber Security attack endanger  people/country security?)   Access vector (is it connected to the internet?)   Environmental issues (does a Cyber Security attack endanger the  environment?)   Intersystem dependencies (does a Cyber Security attack indirectly  affect a connected system)   Regulations (does the law mandate a certification scheme?)  Recommendations  A list of advice on what can be improved or addressed in the whole environment.  6 Only the items which exist at the time of writing this report appear in the certification key drivers’ analysis tables per each  device. Those who are empty are omitted from the analysis in order to avoid unnecessary duplications.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  12  3. Energy - Electricity  The energy electricity sector’s main activities are electricity generation and the delivery of this generated electricity  to the various customers. Currently the energy sector experiences an energy transition from a fossil fuel based and  centralized generation towards a more renewable and decentralized generation. This transition has a strong impact  on the network infrastructure and related cyber security-related requirements. Figure 1 gives and overview of the  current energy value chain with its major components.  In the centralized system, the energy is produced by the power plants and delivered through the transmission and  distribution grid to the customers, so ‘from left to right’ in the figure. The current energy infrastructure deals  increasingly with bidirectional power flows.  Figure 1 The energy power value chain  Generation, transmission and distribution are physical processes that execute the energy conversion and delivery to  the customers. These processes are highly automatized by Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)  systems, Energy Management Systems (EMS), Distribution Management Systems (DMS) and Grid Management  Systems (GMS). Besides automation of the individual processes, the grid is automated to stabilize the frequency and  voltage levels to prevent black-outs. This is the responsibility of the Transmission System Operators (TSO). This  control requires real-time communication interfaces between different ICT systems both within the companies and  between the companies active in the electricity sector.  Emerging ICT infrastructure has been observed in all active components across the energy power value chain as  depicted in Figure 1. Devices like Intelligent Electronic Devices (IED), Remote Terminal Units (RTU), data  concentrators, data historians, and others communicate within the value chain all the way down to the customers,  i.e. the (smart) meters. Besides, as well the supporting IT systems that facilitate the production and distribution of  electricity are involved, like energy trading and metering. The communication standards and interfaces in this sector  are among others IEC 60870-5, IEC 61850, TASE.2/ICCP and DLMS.  The energy sector is a large sector with complex ICT usage and requirements, wherein a lot of standards and  frameworks have been defined and are being used. It can be stated that the energy sector faces a lot of challenges  regarding certification schemes and practices.  Desk Research  The energy sector is highly automated with multiple centralized and decentralized OT systems in power plants and  substations. IT and OT overlap and intertwine to deal with the future electricity market and demands. Reliability of  the power supply us essential for several reasons. Figure 2 shows a global the global infrastructure of the energy  sector. It shows this sector is largely depending on subsectors.

Especially, the operational systems, performing monitoring and control of the physical power system,  can be targeted to create a black-out which has big impact on society.  The following devices are relying on high-speed and secure infrastructures to function properly and are considered  essential for a correct and reliable functioning of the electrical grid:   Intelligent Electronic Devices   Remote Terminal Units   Smart Meter communication   AMI components   Virtual Power Plants  3.1.1 Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs)  Description IEDs are devices based upon a microcontroller, an operating system and a functional  application and are responsible for monitoring, control and protection of electrical assets  or primary components.

In addition,  measurements and process information generated in the remote location is processed  for transmission to the central location. The centrally located operators require  correct information in order to make important decisions to maintain the stability of  the remote sub-grids. Instable sub-grids may cause an instability to the whole grid.  When there is no communication with the remote locations, it is necessary to have  staff on-site remotely.

Findings  Within the energy sector the rise of ICT systems is eminent. IEDs, RTUs, data concentrators, data historians, and  other devices communicate within the value chain all the way down to the customers, i.e. the (smart) meters. The  supporting IT systems – the ones that facilitate both the production and distribution of electricity, and the sales and  settlement of energy – are interconnected. The most important communication standards and interfaces in this area  are: IEC 60870-5, IEC 61850, TASE.2/ICCP and DLMS.  3.2.1 Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs)  3.2.1.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is high because IEDs are installed in most substations and operate autonomously based  upon locally acquired process information or via a local process controller. Remote commands issued from  the central location are received through an interface between the central and remote location which  implies that a third party can control the critical assets connected to the IEDs. So especially when multiple  IEDs are compromised and malfunction this could cause local outages and even a complete blackout.   Number of devices: varies based on the voltage level and capacity of the substation   Safety issues: of severe impact because both a local outage and a blackout could cause several safety issues  including interrupted life-support and dialysis machines, stopped elevators, electronic lock-ins, heating or  cooling issues depending on the season.   Security issues: of severe impact in case of a longer lasting blackout, as it could interrupt critical systems  used for national security beyond the capacity of UPS’s and emergency generators.   Access vector: is limited because IEDs are normally not directly connected to public network infrastructures  like the internet.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  17   Intersystem dependencies: are high, since data is communicated and sharing between IEDs, substations and  control centers.  3.2.1.2 Findings  Station and process networks are normally designed as a standalone network. IEDs are interconnected within the  same substation without direct connection to other systems outside the substation. Depending on the voltage level  there is connectivity with the outside world using a RTU, gateway or proxy, this is done using public and private  networks. Due to the standalone nature of the network the need for certification within the substation is lower as  compared to the equipment connected to public infrastructures. Existing conformance test schemes do not include  compliance testing of cyber security aspects on device level.  3.2.1.3 Recommendations  End-users would like to see that IEC 61850 is extended with specific parts related to security for IEDs (IEC 62351 and  IEC62443 test procedures) and the used communication protocols instead of vendor specific solutions that prove to  be non-interoperable. It is recommended that the UCA International Users Group (UCAIug) incorporate testing  cyber security aspects on devices in the existing conformance test programs.  It is recommended for asset management system to include records of the installed IEDs with the current software/  firmware versions including the used configuration tools. Without this recording it is difficult to identify the systems  that are exposed to a detected vulnerability and apply updates or execute replacement programs. Additionally, the  maintenance organization will need to have skilled engineers that can manage software/ firmware updates.  An identified good practice is to equip every substation network with an IDS to monitor the network for unexpected  activity or protocols.  3.2.2 Remote Terminal Units (RTUs)  3.2.2.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is high because RTUs act as a remote controller serving a control center which needs to  perform actions in the remote location. When the connection between the central and remote location is  compromised a malicious third party can gain access to the SCADA front-end and control the complete  SCADA system or the station RTU and has access to critical assets within the connected substation and  because malicious manipulation of the exchanged energy measurements can harm the whole network  stability   Number of devices: is high because almost all utilities use RTUs to monitor substations from a central  location.   Safety issues: of severe impact because both a local outage and a blackout could cause several safety issues  including interrupted life-support and dialysis machines, stopped elevators, electronic lock-ins, heating or  cooling issues depending on the season.   Security issues: severe security issues in case of a longer lasting blackout, as it could interrupt critical systems  used for national security beyond the capacity of UPS’s and emergency generators.   Access vector: is high because RTUs rely increasingly on communication over public network infrastructures.  Public networks are significantly more accessible than private networks.   Intersystem dependencies: are of medium size because RTUs are limited to the control of substations and  power plants7.  7  Taking into consideration a scenario where a transmission operator balances the network upon regular measurements of  the produced and consumed energy (for example like expected in the scenario of e-price).  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  18  3.2.2.2 Findings  Due to the standalone nature of substations and the network within the substation, cyber-security is currently not  perceived as a must, but attention is increasing for it: electrical utilities are getting more and more aware of the  risks associated with the use of public infrastructures for critical communication with SCADA and RTU systems. The  providers of these products are following the developments of IEC 62351 and IEC 62443, several manufacturers of  substation equipment including RTUs have started the implementation of these standards in their products. Many  of these products are in the phase of being field-tested in pilot projects.  Compliancy test procedures are still under development and will contribute to higher level of device testing before  massive deployment in substations (test procedures IEC 62351 and IEC 62443).  3.2.2.3 Recommendations  It is recommended that testing labs extend test programs to include integrated system testing.  A detailed network design before roll out is crucial to the level of cyber security of a substation network and thus  the entire substation. Manufacturers should invest more resources in improving security of these RTUs due to the  wide-spread character of these devices.  Identified good practices are the use of IPSEC between devices for a secure exchange of data, segment the network  in smaller subnets and isolate risk-areas into one domain, access control lists and the use of protocol convertors  on application level.  3.2.3 Smart meters  3.2.3.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is low because attacking a single meter does not influence the network. However, there  might be a massive attack, where meters could push plenty of wrong data to Head End System. As such,  they could be used to attack the central systems of the utility.   Number of devices: several millions of smart meters are planned to be used in all households and non- industrial businesses. The meters are developed in a multi-vendor environment, to be deployed in all EU  electricity grids. Interoperability is crucial to allow millions of devices to communicate, and the concept can  be extended to the cyber security profiles.   Safety issues: are of severe importance because some smart meter types have disconnect-switches. They  can disconnect the end-user from the electrical grid. A massive which targets the disconnection of  consumers combined with extreme climate situations, can lead to health issues or even deaths of elderly  and sick people when air conditioning or heating systems are disconnected.   Security issues: are of medium severity because alarm systems of private property could be disabled by  tampering with a meter which includes breaker functionality.   Access Vector: is medium/high because its connectivity depends on communication infrastructures in place.  Meters could be connected directly to the Head End System via GPRS, CDMA, or LTE technology, or they  could communicate (via power line carrier) to a Data Concentrator, which collects and sends the data to the  Head End System via public network. In either case, public infrastructure is used due to the high number of  devices. The meters are also equipped with a local interface for maintenance and in many countries, an  interface for in-home devices or third party devices like in-home displays and local energy management  systems.   Intersystem dependencies: are high because several metering (sub)systems depend on the smart meter:  The Head End System (i.e. the system that reads out the meters and collects the data) is connected to an  MDM (meter data management system). The MDM is connected to GIS (Geographic information system),  CRM (Customer Relation Management), and other systems. The energy consumption data collected and  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  19  transmitted by the meters is the source data to bill customers, provide network access and plays an  important role in the settlement mechanism of the whole energy market.  3.2.3.2 Findings  Conformance testing of the application layer is performed under the oversight of the DLMS user association, while  ESMIG and the SMCG are developing European specifications for smart meters and AMI. DLMS can be used with  various communication technologies including ZigBee, 3G PLC and GPRS. The standardization and conformance  testing of these communication technologies are managed by other standardization bodies.  The DLMS standard includes definitions of different security mechanisms for authentication, encryption and digital  signatures.  3.2.3.3 Recommendations  It is recommended that the DLMS user association actively updates and maintains the official conformance test  tool (CCT), since the tool set is often out date when compared to the latest revisions of the DLMS standard.  3.2.4 Advanced Meter Infrastructures (AMI)  3.2.4.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is low because attacking a single meter does not influence the network. However, there  might be a massive attack, where meters could push plenty of wrong data to Head End System. As such,  they could be used to attack the central systems of the utility.   Number of devices: several millions smart meters are planned to be used in all households and non- industrial businesses. The meters are developed in a multi-vendor environment, to be deployed in all EU  electricity grids. Interoperability is crucial to allow millions of devices to communicate, and the concept can  be extended to the cyber security profiles.   Safety issues: are of severe importance because some smart meter types have disconnect-switches. They  can disconnect the end-user from the electrical grid. A massive which targets the disconnection of  consumers combined with extreme climate situations, can lead to health issues or even deaths of elderly  and sick people when air conditioning or heating systems are disconnected.   Security issues: of medium severity because alarm systems of private property could be disabled by  tampering with a meter which includes breaker functionality.    Access Vector: is medium because its connectivity depends on communication infrastructures in place.  Meters could be connected directly to the Head End System via GPRS, CDMA, or LTE technology, or they  could communicate (via power line carrier) to a Data Concentrator, which collects and sends the data to the  Head End System via public network. In either case, public infrastructure is used due to the high number of  devices. The meters are also equipped with a local interface for maintenance and in many countries, an  interface for in-home devices or third party devices like in-home displays and local energy management  systems.   Intersystem dependencies: are high because several metering (sub)systems depend on the smart meter:  The Head End System (i.e. the system that reads out the meters and collects the data) is connected to an  MDM (meter data management system). The MDM is connected to GIS (Geographic information system),  CRM (Customer Relation Management), and other systems. The energy consumption data collected and  transmitted by the meters is the source data to bill customers, provide network access and plays an  important role in the settlement mechanism of the whole energy market.  3.2.4.2 Findings  The architecture of the smart metering infrastructure varies from country to country with the use of different  applications (i.e. DLMS, Meters and More or OSGP), different communication technologies and different regulatory  requirements.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  20  3.2.4.3 Recommendations  Current conformance schemes are focusing solely on the smart meter side, and do not cover the other components  inside the AMI. It is recommended that certification organizations extend the scheme with test cases for DLMS  based data concentrators and head-end-systems.  3.2.5 Virtual Power Plants (VPP)  3.2.5.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is high, because both the flow of electricity and the related information is critical for the  grid stability. Incorrect information from the VPP in regards to its generation could create instabilities in  frequency control causing outages of the grid and cause a blackout due to unbalance.   Number of devices: varies on the local electrical infrastructure   Safety issues: of severe importance because a local outage could cause several safety issues including  interrupted life-support and dialysis machines, stopped elevators, electronic lock-ins, heating or cooling  issues depending on the season.   Security issues: of severe severity in case of a longer lasting blackout, as it could interrupt critical systems  used for local security beyond the capacity of UPS’s and emergency generators.   Access vector: is high, since VPPs communicate using the public infrastructure.  3.2.5.2 Findings  Currently the VHP ready standard is not mature and finalized yet, therefore there is currently no compliance scheme  available. It is currently focusing on security rules and best practices imposed by other standards like IEC 62351.  3.2.5.3 Recommendations  It is recommended to integrate the cyber security rules and standards focusing on power systems, such as IEC  62351, in the VPP certification scheme.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  21  4. Sector: Health Care  Healthcare environment is a vast ecosystem comprised by numerous components. Collaboration among various  stakeholders, numerous interconnected assets and high flexibility requirements do not only lead to complexity and  dynamics but also to blurred organisational boundaries. At the same time, personal health information is deemed  even more valuable than financial information and, apart from access to sensitive information, access to prescription  drugs or possession of expensive medical devices may also be considered worthwhile by attackers. Consequently,  information security is a key issue for healthcare organisations.  To enable swift, correct and complete exchange of information both among specialists and physicians inside the  hospital walls , and physicians with third parties (i.e. insurance companies), ICT  is offering great variety of solutions  and products.  Both the patient data confidentiality and integrity  are very important to ensure that the information  is kept secure and only available to authorized parties while the data needs to be trusted and acted upon. Figure 3  gives an overview of the different components in the health care sector.  The ICT environment of the health care sector consists mostly of suysstems and devices to record, analyse and share  information. However, mainly within hospitals, automation of clinical systems and medical equipment (OT) are  available, to improve the health care provision to the patients.  Safety and availability are important factors for hospitals, and the increasing dependency on ICT systems, means  that any failure will have a great impact on their operation.  Another major issue affecting cyber security in the case of healthcare is the lifespan of medical devices and  equipment. Medical devices like CAT scanners, MRI machines etc can stay as part of a hospital for more than a  decade. This means that new vulnerabilities arise as attackers become more sophisticated. Moreover this shows  that intensive focus should be given in the patching and updating management of these devices. The very thin line  between usability and security is becoming now more transparent as patching comes second (or even lower) in  priority especially as the machines might need to be available at any given moment.  In the healthcare landscape the priority is the life of the patient; seldom are the cases were a physician would follow  all the security procedures attached to medical devices if in case of emergency. These users are made to create  workarounds and this was realized early enough. To increase safety and availability, many procedures were put in  place to mitigate human errors and workarounds.  For all the reasons presented above standardization and the requirement for security certification in medical devices  and systems will increase.  Desk Research  Within the health care sector, both data exchange and storage of health information are becoming increasingly  important. . Inside a hospital many systems are interconnected in order to exchange information and patient’s data;  in some cases this can exceed the hospital’s walls.  Contrary to the energy sector, the health sector has relatively limited (connected) OT systems as the main systems  are administrative. The ICT landscape is complex due to the existence of various systems from multiple vendors and  different lifespans. From this perspective, it is important having security certification in place to secure and protect  the medical equipment, the patients’ data and the administrative systems. Figure 3 shows a generic health care  provision architecture with all relevant devices.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  22  The following systems are considered the most favorable for security certification:   Interconnected clinical information system, which include:  o hospital information system,  o lab information system,  o picture archiving and control system  o radiology information system,  o pharmacy information systems,  o pathology information systems,  o blood bank and  o research info system.   Networked medical devices which include:  o wearable medical devices,  o Implantable medical devices,  o stationary medical devices,  o mobile medical devices,  o supportive devices.  4.1.1  Interconnected clinical information system  Description Large and complex information systems and tools which are the foundation of  hospitals and medical institutes core administrative and medical-support processes.

When ICT systems fail it is possible  that hospitals cannot take in any patients anymore. Hospitals are more and more subject to ransomware infections.  Furthermore, the medical equipment is also able to be connected to the IT network. Remote operation and  monitoring improves the efficiency of the health care. It also implicitly creates extra risks to these medical devices.  Safety and availability is important for hospitals and human errors are already mitigated by procedures. That means  that standardization and the requirement for security certification will increase. That holds for the central databases  and functionality as well. The lack of Role Based Access Control even if in the hospital terminals people having  different roles can access the same data.  4.2.1 Interconnected clinical information system  4.2.1.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is high because the system contains all relevant information needed to run a hospital or a  clinic   Number of devices: is limited because the machines hosting the information are powerful and centralized.   Safety issues: are of high importance because when information is tampered, altered or deleted this can  lead to wrong decisions or no information on a patient.   Access vector: is high because it is a pure IT system with many entry points and it is implemented via a public  communications infrastructure  4.2.1.2 Findings  The criticality of the system is high, because unavailability has a direct impact on the provision of care, even in  situations where protocols apply to work without access to the information system.  Database systems used in clinical networked information systems are based upon different technologies and  providers, they do not share a common (architectural) model or interface between the different components, the  lack of standardization leads to difficulties and additional costs when databases need to be integrated.  4.2.1.3 Recommendations  The definition of a common data-model and profiles regarding authentication and protection of data will realize an  information system used by member states that allow a standardized way of data exchange.  4.2.2 Networked medical devices  4.2.2.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is high because attack on an implantable medical device has no direct impact on a larger  system but only on the actual component   Number of devices: are many because the use of this type of devices gets spread and common   Safety issues: are of high importance because acting on the embedded application running in the device it  will put the patient at risk   Access vector: is high because communication interfaces are active and allow remote access  4.2.2.2 Findings  Many implantable medical devices have already wireless capabilities. Patients and care providers are becoming more  and more security aware. Lack of standardization have triggered concerns and raised questions whether products  fulfills safety and security standards like the ISO80001.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  25  4.2.2.3 Recommendations  The basis for a secure product comes from good engineering practices and proper risk management, instead of  focusing on device security the product developer shall be subject to applicable security and development standards  like the Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC) approach (Davis, 2005).  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  26  5. Sector: Information and Communications Technology  The ICT sector’s main products are software, including firmware, databases and digital certificates, and hardware  such as routers, firewalls, switches, servers and workstations. The usage of these generic components is increasing  at all (process) automation levels in all sectors, which is mainly due to cheaper prices and component  standardisation. In the context of this report, the ICT sector can be divided in the following subsectors:   Network device manufactures   Chip manufactures   Software manufactures   Process automation software manufactures   Support and maintenance companies  Unlike the rest of the sectors, ICT is not an essential service in itself in the terminology of NIS directive, but it supports  other essential services. Accordingly, the ICT infrastructure can be considered as cross cutting component, since it  delivers products and services to the other essential services. This requires specific certification criteria defined by  these sectors, while within the ICT business area a lot of frameworks and standards exist that are widely used for  development, maintenance, manufacturing and support activities. Therefore, it is important to understand that the  scope of the ICT for this study is on end-products.  The ICT infrastructures used by different NIS essential services, heavily depend on network and computing  equipment. The focus within this study will be on the (generic) network and computing devices produced within the  ICT. In this study the widely accepted security requirements will be considered: availability, confidentiality,  authenticity, and integrity.  Desk Research  For this study, ICT provides the necessary equipment and functionality to create the required automation in both  the IT and OT world. ICT equipment, like network components and servers are more and more standardized and  become cheaper and more powerful every year. The use of common ICT components is done at all levels within  complex computing environments. Standardization of network communication is adopted at every automation layer  and enables the possibility to interconnect components, systems and make the bridge between the OT and the IT  world.  ICT components like routers and switches are critical for the correct operation of any system. Security certification  on these impactful devices contributes to the overall security and reliability of the ICT system and the operational  environment it supports. Furthermore, many applications and system depend on correct functioning encryption  mechanisms, in order to use these systems, digital certificates need to be generated, maintained and managed. To  create digital certificates which are compliant with relevant standards and can be safely used in any system made  by any manufacturer the certification of Hardware Security Modules becomes relevant. ICT components that will  require security certification are: switches / routers, firewalls, Hardware Security Modules, Unidirectional Network  Systems and next generation firewalls.

Common ICT equipment, like network components and servers are more and more standardized and become  cheaper and more powerful every year. The use of common ICT components is done at all levels within a complex  industrial environment.  Standardization of network communication is adopted at every automation layer and enables the possibility to  interconnect components, systems and make the bridge between the OT and the IT world. Common ICT components  like routers and switches are critical for correct operation of any system. Certification of these impactful devices  contributes to the overall security and reliability of the OT and IT system.  Therefore, ICT infrastructure is considered to be a (critical) horizontal (cross sector) element which requires  certification on a high level of trustworthiness. Delivery of ICT equipment, software and services to the rest of the  business areas requires specific certification criteria defined within these areas. ICT area is large and diverse;  therefore, it is important to narrow down the scope of ICT for the study.  The study focused on the following common ICT components that play a crucial role in the rest of the ICT landscape:   Routers and switches   Firewalls including next generation firewalls   Unidirectional network system   Hardware Security Modules   Key generation software  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  30   Digital certificates  More information on the specific findings related to the mentioned ICT components can be found below.  5.2.1 Routers and switches  5.2.1.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is high due to the fact that when switches are not working securely there will be no reliable  and secure communication between devices or between networks which will endanger the stability of the  supporting application or function.   Number of devices: are many because every network requires one or more switches   Safety issues: are many because insecure communications in an OT environment can lead to interruption of  critical infrastructures or applications   Security issues: are many because insecure communications in an OT environment can lead to interruption  of critical infrastructures or applications   Access vector: is high because the switch is reachable via the network   Intersystem dependencies: are high because attacking a network switch or router all connected end-devices  will be affected  5.2.1.2 Findings  There is limited market demand for certified networking equipment in OT environments on routers and switches to  be tested and certified against specific security standards. Often the only mandatory requirements are to be suitable  for industrial environments, the support of specific management protocols like SNMP and the support of encryption.  5.2.1.3 Recommendations  Incorporation of security standards in product certification and type-testing is essential to ensure that used network  equipment is meeting cyber security standards. End-users also identified that security assessments (when  equipment is in operation) to verify compliance to security standards is crucial. These assessments shall be  periodically planned and executed and when changes to the system are made (for example firmware or  configuration changes).  Furthermore, for network components a patch management system and procedures need to be in place, both at the  vendor side and at the user side. Crucial to the stability and security of a complex system is also centralized  monitoring and management.  5.2.2 Firewalls  5.2.2.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is high because remote access to a system or domain might not be possible anymore, but  autonomous systems will remain available with access controls   Number of devices: are many because private and public networks use firewalls to protect the network from  attacks and to control who has access to the network   Safety issues: are of high importance because remote control and operation will not be available due to an  outage of the component but the stability and reliability of the connected systems will not be affected   Security issues:  are of high severity because the firewall controls the access to the network   Access vector: varies depending on the network topology. Firewalls are connected to many different type  of network infrastructures and have an effect on the overall stability of a complex system.   Intersystem dependencies: are high because by attacking a firewall all connected end-devices will be  affected  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  31  5.2.2.2 Findings  For firewalls the same conclusion applies to network switches and routers, there is limited market demand for  certified network equipment in OT environments.  For firewalls patch management is also a critical issue, exploits are publicly available and therefore OT firewalls will  require a faster patch cycle, this will have impact on the uptime and availability of the OT system.  There is limited request from the market to ask for routers, switches and firewalls to be tested and certified against  specific security standards. Often the only mandatory requirements are to be suitable for industrial environments,  the support of specific management protocols like Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and the support  of encryption.  5.2.2.3 Recommendations  Audits, functional testing and compliance testing of firewalls should be planned and executed together with other  active network components, like the aforementioned switches and routers. There are risks that firewalls can be  bypassed because of misconfigured switches and routers or even become unavailable due to high loads of network  traffic in case of a Denial of Service (DOS) attack.  Audits on the existing rule base should be performed to ensure that all firewall rules are up to date, validated and  functional before applying rules to production firewalls. Firewalls with build-in Intruder Detection Systems (IDS)  and/or Intruder Prevention Systems (IPS) should be subject to the same audits, to reduce the risk of false positives  due to less known OT traffic and/or protocols.  Make use of role-based-access to ensure that people or devices with access to the system cannot compromise the  overall system. In case of a security-event only limited parts of the system are affected.  A good practice is to use different firewall brands or products for the IT and OT infrastructure, in case a vulnerability  is detected this will not compromise the complete line of defense.  5.2.3 Hardware security modules  5.2.3.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is high because compromise of an HSM will reduce the trust to public key infrastructure  supported by the keys issued by the compromised HSM   Number of devices: is high because every device implementing cryptography might rely on an HSM to secure  its applications   Security issues: are of high severity because a comprised HSM reduces trust in the complete public key  infrastructure   Access vector: is low because HSM is a critical asset with limited access by unauthorized users   Intersystem dependencies: are low for typical ICT infrastructures but very high for applications which use  digital keys  5.2.3.2 Findings  Should an organization decides to deploy a PKI, then the correct design and setup of this infrastructure, including  the HSM, becomes critical. In case of a security event related to the HSM the entire HSM needs to be replaced which  is a major effort.  5.2.3.3 Recommendations  Failure of the HSM will lead to unavailability of the provision of digital keys. Therefore, it should be placed in a  separate environment that can be accessed by a limited number of people. When used in critical process automation  environments redundancy concept are needed to meet the availability requirements.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  32  5.2.4 Unidirectional network system  5.2.4.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is high because unidirectional network devices are mostly used to secure, separate and  protect critical networks, however compromising these devices will not lead to bi-directional  communication due to the physical design of the hardware   Number of devices: is low because separation and protection of network segments will require only two  redundant unidirectional network systems   Security issues: are of low importance because the device has physically blocked bi-directional data flow   Access vector: is low because the device will operated in a protected environment with access by only be  limited authorized persons   Intersystem dependencies: are low because a unidirectional network system does not depend on other  systems.  5.2.4.2 Findings  Unidirectional network devices are not widely used yet. Within critical automation environments these devices are  used more and more to separate for example office networks from process networks.  5.2.4.3 Recommendations  Because of the emerging characteristic of the unidirectional network device, it is required to make sure it is well  designed and bi-directional data must be made physically impossible. Appropriate configuring, testing and  implementation is important. Before widely used it should be part of a certification plan while it plays an important  part to secure interfaces of connected networks.  5.2.5 Next generation firewall  5.2.5.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is high because it provides more protection compared to a traditional firewall and protects  against known and unknown attacks by monitoring the network traffic   Number of devices: expected to be many because a next generation firewall (NGF) could be used in each  network interconnection (for example in demilitarized zones (DMZ))   Security issues: are of severe importance because a NGF is highly configurable and mistakes are easy to  make, compromising this device could lead to undetectable attacks   Access vector: is low because NGF is a critical asset with limited access by unauthorized users   Intersystem dependencies: are high because by attacking a NGF all connected end-devices will be affected  5.2.5.2 Findings  A Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) is an integrated network platform that is a part of the third generation of firewall  technology, combining a traditional firewall with other network device filtering functionalities, such as an application  firewall using in-line deep packet inspection (DPI), an intrusion prevention system (IPS). The goal of next-generation  firewalls is to include more layers of the OSI model, improving filtering of network traffic that is dependent on the  packet contents (Rossi 2012).  Next generation firewalls provide a lot more protection and will be increasingly used within IT and OT networks. For  operational systems, NGFWs could provide high detection of anomalies due to the fact the OT systems are highly  predictable.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  33  5.2.5.3 Recommendations  At least one of the firewall in the DMZ should be a next generation firewall. For operational systems this type of  firewall could be used to detect anomalies. A NGF should be part of a continuous monitoring and update process to  ensure the NGF meets all the operational and process requirements.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  34  6. Sector: Transportation – Railway  The Railway sector’s main activity is the transportation of passengers and goods using a fixed track infrastructure.  The railway infrastructure usually is a shared common infrastructure that is used by different railway companies.  Most railway infrastructures are able to provide electric power to the locomotive. Not all locomotives depend on  electric power, they can also depend on diesel engines for example. A variety of trains can make use of this shared  track.  Trains are vehicles operated by a driver or by automated systems in closed loop environments for example on  airports. Currently, the railway sector uses the following ICT functionality to manage the transport:   Central monitoring and control   Safety systems   Signaling and control systems   Traffic control and communication   Logistic optimization   Passenger information (real-time)   Ticketing, billing and check   On-Board communication   On-Board surveillance   Asset management (vehicles and infrastructure)   Digital tickets  Rail transportation contain large informational and operational systems. Informational systems used to provide their  customers with real-time information. Operational systems are focused on the safety of the track to make sure no  collisions will occur and obstacles are on the track. Within the passenger trains conductors need to check the valid  passes of the passengers. Digital tickets are used more often which require a reliable and available infrastructure.  Figure 5 Overview of railway systems  Attacks on operational systems could lead to disruption or unavailability of the rail transport itself. When  informational systems are attacked it can lead to unavailability of services for the passenger, like being unable to  buy a ticket or digitally check a ticket into the system. Railway is an important way of transportation and could lead  to disruption of the society.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  35  Since transportation is part of the backbone supporting every country, many economies and business sectors will  stop functioning without proper transportation in place. Consequently, cyber-attacks on transportation systems,  which is a major threat, create a large impact on society and people’s daily life. Besides direct effects, like delays,  accidents, injuries or even deaths, it can lead to indirect effects, like socioeconomic effects.  Currently there is no  standardized approach to address security guidelines in the transportation sector. The NIS Directive addresses  elements to reporting of cyber security related issues or events, but it does not address the matter of a standardized  testing and certification approach.  Desk Research  The transportation sector consists of several subsectors like rail and maritime transport and aviation, and in all these  sectors ICT plays an important role. The destruction of the transportation infrastructure will have immediate effect  on people and economy. Figure 6 shows a general architecture of the rail transportation system. In the rail subsector  the role of the infrastructure provider as well as the transportation company using the infrastructure are equally  important to protect the subsector against cyber-attacks.

The maritime sub area is highly standardized and legislated compared to the other sub areas. Logistics and planning  systems play an important role within the maritime sub areas and here different ICT systems depend on always-on  and real-time information delivery from connected components and other systems. Furthermore, the consistency  and reliability of the information is of great importance.  In the rail sub area, the role of the infrastructure provider as well as the transportation company using the  infrastructure are equally important to protect the sub area against cyber-attacks. The wellbeing and functioning of  the city depends on a correct working transportation system.  6.2.1 Automatic train protection (ATP)  6.2.1.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is high because it takes care of critical transportation functions and malfunction may cause  severe accidents which jeopardize human life or nature (in chemical transportation for example).   Number of devices: is high because these systems are used all over in Europe   Safety issues: are of severe importance because security vulnerabilities discovered can allow attacker to  control railway automation which will jeopardize people safety and nature.   Security issues: many security issues because system functionality can be modified or controlled by an  attacker to cause an accident   Access vector: is high therefore there are well known attack vectors, such as:  o Safety system has several security weaknesses, including the ability to control the device without  authentication, and the use of known protocols such as XML over HTTP, which makes it possible to  create tools for controlling the device.  o Product has fail-safe software controller which automation tasks include also fail-safe control  functions and parallel data processing and the integration of the user's own technological functions.  Devices used in railway systems can be exposed to attacks due to the use of default credentials  because security features are not there or they are not taken into use, such as RCE vulnerabilities.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  38   Environmental issues: are of severe importance because if system is hacked or it cannot handle malware  infection it might start to function wrong way and cause severe accident which might affect to nature as  well in case of chemical transportation.  6.2.1.2 Findings  Industrial controllers are used as part of safety systems like ATP all over the railway systems in the EU. The controllers  allow for simple implementation of safety systems on PC-based solutions, like the train protection system SIBAS  which is widely adopted for use in Europe. The new ERTMS system make use of open standards and will gradually  replace legacy systems in use within Europe.  6.2.1.3 Recommendations  ATP systems shall be evaluated via conformance testing and system testing to ensure the devices follow up the rules  set up in standards. Automation systems securing needs also architectural based solutions like segregation and  network flow surveillance (E.g. IDS), good configuration management, patching but also communication with other  devices should be inspected carefully.  6.2.2 Computer based interlocking (CBI)  6.2.2.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is medium because attacks against CBI can be conducted by a malicious actor who has  physical access to the system or by using social engineering.   Number of devices: is high because devices are used all over Europe.   Safety issues: are of high impact because when an attacker has knowledge about railway automation or  routing protocols, access to the system can be reused to re-route trains and cause conflicting routes resulting  in collisions are crashes.   Security issues: are of medium severity because when the systems fail the driver is available to take control  and prevent incidents.   Access vector: is high because public networks are used   Environmental issues: are of high impact because chemical train accidents might cause severe issues   Intersystem dependencies: are of medium size.  6.2.2.2 Findings  Many standard off-the-shelf products are used, all running standard operating system hardware and using common  communication protocols like TCP/IP, soap based web services. Adequate patch-management and version control  are not in place.  6.2.2.3 Recommendations  Cyber security should be evaluated via conformance testing, penetration testing and inspected that devices follow  up the rules set up in standards. Standards also should be different for automation devices than IT systems and  environment. Automation systems are not set up same way as IT systems and their configuration, and  communication with other devices should be inspected carefully.  Adequate cyber security training and information security awareness should be conducted regularly, to take care of  password policies and avoid human based mistakes. Device security testing and overall system hardening to prevent  attack vectors need to be done.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  39  6.2.3 Communication equipment based upon GSM-R  6.2.3.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is high because the communication is the backbone for all other connected systems in or  around the trains   Number of devices: many devices that are installed within Europe   Security issues: are of high severity because of the number of devices in the field a vulnerability will have a  major impact   Access vector: is medium because the networks are operated privately and there is limited connectivity with  public infrastructures   Environmental issues: are many because any intentional or unintentional cyber related activity can  jeopardize safety if vulnerability in system can cause malfunction and affect to train operations. However, if  connection is lost it stops train   Intersystem dependencies: are high because an attack via other systems such as via mobile phones is  possible but European Train Control System (ETCS) automatically stop if the connection between the train  and the control center is interrupted  6.2.3.2 Findings  GSM-R SIM cards and modems are used to connect trains to control centers and therefore have important role in  security. Even though SIM cards are encrypted it is always possible to cause jamming attack in order to prevent train  and the control center communication9. For example, a train using the European Train Control System (ETCS) will  stop if the connection is lost between train and control center.  This can cause issues when the train start moving  again with wrong time schedules and cause a collision. Furthermore, the lack of policies or best practices on using  non-standard PIN are problematic, when the default PINs are used and devices are managed via SMS it is easy to get  access.  Firmware updates cause another risk, in GSM-R devices. Also the firmware can include hardcoded private keys for  SSL certificates and remote admin rights when a man-in-the-middle type attack can be done. Also key management  will cause security issues. Because there are modems used for GSM-R that could also be vulnerable to the types of  mobile phone type of attacks.  6.2.3.3 Recommendations  Even though systems were separated from the Internet, security holes, wrong configuration and inadequate  hardening might offer attack vector, also radio frequency type attacks are possible to conduct if weak encryption is  in use.  Proper version and configuration management systems shall be in place, together with PIN management to avoid  the problematic use of standard PIN codes.  It is important to evaluate railway systems security as a whole, because weaknesses in communications between  other trains might cause collisions. Even though systems were separated from the Internet, security holes, wrong  configuration and inadequate hardening might offer attack vector, also radio frequency type attacks are possible to  conduct if weak encryption is in use.  9 Vulnerabilities in GSM-R have been extensively covered by the 32C3 conference talk “The Great Train Cyber Robbery\",  27/12/2015, available at  http://www.slideshare.net/AlexanderTimorin/the-great-train-cyber-robbery-scadastrangelove.

Sector: Transportation – Water transport  The water transport area consists of offshore and onshore systems which include management, communication  systems and operational systems that perform navigational and automation purposes. Within this report, the focus  is given to the vessel within the Maritime sector. Figure 7 gives an overview of the vessel’s systems and its onshore  connection. In a sense the ship behaves as a floating island operated through interacting IT and OT systems. A large  variety of systems are required, such as electric power generation, electric power distribution, vessel motion control,  automatic navigation track-keeping, safety systems, stability systems, IT networks, control (OT) networks, internet  connection, etc. The combination of these different systems makes it a complex computing environment.  Shipping of goods within Europe is still increasing and represents more than half of the maritime transport that is  carried out. Furthermore, maritime shipping increasingly relies on ICT to optimize operations and enable essential  maritime operations; navigation, propulsion, traffic control management, etc. Due to the increasing ICT, the  maritime sector becomes more vulnerable to cyber threats. As the maritime area is critical for the European society  (2016/1148/EU), significant cyber-attacks could lead to disastrous consequences on the safety, economics and the  European economy.  Figure 7 Overview of systems on a vessel  The maritime industry is continuously driving towards an increase the availability, security and reliability of the  software dependent systems, cyber security recommended practices have recently been published, describing the  first steps towards performing risk-based assessments of cyber security for the maritime assets (Dyryavyy, 2015a).  Existing standards and recommendations can give a certain level of cyber security resilience of on-board systems.  Desk Research  The maritime sector has been selected as a study focus on the vessels systems. Figure 7 shows a general architecture  of a vessel system. It shows the different devices needed for a safe and reliable operation. A vessel contains a diverse  variety of different systems, ranging from power management to propulsion and from navigation to entertainment  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  41  systems. The information technology and operational technology is increasingly interconnected. This brings more  risk of unauthorized access to these systems. Safety, environmental and commercial consequences of a cyber  incident may be significant. On board systems could include (Bimco, 2016):   Cargo management systems   Bridge systems   Propulsion and machinery management and power control systems   Access control systems   Passenger servicing and management systems   Passenger facing public networks   Administrative and crew welfare systems   Communication systems  Each of these systems play an important role on a vessel. Failure or compromising one of these systems can have  severe consequences. These systems could be considered for certification. The following four systems have been  selected for the focus of this study:   Integrated Bridge Systems (allows centralized monitoring and various navigational tools)   Cargo management systems   Passenger servicing and management systems   Propulsion and machinery management  In fo  rm a  ti o  n  T  e c h  n o  lo g  y  (  IT )  O n  b o  a rd  E n  te rp  ri s e  I T  Vessel  Intrusion  detection  Fleet  Management  Passenger  management  Crew  Entertainment  Customer  Manegement  Planning &  Logistcis  Power  Generation  Steering  HR, Finance  Navigation  Onboard  communication  O p e  ra ti o  n a  l  T e  c h n  o lo  g y  Maintenance  Booking  Systems  Mail System  Propulsion  Drainage /  pumping  Ballasting  Cargo  Management  Fire & Gas  Safety Systems  Passenger  accommodation  Auxiliary power  backup system  Watertight  integrity  Ship Admin  Systems  Passenger  entertainment  Backup  systems  Mail systen  Figure 8 Global and simplified architecture maritime vessel  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  42  7.1.1 Integrated Bridge Systems  Description Integrated Bridge Systems (IBS) is a combination of systems that are interconnected.

The maritime is well regulated internationally and uses international established standards and guidelines on  operational, design and safety topics. Logistics and planning systems play an important role within the maritime sub  areas and here different ICT systems depend on always-on and real-time information delivery from connected  components and other systems. Furthermore, the consistency and reliability of the information is of great  importance.  During the recent years, an increase of cyber-attacks has been observed within the Maritime transportation industry.  Although there has not been a catastrophic event to this date, stakeholders have taken on the task to assess this  emerging threat.  As mentioned in the 2011 ENISA study (ENISA, 2012) a holistic risk-based approach is recommended, which would  require the assessment of existing cyber risks associated with the current ICT systems implementations relevant to  the European maritime sector as well as the identification of all critical assets within this sector. For maritime  economic operators and stakeholders, it is important to proactively apply sound cyber and information security risk  management principles within their organizations and environments.  7.2.1 Integrated Bridge Systems  7.2.1.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is high because this system provides the navigational functionality of the ship   Number of devices: one per vessel (is an aggregate of several other navigational systems)   Security issues: expected to be high because it is a networked navigation system with interfaces to shore  side interfaces for updates which make this system vulnerable for cyber attacks   Access vector: expected to be high because all navigation systems within the same network are potentially  accessible by external actors either for maintenance of the software or simply has open ports.   Intersystem dependencies: are high because all associated systems for navigation will be affected like ECDIS,  GNSS, AIS, VDR and Radar/ARPA  7.2.1.2 Findings  An integrated bridge system (IBS) is a combination of interconnected systems to allow centralized access to sensor  information or monitoring/control from workstations. The aim is to increasing the safety and efficiency of the ship's  management. The details for each system boil down to integrated entities such as ECDIS, GNSS, AIS, VDR and  Radar/ARPA ECDIS, GNSS, AIS, VDR and Radar/ARPA.  7.2.1.3 Recommendations  As several navigational systems are integrated in this one integrated bridge concept, it is recommended to perform  security testing before delivery of the vessel or during operations if this step has not been performed. Software  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  45  components necessary for the operation of the integrated bridge system should be managed under configuration in  a manner to keep track of software updated and any changes to the security configuration.  7.2.2 Cargo management system  7.2.2.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is high because it performs the management and control of the cargo including hazardous  cargo   Number of devices: one system per vessel   Security issues: are of high importance because unauthorized persons could add see which (container) cargo  was loaded and subject to targeted high jacking. Other types of cargo such as LNG would pose other  hazardous threats when these dedicated types of cargo management systems would be tampered with.   Access vector: is high because the cargo system could be connected to shore-side cargo. However, the  access vector for onboard cargo management systems for bulk type cargo is limited as it is not normally  connected to the onshore systems.   Intersystem dependencies: are low because only the cargo management of the vessel will be affected.  However, information exchange with onshore system will exist.  7.2.2.2 Findings  In this section we opted to flag a publicly known incident known as the “Roman Holiday” (Szymanski, 2016): involved  an undisclosed global shipping conglomerate contacted the Verizon RISK Team after they became alarmed at a series  of attacks where the pirates were armed with very specific information in terms of the cargo onboard the vessel.  Attackers initially had uploaded a malicious Web shell to the shipping company’s Content Management System  (CMS) server, which manages shipping inventory and bills of lading for its ships.  “The threat actors used an insecure  upload script to upload the web shell and then directly call it as this directory was web accessible and had executed  permissions set on it”. This incident highlights the cargo/content management system to be important for the safe  and reliable transport operations.  7.2.2.3 Recommendations  Onshore Content Management systems should be in the scope of certified IT security management system, to be  audited and security tested.  7.2.3 Passenger servicing and management systems  7.2.3.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is high because it provides boarding and access control holding passenger related  information, as well as property management   Number of devices: one on a vessel   Security issues: are of high severity because compromising this system could lead to unauthorized access  and boarding   Access vector: is high because several systems are needed to fulfill the functionality and it could be that it  interfaces with the internet so passenger are able to check in at home for example   Intersystem dependencies: low  7.2.3.2 Findings  IMO mandatory requirements for the electronic exchange of information on cargo, crew and passengers have been  adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) on 11/04/2016. These include standardized forms for  the maximum information required for the general declaration, cargo declaration, crew list and passenger list; and  agreed essential minimum information requirements for the ship's stores declaration and crew's effects  declaration.  Although standards and recommended practices relating to stowaways are updated to include  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  46  references to relevant sections of the International Ship and Port Facilities’ Security (ISPS) Code, the ISPS audits  do not currently address the cyber security aspect of the electronic passenger lists.  7.2.3.3 Recommendations  Passenger management systems should be in the scope of IT security management policies to be audited and  security tested against cyber security standards and IMO/ISPS code.  7.2.3.4 Propulsion and machinery management  7.2.3.5 Certification drivers   System criticality: is high because it initiates the movement of the ship as commanded by captain   Number of devices: one on each vessel   Security issues: are of high importance because an attacker could control a ship when the system is  compromised   Access vector: is low because this system is normally not connected to systems outside the vessel   Intersystem dependencies: are high because this system is interconnected to bridge monitoring systems  7.2.3.6 Findings  Currently there are various research projects aiming to connect the ship’s machinery to sensors in order to improve  maintenance using Condition Based Maintenance Systems. This may lead to new types of shore based connections  which would need to be further evaluated in the future in order to consider the need for cyber security related  certifications. Nevertheless, currently machinery and propulsion systems are subject to software upgrades and  software obsolescence. Furthermore, there are projects working on autonomous and even unmanned ships that  increase the information exchange with onshore system.  7.2.3.7 Recommendations  As software destined for propulsion systems can become obsolete and thus not upgraded to address newly found  vulnerabilities, it should be designed following a defined obsolescence management policy. Network storming tests  could be a means to check for robustness and segregation practices should be used in order to isolate machinery  and propulsion networks from other non-operational networks. If vendor support remote maintenance must be  used, then strong security policies should be applied to remote maintenance operations.

Conclusions  The main research aim of this study was to provide the decision makers with a thorough description of the cyber  security certification status concerning the most impactful equipment in different critical sectors, and to pave the  way towards a more harmonized approach to cyber security certification in EU based on the results of this study.  This has been performed by undertaking desk research and interviews with experts to answer the several research  questions. Based on the results, findings and recommendations have been presented for each sector.  Here we conclude by presenting common findings which apply to multiple or even all sectors, and are related to  using public or private infrastructures and testing of complete systems versus component testing. For each common  finding a recommendation is provided. Next, key recommendations are described. Finally, a table is presented  providing a clear overview of candidates for certification that should contribute to the agenda to work towards a  more harmonized approach to cyber security certification in EU.  Common Findings  The table below provides the common findings and recommendations:  COMMON FINDING RECOMMENDATION  In each sector the use of privately owned  infrastructures for data communication between  components or complete systems is considered more  secure, however public infrastructures are widely used.  The use of these public infrastructures introduces  additional challenges to a system.  Asset owners should take mitigating measures such as  the use of separated APNs when using public cellular  networks, VPNs when non-dedicated links are used and  additional encryption and authentication.  Furthermore, it was identified that although on  component level standalone certified devices are  considered trustworthy, this might not be the case  after their integration in a real computing environment,  causing proper planning and execution of system tests  to be critical. Device certification will help to get a  generic base line of device quality in terms of cyber  security requirements. However, it should be noted  that 100% guarantee does not exist when it comes to  cyber security of complex computing systems.  Certificate issuing bodies should issue certificates which  state that the component is certified as having certain  security capabilities built-in the given device, but cannot  be used as a guarantee that this device is used  (configured) correctly.  When it comes to building cyber security resilience in  the selected sectors, it is observed that a small part of  the security will be supported by the components or  devices that compose the systems while the larger part  of the security will depend on the processes and  procedures that are in place.  Organisations should consider the security certification  of the process as the highest priority in the whole  business chain (Dyryavyy, Y., 2015b).  Another important observation is the increased  outsourcing of specific cyber security relevant tasks or  functions, which will also increase the risk of being  vulnerable to cyber-attacks.  Customers should verify that external (third parties)  service providers, have all the required knowledge level  in the own organization before entering any contractual  agreement with them. This way they will make sure that  the specific domain (for example substation  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  48  automation) is known and understood by those  delivering the essential cyber security services.  This study focuses only on critical components that are  good candidates for cyber security certification. An  overall concern is the use of devices like laptops,  tablets and phones as entry points for potential attacks  or malware. This is a cross-section threat where  components connected to complex and critical systems  are mostly unmonitored and can cause serious danger  to the overall stability of such complex system. It  should be stated that cyber security certification is as  important for design, implantation, configuration,  operational and business processes.  Owners of critical infrastructures should take a holistic  approach that provides a certain level of security  assurance at every level of the business value chain  instead of merely focusing on the component level.  Overview findings of the given devices per sector  The table below presents a clear overview of candidates for certification that should contribute to the agenda to  work towards a more harmonized approach to cyber security certification in EU.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  49  COMPONENT  CERTIFICATION  DRIVERS  MARKET  SITUATION  RECOMMENDED  FOR  CERTIFICATION  RECOMMENDATIONS  Sector: Digital infrastructure  Routers & Switches  Incorporation security standards in product  certification and type-testing is essential.  Firewalls  Same as routers and switches. Use of different  firewall brands and role-based access.  Hardware security  modules  -  Required to be deployed in a separate  environment.  Unidirectional  Network System  Ensure meeting core requirements requires well  design and proven secure engineering method.  Next generation  firewalls  Use NGF besides existing firewalls to detect  unknown traffic and usage patterns.  Sector: Energy – Electricity  Smart meters  Usage of the DLMS in combination with TLS and IEC  62351 to secure the communication.  Intelligent Electronic  Devices  Best practice is to equip every substation with IDS  to monitor unexpected activity and protocols.  Remote Terminal  Unit (RTU)  Detailed network design crucial for cyber security  of entire substation.  Advanced meter  infrastructure (AMI)  Extend existing certification schemes with test  cases for data concentrators and head-end  systems.

Sector: Transport - Maritime  Integrated Bridge  Systems (IBS)  -  Apply configuration and software change  management/tracking on software components  Overview findings of the given devices  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  50  Key Recommendations  The following general key recommendations are determined for the manufacturers and the users of the certificates:   Organisations should strive for certifying their management system because it is a powerful tool that helps  companies to achieve their business goals. Process certification and compliance is vital to support product  quality, and it is often a ticket to the market. For markets large enough, product manufacturers can test and  certify their products only once as they can have them accepted in many other markets or countries  thereafter.   Both vendors and asset owners should take a holistic view when it comes to security certification and not  merely focus on the functional element of the devices they use. Only after verification of a system in its  entirety, including procedures for operation and maintenance, it can be considered cyber secure.   Organisations should invest more on improving the cyber security education of their engineers. This is  because they usually do not have cyber security culture as they are often confronted with new technologies,  or other domains unknown to them, until it is too late to adopt mitigation measures. Therefore, they need  to be educated, to become aware of cyber risks and to realize that the system is as strong as each individual  component, and that actions and decisions taken for a sub-part of the system can have a major impact on  the overall performance of the system itself.   Cyber security service providers are recommended to implement an IT service management framework in  their organizations as a proof that their services meet customers’ needs.   Whenever this is financially justified, customers should look for the use of security service providers who  provide a follow-the-sun support team in order to ensure maximum availability of their services.  Cargo management  systems  -  Apply network segregation and audit onshore  tracking systems against strict security policies  Passenger servicing  systems  -  Should be security tested to ensure remote  tampering possibility is reduced to a minimum.  Propulsion and  machinery system  -  Apply network segregation and firewall hardening.  Software should be managed for obsolescence.  Sector: Transport - Railway  Automatic train  protection (ATP)  Recommended to ensure to follow rules of the  standards.  Computer based  interlocking (CBI)  Using conformance and penetration testing of  devices against applicable standards.  Communication  equipment GSM-R  Important to evaluate railway system security as a  whole and harden the equipment.  Sector: Health care  Clinical information  systems  Definition of common data-model and profiles for  authentication and protection of data.  Implantable medical  devices  Focus on security and development standards like  Secure Development Life Cycle (SSDLC).  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  51  Furthermore, they should seek for security service providers with an IT service management system which  is based on international and widely known standards e.g. ITIL, ISO/IEC 20000 etc.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  52  9.

Bibliography/References 55  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  05  Executive Summary  Security certification is very limited in industrial environments despite the growing cyber attacks to what is  considered EU Member State Critical Information Infrastructure (CII). There are “good” reasons for this situation,  however, the community questions around the contribution of certification to the cyber security of the industrial CII  production line remain unanswered. Today, without an EU approved standard, harmonised testing and  corresponding certification, answering these questions is complicated and unclear. This is a major issue given the  desire and policy agenda towards a more integrated and global digital infrastructure, which is needed to support the  internal European market.  This study aims to provide a thorough description of the cyber security certification status concerning the most  critical equipment in different critical business sectors. More specifically, five sectors have been selected to  investigate in more detail and to consider a broad spectrum of different requirements and cases that could lead to  certification drivers concerning these devices. The five sectors are1 energy, ICT2, health care, rail transport and water  transport.  The key finding is that every sector has its own functional and security challenges which makes the target of a  common certification framework a challenge. The energy sector, for example, largely depends on real-time  interfaces on process automation level to provide a stable and reliable electrical power supply. The need for more  real-time data exchange is increasing due to the decentralization of the power grid, increasing penetration of  renewables and further integration of markets. On the other hand, the health care sector largely depends on  informational systems and interfaces, like centralized patient databases that are used by companies that provide  healthcare. Automation takes place on small scale, for example at hospitals to provide health monitoring.  Transportation is mostly about logistics and safety. Finally, trains on a track need to be able to communicate with  the generic infrastructure, while for the water transportation a vessel contains automation systems from office  automation to process automation concerning electric power supply and vessel control. At the same time, ICT  becomes the common processing platform which supports all these different functional and security requirements.  This underlines the (increasing) need for a common approach on standards and frameworks for certification.  Based on desk research and expert validation, an analysis is done to study the existing frameworks and standards,  and to identify certification drivers, best practices and candidate products for certification of the five selected  sectors. During this study, common findings that apply to multiple sectors have been identified:   A large part of the public infrastructure is used for data communication within and between critical  infrastructures. This introduces additional challenges to a system versus a privately-owned infrastructure  that is mostly considered as more secure.   Standalone certified devices are considered trustworthy. However, after integration in a real computing  environment this might be not the case. Appropriate planning and execution of system tests is critical,  where device certification will help to get a certain level of device quality concerning cyber security.   When it comes to building cyber security resilience in the selected sectors, it is observed that a small part  of the security will be supported by the components or devices that compose the systems while the larger  part of the security will depend on the processes and procedures that are in place.  1 Based on the findings of the 2015 ENISA study, ‘Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure  assets and services’, available at https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/methodologies-for-the-identification-of-ciis  2 While ICT is not a vital sector per se, we found that this sector is of major importance since it provides a wide range of  devices to other critical sectors.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/methodologies-for-the-identification-of-ciis  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  06   Many industries do not integrate security into their devices from the design phase. Thus, security by design  is an approach that needs to be widely adopted by vendors. A holistic approach provides a certain level of  security assurance at every level of the business value chain for critical infrastructures.   Outsourcing of specific tasks or functions increases the risk of being vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Knowledge  of the specific domain by those who deliver essential cyber security services is mandatory.   An overall concern is the use of devices like laptops, tablets and phones as entry points for potential attacks  or malware. This is a cross-sector threat where devices connected to complex and critical systems are mostly  unmonitored and can cause serious risk to the overall stability of such complex systems.  For each sector, a list of devices was identified that should be considered candidates for certification. Although this  list is not necessarily complete and exhaustive, these devices are found to have a large impact when compromised  or in case they fail to operate. Accordingly, the identified devices included in the candidates’ list provide a good  starting point for the investigation to a common approach for certification, because within critical infrastructures  every device could potentially endanger the whole system.  Based on the analysis of the drivers for certification and the market situation, it is found that the following devices  are most critical for certification in each sector: For Energy - Electricity, smart meters and Intelligent Electronic  Devices (IED); for health care, Clinical Information Systems (CIS); for ICT: firewalls, routers and switches; for  transport – railway, Automatic Train Protection (ATP); and for transport – maritime, Integrated Bridge Systems  (IBS).  The following common key recommendations are determined for these sectors:   Organisations should strive for certifying their management system because it is a powerful tool that helps  companies to achieve their business goals. Process certification and compliance is vital to support product  quality, and it is often a ticket to the market. For markets large enough, product manufacturers can test and  certify their products only once as they can have them accepted in many other markets or countries  thereafter3.   Both vendors and asset owners should take a holistic view when it comes to security certification and not  merely focus on the functional element of the devices they use. Only after verification of a system in its  entirety, including procedures for operation and maintenance, it can be considered cyber secure.   Organisations should invest more on improving the cyber security education of their engineers. This is  because they usually do not have cyber security culture as they are often confronted with new technologies,  or other domains unknown to them, until it is too late to adopt mitigation measures. Therefore, they need  to be educated, to become aware of cyber risks and to realize that the system is as strong as each individual  component, and that actions and decisions taken for a sub-part of the system can have a major impact on  the overall performance of the system itself.   Cyber security service providers are recommended to implement an IT service management framework in  their organizations as a proof that their services meet customers’ needs.   Whenever this is financially justified, customers should look for the use of security service providers who  provide a follow-the-sun support4 team in order to ensure maximum availability of their services.  Furthermore, they should seek for security service providers with an IT service management system which  is based on international and widely known standards e.g. ITIL, ISO/IEC 20000 etc.  3 Specific for EU Product Directives is the requirement on CE -marking the product  4 Follow-the-sun is a type of global workflow in which tasks are passed around daily between work sites that are many time  zones apart.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  07  1. Introduction  There are many challenges when it comes to voluntary EU wide certification for cyber security. The major gaps and  challenges revolve around the fragmentation and different approaches in the member states as well as the lack of  EU guidance by trusted oversight entities. The cybersecurity strategy of the European Union (EU) states the need to  develop industrial and technical resources for cybersecurity in emerging information communication technology  (ICT) environments (COM(2006)786). To realize an open, safe and secure cyberspace, the prime focus of the strategy  is “to create incentives to carry out appropriate risk management and adopt security standards and solutions, as  well as possibly establish voluntary EU-wide certification schemes building on existing schemes in the EU and  internationally” (JOIN(2013) 1) .  ENISA has been involved in the area of certification by, among others, supporting activities such as the workshop on  security certification for smart grid devices (2012), the joint EC/ENISA SOG-IS and ICT certification workshop (2014)  and the report on smart grid security certification (2014). One of the common findings of these activities was the  lack of systematic recording of the major challenges, together with the lack of a harmonized certification framework  in some critical business sectors.  Currently there exist different security standards and frameworks for certification from business sector to business  sector. Not surprisingly, business sectors differ a lot concerning the use and importance of the ICT platforms, like  type of system, components of different vendors, age, technologies and communication protocols. For instance,  there are sectors that use and require automation systems for the automation and the safety of their critical  operational processes, and disruption of these systems could lead to large societal impacts. Within other sectors,  emerging ICT is used for centralized databases, markets and for communication between companies, resulting into  a variety of interfaces between subsectors and companies. Furthermore, differences can be spotted between the  type of system used, like information technology (IT) and near real-time automation systems as operational  technology (OT). These varying ICT landscapes make it complex to develop and implement a common and widely  accepted certification framework in this area.  Consequently, there is no common approach on standards and frameworks for certification within the European  Union, and no certification program that focuses on the emerging ICT environments such as IoT, industry 4.0 etc.  This is a major issue, as specified in (JOIN(2013) 1), “lack of a well-functioning mechanism of certification” is an  inhibitor to the functioning of the European market as a whole. In line with the JOIN(2013) 1 and 2016/1148/EU,  there is the desire to have a more integrated and global digital infrastructure, as a means to support the global  European market. Accordingly, given the current situation and further developments, common cyber security  practices and certification schemes are of great importance because security certification schemes are considered  as a cyber security enabler which may:   bring transparency into the processing taking place in a complex computing environment (supporting an  answer to the “how secure” question),   align IT and Engineering personnel to common security goals,   help clean up responsibility questions (who is responsible for what?) and   accelerate a secure introduction of emerging ICT technologies.  Addressing the harmonization issue, requires an understanding of the current challenges for security certification  (the “good” reasons) and, subsequently, the identification of an implementation strategy which delivers results in a  coordinated, balanced and cost-efficient manner for the society and the industry.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  08  Objective  This report aims to provide decision makers with a thorough description of the security certification status  concerning the most impactful equipment in five different critical business sectors. Results of this study should help  to improve and harmonize the certification standards and frameworks in place, and pave the way towards a common  approach to security certification in these sectors in the EU. Finally, both current and upcoming certification schemes  will be considered while investigating the differences and similarities in the five selected critical sectors.  Methodology & deliverables  This report consists of two parts and adopts both a theoretical and empirical approach to investigate and answer  questions around the relation of certification and security. The main methods applied are desk research and an  observational study using questionnaires and interviews. Desk research was performed to collect publicly available  existing standards and frameworks for certification, and to identify existing certification practices and challenges in  the selected sectors. Of great help in selecting the areas of interest was the ENISA report on identification of critical  infrastructure assets and services (JOIN(2013) , 2016/1148/EU).  Subsequently, a questionnaire was developed to identify challenges, needs, success stories and lessons learned of  certification in the selected sectors. This questionnaire was used during interviews with experts of the selected  sectors, after a careful identification of a list of experts from the relevant stakeholders within the selected sectors.  The information gathered from the experts was used to validate the desk research about current challenges, risks  and needs for security and conformity assurance, and collects best practices and lessons learned.  To meet the objective of the study, the following tasks were performed:   Selection of five sectors, that cover most aspects concerning the different types of ICT environments for  which conformity assessment is considered as a key enabler for the economic development.   For each sector, identification of:  o Elements of commonly used architectures  o Different conformity assessment frameworks  o Challenges to conformity assessments  o Success stories and lessons learned  o Useful conclusions on how to overcome the identified challenges   Creation of an overview of existing standards and frameworks for certification concerning critical  infrastructure protection in emerging ICT environments.  In order to be able to define clear recommendations based on the findings, the following questions need to be  answered:   What are the needs for different conformity assurance standards and techniques for each sector?   What are different conformity assessments types for each sector?   Which organizations are relevant to security certifications in each sector and what is their relationship?   What is the role of existing international and European standards towards a harmonized certification  approach?   What are the main challenges facing the existing standards, guidelines, regulations and certification  programs?   What are the main incentives and barriers for developing the market of security certifications in Europe?  Results of this research have led to a clear overview of the challenges and the gaps in cyber security certification  schemes.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  09  Target audience  This report provides relevant information and recommendations for the Member States involved in defining  certification schemes and the development of test programs of components in critical infrastructures. Furthermore  this report is of interest to asset owners and operators engaged in securing or selecting secure component by  providing an overview of existing components used today in critical infrastructures and possible existing certification  schemes and standards.  Structure of this document  This report is structured as follows. Chapter 2 outlines which sectors are selected for further investigation. The  subsequent chapters 3 – 7 are organized by sector and provide an overview and main findings of the sectors namely  energy – electricity, health care, ICT, transportation – railway and transportation – water transport respectively.  Finally, chapter 8 presents common findings and key recommendations.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  10  2. Selected sectors  The latest Network Information Systems (NIS) directive gives an overview of sectors and subsectors that are seen as  essential services. According to the NIS directive (2016/1148/EU), an essential service is an asset or system which is  essential for the maintenance of vital societal functions. Damage to essential services, their destruction or disruption  by natural disasters, terrorism, criminal activity or malicious behavior, may have a significant negative impact on the  security of the EU and the well-being of its citizens.  The selection of the sectors for this study, is based on the results of the ENISA study on the identification of critical  infrstructures1. The following sectors and subsectors have been selected, using the naming convention as used in  the NIS directive:   Energy – Electricity   Information and Communications Technology5   Health Care   Transportation – Rail transport   Transportation – Water transport  Each sector is described in more detail in the following chapters 3 – 7 by providing a general overview of the  sector, identification of the most impactful devices (that most likely require certification), and findings on  certification drivers, best practices and recommendations to harmonize the cyber security approach in the EU.  Accordingly, the following information is presented for each sector:  GENERAL INFORMATION  Description  A short overview about the product, what is it doing, what is it used for  etc.  Products  An overview of products that have been certified or assessed by these  practices  Candidate products  An overview of products that could potentially be certified or assessed  targeting these practices  Documents  A list of the standards, technical reports, sets of rules, boundaries, etc.  that can be applied for certification of products  Certification authority  The authority that defines the certification rules and issues the final  certificate upon successful completion of testing that issues a certificate  Regulatory authority The entity that setup and regulates the certification scheme  Certification schemes/frameworks  The methodology and rules by which a certificate is granted to who  undertakes the process (only for existing)  5 It should be noted that the NIS directive does not state ICT. Sector ICT has been selected, because it fulfills an important role  by providing critical devices to each of these sectors.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  11  Certification drivers and issues  Certification drivers  The following items6 are considered when identifying certification drivers:   System criticality (does a Cyber Security attack imply a critical  damage?)   Number of devices (is it in every house?)   Safety issues (does it affect people lives?)   Security issues (does a Cyber Security attack endanger  people/country security?)   Access vector (is it connected to the internet?)   Environmental issues (does a Cyber Security attack endanger the  environment?)   Intersystem dependencies (does a Cyber Security attack indirectly  affect a connected system)   Regulations (does the law mandate a certification scheme?)  Recommendations  A list of advice on what can be improved or addressed in the whole environment.  6 Only the items which exist at the time of writing this report appear in the certification key drivers’ analysis tables per each  device. Those who are empty are omitted from the analysis in order to avoid unnecessary duplications.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  12  3. Energy - Electricity  The energy electricity sector’s main activities are electricity generation and the delivery of this generated electricity  to the various customers. Currently the energy sector experiences an energy transition from a fossil fuel based and  centralized generation towards a more renewable and decentralized generation. This transition has a strong impact  on the network infrastructure and related cyber security-related requirements. Figure 1 gives and overview of the  current energy value chain with its major components.  In the centralized system, the energy is produced by the power plants and delivered through the transmission and  distribution grid to the customers, so ‘from left to right’ in the figure. The current energy infrastructure deals  increasingly with bidirectional power flows.  Figure 1 The energy power value chain  Generation, transmission and distribution are physical processes that execute the energy conversion and delivery to  the customers. These processes are highly automatized by Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)  systems, Energy Management Systems (EMS), Distribution Management Systems (DMS) and Grid Management  Systems (GMS). Besides automation of the individual processes, the grid is automated to stabilize the frequency and  voltage levels to prevent black-outs. This is the responsibility of the Transmission System Operators (TSO). This  control requires real-time communication interfaces between different ICT systems both within the companies and  between the companies active in the electricity sector.  Emerging ICT infrastructure has been observed in all active components across the energy power value chain as  depicted in Figure 1. Devices like Intelligent Electronic Devices (IED), Remote Terminal Units (RTU), data  concentrators, data historians, and others communicate within the value chain all the way down to the customers,  i.e. the (smart) meters. Besides, as well the supporting IT systems that facilitate the production and distribution of  electricity are involved, like energy trading and metering. The communication standards and interfaces in this sector  are among others IEC 60870-5, IEC 61850, TASE.2/ICCP and DLMS.  The energy sector is a large sector with complex ICT usage and requirements, wherein a lot of standards and  frameworks have been defined and are being used. It can be stated that the energy sector faces a lot of challenges  regarding certification schemes and practices.  Desk Research  The energy sector is highly automated with multiple centralized and decentralized OT systems in power plants and  substations. IT and OT overlap and intertwine to deal with the future electricity market and demands. Reliability of  the power supply us essential for several reasons. Figure 2 shows a global the global infrastructure of the energy  sector. It shows this sector is largely depending on subsectors.

Especially, the operational systems, performing monitoring and control of the physical power system,  can be targeted to create a black-out which has big impact on society.

The centrally located operators require  correct information in order to make important decisions to maintain the stability of  the remote sub-grids.

Findings  Within the energy sector the rise of ICT systems is eminent. IEDs, RTUs, data concentrators, data historians, and  other devices communicate within the value chain all the way down to the customers, i.e. the (smart) meters. The  supporting IT systems – the ones that facilitate both the production and distribution of electricity, and the sales and  settlement of energy – are interconnected. The most important communication standards and interfaces in this area  are: IEC 60870-5, IEC 61850, TASE.2/ICCP and DLMS.  3.2.1 Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs)  3.2.1.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is high because IEDs are installed in most substations and operate autonomously based  upon locally acquired process information or via a local process controller. Remote commands issued from  the central location are received through an interface between the central and remote location which  implies that a third party can control the critical assets connected to the IEDs. So especially when multiple  IEDs are compromised and malfunction this could cause local outages and even a complete blackout.   Number of devices: varies based on the voltage level and capacity of the substation   Safety issues: of severe impact because both a local outage and a blackout could cause several safety issues  including interrupted life-support and dialysis machines, stopped elevators, electronic lock-ins, heating or  cooling issues depending on the season.   Security issues: of severe impact in case of a longer lasting blackout, as it could interrupt critical systems  used for national security beyond the capacity of UPS’s and emergency generators.   Access vector: is limited because IEDs are normally not directly connected to public network infrastructures  like the internet.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  17   Intersystem dependencies: are high, since data is communicated and sharing between IEDs, substations and  control centers.  3.2.1.2 Findings  Station and process networks are normally designed as a standalone network. IEDs are interconnected within the  same substation without direct connection to other systems outside the substation. Depending on the voltage level  there is connectivity with the outside world using a RTU, gateway or proxy, this is done using public and private  networks. Due to the standalone nature of the network the need for certification within the substation is lower as  compared to the equipment connected to public infrastructures. Existing conformance test schemes do not include  compliance testing of cyber security aspects on device level.  3.2.1.3 Recommendations  End-users would like to see that IEC 61850 is extended with specific parts related to security for IEDs (IEC 62351 and  IEC62443 test procedures) and the used communication protocols instead of vendor specific solutions that prove to  be non-interoperable. It is recommended that the UCA International Users Group (UCAIug) incorporate testing  cyber security aspects on devices in the existing conformance test programs.  It is recommended for asset management system to include records of the installed IEDs with the current software/  firmware versions including the used configuration tools. Without this recording it is difficult to identify the systems  that are exposed to a detected vulnerability and apply updates or execute replacement programs. Additionally, the  maintenance organization will need to have skilled engineers that can manage software/ firmware updates.  An identified good practice is to equip every substation network with an IDS to monitor the network for unexpected  activity or protocols.  3.2.2 Remote Terminal Units (RTUs)  3.2.2.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is high because RTUs act as a remote controller serving a control center which needs to  perform actions in the remote location. When the connection between the central and remote location is  compromised a malicious third party can gain access to the SCADA front-end and control the complete  SCADA system or the station RTU and has access to critical assets within the connected substation and  because malicious manipulation of the exchanged energy measurements can harm the whole network  stability   Number of devices: is high because almost all utilities use RTUs to monitor substations from a central  location.   Safety issues: of severe impact because both a local outage and a blackout could cause several safety issues  including interrupted life-support and dialysis machines, stopped elevators, electronic lock-ins, heating or  cooling issues depending on the season.   Security issues: severe security issues in case of a longer lasting blackout, as it could interrupt critical systems  used for national security beyond the capacity of UPS’s and emergency generators.   Access vector: is high because RTUs rely increasingly on communication over public network infrastructures.  Public networks are significantly more accessible than private networks.   Intersystem dependencies: are of medium size because RTUs are limited to the control of substations and  power plants7.  7  Taking into consideration a scenario where a transmission operator balances the network upon regular measurements of  the produced and consumed energy (for example like expected in the scenario of e-price).  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  18  3.2.2.2 Findings  Due to the standalone nature of substations and the network within the substation, cyber-security is currently not  perceived as a must, but attention is increasing for it: electrical utilities are getting more and more aware of the  risks associated with the use of public infrastructures for critical communication with SCADA and RTU systems. The  providers of these products are following the developments of IEC 62351 and IEC 62443, several manufacturers of  substation equipment including RTUs have started the implementation of these standards in their products. Many  of these products are in the phase of being field-tested in pilot projects.  Compliancy test procedures are still under development and will contribute to higher level of device testing before  massive deployment in substations (test procedures IEC 62351 and IEC 62443).  3.2.2.3 Recommendations  It is recommended that testing labs extend test programs to include integrated system testing.  A detailed network design before roll out is crucial to the level of cyber security of a substation network and thus  the entire substation. Manufacturers should invest more resources in improving security of these RTUs due to the  wide-spread character of these devices.  Identified good practices are the use of IPSEC between devices for a secure exchange of data, segment the network  in smaller subnets and isolate risk-areas into one domain, access control lists and the use of protocol convertors  on application level.  3.2.3 Smart meters  3.2.3.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is low because attacking a single meter does not influence the network. However, there  might be a massive attack, where meters could push plenty of wrong data to Head End System. As such,  they could be used to attack the central systems of the utility.   Number of devices: several millions of smart meters are planned to be used in all households and non- industrial businesses. The meters are developed in a multi-vendor environment, to be deployed in all EU  electricity grids. Interoperability is crucial to allow millions of devices to communicate, and the concept can  be extended to the cyber security profiles.   Safety issues: are of severe importance because some smart meter types have disconnect-switches. They  can disconnect the end-user from the electrical grid. A massive which targets the disconnection of  consumers combined with extreme climate situations, can lead to health issues or even deaths of elderly  and sick people when air conditioning or heating systems are disconnected.   Security issues: are of medium severity because alarm systems of private property could be disabled by  tampering with a meter which includes breaker functionality.   Access Vector: is medium/high because its connectivity depends on communication infrastructures in place.  Meters could be connected directly to the Head End System via GPRS, CDMA, or LTE technology, or they  could communicate (via power line carrier) to a Data Concentrator, which collects and sends the data to the  Head End System via public network. In either case, public infrastructure is used due to the high number of  devices. The meters are also equipped with a local interface for maintenance and in many countries, an  interface for in-home devices or third party devices like in-home displays and local energy management  systems.   Intersystem dependencies: are high because several metering (sub)systems depend on the smart meter:  The Head End System (i.e. the system that reads out the meters and collects the data) is connected to an  MDM (meter data management system). The MDM is connected to GIS (Geographic information system),  CRM (Customer Relation Management), and other systems. The energy consumption data collected and  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  19  transmitted by the meters is the source data to bill customers, provide network access and plays an  important role in the settlement mechanism of the whole energy market.  3.2.3.2 Findings  Conformance testing of the application layer is performed under the oversight of the DLMS user association, while  ESMIG and the SMCG are developing European specifications for smart meters and AMI. DLMS can be used with  various communication technologies including ZigBee, 3G PLC and GPRS. The standardization and conformance  testing of these communication technologies are managed by other standardization bodies.  The DLMS standard includes definitions of different security mechanisms for authentication, encryption and digital  signatures.  3.2.3.3 Recommendations  It is recommended that the DLMS user association actively updates and maintains the official conformance test  tool (CCT), since the tool set is often out date when compared to the latest revisions of the DLMS standard.  3.2.4 Advanced Meter Infrastructures (AMI)  3.2.4.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is low because attacking a single meter does not influence the network. However, there  might be a massive attack, where meters could push plenty of wrong data to Head End System. As such,  they could be used to attack the central systems of the utility.   Number of devices: several millions smart meters are planned to be used in all households and non- industrial businesses. The meters are developed in a multi-vendor environment, to be deployed in all EU  electricity grids. Interoperability is crucial to allow millions of devices to communicate, and the concept can  be extended to the cyber security profiles.   Safety issues: are of severe importance because some smart meter types have disconnect-switches. They  can disconnect the end-user from the electrical grid. A massive which targets the disconnection of  consumers combined with extreme climate situations, can lead to health issues or even deaths of elderly  and sick people when air conditioning or heating systems are disconnected.   Security issues: of medium severity because alarm systems of private property could be disabled by  tampering with a meter which includes breaker functionality.    Access Vector: is medium because its connectivity depends on communication infrastructures in place.  Meters could be connected directly to the Head End System via GPRS, CDMA, or LTE technology, or they  could communicate (via power line carrier) to a Data Concentrator, which collects and sends the data to the  Head End System via public network. In either case, public infrastructure is used due to the high number of  devices. The meters are also equipped with a local interface for maintenance and in many countries, an  interface for in-home devices or third party devices like in-home displays and local energy management  systems.   Intersystem dependencies: are high because several metering (sub)systems depend on the smart meter:  The Head End System (i.e. the system that reads out the meters and collects the data) is connected to an  MDM (meter data management system). The MDM is connected to GIS (Geographic information system),  CRM (Customer Relation Management), and other systems. The energy consumption data collected and  transmitted by the meters is the source data to bill customers, provide network access and plays an  important role in the settlement mechanism of the whole energy market.  3.2.4.2 Findings  The architecture of the smart metering infrastructure varies from country to country with the use of different  applications (i.e. DLMS, Meters and More or OSGP), different communication technologies and different regulatory  requirements.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  20  3.2.4.3 Recommendations  Current conformance schemes are focusing solely on the smart meter side, and do not cover the other components  inside the AMI. It is recommended that certification organizations extend the scheme with test cases for DLMS  based data concentrators and head-end-systems.  3.2.5 Virtual Power Plants (VPP)  3.2.5.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is high, because both the flow of electricity and the related information is critical for the  grid stability. Incorrect information from the VPP in regards to its generation could create instabilities in  frequency control causing outages of the grid and cause a blackout due to unbalance.   Number of devices: varies on the local electrical infrastructure   Safety issues: of severe importance because a local outage could cause several safety issues including  interrupted life-support and dialysis machines, stopped elevators, electronic lock-ins, heating or cooling  issues depending on the season.   Security issues: of severe severity in case of a longer lasting blackout, as it could interrupt critical systems  used for local security beyond the capacity of UPS’s and emergency generators.   Access vector: is high, since VPPs communicate using the public infrastructure.  3.2.5.2 Findings  Currently the VHP ready standard is not mature and finalized yet, therefore there is currently no compliance scheme  available. It is currently focusing on security rules and best practices imposed by other standards like IEC 62351.  3.2.5.3 Recommendations  It is recommended to integrate the cyber security rules and standards focusing on power systems, such as IEC  62351, in the VPP certification scheme.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  21  4. Sector: Health Care  Healthcare environment is a vast ecosystem comprised by numerous components. Collaboration among various  stakeholders, numerous interconnected assets and high flexibility requirements do not only lead to complexity and  dynamics but also to blurred organisational boundaries. At the same time, personal health information is deemed  even more valuable than financial information and, apart from access to sensitive information, access to prescription  drugs or possession of expensive medical devices may also be considered worthwhile by attackers. Consequently,  information security is a key issue for healthcare organisations.  To enable swift, correct and complete exchange of information both among specialists and physicians inside the  hospital walls , and physicians with third parties (i.e. insurance companies), ICT  is offering great variety of solutions  and products.  Both the patient data confidentiality and integrity  are very important to ensure that the information  is kept secure and only available to authorized parties while the data needs to be trusted and acted upon. Figure 3  gives an overview of the different components in the health care sector.  The ICT environment of the health care sector consists mostly of suysstems and devices to record, analyse and share  information. However, mainly within hospitals, automation of clinical systems and medical equipment (OT) are  available, to improve the health care provision to the patients.  Safety and availability are important factors for hospitals, and the increasing dependency on ICT systems, means  that any failure will have a great impact on their operation.  Another major issue affecting cyber security in the case of healthcare is the lifespan of medical devices and  equipment. Medical devices like CAT scanners, MRI machines etc can stay as part of a hospital for more than a  decade. This means that new vulnerabilities arise as attackers become more sophisticated. Moreover this shows  that intensive focus should be given in the patching and updating management of these devices. The very thin line  between usability and security is becoming now more transparent as patching comes second (or even lower) in  priority especially as the machines might need to be available at any given moment.  In the healthcare landscape the priority is the life of the patient; seldom are the cases were a physician would follow  all the security procedures attached to medical devices if in case of emergency. These users are made to create  workarounds and this was realized early enough. To increase safety and availability, many procedures were put in  place to mitigate human errors and workarounds.  For all the reasons presented above standardization and the requirement for security certification in medical devices  and systems will increase.  Desk Research  Within the health care sector, both data exchange and storage of health information are becoming increasingly  important. . Inside a hospital many systems are interconnected in order to exchange information and patient’s data;  in some cases this can exceed the hospital’s walls.  Contrary to the energy sector, the health sector has relatively limited (connected) OT systems as the main systems  are administrative. The ICT landscape is complex due to the existence of various systems from multiple vendors and  different lifespans. From this perspective, it is important having security certification in place to secure and protect  the medical equipment, the patients’ data and the administrative systems. Figure 3 shows a generic health care  provision architecture with all relevant devices.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  22  The following systems are considered the most favorable for security certification:   Interconnected clinical information system, which include:  o hospital information system,  o lab information system,  o picture archiving and control system  o radiology information system,  o pharmacy information systems,  o pathology information systems,  o blood bank and  o research info system.   Networked medical devices which include:  o wearable medical devices,  o Implantable medical devices,  o stationary medical devices,  o mobile medical devices,  o supportive devices.  4.1.1  Interconnected clinical information system  Description Large and complex information systems and tools which are the foundation of  hospitals and medical institutes core administrative and medical-support processes.

When ICT systems fail it is possible  that hospitals cannot take in any patients anymore. Hospitals are more and more subject to ransomware infections.  Furthermore, the medical equipment is also able to be connected to the IT network. Remote operation and  monitoring improves the efficiency of the health care. It also implicitly creates extra risks to these medical devices.  Safety and availability is important for hospitals and human errors are already mitigated by procedures. That means  that standardization and the requirement for security certification will increase. That holds for the central databases  and functionality as well. The lack of Role Based Access Control even if in the hospital terminals people having  different roles can access the same data.  4.2.1 Interconnected clinical information system  4.2.1.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is high because the system contains all relevant information needed to run a hospital or a  clinic   Number of devices: is limited because the machines hosting the information are powerful and centralized.   Safety issues: are of high importance because when information is tampered, altered or deleted this can  lead to wrong decisions or no information on a patient.   Access vector: is high because it is a pure IT system with many entry points and it is implemented via a public  communications infrastructure  4.2.1.2 Findings  The criticality of the system is high, because unavailability has a direct impact on the provision of care, even in  situations where protocols apply to work without access to the information system.  Database systems used in clinical networked information systems are based upon different technologies and  providers, they do not share a common (architectural) model or interface between the different components, the  lack of standardization leads to difficulties and additional costs when databases need to be integrated.  4.2.1.3 Recommendations  The definition of a common data-model and profiles regarding authentication and protection of data will realize an  information system used by member states that allow a standardized way of data exchange.  4.2.2 Networked medical devices  4.2.2.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is high because attack on an implantable medical device has no direct impact on a larger  system but only on the actual component   Number of devices: are many because the use of this type of devices gets spread and common   Safety issues: are of high importance because acting on the embedded application running in the device it  will put the patient at risk   Access vector: is high because communication interfaces are active and allow remote access  4.2.2.2 Findings  Many implantable medical devices have already wireless capabilities. Patients and care providers are becoming more  and more security aware. Lack of standardization have triggered concerns and raised questions whether products  fulfills safety and security standards like the ISO80001.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  25  4.2.2.3 Recommendations  The basis for a secure product comes from good engineering practices and proper risk management, instead of  focusing on device security the product developer shall be subject to applicable security and development standards  like the Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC) approach (Davis, 2005).  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  26  5. Sector: Information and Communications Technology  The ICT sector’s main products are software, including firmware, databases and digital certificates, and hardware  such as routers, firewalls, switches, servers and workstations. The usage of these generic components is increasing  at all (process) automation levels in all sectors, which is mainly due to cheaper prices and component  standardisation. In the context of this report, the ICT sector can be divided in the following subsectors:   Network device manufactures   Chip manufactures   Software manufactures   Process automation software manufactures   Support and maintenance companies  Unlike the rest of the sectors, ICT is not an essential service in itself in the terminology of NIS directive, but it supports  other essential services. Accordingly, the ICT infrastructure can be considered as cross cutting component, since it  delivers products and services to the other essential services. This requires specific certification criteria defined by  these sectors, while within the ICT business area a lot of frameworks and standards exist that are widely used for  development, maintenance, manufacturing and support activities. Therefore, it is important to understand that the  scope of the ICT for this study is on end-products.  The ICT infrastructures used by different NIS essential services, heavily depend on network and computing  equipment. The focus within this study will be on the (generic) network and computing devices produced within the  ICT. In this study the widely accepted security requirements will be considered: availability, confidentiality,  authenticity, and integrity.  Desk Research  For this study, ICT provides the necessary equipment and functionality to create the required automation in both  the IT and OT world. ICT equipment, like network components and servers are more and more standardized and  become cheaper and more powerful every year. The use of common ICT components is done at all levels within  complex computing environments. Standardization of network communication is adopted at every automation layer  and enables the possibility to interconnect components, systems and make the bridge between the OT and the IT  world.  ICT components like routers and switches are critical for the correct operation of any system. Security certification  on these impactful devices contributes to the overall security and reliability of the ICT system and the operational  environment it supports. Furthermore, many applications and system depend on correct functioning encryption  mechanisms, in order to use these systems, digital certificates need to be generated, maintained and managed. To  create digital certificates which are compliant with relevant standards and can be safely used in any system made  by any manufacturer the certification of Hardware Security Modules becomes relevant. ICT components that will  require security certification are: switches / routers, firewalls, Hardware Security Modules, Unidirectional Network  Systems and next generation firewalls.

As well as the generation function,  covering a crucial function in the process of securing assets, this hardware normally  offers very strong security measures, such as deletion of keys in case of tampering,  backup, and redundancy. This hardware is a physical computing device that manages  digital keys for strong authentication. It could be part of a Public Key Infrastructure  (PKI).

It combines a  standard firewall with other types of network filtering functionalities, like an  application firewall using deep packet inspection (DPI) and intrusion prevention  system (IPS) for example. Furthermore, the device could be capable of deeper  inspection compared to a traditional firewall such as encrypted data inspection  (TLS/SSL), website filtering, malware and antivirus inspection.

Common ICT equipment, like network components and servers are more and more standardized and become  cheaper and more powerful every year. The use of common ICT components is done at all levels within a complex  industrial environment.  Standardization of network communication is adopted at every automation layer and enables the possibility to  interconnect components, systems and make the bridge between the OT and the IT world. Common ICT components  like routers and switches are critical for correct operation of any system. Certification of these impactful devices  contributes to the overall security and reliability of the OT and IT system.  Therefore, ICT infrastructure is considered to be a (critical) horizontal (cross sector) element which requires  certification on a high level of trustworthiness. Delivery of ICT equipment, software and services to the rest of the  business areas requires specific certification criteria defined within these areas. ICT area is large and diverse;  therefore, it is important to narrow down the scope of ICT for the study.  The study focused on the following common ICT components that play a crucial role in the rest of the ICT landscape:   Routers and switches   Firewalls including next generation firewalls   Unidirectional network system   Hardware Security Modules   Key generation software  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  30   Digital certificates  More information on the specific findings related to the mentioned ICT components can be found below.  5.2.1 Routers and switches  5.2.1.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is high due to the fact that when switches are not working securely there will be no reliable  and secure communication between devices or between networks which will endanger the stability of the  supporting application or function.   Number of devices: are many because every network requires one or more switches   Safety issues: are many because insecure communications in an OT environment can lead to interruption of  critical infrastructures or applications   Security issues: are many because insecure communications in an OT environment can lead to interruption  of critical infrastructures or applications   Access vector: is high because the switch is reachable via the network   Intersystem dependencies: are high because attacking a network switch or router all connected end-devices  will be affected  5.2.1.2 Findings  There is limited market demand for certified networking equipment in OT environments on routers and switches to  be tested and certified against specific security standards. Often the only mandatory requirements are to be suitable  for industrial environments, the support of specific management protocols like SNMP and the support of encryption.  5.2.1.3 Recommendations  Incorporation of security standards in product certification and type-testing is essential to ensure that used network  equipment is meeting cyber security standards. End-users also identified that security assessments (when  equipment is in operation) to verify compliance to security standards is crucial. These assessments shall be  periodically planned and executed and when changes to the system are made (for example firmware or  configuration changes).  Furthermore, for network components a patch management system and procedures need to be in place, both at the  vendor side and at the user side. Crucial to the stability and security of a complex system is also centralized  monitoring and management.  5.2.2 Firewalls  5.2.2.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is high because remote access to a system or domain might not be possible anymore, but  autonomous systems will remain available with access controls   Number of devices: are many because private and public networks use firewalls to protect the network from  attacks and to control who has access to the network   Safety issues: are of high importance because remote control and operation will not be available due to an  outage of the component but the stability and reliability of the connected systems will not be affected   Security issues:  are of high severity because the firewall controls the access to the network   Access vector: varies depending on the network topology. Firewalls are connected to many different type  of network infrastructures and have an effect on the overall stability of a complex system.   Intersystem dependencies: are high because by attacking a firewall all connected end-devices will be  affected  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  31  5.2.2.2 Findings  For firewalls the same conclusion applies to network switches and routers, there is limited market demand for  certified network equipment in OT environments.  For firewalls patch management is also a critical issue, exploits are publicly available and therefore OT firewalls will  require a faster patch cycle, this will have impact on the uptime and availability of the OT system.  There is limited request from the market to ask for routers, switches and firewalls to be tested and certified against  specific security standards. Often the only mandatory requirements are to be suitable for industrial environments,  the support of specific management protocols like Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and the support  of encryption.  5.2.2.3 Recommendations  Audits, functional testing and compliance testing of firewalls should be planned and executed together with other  active network components, like the aforementioned switches and routers. There are risks that firewalls can be  bypassed because of misconfigured switches and routers or even become unavailable due to high loads of network  traffic in case of a Denial of Service (DOS) attack.  Audits on the existing rule base should be performed to ensure that all firewall rules are up to date, validated and  functional before applying rules to production firewalls. Firewalls with build-in Intruder Detection Systems (IDS)  and/or Intruder Prevention Systems (IPS) should be subject to the same audits, to reduce the risk of false positives  due to less known OT traffic and/or protocols.  Make use of role-based-access to ensure that people or devices with access to the system cannot compromise the  overall system. In case of a security-event only limited parts of the system are affected.  A good practice is to use different firewall brands or products for the IT and OT infrastructure, in case a vulnerability  is detected this will not compromise the complete line of defense.  5.2.3 Hardware security modules  5.2.3.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is high because compromise of an HSM will reduce the trust to public key infrastructure  supported by the keys issued by the compromised HSM   Number of devices: is high because every device implementing cryptography might rely on an HSM to secure  its applications   Security issues: are of high severity because a comprised HSM reduces trust in the complete public key  infrastructure   Access vector: is low because HSM is a critical asset with limited access by unauthorized users   Intersystem dependencies: are low for typical ICT infrastructures but very high for applications which use  digital keys  5.2.3.2 Findings  Should an organization decides to deploy a PKI, then the correct design and setup of this infrastructure, including  the HSM, becomes critical. In case of a security event related to the HSM the entire HSM needs to be replaced which  is a major effort.  5.2.3.3 Recommendations  Failure of the HSM will lead to unavailability of the provision of digital keys. Therefore, it should be placed in a  separate environment that can be accessed by a limited number of people. When used in critical process automation  environments redundancy concept are needed to meet the availability requirements.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  32  5.2.4 Unidirectional network system  5.2.4.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is high because unidirectional network devices are mostly used to secure, separate and  protect critical networks, however compromising these devices will not lead to bi-directional  communication due to the physical design of the hardware   Number of devices: is low because separation and protection of network segments will require only two  redundant unidirectional network systems   Security issues: are of low importance because the device has physically blocked bi-directional data flow   Access vector: is low because the device will operated in a protected environment with access by only be  limited authorized persons   Intersystem dependencies: are low because a unidirectional network system does not depend on other  systems.  5.2.4.2 Findings  Unidirectional network devices are not widely used yet. Within critical automation environments these devices are  used more and more to separate for example office networks from process networks.  5.2.4.3 Recommendations  Because of the emerging characteristic of the unidirectional network device, it is required to make sure it is well  designed and bi-directional data must be made physically impossible. Appropriate configuring, testing and  implementation is important. Before widely used it should be part of a certification plan while it plays an important  part to secure interfaces of connected networks.  5.2.5 Next generation firewall  5.2.5.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is high because it provides more protection compared to a traditional firewall and protects  against known and unknown attacks by monitoring the network traffic   Number of devices: expected to be many because a next generation firewall (NGF) could be used in each  network interconnection (for example in demilitarized zones (DMZ))   Security issues: are of severe importance because a NGF is highly configurable and mistakes are easy to  make, compromising this device could lead to undetectable attacks   Access vector: is low because NGF is a critical asset with limited access by unauthorized users   Intersystem dependencies: are high because by attacking a NGF all connected end-devices will be affected  5.2.5.2 Findings  A Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) is an integrated network platform that is a part of the third generation of firewall  technology, combining a traditional firewall with other network device filtering functionalities, such as an application  firewall using in-line deep packet inspection (DPI), an intrusion prevention system (IPS). The goal of next-generation  firewalls is to include more layers of the OSI model, improving filtering of network traffic that is dependent on the  packet contents (Rossi 2012).  Next generation firewalls provide a lot more protection and will be increasingly used within IT and OT networks. For  operational systems, NGFWs could provide high detection of anomalies due to the fact the OT systems are highly  predictable.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  33  5.2.5.3 Recommendations  At least one of the firewall in the DMZ should be a next generation firewall. For operational systems this type of  firewall could be used to detect anomalies. A NGF should be part of a continuous monitoring and update process to  ensure the NGF meets all the operational and process requirements.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  34  6. Sector: Transportation – Railway  The Railway sector’s main activity is the transportation of passengers and goods using a fixed track infrastructure.  The railway infrastructure usually is a shared common infrastructure that is used by different railway companies.  Most railway infrastructures are able to provide electric power to the locomotive. Not all locomotives depend on  electric power, they can also depend on diesel engines for example. A variety of trains can make use of this shared  track.  Trains are vehicles operated by a driver or by automated systems in closed loop environments for example on  airports. Currently, the railway sector uses the following ICT functionality to manage the transport:   Central monitoring and control   Safety systems   Signaling and control systems   Traffic control and communication   Logistic optimization   Passenger information (real-time)   Ticketing, billing and check   On-Board communication   On-Board surveillance   Asset management (vehicles and infrastructure)   Digital tickets  Rail transportation contain large informational and operational systems. Informational systems used to provide their  customers with real-time information. Operational systems are focused on the safety of the track to make sure no  collisions will occur and obstacles are on the track. Within the passenger trains conductors need to check the valid  passes of the passengers. Digital tickets are used more often which require a reliable and available infrastructure.  Figure 5 Overview of railway systems  Attacks on operational systems could lead to disruption or unavailability of the rail transport itself. When  informational systems are attacked it can lead to unavailability of services for the passenger, like being unable to  buy a ticket or digitally check a ticket into the system. Railway is an important way of transportation and could lead  to disruption of the society.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  35  Since transportation is part of the backbone supporting every country, many economies and business sectors will  stop functioning without proper transportation in place. Consequently, cyber-attacks on transportation systems,  which is a major threat, create a large impact on society and people’s daily life. Besides direct effects, like delays,  accidents, injuries or even deaths, it can lead to indirect effects, like socioeconomic effects.  Currently there is no  standardized approach to address security guidelines in the transportation sector. The NIS Directive addresses  elements to reporting of cyber security related issues or events, but it does not address the matter of a standardized  testing and certification approach.  Desk Research  The transportation sector consists of several subsectors like rail and maritime transport and aviation, and in all these  sectors ICT plays an important role. The destruction of the transportation infrastructure will have immediate effect  on people and economy. Figure 6 shows a general architecture of the rail transportation system. In the rail subsector  the role of the infrastructure provider as well as the transportation company using the infrastructure are equally  important to protect the subsector against cyber-attacks.

The maritime sub area is highly standardized and legislated compared to the other sub areas. Logistics and planning  systems play an important role within the maritime sub areas and here different ICT systems depend on always-on  and real-time information delivery from connected components and other systems. Furthermore, the consistency  and reliability of the information is of great importance.  In the rail sub area, the role of the infrastructure provider as well as the transportation company using the  infrastructure are equally important to protect the sub area against cyber-attacks. The wellbeing and functioning of  the city depends on a correct working transportation system.  6.2.1 Automatic train protection (ATP)  6.2.1.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is high because it takes care of critical transportation functions and malfunction may cause  severe accidents which jeopardize human life or nature (in chemical transportation for example).   Number of devices: is high because these systems are used all over in Europe   Safety issues: are of severe importance because security vulnerabilities discovered can allow attacker to  control railway automation which will jeopardize people safety and nature.   Security issues: many security issues because system functionality can be modified or controlled by an  attacker to cause an accident   Access vector: is high therefore there are well known attack vectors, such as:  o Safety system has several security weaknesses, including the ability to control the device without  authentication, and the use of known protocols such as XML over HTTP, which makes it possible to  create tools for controlling the device.  o Product has fail-safe software controller which automation tasks include also fail-safe control  functions and parallel data processing and the integration of the user's own technological functions.  Devices used in railway systems can be exposed to attacks due to the use of default credentials  because security features are not there or they are not taken into use, such as RCE vulnerabilities.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  38   Environmental issues: are of severe importance because if system is hacked or it cannot handle malware  infection it might start to function wrong way and cause severe accident which might affect to nature as  well in case of chemical transportation.  6.2.1.2 Findings  Industrial controllers are used as part of safety systems like ATP all over the railway systems in the EU. The controllers  allow for simple implementation of safety systems on PC-based solutions, like the train protection system SIBAS  which is widely adopted for use in Europe. The new ERTMS system make use of open standards and will gradually  replace legacy systems in use within Europe.  6.2.1.3 Recommendations  ATP systems shall be evaluated via conformance testing and system testing to ensure the devices follow up the rules  set up in standards. Automation systems securing needs also architectural based solutions like segregation and  network flow surveillance (E.g. IDS), good configuration management, patching but also communication with other  devices should be inspected carefully.  6.2.2 Computer based interlocking (CBI)  6.2.2.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is medium because attacks against CBI can be conducted by a malicious actor who has  physical access to the system or by using social engineering.   Number of devices: is high because devices are used all over Europe.   Safety issues: are of high impact because when an attacker has knowledge about railway automation or  routing protocols, access to the system can be reused to re-route trains and cause conflicting routes resulting  in collisions are crashes.   Security issues: are of medium severity because when the systems fail the driver is available to take control  and prevent incidents.   Access vector: is high because public networks are used   Environmental issues: are of high impact because chemical train accidents might cause severe issues   Intersystem dependencies: are of medium size.  6.2.2.2 Findings  Many standard off-the-shelf products are used, all running standard operating system hardware and using common  communication protocols like TCP/IP, soap based web services. Adequate patch-management and version control  are not in place.  6.2.2.3 Recommendations  Cyber security should be evaluated via conformance testing, penetration testing and inspected that devices follow  up the rules set up in standards. Standards also should be different for automation devices than IT systems and  environment. Automation systems are not set up same way as IT systems and their configuration, and  communication with other devices should be inspected carefully.  Adequate cyber security training and information security awareness should be conducted regularly, to take care of  password policies and avoid human based mistakes. Device security testing and overall system hardening to prevent  attack vectors need to be done.  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  39  6.2.3 Communication equipment based upon GSM-R  6.2.3.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is high because the communication is the backbone for all other connected systems in or  around the trains   Number of devices: many devices that are installed within Europe   Security issues: are of high severity because of the number of devices in the field a vulnerability will have a  major impact   Access vector: is medium because the networks are operated privately and there is limited connectivity with  public infrastructures   Environmental issues: are many because any intentional or unintentional cyber related activity can  jeopardize safety if vulnerability in system can cause malfunction and affect to train operations. However, if  connection is lost it stops train   Intersystem dependencies: are high because an attack via other systems such as via mobile phones is  possible but European Train Control System (ETCS) automatically stop if the connection between the train  and the control center is interrupted  6.2.3.2 Findings  GSM-R SIM cards and modems are used to connect trains to control centers and therefore have important role in  security. Even though SIM cards are encrypted it is always possible to cause jamming attack in order to prevent train  and the control center communication9. For example, a train using the European Train Control System (ETCS) will  stop if the connection is lost between train and control center.  This can cause issues when the train start moving  again with wrong time schedules and cause a collision. Furthermore, the lack of policies or best practices on using  non-standard PIN are problematic, when the default PINs are used and devices are managed via SMS it is easy to get  access.  Firmware updates cause another risk, in GSM-R devices. Also the firmware can include hardcoded private keys for  SSL certificates and remote admin rights when a man-in-the-middle type attack can be done. Also key management  will cause security issues. Because there are modems used for GSM-R that could also be vulnerable to the types of  mobile phone type of attacks.  6.2.3.3 Recommendations  Even though systems were separated from the Internet, security holes, wrong configuration and inadequate  hardening might offer attack vector, also radio frequency type attacks are possible to conduct if weak encryption is  in use.  Proper version and configuration management systems shall be in place, together with PIN management to avoid  the problematic use of standard PIN codes.  It is important to evaluate railway systems security as a whole, because weaknesses in communications between  other trains might cause collisions. Even though systems were separated from the Internet, security holes, wrong  configuration and inadequate hardening might offer attack vector, also radio frequency type attacks are possible to  conduct if weak encryption is in use.  9 Vulnerabilities in GSM-R have been extensively covered by the 32C3 conference talk “The Great Train Cyber Robbery\",  27/12/2015, available at  http://www.slideshare.net/AlexanderTimorin/the-great-train-cyber-robbery-scadastrangelove.

Sector: Transportation – Water transport  The water transport area consists of offshore and onshore systems which include management, communication  systems and operational systems that perform navigational and automation purposes. Within this report, the focus  is given to the vessel within the Maritime sector. Figure 7 gives an overview of the vessel’s systems and its onshore  connection. In a sense the ship behaves as a floating island operated through interacting IT and OT systems. A large  variety of systems are required, such as electric power generation, electric power distribution, vessel motion control,  automatic navigation track-keeping, safety systems, stability systems, IT networks, control (OT) networks, internet  connection, etc. The combination of these different systems makes it a complex computing environment.  Shipping of goods within Europe is still increasing and represents more than half of the maritime transport that is  carried out. Furthermore, maritime shipping increasingly relies on ICT to optimize operations and enable essential  maritime operations; navigation, propulsion, traffic control management, etc. Due to the increasing ICT, the  maritime sector becomes more vulnerable to cyber threats. As the maritime area is critical for the European society  (2016/1148/EU), significant cyber-attacks could lead to disastrous consequences on the safety, economics and the  European economy.  Figure 7 Overview of systems on a vessel  The maritime industry is continuously driving towards an increase the availability, security and reliability of the  software dependent systems, cyber security recommended practices have recently been published, describing the  first steps towards performing risk-based assessments of cyber security for the maritime assets (Dyryavyy, 2015a).  Existing standards and recommendations can give a certain level of cyber security resilience of on-board systems.  Desk Research  The maritime sector has been selected as a study focus on the vessels systems. Figure 7 shows a general architecture  of a vessel system. It shows the different devices needed for a safe and reliable operation. A vessel contains a diverse  variety of different systems, ranging from power management to propulsion and from navigation to entertainment  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  41  systems. The information technology and operational technology is increasingly interconnected. This brings more  risk of unauthorized access to these systems. Safety, environmental and commercial consequences of a cyber  incident may be significant. On board systems could include (Bimco, 2016):   Cargo management systems   Bridge systems   Propulsion and machinery management and power control systems   Access control systems   Passenger servicing and management systems   Passenger facing public networks   Administrative and crew welfare systems   Communication systems  Each of these systems play an important role on a vessel. Failure or compromising one of these systems can have  severe consequences. These systems could be considered for certification. The following four systems have been  selected for the focus of this study:   Integrated Bridge Systems (allows centralized monitoring and various navigational tools)   Cargo management systems   Passenger servicing and management systems   Propulsion and machinery management  In fo  rm a  ti o  n  T  e c h  n o  lo g  y  (  IT )  O n  b o  a rd  E n  te rp  ri s e  I T  Vessel  Intrusion  detection  Fleet  Management  Passenger  management  Crew  Entertainment  Customer  Manegement  Planning &  Logistcis  Power  Generation  Steering  HR, Finance  Navigation  Onboard  communication  O p e  ra ti o  n a  l  T e  c h n  o lo  g y  Maintenance  Booking  Systems  Mail System  Propulsion  Drainage /  pumping  Ballasting  Cargo  Management  Fire & Gas  Safety Systems  Passenger  accommodation  Auxiliary power  backup system  Watertight  integrity  Ship Admin  Systems  Passenger  entertainment  Backup  systems  Mail systen  Figure 8 Global and simplified architecture maritime vessel  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  42  7.1.1 Integrated Bridge Systems  Description Integrated Bridge Systems (IBS) is a combination of systems that are interconnected.

The maritime is well regulated internationally and uses international established standards and guidelines on  operational, design and safety topics. Logistics and planning systems play an important role within the maritime sub  areas and here different ICT systems depend on always-on and real-time information delivery from connected  components and other systems. Furthermore, the consistency and reliability of the information is of great  importance.  During the recent years, an increase of cyber-attacks has been observed within the Maritime transportation industry.  Although there has not been a catastrophic event to this date, stakeholders have taken on the task to assess this  emerging threat.  As mentioned in the 2011 ENISA study (ENISA, 2012) a holistic risk-based approach is recommended, which would  require the assessment of existing cyber risks associated with the current ICT systems implementations relevant to  the European maritime sector as well as the identification of all critical assets within this sector. For maritime  economic operators and stakeholders, it is important to proactively apply sound cyber and information security risk  management principles within their organizations and environments.  7.2.1 Integrated Bridge Systems  7.2.1.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is high because this system provides the navigational functionality of the ship   Number of devices: one per vessel (is an aggregate of several other navigational systems)   Security issues: expected to be high because it is a networked navigation system with interfaces to shore  side interfaces for updates which make this system vulnerable for cyber attacks   Access vector: expected to be high because all navigation systems within the same network are potentially  accessible by external actors either for maintenance of the software or simply has open ports.   Intersystem dependencies: are high because all associated systems for navigation will be affected like ECDIS,  GNSS, AIS, VDR and Radar/ARPA  7.2.1.2 Findings  An integrated bridge system (IBS) is a combination of interconnected systems to allow centralized access to sensor  information or monitoring/control from workstations. The aim is to increasing the safety and efficiency of the ship's  management. The details for each system boil down to integrated entities such as ECDIS, GNSS, AIS, VDR and  Radar/ARPA ECDIS, GNSS, AIS, VDR and Radar/ARPA.  7.2.1.3 Recommendations  As several navigational systems are integrated in this one integrated bridge concept, it is recommended to perform  security testing before delivery of the vessel or during operations if this step has not been performed. Software  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  45  components necessary for the operation of the integrated bridge system should be managed under configuration in  a manner to keep track of software updated and any changes to the security configuration.  7.2.2 Cargo management system  7.2.2.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is high because it performs the management and control of the cargo including hazardous  cargo   Number of devices: one system per vessel   Security issues: are of high importance because unauthorized persons could add see which (container) cargo  was loaded and subject to targeted high jacking. Other types of cargo such as LNG would pose other  hazardous threats when these dedicated types of cargo management systems would be tampered with.   Access vector: is high because the cargo system could be connected to shore-side cargo. However, the  access vector for onboard cargo management systems for bulk type cargo is limited as it is not normally  connected to the onshore systems.   Intersystem dependencies: are low because only the cargo management of the vessel will be affected.  However, information exchange with onshore system will exist.  7.2.2.2 Findings  In this section we opted to flag a publicly known incident known as the “Roman Holiday” (Szymanski, 2016): involved  an undisclosed global shipping conglomerate contacted the Verizon RISK Team after they became alarmed at a series  of attacks where the pirates were armed with very specific information in terms of the cargo onboard the vessel.  Attackers initially had uploaded a malicious Web shell to the shipping company’s Content Management System  (CMS) server, which manages shipping inventory and bills of lading for its ships.  “The threat actors used an insecure  upload script to upload the web shell and then directly call it as this directory was web accessible and had executed  permissions set on it”. This incident highlights the cargo/content management system to be important for the safe  and reliable transport operations.  7.2.2.3 Recommendations  Onshore Content Management systems should be in the scope of certified IT security management system, to be  audited and security tested.  7.2.3 Passenger servicing and management systems  7.2.3.1 Certification drivers   System criticality: is high because it provides boarding and access control holding passenger related  information, as well as property management   Number of devices: one on a vessel   Security issues: are of high severity because compromising this system could lead to unauthorized access  and boarding   Access vector: is high because several systems are needed to fulfill the functionality and it could be that it  interfaces with the internet so passenger are able to check in at home for example   Intersystem dependencies: low  7.2.3.2 Findings  IMO mandatory requirements for the electronic exchange of information on cargo, crew and passengers have been  adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) on 11/04/2016. These include standardized forms for  the maximum information required for the general declaration, cargo declaration, crew list and passenger list; and  agreed essential minimum information requirements for the ship's stores declaration and crew's effects  declaration.  Although standards and recommended practices relating to stowaways are updated to include  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  46  references to relevant sections of the International Ship and Port Facilities’ Security (ISPS) Code, the ISPS audits  do not currently address the cyber security aspect of the electronic passenger lists.  7.2.3.3 Recommendations  Passenger management systems should be in the scope of IT security management policies to be audited and  security tested against cyber security standards and IMO/ISPS code.  7.2.3.4 Propulsion and machinery management  7.2.3.5 Certification drivers   System criticality: is high because it initiates the movement of the ship as commanded by captain   Number of devices: one on each vessel   Security issues: are of high importance because an attacker could control a ship when the system is  compromised   Access vector: is low because this system is normally not connected to systems outside the vessel   Intersystem dependencies: are high because this system is interconnected to bridge monitoring systems  7.2.3.6 Findings  Currently there are various research projects aiming to connect the ship’s machinery to sensors in order to improve  maintenance using Condition Based Maintenance Systems. This may lead to new types of shore based connections  which would need to be further evaluated in the future in order to consider the need for cyber security related  certifications. Nevertheless, currently machinery and propulsion systems are subject to software upgrades and  software obsolescence. Furthermore, there are projects working on autonomous and even unmanned ships that  increase the information exchange with onshore system.  7.2.3.7 Recommendations  As software destined for propulsion systems can become obsolete and thus not upgraded to address newly found  vulnerabilities, it should be designed following a defined obsolescence management policy. Network storming tests  could be a means to check for robustness and segregation practices should be used in order to isolate machinery  and propulsion networks from other non-operational networks. If vendor support remote maintenance must be  used, then strong security policies should be applied to remote maintenance operations.

Conclusions  The main research aim of this study was to provide the decision makers with a thorough description of the cyber  security certification status concerning the most impactful equipment in different critical sectors, and to pave the  way towards a more harmonized approach to cyber security certification in EU based on the results of this study.  This has been performed by undertaking desk research and interviews with experts to answer the several research  questions. Based on the results, findings and recommendations have been presented for each sector.  Here we conclude by presenting common findings which apply to multiple or even all sectors, and are related to  using public or private infrastructures and testing of complete systems versus component testing. For each common  finding a recommendation is provided. Next, key recommendations are described. Finally, a table is presented  providing a clear overview of candidates for certification that should contribute to the agenda to work towards a  more harmonized approach to cyber security certification in EU.  Common Findings  The table below provides the common findings and recommendations:  COMMON FINDING RECOMMENDATION  In each sector the use of privately owned  infrastructures for data communication between  components or complete systems is considered more  secure, however public infrastructures are widely used.  The use of these public infrastructures introduces  additional challenges to a system.  Asset owners should take mitigating measures such as  the use of separated APNs when using public cellular  networks, VPNs when non-dedicated links are used and  additional encryption and authentication.  Furthermore, it was identified that although on  component level standalone certified devices are  considered trustworthy, this might not be the case  after their integration in a real computing environment,  causing proper planning and execution of system tests  to be critical. Device certification will help to get a  generic base line of device quality in terms of cyber  security requirements. However, it should be noted  that 100% guarantee does not exist when it comes to  cyber security of complex computing systems.  Certificate issuing bodies should issue certificates which  state that the component is certified as having certain  security capabilities built-in the given device, but cannot  be used as a guarantee that this device is used  (configured) correctly.  When it comes to building cyber security resilience in  the selected sectors, it is observed that a small part of  the security will be supported by the components or  devices that compose the systems while the larger part  of the security will depend on the processes and  procedures that are in place.  Organisations should consider the security certification  of the process as the highest priority in the whole  business chain (Dyryavyy, Y., 2015b).  Another important observation is the increased  outsourcing of specific cyber security relevant tasks or  functions, which will also increase the risk of being  vulnerable to cyber-attacks.  Customers should verify that external (third parties)  service providers, have all the required knowledge level  in the own organization before entering any contractual  agreement with them. This way they will make sure that  the specific domain (for example substation  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  48  automation) is known and understood by those  delivering the essential cyber security services.  This study focuses only on critical components that are  good candidates for cyber security certification. An  overall concern is the use of devices like laptops,  tablets and phones as entry points for potential attacks  or malware. This is a cross-section threat where  components connected to complex and critical systems  are mostly unmonitored and can cause serious danger  to the overall stability of such complex system. It  should be stated that cyber security certification is as  important for design, implantation, configuration,  operational and business processes.  Owners of critical infrastructures should take a holistic  approach that provides a certain level of security  assurance at every level of the business value chain  instead of merely focusing on the component level.  Overview findings of the given devices per sector  The table below presents a clear overview of candidates for certification that should contribute to the agenda to  work towards a more harmonized approach to cyber security certification in EU.

Sector: Transport - Maritime  Integrated Bridge  Systems (IBS)  -  Apply configuration and software change  management/tracking on software components  Overview findings of the given devices  Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments  December 2016  50  Key Recommendations  The following general key recommendations are determined for the manufacturers and the users of the certificates:   Organisations should strive for certifying their management system because it is a powerful tool that helps  companies to achieve their business goals. Process certification and compliance is vital to support product  quality, and it is often a ticket to the market. For markets large enough, product manufacturers can test and  certify their products only once as they can have them accepted in many other markets or countries  thereafter.   Both vendors and asset owners should take a holistic view when it comes to security certification and not  merely focus on the functional element of the devices they use. Only after verification of a system in its  entirety, including procedures for operation and maintenance, it can be considered cyber secure.   Organisations should invest more on improving the cyber security education of their engineers. This is  because they usually do not have cyber security culture as they are often confronted with new technologies,  or other domains unknown to them, until it is too late to adopt mitigation measures. Therefore, they need  to be educated, to become aware of cyber risks and to realize that the system is as strong as each individual  component, and that actions and decisions taken for a sub-part of the system can have a major impact on  the overall performance of the system itself.   Cyber security service providers are recommended to implement an IT service management framework in  their organizations as a proof that their services meet customers’ needs.   Whenever this is financially justified, customers should look for the use of security service providers who  provide a follow-the-sun support team in order to ensure maximum availability of their services.  Cargo management  systems  -  Apply network segregation and audit onshore  tracking systems against strict security policies  Passenger servicing  systems  -  Should be security tested to ensure remote  tampering possibility is reduced to a minimum.  Propulsion and  machinery system  -  Apply network segregation and firewall hardening.  Software should be managed for obsolescence.  Sector: Transport - Railway  Automatic train  protection (ATP)  Recommended to ensure to follow rules of the  standards.  Computer based  interlocking (CBI)  Using conformance and penetration testing of  devices against applicable standards.  Communication  equipment GSM-R  Important to evaluate railway system security as a  whole and harden the equipment.

CONCLUSIONS 22  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  3  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  The EU’s eIDAS regulation (EU Regulation 910/2014) sets rules for electronic identity schemes  and trust services in Europe, national eID schemes, cross-border interoperability and recognition.  eIDAS was adopted in July 2014 and came into force in 2016. One of the goals of eIDAS is to  ensure that electronic signatures can have the same legal standing as traditional signatures and to  remove barriers to electronic commerce and all types of electronic transactions in the EU. The  eIDAS regulation aims to:  • ensure that people and businesses can voluntarily use their own national electronic  identification schemes (eIDs) to access public services available online in other EU  countries.  • create a European internal market for trust services by ensuring that they will work across  borders and have the same legal status as their traditional paper-based equivalents.  Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation sets out the security requirements for the trust service providers  (TSPs) and introduces mandatory reporting of security breaches for TSPs in the EU. The reporting  obligation consists of three parts.  • Trust service providers must notify security breaches that have a significant impact to the  national supervisory bodies.  • The national supervisory bodies must inform each other and ENISA if there are  breaches which have an impact across borders.  • Every year national supervisory bodies must send annual summary reports about the  notified breaches to ENISA and the Commission.  This report, the Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2021, provides an aggregated  overview of the notified breaches for 2021, analysing root causes, statistics and trends. This  report marks the sixth round of security incident reporting for the EU’s trust services sector.  In this round of annual summary reporting a total of 27 EU countries and 3 EEA countries took  part. They reported a total of 46 incidents.  The key findings from the 2021 incident reports are summarised as follows.  • A steady increase in notified incidents: in 2021 notified incidents increased by  around 18%, same as the growth observed in 2020. This suggests that authorities  and TSPs are becoming more familiar with the process for reporting breaches and  their obligations under eIDAS.  • The number of incidents with a large impact has increased: in 2020 only 3  incidents were characterised as having had a ‘large impact’ as opposed to 2021  when 11 such incidents were reported (translating into approximately a quadruple  increase). Compared to previous years, it is evident that the numbers for 2020 were  outliers and that the norm is a ratio of circa 25% for incidents with large impacts.  The ratio of reported incidents concerning qualified trust services over non-qualified  ones remains high. In 2021, 80% of total incidents had an impact on qualified trust services  when compared with approximately 29% of incidents reported on non-qualified trust services.  Although non-qualified trust services are widely used, not much effort is made by operators on  related incident reporting. In most cases, notifications are performed by a TSP offering all types  of services (qualified and non-qualified), reporting an incident that has affected both their  qualified and non-qualified services.  HIGHLIGHTS 2021  The number of notified  incidents is steadily  increasing.  The number of incidents  with minor and large  impacts has increased.  As in previous years,  most reported incidents  concern qualified  certificates.  System failures account  for almost half of  incidents and have been  the dominant root cause  for the last five years of  incident reporting.  2021 witnessed an  increased in incidents  caused by malicious  actions (20%).  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  4  It needs to be highlighted that in 2021 significant improvement in this particular area was  noted compared to 2020 when the observation was first made. This is a testament to the value  of the work on incident reporting and the relevant analysis, which had a direct positive impact  on the overall process.  Although non-qualified trust services are widely used by citizens and enterprises, it seems that  the respective trust services operators do not make much effort to report related incidents. In  most cases, the notification is done by a TSP that also offers qualified services reporting an  incident that has affected both their qualified and non-qualified services. Having said this,  compared to 2020, 2021 witnessed an improvement in this direction with 9 incidents affecting  solely non-qualified services being reported.  The impact on subservices is mainly divided between certificate management (63% of  the incidents) and certificate generation (65% of the incidents), with a notable (more  than 50%) increase compared to 2020.  Approximately 66% (30 incidents) of the reported incidents were rated as minor,  showing stabilisation compared to 2020. No disastrous incidents were reported in 2021,  whereas a significant increase was observed for incidents with a large impact, which  quadrupled compared to 2020 and returned to 2018-2019 values. Furthermore, relative  stability in the number of minor incidents has been observed, indicating that the  incident reporting mechanism has become more familiar to the providers and they are  reporting more incidents regardless of their severity.  ENISA publishes detailed statistics about trust services security incidents in an online visual  tool, CIRAS Visual. This tool allows for custom analysis of trends and patterns1.  Currently the European Commission, Member States and the European Parliament are  discussing policy changes. Last year the Commission proposed to integrate Article 19, the  1 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-  analysis/visual-tool  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-analysis/visual-tool https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-analysis/visual-tool  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  5  security requirements for TSPs into a revised NIS (Network and Information Security)  Directive. The goal of this Commission proposal, the NIS2 proposal, is to simplify EU  cybersecurity legislation and to ensure that there is a similar approach across the various  sectors, including the telecom sector and the trust services sector, which are currently  addressed under separate pieces of legislation. This year the Commission will also make a  proposal for a new eIDAS regulation.  ENISA will continue to support national supervisory bodies with the implementation of breach  reporting under Article 19 of eIDAS and to work towards making this process more efficient  and effective, yielding useful data for the supervising bodies, for the national authorities, as  well as for the trust service providers and the organisations relying on these trust services.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  6  1. INTRODUCTION  Under Article 19 of the eIDAS Regulation2, Trust Service Providers (TSPs) in the EU are  expected to notify the national supervisory bodies in their country about security incidents. On  an annual basis, the supervisory bodies send summaries of these incident reports to ENISA.  Subsequently, ENISA publishes an aggregated overview of the reported security incidents.  This document gives an aggregate overview of the security incident reports submitted by the  supervisory bodies during 2021. This annual report marks the sixth round of security incident  reporting in the EU’s trust services sector, covering security incidents during 2021.  SCOPE  This report covers incidents reported by authorities under Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation.  TARGET AUDIENCE  The audience for this report includes experts in national authorities and experts in the sector.  CONTENT  This document is structured as follows: in section 2, the policy context is briefly summarised  as is the underlying eIDAS reporting framework and an overview of the types of incidents  reported is provided using anonymised examples.  In Section 3, further elaboration of the reported incidents is given, by presenting the categories  of root causes and the detailed causes as well as the affected services. In section 4, the multi- annual trends in incidents over the years 2016-2021 are highlighted. In Section 5, conclusions  and observations based on the available data are drawn.  DISCLAIMER  This document only contains aggregated and anonymised information about incidents and  does not include details about individual countries or individual trust service providers.  Detailed discussions about the reported security incidents take place in the ENISA Article 19  expert group, which is an informal group of experts from national supervisory bodies focusing  on the practical implementation of Article 19. The group is currently chaired by a  representative from RTR, the Austrian regulatory authority. ENISA acts as the secretariat and  supports the group with analysis, drafting, logistics, etc.  2 Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification  and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC, can be consulted  at https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  7  2. INCIDENT REPORTING FRAMEWORK  In this section, we give an overview of the formats and procedures for the reporting of  incidents (breaches) under Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation.  OVERVIEW OF INCIDENT REPORTING PROCESS  The mandatory notification process for security breaches has three steps as shown in the  figure below:  1. Trust service providers notify their national supervisory bodies about security  breaches that have significant impact.  2. The national supervisory bodies inform each other and ENISA if there is a cross- border impact.  3. The national supervisory bodies send annual summary reports about the notified  breaches to ENISA and the Commission.  INCIDENT REPORTING TOOL  Experts from the national authorities have access to the ENISA CIRAS (Cybersecurity Incident  Reporting and Analysis System) incident reporting tool3, where they can upload incident  reports and search for and study specific incidents.  We briefly introduce the reporting template. The template starts with a ‘type’ selector and has  three parts:  1. Impact of the incident: which trust services are impacted and by how much.  2. Nature of the incident: what caused the incident.  3 See https://ciras.enisa.europa.eu/  eIDAS Article 19  requires trust  service providers in  the EU to 1)  assess risks, 2)  take appropriate  security measures  to mitigate security  breaches, and 3)  notify breaches to  national  supervisory bodies.  https://ciras.enisa.europa.eu/  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  8  3. Details about the incident: detailed information about the incident, a short description,  the types of services, the types of assets, the severity level etc.   Type A: Service outage (e.g. continuity, availability); for example, an outage caused  by a cable cut due to a mistake by the operator of an excavation machine used for  building a new road would be categorised as a type A incident.   Type B: Other impact on service (e.g. confidentiality, authenticity, integrity), for  example, a popular collaboration tool has not encrypted the content of the media  channels, which are being established when a session is started, between the  endpoints participating in a shared session. This leads to the interception of the  media (voice, pictures, video, files, etc.) through a man-in-the-middle attack. This  incident would be categorised as a type B incident.   Type C: Impact on other systems (e.g. ransomware in an office network, no impact  on the service), for example, a malware has been detected on several workstations  and servers of the office network of a telecom provider. This incident would be  categorised as a type C incident.   Type D: Threat or vulnerability (e.g. discovery of crypto flaw), for instance, the  discovery of a cryptographic weakness would be categorised as a type D incident.   Type E: Impact on redundancy (e.g. failover or backup system), for example, the  breaking of one of two redundant submarine cables would be categorised as a type E  incident.   Type F: Near-miss incident (e.g. activation of security measures), for instance, a  malicious attempt that ends up in the honeypot network of a telecom provider would  be categorised as a type F incident.  Depending on the type selected, some fields in the template are deactivated. For example, in  the case of a Type A incident the fields ‘threat severity factors’ and ‘severity of threat’ are not  active.  ANONYMISED EXAMPLES OF SECURITY INCIDENTS  In this section we present some of the kinds of incidents that are reported, by providing  detailed and anonymised examples.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  9  Incident example 1  Incident type A-Core service outage  Service affected eSignature, eSeal, eTimestamp  Root cause System failure  Technical causes Overload  Assets affected • Generation (signatures, seals and timestamps)  • Certificate management (registration and creation  of certificates, suspension, revocation)  • Validation  Comment Unavailability of the eSignature/ eSeal/ eTimestamp services  due to a backend system overload.  Incident example 2  Incident type A-Core service outage  Service affected eSignature, eSeal  Root cause Malicious actions  Technical causes Ransomware  Assets affected Certification Authority (CA) platform, Generation and  validation of signatures/seals platform, Network platform  Comment Provider suffered a ransomware attack, but no systems  supporting trust services were affected. As a precaution all  systems were disconnected from the network. No certificates  had to be revoked.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  10  Incident example 3  Incident type A-Core service outage  Service affected eSignature, eTimestamp  Root cause System failure  Technical causes Software bug, configuration issue  Assets affected Generation and validation of  signatures/seals platform, Software  Comment An issue with configuration of a supporting system led to  the loss of availability of the eSignature and eTimestamp  services.  Incident example 4  Incident type B-Other impact on core service  Service affected eSignature  Root cause Malicious action  Technical causes Malware and viruses  Assets affected Generation and validation of signatures/seals platform  Comment The incident concerns the leak of credentials for qualified  signatures.

TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  12  3. INCIDENT ANALYSIS  The 2021 annual summary reporting by the 27 EU Member States and 3 EEA countries  participating in this process included 46 security incidents in total4. This is the sixth round of  annual summary reporting since eIDAS came into force on the 1 July 2016.  Figure 1: Number of reported incidents from 2016 - 2021 under Article of the eIDAS regulation  There is a steady increase in the number of incidents reported which, over the years, leans  towards becoming linear. This suggests that TSPs are becoming more familiar with the  process.  ROOT CAUSE CATEGORIES  Figure 2 below shows the distribution of the incidents according to their underlying root cause.  We categorise incidents into four categories of root causes: systems failures, human errors,  malicious actions and natural phenomena.  • System failures continue to be the dominant root cause, accounting for almost half of  the total reported trust services incidents (47%, around 22 incidents). Typically,  system failures are due to either hardware failures or software bugs.  • Almost 31% of incidents were categorised as human errors.  • Around 20% of the incidents were flagged as malicious actions.  • Natural phenomena accounted for 2% of the reported incidents.  4 Note that one of the reported incidents was indicated as type D-Active threats or vulnerabilities and is not included in the  analysis.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  13  Figure 2: Root causes of TSP security incidents – 2021  We also keep track of third-party failures, i.e. when the incident really originated at a third  party. For 2021, 14 incidents out of 45 were flagged as third-party failures (31.11%), well  above the 14% of incidents flagged as third-party failures in 2020. This finding further  reinforces the need to consider supply chain issues when it comes to security as the  increasing expansion and complexity of modern supply chains affects more and more  services. Out of the 14 third-party failures reported in 2021, 10 were categorised as system  failures, 3 as human errors and 1 as natural phenomena (arguably a natural phenomenon  should not be not classified as third-party failure). Figure 3 provides the full picture.  Figure 3: Root causes – third party failures – 2021  DETAILED CAUSES  The two most common detailed causes of incidents were flaws in an organisation’s policy or  procedures and faulty software changes/updates, with each one accounting for 20% of the  incidents, followed by other undefined causes (20%) and software bugs (13%).  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  14  It is important to note that an incident is often not triggered by only one cause but can involve  multiple detailed causes (i.e. a chain of events). Interestingly, supply chain causes that were  first introduced in 2021 accounted for 6% of reported incidents, highlighting the increasing  threat caused by supply chains as underlined in the ENISA Threat Landscape for Supply  Chain5 that was published in 2021.  The full breakdown of detailed causes6 for reported incidents may be seen in Figure 4.  Figure 4: Detailed causes of trust services security incidents - 2021  TYPES OF TRUST SERVICES AFFECTED  Most of the reported incidents (91.3%) had an impact on electronic signatures as can be seen  in Figure 5. This is a significant increase compared to 69% recorded in 2020. Interestingly  enough, no reported incidents affected web certificates or electronic delivery services. But  19.57% of reported incidents involved electronic seals and 15.22% electronic timestamps,  both exhibiting a 50% increase compared to 2020. It needs to be noted that several incidents  affected multiple services, hence the numbers in the figure correspond to more than 100%.  If we look back at the past years of reporting, we see a similar pattern: 83% of the reported  incidents had an impact on electronic signature services, while 29% affected electronic seals  and 20% affected timestamping services. In general, most incidents refer to electronic  signatures and this may be attributed to their widespread deployment and uptake in  comparison to electronic seals and timestamping services.  5 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for-supply-chain-attacks  6 The remaining 5% refers to specific detailed causes such as ransomware (~2%), DDoS (~2%) and malware and viruses  (~2%).  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for-supply-chain-attacks  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  15  Figure 5: Impact of incidents on trust services - 2021  For each incident we keep track of the underlying subservices affected. Most incidents have  an impact on the generation of signatures/seals/timestamps (65.22% up from 42% in 2020) or  certificate management (63.04% up from 47% in 2020) (see Figure 6). The impact on the  validation of subservices accounts for 15.22%. Once again, impact on multiple subservices  may be reported for incidents, hence the numbers in the figure account for more than 100%.  Figure 6: Impact of incidents on trust subservices – 2021  Figure 7: Technical assets affected – TSP security incidents 2021  Finally, we also keep track of the underlying assets affected by incidents. In most cases, the  assets affected are the platform for the generation and validation of signatures/seals (42%)  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  16  and the Certification Authority (CA) platform (33%). It is interesting to note that in 20% of the  reported incidents, the affected asset involved the registration authority’s platform and in 18%  of the cases the network platform. The dispersion of affected assets calls for a holistic  approach when it comes to the security of trust services, taking into account assets from  across the entire lifecycle and supply chain. See the impact on technical assets in Figure 7.  Figure 8: Breakdown of technical causes per affected asset – TSP security incidents 2021  By delving more into the affected technical assets, one can ascertain noteworthy differences  with regard to the corresponding technical causes (see Figure 8). In the case of the platform  for the generation and validation of signatures or seals, 36% of the incidents report flaws in  policies and procedures as the root cause and 21% software bugs. Conversely, in the case of  the Certification Authority’s platform, the two main root causes are flaws in processes or  procedures (46%) and faulty software updates (20%).  The registration platform incidents have an overwhelming 88% of flaws in policies and  procedures as their root cause, followed by 11% due to theft of data and 11% due to hardware  failures, whereas the network platform has 25% hardware failures, 25% faulty software  changes and 12% of ransomware, as well as a 12% of DDoS attacks as root causes. This  breakdown is extremely important in order to understand where emphasis should be prioritised  when it comes to targeted security controls in the various technical assets of TSPs.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  17  QUALIFIED SERVICES VERSUS NON-QUALIFIED SERVICES  This year nearly 80% of total security incidents affecting trust services had an impact on  qualified services (i.e. the creation of qualified signature certificates, the creation of qualified seal  certificates, etc.), while only a quarter of the incidents affected a non-qualified service. Again, it  is important to note that one incident report could involve multiple trust services, which  explains why the percentages in the Figure 9 below add up to more than 100%.  Figure 9: Reported Incidents affecting Qualified v Non-qualified services 2021  Note that, in most cases, the TSP notifying an incident is also offering qualified services and  that in most cases the impact on non-qualified services is reported as part of an incident report  for a qualified trust service (hence the numbers adding up to more than 100%). This suggests  that there is a gap in the reporting and that, while Article 19 is also concerned with non- qualified services, only the TSPs offering qualified trust services are reporting incidents, and  mostly do so concerning incidents that impact qualified services.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  18  4. MULTI-ANNUAL TRENDS 2016-2021  ENISA has been collecting and aggregating incident reports on trust services since 2016. In  this section, we look at multi-annual trends over the last six years, covering the period from  2016 to 2021. The total dataset contains 150 reported incidents.  MULTI-ANNUAL TREND IN ROOT CAUSE CATEGORIES  Over the last few years of reports on security incidents affecting trust services - as displayed in  Figure 10 - the most common root cause has been system failures. These add up to 54% as  shown in Figure 11, with human errors representing 28% of all reported incidents, 16%  involving malicious actions and 2% natural phenomena. One can observe a relative  stabilisation in the number of incidents related to system failures over the last 6 years, starting  from a peak of 100% in 2016 (first year of trust services annual incident reporting) to 52.8% in  2020 and 46.7% in 2021.  Note that we observe the same pattern in electronic communication services7, where system  failures account for almost two thirds (65%) of total incidents (926 out of 1432 incidents). In  the trust services sector, natural phenomena are not a common root cause. In comparison, the  telecom sector is quite different because it has extensive over-the-ground IT infrastructure  which is vulnerable to natural phenomena such as storms. Accordingly, in the case of natural  phenomena as a root cause, consistently low figures are being reported with a peak of 5.6% in  2018 and just 2.2 % being reported in 2021.  Figure 10: Root cause categories – Trust services security incidents in the EU (reported over  2016-2021)  Moreover, incidents concerning human errors are being reported at an increasing rate, with  28.1% in 2019, 38.9% in 2020 and 31.1% in 2021. Malicious actions vary over the years, with  the peak observed during 2018 (38.9%) and a value as low as 5.6% during 2020. During  2021, malicious actions were the root cause for 20% of the reported incidents.  7 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/for-telcos  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/for-telcos  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  19  Figure 11: Nature of reported incidents – Trust services security incidents in the EU (reported  over 2016-2021)  In particular for the incidents reported under the malicious actions category, the most common  detailed causes over the years as shown in Figure 12 were policy/procedure flaws (34%),  theft/loss of data (17%), theft/ loss of equipment (13%), malware (13%) and DDoS attacks  (13%).  It is interesting to contrast these findings with the latest version of the ENISA Threat  Landscape8 and the identified prime threats (threats against data, malware, threats against  availability, non-malicious threats, etc.). Despite the low number of incidents reported in the  field of trust services, there is an alignment with the findings of the ENISA Threat Landscape,  which illustrates the representative nature of the reports of trust services security incidents.  Figure 12: Detailed technical causes – Trust services security incidents in the EU (reported  over 2016-2021)  88 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2021  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2021  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  20  MULTI-ANNUAL TREND IN SEVERITY OF IMPACT  In the multi-annual trend concerning the severity of impact, the EU Cybersecurity incident  taxonomy is again followed where the severity of the impact has the following values: no  impact, minor, large and very large impact9.  While comparing the statistics for severity since 2016 (Figure 13), it is quite clear that the  number of incidents with a large impact increased significantly over the course of 2021  compared to the drop that was observed in 2020. It seems that the drop that was observed in  2020 was an outlier, and about 23% of incidents every year are reported as having a large  impact. It is interesting to see that there has been a rather linear increase in minor incidents  over the course of the last few years.  This is again an indication that the incident reporting mechanism has become more familiar to  trust services providers and also more effective; providers are reporting more incidents  regardless of their severity. In contrast to 2018, there were no very large (i.e. disastrous)  incidents during 2019 and 2021 (and only 1 such incident was reported in 2020).  Figure 13: Severity of impact – Trust services security incidents in the EU (reported over  2016-2021)  MULTI-ANNUAL TREND IN IMPACT ON SERVICES  When considering the impact per service during the course of 2016-2021 for reported  incidents for trust services, Figure 14 provides an overview. It is evident that the majority of  reported incidents relate to electronic signatures, with numbers ranging consistently above  66% (2018) and reaching peaks of 100% in 2016 and 93% in 2021.  9 See http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=53646  http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=53646  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  21  Figure 14: Impact on services – Trust services security incidents in the EU (reported over  2016-2021)  Electronic seals and electronic timestamps are respectively the second and third most affected  services, whereas it is interesting to note the consistently low values for web certificates and  electronic delivery services. The reason for the low number of reported incidents in the latter  two categories require further attention in order to investigate whether this is due to reduced  use of the services, better security provisions or lack of maturity in the reporting of such  incidents.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  22  5. CONCLUSIONS  The key takeaways from the 2021 incidents are:  • A steady lower level of severity confirms that TSPs are becoming more familiar with  the incident reporting process and that they are reporting more incidents, even if they  are less severe.  • Qualified trust services versus non-qualified trust services: the ratio of reported  incidents concerning qualified trust services over non-qualified ones remains high. In  2021, 80% of total incidents had an impact on qualified trust services when compared  with approximately 29% of incidents reported as having impacted non-qualified trust  services. Although non-qualified trust services are widely used, not much effort is  made by operators on related incident reporting. In most cases, notifications are  performed by a TSP offering all types of services (qualified and non-qualified)  reporting an incident that has affected both their qualified and non-qualified services.  It needs to be highlighted that in 2021 significant improvements in this particular area  were noted compared to 2020 when the observation was first made. This is a  testament to the value of the work on incident reporting and related analysis, which  had a direct positive impact on the overall process.  • System failures (47%) remain the dominant root cause and the second most  dominant are human errors at 31%. A notable increase in malicious actions (20%)  was observed in 2021.  • Root causes for malicious actions are consistent with the findings of the 2021  ENISA Threat Landscape. Despite the relatively low number of incidents reported in  the field of trust services, there is an alignment with the findings of the ENISA Threat  Landscape which illustrates the representative nature of reporting on security  incidents relating to trust services.  We conclude with some other observations:  • Reporting of threats/vulnerabilities in 2021: in 2021 authorities reported only one  threat/vulnerability. This vulnerability, which is not under the control of a TSP and  therefore can hardly be supervised, was reported as type D-incidents/vulnerabilities.  While challenging for authorities to report such vulnerabilities, the importance of  information sharing cannot be understated, in particular when it comes to malicious  actions. Early warnings and best practices on how to address malicious actions can  greatly help mitigate them and thus reduce the impact of potential incidents. It can  also serve as a great example of peer learning between authorities, learning from  one another on how best to mitigate potential threats.  • Supervision of non-qualified services: the supervision of, and incident reporting  by, non-qualified services remains a concern. As already mentioned, non-qualified  trust services are widely used. A good example is website (TLS) certificates, which  are a staple of online/internet security. Globally around 80% of websites use web  certificates. The fact that under Article 19 there are very few reports about incidents  with non-qualified trust services suggests there is still under-reporting in this area,  although nine purely non-qualified trust services incidents were reported in 2021,  thus showing growing maturity.  • EU policy changes: eIDAS regulations and eIDAS incident reporting have been in  place for more than five years now and eIDAS is currently under review. The  Commission is working on a proposal for a revised eIDAS regulation. In 2020, the  Commission also made a proposal for a revised NIS (Network and Information  Security) Directive, i.e. NIS2, which proposes the integration of eIDAS Article 19 with  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  23  the NIS Directive and there was a political agreement on the text in May 2022. Both  policy proposals are expected to deliver important improvements. These policy  changes present an opportunity to address some of the gaps in policy, for example,  the issue of supervision of and reporting by the providers of non-qualified services.  We look forward to supporting the Commission and the EU Member States with  implementing eIDAS security incident reporting in an efficient and effective manner  and contributing to consolidated incident reporting under NIS2.

CONCLUSIONS 22  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  3  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  The EU’s eIDAS regulation (EU Regulation 910/2014) sets rules for electronic identity schemes  and trust services in Europe, national eID schemes, cross-border interoperability and recognition.  eIDAS was adopted in July 2014 and came into force in 2016. One of the goals of eIDAS is to  ensure that electronic signatures can have the same legal standing as traditional signatures and to  remove barriers to electronic commerce and all types of electronic transactions in the EU. The  eIDAS regulation aims to:  • ensure that people and businesses can voluntarily use their own national electronic  identification schemes (eIDs) to access public services available online in other EU  countries.  • create a European internal market for trust services by ensuring that they will work across  borders and have the same legal status as their traditional paper-based equivalents.  Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation sets out the security requirements for the trust service providers  (TSPs) and introduces mandatory reporting of security breaches for TSPs in the EU. The reporting  obligation consists of three parts.  • Trust service providers must notify security breaches that have a significant impact to the  national supervisory bodies.  • The national supervisory bodies must inform each other and ENISA if there are  breaches which have an impact across borders.  • Every year national supervisory bodies must send annual summary reports about the  notified breaches to ENISA and the Commission.  This report, the Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2021, provides an aggregated  overview of the notified breaches for 2021, analysing root causes, statistics and trends. This  report marks the sixth round of security incident reporting for the EU’s trust services sector.  In this round of annual summary reporting a total of 27 EU countries and 3 EEA countries took  part. They reported a total of 46 incidents.  The key findings from the 2021 incident reports are summarised as follows.  • A steady increase in notified incidents: in 2021 notified incidents increased by  around 18%, same as the growth observed in 2020. This suggests that authorities  and TSPs are becoming more familiar with the process for reporting breaches and  their obligations under eIDAS.  • The number of incidents with a large impact has increased: in 2020 only 3  incidents were characterised as having had a ‘large impact’ as opposed to 2021  when 11 such incidents were reported (translating into approximately a quadruple  increase). Compared to previous years, it is evident that the numbers for 2020 were  outliers and that the norm is a ratio of circa 25% for incidents with large impacts.  The ratio of reported incidents concerning qualified trust services over non-qualified  ones remains high. In 2021, 80% of total incidents had an impact on qualified trust services  when compared with approximately 29% of incidents reported on non-qualified trust services.  Although non-qualified trust services are widely used, not much effort is made by operators on  related incident reporting. In most cases, notifications are performed by a TSP offering all types  of services (qualified and non-qualified), reporting an incident that has affected both their  qualified and non-qualified services.  HIGHLIGHTS 2021  The number of notified  incidents is steadily  increasing.  The number of incidents  with minor and large  impacts has increased.  As in previous years,  most reported incidents  concern qualified  certificates.  System failures account  for almost half of  incidents and have been  the dominant root cause  for the last five years of  incident reporting.  2021 witnessed an  increased in incidents  caused by malicious  actions (20%).  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  4  It needs to be highlighted that in 2021 significant improvement in this particular area was  noted compared to 2020 when the observation was first made. This is a testament to the value  of the work on incident reporting and the relevant analysis, which had a direct positive impact  on the overall process.  Although non-qualified trust services are widely used by citizens and enterprises, it seems that  the respective trust services operators do not make much effort to report related incidents. In  most cases, the notification is done by a TSP that also offers qualified services reporting an  incident that has affected both their qualified and non-qualified services. Having said this,  compared to 2020, 2021 witnessed an improvement in this direction with 9 incidents affecting  solely non-qualified services being reported.  The impact on subservices is mainly divided between certificate management (63% of  the incidents) and certificate generation (65% of the incidents), with a notable (more  than 50%) increase compared to 2020.  Approximately 66% (30 incidents) of the reported incidents were rated as minor,  showing stabilisation compared to 2020. No disastrous incidents were reported in 2021,  whereas a significant increase was observed for incidents with a large impact, which  quadrupled compared to 2020 and returned to 2018-2019 values. Furthermore, relative  stability in the number of minor incidents has been observed, indicating that the  incident reporting mechanism has become more familiar to the providers and they are  reporting more incidents regardless of their severity.  ENISA publishes detailed statistics about trust services security incidents in an online visual  tool, CIRAS Visual. This tool allows for custom analysis of trends and patterns1.  Currently the European Commission, Member States and the European Parliament are  discussing policy changes. Last year the Commission proposed to integrate Article 19, the  1 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-  analysis/visual-tool  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-analysis/visual-tool https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-analysis/visual-tool  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  5  security requirements for TSPs into a revised NIS (Network and Information Security)  Directive. The goal of this Commission proposal, the NIS2 proposal, is to simplify EU  cybersecurity legislation and to ensure that there is a similar approach across the various  sectors, including the telecom sector and the trust services sector, which are currently  addressed under separate pieces of legislation. This year the Commission will also make a  proposal for a new eIDAS regulation.  ENISA will continue to support national supervisory bodies with the implementation of breach  reporting under Article 19 of eIDAS and to work towards making this process more efficient  and effective, yielding useful data for the supervising bodies, for the national authorities, as  well as for the trust service providers and the organisations relying on these trust services.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  6  1. INTRODUCTION  Under Article 19 of the eIDAS Regulation2, Trust Service Providers (TSPs) in the EU are  expected to notify the national supervisory bodies in their country about security incidents. On  an annual basis, the supervisory bodies send summaries of these incident reports to ENISA.  Subsequently, ENISA publishes an aggregated overview of the reported security incidents.  This document gives an aggregate overview of the security incident reports submitted by the  supervisory bodies during 2021. This annual report marks the sixth round of security incident  reporting in the EU’s trust services sector, covering security incidents during 2021.  SCOPE  This report covers incidents reported by authorities under Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation.  TARGET AUDIENCE  The audience for this report includes experts in national authorities and experts in the sector.  CONTENT  This document is structured as follows: in section 2, the policy context is briefly summarised  as is the underlying eIDAS reporting framework and an overview of the types of incidents  reported is provided using anonymised examples.  In Section 3, further elaboration of the reported incidents is given, by presenting the categories  of root causes and the detailed causes as well as the affected services. In section 4, the multi- annual trends in incidents over the years 2016-2021 are highlighted. In Section 5, conclusions  and observations based on the available data are drawn.  DISCLAIMER  This document only contains aggregated and anonymised information about incidents and  does not include details about individual countries or individual trust service providers.  Detailed discussions about the reported security incidents take place in the ENISA Article 19  expert group, which is an informal group of experts from national supervisory bodies focusing  on the practical implementation of Article 19. The group is currently chaired by a  representative from RTR, the Austrian regulatory authority. ENISA acts as the secretariat and  supports the group with analysis, drafting, logistics, etc.  2 Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification  and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC, can be consulted  at https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  7  2. INCIDENT REPORTING FRAMEWORK  In this section, we give an overview of the formats and procedures for the reporting of  incidents (breaches) under Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation.  OVERVIEW OF INCIDENT REPORTING PROCESS  The mandatory notification process for security breaches has three steps as shown in the  figure below:  1. Trust service providers notify their national supervisory bodies about security  breaches that have significant impact.  2. The national supervisory bodies inform each other and ENISA if there is a cross- border impact.  3. The national supervisory bodies send annual summary reports about the notified  breaches to ENISA and the Commission.  INCIDENT REPORTING TOOL  Experts from the national authorities have access to the ENISA CIRAS (Cybersecurity Incident  Reporting and Analysis System) incident reporting tool3, where they can upload incident  reports and search for and study specific incidents.  We briefly introduce the reporting template. The template starts with a ‘type’ selector and has  three parts:  1. Impact of the incident: which trust services are impacted and by how much.  2. Nature of the incident: what caused the incident.  3 See https://ciras.enisa.europa.eu/  eIDAS Article 19  requires trust  service providers in  the EU to 1)  assess risks, 2)  take appropriate  security measures  to mitigate security  breaches, and 3)  notify breaches to  national  supervisory bodies.  https://ciras.enisa.europa.eu/  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  8  3. Details about the incident: detailed information about the incident, a short description,  the types of services, the types of assets, the severity level etc.   Type A: Service outage (e.g. continuity, availability); for example, an outage caused  by a cable cut due to a mistake by the operator of an excavation machine used for  building a new road would be categorised as a type A incident.   Type B: Other impact on service (e.g. confidentiality, authenticity, integrity), for  example, a popular collaboration tool has not encrypted the content of the media  channels, which are being established when a session is started, between the  endpoints participating in a shared session. This leads to the interception of the  media (voice, pictures, video, files, etc.) through a man-in-the-middle attack. This  incident would be categorised as a type B incident.   Type C: Impact on other systems (e.g. ransomware in an office network, no impact  on the service), for example, a malware has been detected on several workstations  and servers of the office network of a telecom provider. This incident would be  categorised as a type C incident.   Type D: Threat or vulnerability (e.g. discovery of crypto flaw), for instance, the  discovery of a cryptographic weakness would be categorised as a type D incident.   Type E: Impact on redundancy (e.g. failover or backup system), for example, the  breaking of one of two redundant submarine cables would be categorised as a type E  incident.   Type F: Near-miss incident (e.g. activation of security measures), for instance, a  malicious attempt that ends up in the honeypot network of a telecom provider would  be categorised as a type F incident.  Depending on the type selected, some fields in the template are deactivated. For example, in  the case of a Type A incident the fields ‘threat severity factors’ and ‘severity of threat’ are not  active.  ANONYMISED EXAMPLES OF SECURITY INCIDENTS  In this section we present some of the kinds of incidents that are reported, by providing  detailed and anonymised examples.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  9  Incident example 1  Incident type A-Core service outage  Service affected eSignature, eSeal, eTimestamp  Root cause System failure  Technical causes Overload  Assets affected • Generation (signatures, seals and timestamps)  • Certificate management (registration and creation  of certificates, suspension, revocation)  • Validation  Comment Unavailability of the eSignature/ eSeal/ eTimestamp services  due to a backend system overload.

TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  12  3. INCIDENT ANALYSIS  The 2021 annual summary reporting by the 27 EU Member States and 3 EEA countries  participating in this process included 46 security incidents in total4. This is the sixth round of  annual summary reporting since eIDAS came into force on the 1 July 2016.  Figure 1: Number of reported incidents from 2016 - 2021 under Article of the eIDAS regulation  There is a steady increase in the number of incidents reported which, over the years, leans  towards becoming linear. This suggests that TSPs are becoming more familiar with the  process.  ROOT CAUSE CATEGORIES  Figure 2 below shows the distribution of the incidents according to their underlying root cause.  We categorise incidents into four categories of root causes: systems failures, human errors,  malicious actions and natural phenomena.  • System failures continue to be the dominant root cause, accounting for almost half of  the total reported trust services incidents (47%, around 22 incidents). Typically,  system failures are due to either hardware failures or software bugs.  • Almost 31% of incidents were categorised as human errors.  • Around 20% of the incidents were flagged as malicious actions.  • Natural phenomena accounted for 2% of the reported incidents.  4 Note that one of the reported incidents was indicated as type D-Active threats or vulnerabilities and is not included in the  analysis.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  13  Figure 2: Root causes of TSP security incidents – 2021  We also keep track of third-party failures, i.e. when the incident really originated at a third  party. For 2021, 14 incidents out of 45 were flagged as third-party failures (31.11%), well  above the 14% of incidents flagged as third-party failures in 2020. This finding further  reinforces the need to consider supply chain issues when it comes to security as the  increasing expansion and complexity of modern supply chains affects more and more  services. Out of the 14 third-party failures reported in 2021, 10 were categorised as system  failures, 3 as human errors and 1 as natural phenomena (arguably a natural phenomenon  should not be not classified as third-party failure). Figure 3 provides the full picture.  Figure 3: Root causes – third party failures – 2021  DETAILED CAUSES  The two most common detailed causes of incidents were flaws in an organisation’s policy or  procedures and faulty software changes/updates, with each one accounting for 20% of the  incidents, followed by other undefined causes (20%) and software bugs (13%).  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  14  It is important to note that an incident is often not triggered by only one cause but can involve  multiple detailed causes (i.e. a chain of events). Interestingly, supply chain causes that were  first introduced in 2021 accounted for 6% of reported incidents, highlighting the increasing  threat caused by supply chains as underlined in the ENISA Threat Landscape for Supply  Chain5 that was published in 2021.  The full breakdown of detailed causes6 for reported incidents may be seen in Figure 4.  Figure 4: Detailed causes of trust services security incidents - 2021  TYPES OF TRUST SERVICES AFFECTED  Most of the reported incidents (91.3%) had an impact on electronic signatures as can be seen  in Figure 5. This is a significant increase compared to 69% recorded in 2020. Interestingly  enough, no reported incidents affected web certificates or electronic delivery services. But  19.57% of reported incidents involved electronic seals and 15.22% electronic timestamps,  both exhibiting a 50% increase compared to 2020. It needs to be noted that several incidents  affected multiple services, hence the numbers in the figure correspond to more than 100%.  If we look back at the past years of reporting, we see a similar pattern: 83% of the reported  incidents had an impact on electronic signature services, while 29% affected electronic seals  and 20% affected timestamping services. In general, most incidents refer to electronic  signatures and this may be attributed to their widespread deployment and uptake in  comparison to electronic seals and timestamping services.  5 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for-supply-chain-attacks  6 The remaining 5% refers to specific detailed causes such as ransomware (~2%), DDoS (~2%) and malware and viruses  (~2%).  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for-supply-chain-attacks  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  15  Figure 5: Impact of incidents on trust services - 2021  For each incident we keep track of the underlying subservices affected. Most incidents have  an impact on the generation of signatures/seals/timestamps (65.22% up from 42% in 2020) or  certificate management (63.04% up from 47% in 2020) (see Figure 6). The impact on the  validation of subservices accounts for 15.22%. Once again, impact on multiple subservices  may be reported for incidents, hence the numbers in the figure account for more than 100%.  Figure 6: Impact of incidents on trust subservices – 2021  Figure 7: Technical assets affected – TSP security incidents 2021  Finally, we also keep track of the underlying assets affected by incidents. In most cases, the  assets affected are the platform for the generation and validation of signatures/seals (42%)  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  16  and the Certification Authority (CA) platform (33%). It is interesting to note that in 20% of the  reported incidents, the affected asset involved the registration authority’s platform and in 18%  of the cases the network platform. The dispersion of affected assets calls for a holistic  approach when it comes to the security of trust services, taking into account assets from  across the entire lifecycle and supply chain. See the impact on technical assets in Figure 7.  Figure 8: Breakdown of technical causes per affected asset – TSP security incidents 2021  By delving more into the affected technical assets, one can ascertain noteworthy differences  with regard to the corresponding technical causes (see Figure 8). In the case of the platform  for the generation and validation of signatures or seals, 36% of the incidents report flaws in  policies and procedures as the root cause and 21% software bugs. Conversely, in the case of  the Certification Authority’s platform, the two main root causes are flaws in processes or  procedures (46%) and faulty software updates (20%).  The registration platform incidents have an overwhelming 88% of flaws in policies and  procedures as their root cause, followed by 11% due to theft of data and 11% due to hardware  failures, whereas the network platform has 25% hardware failures, 25% faulty software  changes and 12% of ransomware, as well as a 12% of DDoS attacks as root causes. This  breakdown is extremely important in order to understand where emphasis should be prioritised  when it comes to targeted security controls in the various technical assets of TSPs.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  17  QUALIFIED SERVICES VERSUS NON-QUALIFIED SERVICES  This year nearly 80% of total security incidents affecting trust services had an impact on  qualified services (i.e. the creation of qualified signature certificates, the creation of qualified seal  certificates, etc.), while only a quarter of the incidents affected a non-qualified service. Again, it  is important to note that one incident report could involve multiple trust services, which  explains why the percentages in the Figure 9 below add up to more than 100%.  Figure 9: Reported Incidents affecting Qualified v Non-qualified services 2021  Note that, in most cases, the TSP notifying an incident is also offering qualified services and  that in most cases the impact on non-qualified services is reported as part of an incident report  for a qualified trust service (hence the numbers adding up to more than 100%). This suggests  that there is a gap in the reporting and that, while Article 19 is also concerned with non- qualified services, only the TSPs offering qualified trust services are reporting incidents, and  mostly do so concerning incidents that impact qualified services.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  18  4. MULTI-ANNUAL TRENDS 2016-2021  ENISA has been collecting and aggregating incident reports on trust services since 2016. In  this section, we look at multi-annual trends over the last six years, covering the period from  2016 to 2021. The total dataset contains 150 reported incidents.  MULTI-ANNUAL TREND IN ROOT CAUSE CATEGORIES  Over the last few years of reports on security incidents affecting trust services - as displayed in  Figure 10 - the most common root cause has been system failures. These add up to 54% as  shown in Figure 11, with human errors representing 28% of all reported incidents, 16%  involving malicious actions and 2% natural phenomena. One can observe a relative  stabilisation in the number of incidents related to system failures over the last 6 years, starting  from a peak of 100% in 2016 (first year of trust services annual incident reporting) to 52.8% in  2020 and 46.7% in 2021.  Note that we observe the same pattern in electronic communication services7, where system  failures account for almost two thirds (65%) of total incidents (926 out of 1432 incidents). In  the trust services sector, natural phenomena are not a common root cause. In comparison, the  telecom sector is quite different because it has extensive over-the-ground IT infrastructure  which is vulnerable to natural phenomena such as storms. Accordingly, in the case of natural  phenomena as a root cause, consistently low figures are being reported with a peak of 5.6% in  2018 and just 2.2 % being reported in 2021.  Figure 10: Root cause categories – Trust services security incidents in the EU (reported over  2016-2021)  Moreover, incidents concerning human errors are being reported at an increasing rate, with  28.1% in 2019, 38.9% in 2020 and 31.1% in 2021. Malicious actions vary over the years, with  the peak observed during 2018 (38.9%) and a value as low as 5.6% during 2020. During  2021, malicious actions were the root cause for 20% of the reported incidents.  7 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/for-telcos  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/for-telcos  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  19  Figure 11: Nature of reported incidents – Trust services security incidents in the EU (reported  over 2016-2021)  In particular for the incidents reported under the malicious actions category, the most common  detailed causes over the years as shown in Figure 12 were policy/procedure flaws (34%),  theft/loss of data (17%), theft/ loss of equipment (13%), malware (13%) and DDoS attacks  (13%).  It is interesting to contrast these findings with the latest version of the ENISA Threat  Landscape8 and the identified prime threats (threats against data, malware, threats against  availability, non-malicious threats, etc.). Despite the low number of incidents reported in the  field of trust services, there is an alignment with the findings of the ENISA Threat Landscape,  which illustrates the representative nature of the reports of trust services security incidents.  Figure 12: Detailed technical causes – Trust services security incidents in the EU (reported  over 2016-2021)  88 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2021  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2021  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  20  MULTI-ANNUAL TREND IN SEVERITY OF IMPACT  In the multi-annual trend concerning the severity of impact, the EU Cybersecurity incident  taxonomy is again followed where the severity of the impact has the following values: no  impact, minor, large and very large impact9.  While comparing the statistics for severity since 2016 (Figure 13), it is quite clear that the  number of incidents with a large impact increased significantly over the course of 2021  compared to the drop that was observed in 2020. It seems that the drop that was observed in  2020 was an outlier, and about 23% of incidents every year are reported as having a large  impact. It is interesting to see that there has been a rather linear increase in minor incidents  over the course of the last few years.  This is again an indication that the incident reporting mechanism has become more familiar to  trust services providers and also more effective; providers are reporting more incidents  regardless of their severity. In contrast to 2018, there were no very large (i.e. disastrous)  incidents during 2019 and 2021 (and only 1 such incident was reported in 2020).  Figure 13: Severity of impact – Trust services security incidents in the EU (reported over  2016-2021)  MULTI-ANNUAL TREND IN IMPACT ON SERVICES  When considering the impact per service during the course of 2016-2021 for reported  incidents for trust services, Figure 14 provides an overview. It is evident that the majority of  reported incidents relate to electronic signatures, with numbers ranging consistently above  66% (2018) and reaching peaks of 100% in 2016 and 93% in 2021.  9 See http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=53646  http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=53646  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  21  Figure 14: Impact on services – Trust services security incidents in the EU (reported over  2016-2021)  Electronic seals and electronic timestamps are respectively the second and third most affected  services, whereas it is interesting to note the consistently low values for web certificates and  electronic delivery services. The reason for the low number of reported incidents in the latter  two categories require further attention in order to investigate whether this is due to reduced  use of the services, better security provisions or lack of maturity in the reporting of such  incidents.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  22  5. CONCLUSIONS  The key takeaways from the 2021 incidents are:  • A steady lower level of severity confirms that TSPs are becoming more familiar with  the incident reporting process and that they are reporting more incidents, even if they  are less severe.  • Qualified trust services versus non-qualified trust services: the ratio of reported  incidents concerning qualified trust services over non-qualified ones remains high. In  2021, 80% of total incidents had an impact on qualified trust services when compared  with approximately 29% of incidents reported as having impacted non-qualified trust  services. Although non-qualified trust services are widely used, not much effort is  made by operators on related incident reporting. In most cases, notifications are  performed by a TSP offering all types of services (qualified and non-qualified)  reporting an incident that has affected both their qualified and non-qualified services.  It needs to be highlighted that in 2021 significant improvements in this particular area  were noted compared to 2020 when the observation was first made. This is a  testament to the value of the work on incident reporting and related analysis, which  had a direct positive impact on the overall process.  • System failures (47%) remain the dominant root cause and the second most  dominant are human errors at 31%. A notable increase in malicious actions (20%)  was observed in 2021.  • Root causes for malicious actions are consistent with the findings of the 2021  ENISA Threat Landscape. Despite the relatively low number of incidents reported in  the field of trust services, there is an alignment with the findings of the ENISA Threat  Landscape which illustrates the representative nature of reporting on security  incidents relating to trust services.  We conclude with some other observations:  • Reporting of threats/vulnerabilities in 2021: in 2021 authorities reported only one  threat/vulnerability. This vulnerability, which is not under the control of a TSP and  therefore can hardly be supervised, was reported as type D-incidents/vulnerabilities.  While challenging for authorities to report such vulnerabilities, the importance of  information sharing cannot be understated, in particular when it comes to malicious  actions. Early warnings and best practices on how to address malicious actions can  greatly help mitigate them and thus reduce the impact of potential incidents. It can  also serve as a great example of peer learning between authorities, learning from  one another on how best to mitigate potential threats.  • Supervision of non-qualified services: the supervision of, and incident reporting  by, non-qualified services remains a concern. As already mentioned, non-qualified  trust services are widely used. A good example is website (TLS) certificates, which  are a staple of online/internet security. Globally around 80% of websites use web  certificates. The fact that under Article 19 there are very few reports about incidents  with non-qualified trust services suggests there is still under-reporting in this area,  although nine purely non-qualified trust services incidents were reported in 2021,  thus showing growing maturity.  • EU policy changes: eIDAS regulations and eIDAS incident reporting have been in  place for more than five years now and eIDAS is currently under review. The  Commission is working on a proposal for a revised eIDAS regulation. In 2020, the  Commission also made a proposal for a revised NIS (Network and Information  Security) Directive, i.e. NIS2, which proposes the integration of eIDAS Article 19 with  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  JULY 2022  23  the NIS Directive and there was a political agreement on the text in May 2022. Both  policy proposals are expected to deliver important improvements. These policy  changes present an opportunity to address some of the gaps in policy, for example,  the issue of supervision of and reporting by the providers of non-qualified services.  We look forward to supporting the Commission and the EU Member States with  implementing eIDAS security incident reporting in an efficient and effective manner  and contributing to consolidated incident reporting under NIS2.

This includes an annual campaign: Stay Smart Online  Week, which aims to raise awareness and drive  behaviour change to improve cyber security.  The ASCS identified a need to conduct exploratory  research to better understand audience awareness of  cyber security practices, as well as the ACSC and SSO  brand recognition. Identification of audience segments,  specifically, which groups are most likely to change  their behaviour or be resistant to change, is also  required.  This research will be used to inform next steps in  branding and communications.  Background  4  The overarching objective of the research program is to  understand levels of community awareness,  understanding and behaviours in relation to the current  cyber security threat in Australia.  The research will also establish the need and  requirement (or otherwise) for communications to  various audiences within the Australian community and  inform communication imperatives.  Specifically, the research was designed to establish:  • Awareness of the ASCS and knowledge of the  services and information it provides.  • Knowledge of where to go for information.  • Types of information desired by the Australian public.  • Levels of trust in various organisations and entities.  • The importance of online security to various  subgroups within the community.  • Levels of confusion with other services and  information sources, both government and non-  government sponsored.  • Changes that people are willing or unwilling to make  around cyber security.  Research objectives  5  J00989 – ASD – Cyber Security Research Report – September 2020  Research methodology  6  J00989 – ASD – Cyber Security Research Report – September 2020  The research was conducted in compliance with AS-ISO 20252.  Sample size  • A representative sample  of n=2,000 Australians,  aged 18 years and over.  Representation  • Survey quotas applied for  age, gender and location.  • Weighting applied at the  analysis stage to age /  gender / location  proportions based on ABS  census data.  Margin of error and  confidence level  • The maximum margin of  error on a sample of  n=2,000 is +/-2.2 at the  95% confidence level.  • Differences of +/-1% for  net scores are due to  rounding.  Timing  • 15 minutes in length (full  survey).  • Conducted from the 25th  August to the 1st  September 2020.  Nationally representative quantitative survey  The table below shows the definitions of sub-sample segments described throughout the report:  Reporting notes: segment definitions  7  J00989 – ASD – Cyber Security Research Report – September 2020  Label Description  SME Owner, financial partner or main decision maker in an Australian business turning over more than  $75,000 per annum  SME contracts cyber SME which hires or contracts a company/provider to manage IT and cyber security  ATSI Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander origin  CALD Culturally and/or linguistically diverse  Kids in hhold Dependent children aged 18 years or under living in household  Kids 0-9 yrs Dependent children aged 9 years or under living in household  Kids 10-18 yrs Dependent children aged between 10 to 18 years living in household  Heavy internet user Average of 6 hours or more spent on the internet each day, either personally or at workplace  Medium internet user Average of 2 to 6 hours spent on the internet each day, either personally or at workplace  Light internet user Average of up to 2 hours or less spent on the internet each day, either personally or at workplace  ‘Savvy’ segment Those with an expert or good understanding of cyber security who have implemented cyber security  measures in their household to a great or moderate extent  ‘Moderate’ segment Those with an average understanding of cyber security who have implemented cyber security measures  in their household to some extent or better  ‘At risk’ segment Those with a low or no understanding of cyber security and/or have implemented cyber security  measures in their household to a small extent or not at all  Executive  summary  8  Key insights summary and recommendations  9  J00989 – ASD – Cyber Security Research Report – August 2020  Use of multiple devices and programs leaves Australians exposed to cyber attack  in a multitude of ways. Almost universal internet connection also means that almost  everyone is vulnerable, with older and lower income people the most out of their  depth and least likely to be able to detect threats and protect themselves.  Cyber security  information is  relevant to  everyone  Many more people are aware of the risks and concerned about cyber security than  are actually capable and prepared against attacks. For example, older people,  regional residents, lower income earners and light internet users all report lower  levels of understanding or competency and should be a key target for information.  Poor understanding  and competency  make some groups  more vulnerable  Very few people know clearly what to do or where to go to be cyber secure, even  though they are generally aware of and concerned about a wide range of potential  threats across a variety of platforms and activities. The need for improved  education and information could not be clearer.  An obvious need  for better education  and information  There is some complacency towards cyber security, with feelings of security  exceeding measures actually implemented. Many people admit to the  implementation of little or no security measures. Improved implementation of basic  cyber security protocols is required across the population.  Complacency  compounds  potential exposure  to cyber attack  Government websites are considered a key information source on cyber security,  yet for the many people experiencing cyber breaches, only about 1 in 2 typically  reports, with a key reason being not knowing where to report. Lack of awareness of  a dedicated Government cyber security agency is part of the problem.  Lack of a known  cyber security  agency hampers  reporting of attacks  Key insights summary and recommendations (cont’d)  10  J00989 – ASD – Cyber Security Research Report – August 2020  There is low existing awareness of the ACSC, but very high trust among this aware  group, comparable to trust of the Australian Federal Police. Importantly, the ACSC  is intuitively thought of as the best source of cyber security information and for  assistance on cyber crimes.  The ACSC is trusted  by those who know  it, and naturally  trusted by others  The Australian Cyber Security Agency, by its very name, is naturally seen to have  credibility on cyber security issues. The ACSC engenders confidence. It is a well-  kept secret that needs to be shared and potentially positioned as the single source  for Government information and assistance on cyber security.  The ACSC name  automatically gives  it credibility  Australians are generally interested in knowing or hearing more about the  Australian Cyber Security Strategy, especially a 24/7 hotline. Most people would go  to the ACSC website for information or assistance on cyber crime, so it appears to  fill a gap in the market for a trusted Government source on cyber security.  The ACSC fills a  gap in the market  for a trusted source  on cyber security  It is a particularly compelling result that half the population wants to hear more  about cyber security. Identity theft, internet fraud, ransomware and email  compromise are the key areas of interest, but interest extends to all threats. A  single dedicated Government website is the main preferred source of information.  Most want more  cyber security info  from a single  Government site  Key opportunities for the ACSC  J00911 AVA Value to the Profession Board Presentation – September 2020  1. Raise profile of ACSC as the trusted Government source on cyber security  The name says it all – brand it consistently across all communications and advice and make the  ACSC the automatic go-to for all cyber security matters.  3. Tailor content to meet the needs of the different cyber segments  Tailor content for different cyber segments:  oAt risk need basic easy-to-follow information and advice to reduce their confusion.  oModerates need more detailed information to match their capacity to their exposure.  oSavvy need detailed, sophisticated and up-to-date information to help keep them informed  and responsive to emerging threats.  11  2. Define the core offerings  Clearly define the role of the ACSC – the site for prevention, reporting and response on cyber  security.  What is the ACSC’s role for each of the cyber segments?  12  J00966 Campaign Evaluation and Development Research – MCA – August 2020  • Highly connected, internet dependent and both aware and concerned about  cyber security threats – they are actively interested in knowing more.  • ACSC can play a vital role, as a ready reference for information and  recommended actions on new and emerging cyber threats.  • Prime segment candidate to subscribe to or follow the ACSC for alerts.  ‘Savvy’ segment is  proactively looking for  information and advice  to make them even more  cyber secure  Savvy segment: High level understanding of cyber security and implementation of cyber security  measures.  • Underestimate risks and their level of unpreparedness for cyber attacks. A  mistaken sense of security means they can be apathetic towards information.  • Role for the ACSC is to provide information and advice on the range of threats  via simple, easy to follow guides on how to become more cyber secure.  • Raise profile of ACSC as trusted go-to source on cyber security.  ‘Moderate’ segment is  apathetic towards risks  and need ACSC as an  easy go-to single source  of trusted information  Moderate segment: Average level understanding of cyber security and implementation of cyber security  measures.  • Poor comprehension and capacity on cyber security makes them particularly  vulnerable to attack and loss.  • Imperative is to raise profile of ACSC as a trusted source on cyber security.  • ACSC should provide step-by-step explanations, actions and advice on basic  protocols and behaviours to implement at least minimum protection.  ‘At risk’ segment has  poor comprehension on  cyber security and ACSC  needs to reach out to  them to provide basic  protection  At risk segment: Poor understanding of cyber security and implementation of cyber security measures.  Detailed findings  13  Context  14  Section summary – context  J00989 – ASD – Cyber Security Research Report – September 2020  15  Internet usage is  extensive across a  range of devices  Google Chrome (56%) and Google (54%) dominate search engines used, with one  out of every two people using at least one of these Google products. These  products are useable on both a Windows and Apple platforms, in contrast to Safari  (22%), the third-most commonly used browser, exclusive to Apple devices. On  average, Australians use two search engines or browsers.  Google dominates  search engines and  browsers  It is a truism that social media is synonymous with youth, and indeed most under  35s report using five or more sites, but it is not exclusively their domain. The  number of social media sites used does decrease with age, but most 35-59 year  olds use three or more sites and most over 60s use two or more sites. In order,  Facebook, Messenger, YouTube, Instagram and WhatsApp are the main sites.  Social media is no  longer just the  domain of young  people  The advent of connectivity of a wide range of household and portable devices,  particularly smart phones, laptops and tablets, are a key reason for extensive  internet usage. Approximately one in three (36%) adult Australians uses the internet  for six hours a day or more, and three out of four (74%) spend more than two hours  per day connected to the internet.  Email usage is universal, with 99% of Australian adults having an account. People  do not use as many different providers as they do with browsers and social media.  On average, people use 1.5 email providers, with potentially different providers  used between work and home, although people may have multiple accounts with  the same provider. Gmail (41%), Hotmail (39%) and Outlook (34%) are the key  email providers used.  Email usage is  universal, with a  preference for a  single provider  On average, younger and metro Australians are heavy  internet users, older and regional Australians lighter users  16  Significantly higher than the total at the 95% confidence interval.  S4. On average, how much of each day do you spend on the internet, either personally or at your workplace?  This includes accessing the internet on any device such as smartphones, iPads / tablets, laptop or desktop computers and includes any  manner of internet activities such as checking email, online gaming, browsing social media, streaming video, online shopping, etcetera.  Base: All respondents (n=2,000).

However, understanding is far lower, with  most only knowing ‘a bit’ about each threat. This lack of knowledge can contribute  to higher levels of anxiety and increase the potential of becoming a victim. The  greatest cyber security concerns relate to identity theft (76%) and fraud (72%).  High levels of  threat awareness  but limited  understanding  Cyber concerns are possibly exacerbated by the varying levels of understanding of  cyber security. The majority understands cyber security, but only one in four (28%)  considers themselves to have an ‘expert’ or ‘good understanding’. Many are  cognisant of the vulnerabilities every time they are online, as most agree anyone  can be the victim of cyber crime, with potentially very serious consequences.  Cyber security  concerns are  exacerbated by  varying degrees of  understanding  Levels of concern about cyber security are high, with approximately one in two  Australians indicating they are ‘extremely’ or ‘very concerned’ about it. They are  most concerned about cyber security for Government (54%) and business (46%),  more so than for themselves (43%).  Perception of the risk of experiencing a cyber breach does not reflect levels of  concern. Using social media is seen as attracting the highest level of vulnerability,  with three out of five (60%) believing a breach is likely, yet only a third (34%)  believe gaming and e-sports carry a risk. Some Australians’ self-assessment of  their understanding may not reflect reality.  Perception of risk  does not  necessarily reflect  the reality  Many people are concerned about cyber security, but more  so for Government and business than for themselves  25  Significantly higher / lower than the total at the 95% confidence interval.

Online searching is the most popular (40%), followed closely by  Federal Government websites (38%), cyber security companies (32%), internet  service providers (30%) and specialist IT companies (28%). The list is long,  however, and 10% admit to not knowing where to look.  Online searching  and Government  websites are top of  the information  consideration set  Cyber security behaviour reflects the variation in levels of awareness,  understanding and concern. For example 59% of people never share their  passwords and 57% say they are always wary of phishing and online scams,  leaving the remaining two out of five Australians potentially vulnerable. Despite  high usage, 14% of people never review their social media privacy settings.  Varying cyber  practices leave  Australians  vulnerable to attack  The level of cyber security is not necessarily reflected in the implementation of  preventative cyber security measures. Nearly half (47%) of Australians feel secure  based on the measures they have implemented, yet just 34% have put in place  extensive security measures (great / moderate). SMEs are slightly more realistic,  with one in two (52%) implementing extensive measures and 56% feeling secure.  Two out of five Australians (42%) have received a phishing email in recent years,  but more serious attacks such as unauthorised access to financial accounts is  much lower at 15% (of which 71% reported it, the highest for all the attacks  experienced). Overall, about half report any kind of attack, reasons for not  reporting include: it was not considered serious enough; they didn’t know where to  report it; or, they thought nothing would come of it. Just 15% say they would report  to ACSC’s ReportCyber.  Cyber complacency  is compounded by  not knowing where  to report attacks  Business more likely to have implemented cyber security  measures than households, but many have little protection  38  Significantly higher than the total at the 95% confidence interval.

They  understand and have implemented adequate levels of cyber security but not to the  same degree as the Savvy segment. As a result, while they believe they have a  good level of security, they are still vulnerable due to some deficits in their  knowledge and security measures. They are very receptive to learning more,  particularly from the ACSC, who is perceived to be a trustworthy source.  Moderate segment  The Savvy segment has a good understanding of cyber security and implements a  range of protective measures. This segment tends to be educated and heavy  internet users through multiple devices. They are vigilant, informed, and have an  ongoing interest in keeping up with the latest developments in cyber security and  threats. The ACSC can help to satisfy these needs for the Savvy segment.  Savvy segment  Segmentation will  be the key to the  strategy  A viable segmentation has been developed on the basis of the level of  understanding and the extent of cyber security measures implemented by  Australians. There is significant differentiation between the segments that will  enable the ACSC to develop targeted strategies to meet the needs of a very  disparate market.  ‘At risk’ describes this segment well, based on the implementation, or lack thereof,  of cyber security measures. Their knowledge and understanding of the importance  of cyber security is limited, and many of them are unconcerned about cyber  security. It is unclear if this is apathy or ignorance, but nonetheless, they are  exposed to significant risks every time they are on the internet.

Moderate  17%  40%  34% ‘Savvy’ skews male – 61% of this  cohort are men, they are more likely to  be employed, have higher education  levels, spend more than 6 hours per  day on the internet, with household  income over $100,000, and kids. They  are more likely to have a greater range  of devices including alarm / security  systems and home automation  connected to the internet. They are  also far more likely to be users of  multiple social media sites (2+ sites  82% vs 70% average).  Savvy  The ‘At risks’ skew female – 55% of  this cohort are women. At risk also  skews to the over 60s, households  with incomes under $50,000 and those  who spend up to two hours per day on  the internet. They are also less likely  to use multiple social media sites, but  they are still connected and  vulnerable.

Profile of segments (%)  J00989 – ASD – Cyber Security Research Report – September 2020  Savvy At riskModerate  ‘Savvy’ segment understand how critical cyber security is  at every level  53  J00989 – ASD – Cyber Security Research Report – September 2020  Who are they?  The Savvies skew male – comprising 61% of this cohort.  They are higher income and heavy internet users, spending  more than 6 hours per day on the internet. They are also  more likely to have a greater range of devices including  alarm / security systems and home automation connected to  the internet. In addition, Savvy cohort are also far more likely  to be users of multiple social media sites (2+ sites 82% vs  70% average).  What underpins their views?  • Savvies are significantly more likely to be extremely  or very concerned for themselves personally about  cyber security than the other segments (56% compared  to 43% among all Australians).  • Consistent with this concern, they are significantly more  likely to have higher levels of concern for their business  (68% vs 50% average), business in general (61% vs 46%  average) and the Government (65% vs 54% average).  • More than other segments, the Savvy segment think they  know what is required to ensure a high level of security  (82% vs 43% average). They also know where to go for  information (78% vs 41% average).  • This segment more than others believes that cyber crime  can ruin lives (87% vs 78% average). This  acknowledgment is vital to understanding the importance  of cyber security, particularly the businesses which they  are more likely to believe are at greater risk (50% vs 41%  average).  • Awareness of when and how breaches can occur online is  greater than for other segments: for example when  messaging or chatting online (60% vs 48% average), or  undertaking work activities (52% vs 39% average.)  • Savvies are confident that the measures implemented for  themselves (82% vs 47% average) and, if they are SMEs,  their businesses (79% vs 56% average) are secure. In  fact, when reviewing the measures implemented, there is  an extensive and more sophisticated range of measures  used, from password-protected routers (81% vs 60%  average) through to multifactor authentication (70% vs  46% average) and VPNs (46% vs 25% average).  • Consistent with their other behaviour, this segment has  significantly higher levels of awareness and concern for  the range of cyber threats. This raises the question of  whether they have experienced a cyber attack; however,  the incidence of cyber attack is in line with the other  segments.  • Should they want to obtain information, Savvies trust the  ACSC and are significantly more likely to go to the  website (72% vs 63% average).  • Overall, Savvies are significantly more likely to want to  hear more about cyber security (60% vs 50% average).  Savvy (17%)  The ‘Moderate’ segment has adequate levels of awareness  and knowledge but they are still vulnerable  54  J00989 – ASD – Cyber Security Research Report – September 2020  Who are they?  The demographic profile of the Moderate cohort follows that  of the Australian population in all respects other than  significantly higher middle income representation.  What underpins their views?  • Moderates think that they are informed about cyber  security. They are more likely to know where to go to find  information (48% vs 41% average). Furthermore, they are  also more likely to believe that they do everything they  can to prevent against cyber threats (66% vs 57%  average).  • Moderates are significantly more likely to consider the  measures implemented have given them a good level of  personal / household security (58% vs 47% average).  • There are a number of measures they are more likely to  implement, from using anti-virus software (77% vs 70%  average) through to using strong passwords / phrases  (73% vs 66% average). There are some differences  between the Savvies and the Moderates. The Savvies  have higher incidences of using more sophisticated  security measures, such as VPNs and passphrases.  • Moderates are generally aware of the cyber threats and  are concerned, but not to the same extent as the Savvy  segment.  • In regard to the organisations that can provide assistance  with cyber crimes, Moderates are significantly more likely  to nominate the ACSC (52% vs 46% average). There is no  apparent reason for this, other than to reinforce earlier  conclusions about the power of ACSC’s name association.  • The Moderates, as with all the segments, have a high  level of trust in the ACSC to provide cyber security  information (77% average). Compared to the Australian  population overall, significantly more Moderates would go  to the website to get this information (70% vs 63%  average) and to report a cyber crime if they are a victim  (76% vs 68% average).  Moderate (40%)  The ‘At risk’ segment does not sufficiently comprehend the  importance of cyber security  55  J00989 – ASD – Cyber Security Research Report – September 2020  Who are they?  The At risk segment skews female – 55% of this cohort are  female. They are lower income and lighter users, spending  up to two hours a day on the internet. They are also less  likely to use multiple social media sites.  What underpins their views?  • As can be expected, the At risk cohort are more likely  to be unconcerned about cyber security on any level –  personal (21% vs 16% average), for their own business  (33% vs 16% average) or business in general (18% vs  22% average).  • In the attitudinal statements, it is evident that they are less  concerned about cyber security, and significantly less  likely to know where to go to find out about it (22% vs 41%  average). Further, approximately half of the At risk  segment acknowledge that they do not know what to do to  prevent against an attack (47% vs 33% average).  • Of great concern is that SMEs in this segment are  significantly less likely to have implemented cyber security  measures for their business (57% ‘not at all’ or ‘to a small  extent’ vs 18% average). At risk SMEs are also less likely  to consider their business secure as result of these  measures (31% vs 56% average). This underestimation  of risk, coupled with their low levels of cyber security  knowledge, exposes them to cyber threats.  • Consistent with their other behaviours, the At risk  segment are significantly less likely to have  implemented any security measures, even the most  basic ones of antivirus software (58% vs 70% average) or  avoiding free Wi-Fi to conduct financial or sensitive  transactions (63% vs 71% average).  • This unpreparedness is further compounded by their  lower awareness and levels of concern in comparison to  the other segments of the various cyber threats. For  example, they are significantly less likely to be concerned  about online shopping or romance frauds (22% vs 29%  average).  • In terms of who they trust to provide information about  cyber security, seven out of ten of the At risk segment  would trust the ACSC. This segment is significantly less  likely to be aware of or know anything about the ACSC  (9% vs 19% average), so it is interesting that there is such  a high level of trust.  • Further, a majority (56%) would go to the ACSC website  to seek out information about cyber security. At the end  of this research, nearly half (47%) indicate that they  want to know more about cyber security.  • Overall, there is a vast difference in cyber security  understanding and behaviour between the Savvy and  At risk segments, but there is a glimmer of hope that  once At risk become aware of the risks, many will  want to rectify the situation and close their knowledge  gaps.  At risk (34%)  Trusted  organisations  56  Section summary – trusted organisations  J00989 – ASD – Cyber Security Research Report – September 2020  Limited awareness  and knowledge of  the ACSC except  among specific  audiences  Awareness of the Stay Smart Online program is low, with less than 1 in 3 (31%)  aware of the program and very few knowing a lot about it. There is not a strong  association that the ACSC runs the program. Overall, Stay Smart Online has a  limited trust rating among those aware of it.  Awareness and  trust of Stay Smart  Online is low  Irrespective of low awareness levels, the ACSC is nominated by approximately one  out of two Australians as the organisation that can assist with cyber security  information (54%), reporting a cyber crime (45%) and assisting with cyber crimes  (46%). Among those aware of the ACSC, it has exceptionally high levels of trust,  on par with the AFP – the only limitation is the ACSC’s low awareness.  ACSC – the name  gives the  organisation  credibility  The ACSC has a low level of awareness (31%) in comparison to organisations such  as the AFP (75%) and Border Force (65%). Interestingly, there is greater  awareness among those who have high levels of concern about cyber security for  both personal (37%) and business (60%) as well as those who self-classify as  having an ‘expert’ or ‘good’ understanding of cyber security.  The ACSC has relatively low awareness, although Stay  Smart Online awareness is even lower  58Q25. Which of the following organisations or programs are you aware of?

There is less, but still considerable, appetite for following the  ACSC on social media (42%) or subscribing to the ACSC alert service (39%).  ACSC – a one-stop-  shop for cyber  security  Given an explanation of the ACSC and its mission, 47% claim some awareness,  but only 19% say they have even limited knowledge of the ACSC. This contrasts  with the 31% who earlier said they are aware of the ACSC and claim to know  something. It can be hypothesised that, initially, Australians may have confused it  with another organisation, such as the ACCC.  The ACSC needs to  define its role and  raise its profile  Awareness of the 2020 Cyber Security Strategy is low, with only about one in ten  (12%) having ‘definitely’ heard of it. Once prompted, there is a lot of interest in  hearing about the different initiatives, particularly the 24/7 cyber security advice  hotline (32%).

One in four Australians want to know about all  potential threats. In addition to more information, Australians are also eager to  learn how to be more secure online, with only 10% having no interest in more  information about how to be secure online.  Avoiding internet  fraud and theft is of  paramount concern  There is unmet  demand for more  cyber security  information  There is an unmet demand for more, readily accessible information about  cyber security. One in every two Australians (50%) wants to hear more. This figure  is even higher among those who have already expressed that they are ‘extremely’  or ‘very concerned’ about cyber security. Only 6% have no interest in any  information. There is an urgency to provide this information due to the level of  exposure to cyber attacks of a notable proportion of SMEs and households.  ACSC is the ideal  source for  disseminating  cyber security  information  For most Australians, the preferred source to receive cyber security information is  through Government websites. A single dedicated Government website is the  leading preference of two out of every five Australians (38%), coupled with other  Government websites such as myGov (33%). A single site is more appropriate as  it is a single touchpoint for everything cyber-related. It simplifies the search  process and reduces confusion, an important consideration for people who are  confused and concerned about cyber security.  Half the population wants to hear more on cyber security,  more so among older and lower income Australians  69Q34. How much do you want to hear about cyber security?

This includes an annual campaign: Stay Smart Online  Week, which aims to raise awareness and drive  behaviour change to improve cyber security.  The ASCS identified a need to conduct exploratory  research to better understand audience awareness of  cyber security practices, as well as the ACSC and SSO  brand recognition. Identification of audience segments,  specifically, which groups are most likely to change  their behaviour or be resistant to change, is also  required.  This research will be used to inform next steps in  branding and communications.  Background  4  The overarching objective of the research program is to  understand levels of community awareness,  understanding and behaviours in relation to the current  cyber security threat in Australia.  The research will also establish the need and  requirement (or otherwise) for communications to  various audiences within the Australian community and  inform communication imperatives.  Specifically, the research was designed to establish:  • Awareness of the ASCS and knowledge of the  services and information it provides.  • Knowledge of where to go for information.  • Types of information desired by the Australian public.  • Levels of trust in various organisations and entities.  • The importance of online security to various  subgroups within the community.  • Levels of confusion with other services and  information sources, both government and non-  government sponsored.  • Changes that people are willing or unwilling to make  around cyber security.  Research objectives  5  J00989 – ASD – Cyber Security Research Report – September 2020  Research methodology  6  J00989 – ASD – Cyber Security Research Report – September 2020  The research was conducted in compliance with AS-ISO 20252.  Sample size  • A representative sample  of n=2,000 Australians,  aged 18 years and over.  Representation  • Survey quotas applied for  age, gender and location.  • Weighting applied at the  analysis stage to age /  gender / location  proportions based on ABS  census data.  Margin of error and  confidence level  • The maximum margin of  error on a sample of  n=2,000 is +/-2.2 at the  95% confidence level.  • Differences of +/-1% for  net scores are due to  rounding.  Timing  • 15 minutes in length (full  survey).  • Conducted from the 25th  August to the 1st  September 2020.  Nationally representative quantitative survey  The table below shows the definitions of sub-sample segments described throughout the report:  Reporting notes: segment definitions  7  J00989 – ASD – Cyber Security Research Report – September 2020  Label Description  SME Owner, financial partner or main decision maker in an Australian business turning over more than  $75,000 per annum  SME contracts cyber SME which hires or contracts a company/provider to manage IT and cyber security  ATSI Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander origin  CALD Culturally and/or linguistically diverse  Kids in hhold Dependent children aged 18 years or under living in household  Kids 0-9 yrs Dependent children aged 9 years or under living in household  Kids 10-18 yrs Dependent children aged between 10 to 18 years living in household  Heavy internet user Average of 6 hours or more spent on the internet each day, either personally or at workplace  Medium internet user Average of 2 to 6 hours spent on the internet each day, either personally or at workplace  Light internet user Average of up to 2 hours or less spent on the internet each day, either personally or at workplace  ‘Savvy’ segment Those with an expert or good understanding of cyber security who have implemented cyber security  measures in their household to a great or moderate extent  ‘Moderate’ segment Those with an average understanding of cyber security who have implemented cyber security measures  in their household to some extent or better  ‘At risk’ segment Those with a low or no understanding of cyber security and/or have implemented cyber security  measures in their household to a small extent or not at all  Executive  summary  8  Key insights summary and recommendations  9  J00989 – ASD – Cyber Security Research Report – August 2020  Use of multiple devices and programs leaves Australians exposed to cyber attack  in a multitude of ways. Almost universal internet connection also means that almost  everyone is vulnerable, with older and lower income people the most out of their  depth and least likely to be able to detect threats and protect themselves.  Cyber security  information is  relevant to  everyone  Many more people are aware of the risks and concerned about cyber security than  are actually capable and prepared against attacks. For example, older people,  regional residents, lower income earners and light internet users all report lower  levels of understanding or competency and should be a key target for information.  Poor understanding  and competency  make some groups  more vulnerable  Very few people know clearly what to do or where to go to be cyber secure, even  though they are generally aware of and concerned about a wide range of potential  threats across a variety of platforms and activities. The need for improved  education and information could not be clearer.  An obvious need  for better education  and information  There is some complacency towards cyber security, with feelings of security  exceeding measures actually implemented. Many people admit to the  implementation of little or no security measures. Improved implementation of basic  cyber security protocols is required across the population.  Complacency  compounds  potential exposure  to cyber attack  Government websites are considered a key information source on cyber security,  yet for the many people experiencing cyber breaches, only about 1 in 2 typically  reports, with a key reason being not knowing where to report. Lack of awareness of  a dedicated Government cyber security agency is part of the problem.  Lack of a known  cyber security  agency hampers  reporting of attacks  Key insights summary and recommendations (cont’d)  10  J00989 – ASD – Cyber Security Research Report – August 2020  There is low existing awareness of the ACSC, but very high trust among this aware  group, comparable to trust of the Australian Federal Police. Importantly, the ACSC  is intuitively thought of as the best source of cyber security information and for  assistance on cyber crimes.  The ACSC is trusted  by those who know  it, and naturally  trusted by others  The Australian Cyber Security Agency, by its very name, is naturally seen to have  credibility on cyber security issues. The ACSC engenders confidence. It is a well-  kept secret that needs to be shared and potentially positioned as the single source  for Government information and assistance on cyber security.  The ACSC name  automatically gives  it credibility  Australians are generally interested in knowing or hearing more about the  Australian Cyber Security Strategy, especially a 24/7 hotline. Most people would go  to the ACSC website for information or assistance on cyber crime, so it appears to  fill a gap in the market for a trusted Government source on cyber security.  The ACSC fills a  gap in the market  for a trusted source  on cyber security  It is a particularly compelling result that half the population wants to hear more  about cyber security. Identity theft, internet fraud, ransomware and email  compromise are the key areas of interest, but interest extends to all threats. A  single dedicated Government website is the main preferred source of information.  Most want more  cyber security info  from a single  Government site  Key opportunities for the ACSC  J00911 AVA Value to the Profession Board Presentation – September 2020  1. Raise profile of ACSC as the trusted Government source on cyber security  The name says it all – brand it consistently across all communications and advice and make the  ACSC the automatic go-to for all cyber security matters.  3. Tailor content to meet the needs of the different cyber segments  Tailor content for different cyber segments:  oAt risk need basic easy-to-follow information and advice to reduce their confusion.  oModerates need more detailed information to match their capacity to their exposure.  oSavvy need detailed, sophisticated and up-to-date information to help keep them informed  and responsive to emerging threats.  11  2. Define the core offerings  Clearly define the role of the ACSC – the site for prevention, reporting and response on cyber  security.  What is the ACSC’s role for each of the cyber segments?  12  J00966 Campaign Evaluation and Development Research – MCA – August 2020  • Highly connected, internet dependent and both aware and concerned about  cyber security threats – they are actively interested in knowing more.  • ACSC can play a vital role, as a ready reference for information and  recommended actions on new and emerging cyber threats.  • Prime segment candidate to subscribe to or follow the ACSC for alerts.  ‘Savvy’ segment is  proactively looking for  information and advice  to make them even more  cyber secure  Savvy segment: High level understanding of cyber security and implementation of cyber security  measures.  • Underestimate risks and their level of unpreparedness for cyber attacks. A  mistaken sense of security means they can be apathetic towards information.  • Role for the ACSC is to provide information and advice on the range of threats  via simple, easy to follow guides on how to become more cyber secure.  • Raise profile of ACSC as trusted go-to source on cyber security.  ‘Moderate’ segment is  apathetic towards risks  and need ACSC as an  easy go-to single source  of trusted information  Moderate segment: Average level understanding of cyber security and implementation of cyber security  measures.  • Poor comprehension and capacity on cyber security makes them particularly  vulnerable to attack and loss.  • Imperative is to raise profile of ACSC as a trusted source on cyber security.  • ACSC should provide step-by-step explanations, actions and advice on basic  protocols and behaviours to implement at least minimum protection.  ‘At risk’ segment has  poor comprehension on  cyber security and ACSC  needs to reach out to  them to provide basic  protection  At risk segment: Poor understanding of cyber security and implementation of cyber security measures.  Detailed findings  13  Context  14  Section summary – context  J00989 – ASD – Cyber Security Research Report – September 2020  15  Internet usage is  extensive across a  range of devices  Google Chrome (56%) and Google (54%) dominate search engines used, with one  out of every two people using at least one of these Google products. These  products are useable on both a Windows and Apple platforms, in contrast to Safari  (22%), the third-most commonly used browser, exclusive to Apple devices. On  average, Australians use two search engines or browsers.  Google dominates  search engines and  browsers  It is a truism that social media is synonymous with youth, and indeed most under  35s report using five or more sites, but it is not exclusively their domain. The  number of social media sites used does decrease with age, but most 35-59 year  olds use three or more sites and most over 60s use two or more sites. In order,  Facebook, Messenger, YouTube, Instagram and WhatsApp are the main sites.  Social media is no  longer just the  domain of young  people  The advent of connectivity of a wide range of household and portable devices,  particularly smart phones, laptops and tablets, are a key reason for extensive  internet usage. Approximately one in three (36%) adult Australians uses the internet  for six hours a day or more, and three out of four (74%) spend more than two hours  per day connected to the internet.  Email usage is universal, with 99% of Australian adults having an account. People  do not use as many different providers as they do with browsers and social media.  On average, people use 1.5 email providers, with potentially different providers  used between work and home, although people may have multiple accounts with  the same provider. Gmail (41%), Hotmail (39%) and Outlook (34%) are the key  email providers used.  Email usage is  universal, with a  preference for a  single provider  On average, younger and metro Australians are heavy  internet users, older and regional Australians lighter users  16  Significantly higher than the total at the 95% confidence interval.  S4. On average, how much of each day do you spend on the internet, either personally or at your workplace?  This includes accessing the internet on any device such as smartphones, iPads / tablets, laptop or desktop computers and includes any  manner of internet activities such as checking email, online gaming, browsing social media, streaming video, online shopping, etcetera.

However, understanding is far lower, with  most only knowing ‘a bit’ about each threat. This lack of knowledge can contribute  to higher levels of anxiety and increase the potential of becoming a victim. The  greatest cyber security concerns relate to identity theft (76%) and fraud (72%).  High levels of  threat awareness  but limited  understanding  Cyber concerns are possibly exacerbated by the varying levels of understanding of  cyber security. The majority understands cyber security, but only one in four (28%)  considers themselves to have an ‘expert’ or ‘good understanding’. Many are  cognisant of the vulnerabilities every time they are online, as most agree anyone  can be the victim of cyber crime, with potentially very serious consequences.  Cyber security  concerns are  exacerbated by  varying degrees of  understanding  Levels of concern about cyber security are high, with approximately one in two  Australians indicating they are ‘extremely’ or ‘very concerned’ about it. They are  most concerned about cyber security for Government (54%) and business (46%),  more so than for themselves (43%).  Perception of the risk of experiencing a cyber breach does not reflect levels of  concern. Using social media is seen as attracting the highest level of vulnerability,  with three out of five (60%) believing a breach is likely, yet only a third (34%)  believe gaming and e-sports carry a risk. Some Australians’ self-assessment of  their understanding may not reflect reality.  Perception of risk  does not  necessarily reflect  the reality  Many people are concerned about cyber security, but more  so for Government and business than for themselves  25  Significantly higher / lower than the total at the 95% confidence interval.

Online searching is the most popular (40%), followed closely by  Federal Government websites (38%), cyber security companies (32%), internet  service providers (30%) and specialist IT companies (28%). The list is long,  however, and 10% admit to not knowing where to look.  Online searching  and Government  websites are top of  the information  consideration set  Cyber security behaviour reflects the variation in levels of awareness,  understanding and concern. For example 59% of people never share their  passwords and 57% say they are always wary of phishing and online scams,  leaving the remaining two out of five Australians potentially vulnerable. Despite  high usage, 14% of people never review their social media privacy settings.  Varying cyber  practices leave  Australians  vulnerable to attack  The level of cyber security is not necessarily reflected in the implementation of  preventative cyber security measures. Nearly half (47%) of Australians feel secure  based on the measures they have implemented, yet just 34% have put in place  extensive security measures (great / moderate). SMEs are slightly more realistic,  with one in two (52%) implementing extensive measures and 56% feeling secure.  Two out of five Australians (42%) have received a phishing email in recent years,  but more serious attacks such as unauthorised access to financial accounts is  much lower at 15% (of which 71% reported it, the highest for all the attacks  experienced). Overall, about half report any kind of attack, reasons for not  reporting include: it was not considered serious enough; they didn’t know where to  report it; or, they thought nothing would come of it. Just 15% say they would report  to ACSC’s ReportCyber.  Cyber complacency  is compounded by  not knowing where  to report attacks  Business more likely to have implemented cyber security  measures than households, but many have little protection  38  Significantly higher than the total at the 95% confidence interval.

They  understand and have implemented adequate levels of cyber security but not to the  same degree as the Savvy segment. As a result, while they believe they have a  good level of security, they are still vulnerable due to some deficits in their  knowledge and security measures. They are very receptive to learning more,  particularly from the ACSC, who is perceived to be a trustworthy source.  Moderate segment  The Savvy segment has a good understanding of cyber security and implements a  range of protective measures. This segment tends to be educated and heavy  internet users through multiple devices. They are vigilant, informed, and have an  ongoing interest in keeping up with the latest developments in cyber security and  threats. The ACSC can help to satisfy these needs for the Savvy segment.  Savvy segment  Segmentation will  be the key to the  strategy  A viable segmentation has been developed on the basis of the level of  understanding and the extent of cyber security measures implemented by  Australians. There is significant differentiation between the segments that will  enable the ACSC to develop targeted strategies to meet the needs of a very  disparate market.  ‘At risk’ describes this segment well, based on the implementation, or lack thereof,  of cyber security measures. Their knowledge and understanding of the importance  of cyber security is limited, and many of them are unconcerned about cyber  security. It is unclear if this is apathy or ignorance, but nonetheless, they are  exposed to significant risks every time they are on the internet.

Moderate  17%  40%  34% ‘Savvy’ skews male – 61% of this  cohort are men, they are more likely to  be employed, have higher education  levels, spend more than 6 hours per  day on the internet, with household  income over $100,000, and kids. They  are more likely to have a greater range  of devices including alarm / security  systems and home automation  connected to the internet. They are  also far more likely to be users of  multiple social media sites (2+ sites  82% vs 70% average).  Savvy  The ‘At risks’ skew female – 55% of  this cohort are women. At risk also  skews to the over 60s, households  with incomes under $50,000 and those  who spend up to two hours per day on  the internet. They are also less likely  to use multiple social media sites, but  they are still connected and  vulnerable.

Base: All respondents (n=2,000).  Profile of segments (%)  J00989 – ASD – Cyber Security Research Report – September 2020  Savvy At riskModerate  ‘Savvy’ segment understand how critical cyber security is  at every level  53  J00989 – ASD – Cyber Security Research Report – September 2020  Who are they?  The Savvies skew male – comprising 61% of this cohort.  They are higher income and heavy internet users, spending  more than 6 hours per day on the internet. They are also  more likely to have a greater range of devices including  alarm / security systems and home automation connected to  the internet. In addition, Savvy cohort are also far more likely  to be users of multiple social media sites (2+ sites 82% vs  70% average).  What underpins their views?  • Savvies are significantly more likely to be extremely  or very concerned for themselves personally about  cyber security than the other segments (56% compared  to 43% among all Australians).  • Consistent with this concern, they are significantly more  likely to have higher levels of concern for their business  (68% vs 50% average), business in general (61% vs 46%  average) and the Government (65% vs 54% average).  • More than other segments, the Savvy segment think they  know what is required to ensure a high level of security  (82% vs 43% average). They also know where to go for  information (78% vs 41% average).  • This segment more than others believes that cyber crime  can ruin lives (87% vs 78% average). This  acknowledgment is vital to understanding the importance  of cyber security, particularly the businesses which they  are more likely to believe are at greater risk (50% vs 41%  average).  • Awareness of when and how breaches can occur online is  greater than for other segments: for example when  messaging or chatting online (60% vs 48% average), or  undertaking work activities (52% vs 39% average.)  • Savvies are confident that the measures implemented for  themselves (82% vs 47% average) and, if they are SMEs,  their businesses (79% vs 56% average) are secure. In  fact, when reviewing the measures implemented, there is  an extensive and more sophisticated range of measures  used, from password-protected routers (81% vs 60%  average) through to multifactor authentication (70% vs  46% average) and VPNs (46% vs 25% average).  • Consistent with their other behaviour, this segment has  significantly higher levels of awareness and concern for  the range of cyber threats. This raises the question of  whether they have experienced a cyber attack; however,  the incidence of cyber attack is in line with the other  segments.  • Should they want to obtain information, Savvies trust the  ACSC and are significantly more likely to go to the  website (72% vs 63% average).  • Overall, Savvies are significantly more likely to want to  hear more about cyber security (60% vs 50% average).  Savvy (17%)  The ‘Moderate’ segment has adequate levels of awareness  and knowledge but they are still vulnerable  54  J00989 – ASD – Cyber Security Research Report – September 2020  Who are they?  The demographic profile of the Moderate cohort follows that  of the Australian population in all respects other than  significantly higher middle income representation.  What underpins their views?  • Moderates think that they are informed about cyber  security. They are more likely to know where to go to find  information (48% vs 41% average). Furthermore, they are  also more likely to believe that they do everything they  can to prevent against cyber threats (66% vs 57%  average).  • Moderates are significantly more likely to consider the  measures implemented have given them a good level of  personal / household security (58% vs 47% average).  • There are a number of measures they are more likely to  implement, from using anti-virus software (77% vs 70%  average) through to using strong passwords / phrases  (73% vs 66% average). There are some differences  between the Savvies and the Moderates. The Savvies  have higher incidences of using more sophisticated  security measures, such as VPNs and passphrases.  • Moderates are generally aware of the cyber threats and  are concerned, but not to the same extent as the Savvy  segment.  • In regard to the organisations that can provide assistance  with cyber crimes, Moderates are significantly more likely  to nominate the ACSC (52% vs 46% average). There is no  apparent reason for this, other than to reinforce earlier  conclusions about the power of ACSC’s name association.  • The Moderates, as with all the segments, have a high  level of trust in the ACSC to provide cyber security  information (77% average). Compared to the Australian  population overall, significantly more Moderates would go  to the website to get this information (70% vs 63%  average) and to report a cyber crime if they are a victim  (76% vs 68% average).  Moderate (40%)  The ‘At risk’ segment does not sufficiently comprehend the  importance of cyber security  55  J00989 – ASD – Cyber Security Research Report – September 2020  Who are they?  The At risk segment skews female – 55% of this cohort are  female. They are lower income and lighter users, spending  up to two hours a day on the internet. They are also less  likely to use multiple social media sites.  What underpins their views?  • As can be expected, the At risk cohort are more likely  to be unconcerned about cyber security on any level –  personal (21% vs 16% average), for their own business  (33% vs 16% average) or business in general (18% vs  22% average).  • In the attitudinal statements, it is evident that they are less  concerned about cyber security, and significantly less  likely to know where to go to find out about it (22% vs 41%  average). Further, approximately half of the At risk  segment acknowledge that they do not know what to do to  prevent against an attack (47% vs 33% average).  • Of great concern is that SMEs in this segment are  significantly less likely to have implemented cyber security  measures for their business (57% ‘not at all’ or ‘to a small  extent’ vs 18% average). At risk SMEs are also less likely  to consider their business secure as result of these  measures (31% vs 56% average). This underestimation  of risk, coupled with their low levels of cyber security  knowledge, exposes them to cyber threats.  • Consistent with their other behaviours, the At risk  segment are significantly less likely to have  implemented any security measures, even the most  basic ones of antivirus software (58% vs 70% average) or  avoiding free Wi-Fi to conduct financial or sensitive  transactions (63% vs 71% average).  • This unpreparedness is further compounded by their  lower awareness and levels of concern in comparison to  the other segments of the various cyber threats. For  example, they are significantly less likely to be concerned  about online shopping or romance frauds (22% vs 29%  average).  • In terms of who they trust to provide information about  cyber security, seven out of ten of the At risk segment  would trust the ACSC. This segment is significantly less  likely to be aware of or know anything about the ACSC  (9% vs 19% average), so it is interesting that there is such  a high level of trust.  • Further, a majority (56%) would go to the ACSC website  to seek out information about cyber security. At the end  of this research, nearly half (47%) indicate that they  want to know more about cyber security.  • Overall, there is a vast difference in cyber security  understanding and behaviour between the Savvy and  At risk segments, but there is a glimmer of hope that  once At risk become aware of the risks, many will  want to rectify the situation and close their knowledge  gaps.  At risk (34%)  Trusted  organisations  56  Section summary – trusted organisations  J00989 – ASD – Cyber Security Research Report – September 2020  Limited awareness  and knowledge of  the ACSC except  among specific  audiences  Awareness of the Stay Smart Online program is low, with less than 1 in 3 (31%)  aware of the program and very few knowing a lot about it. There is not a strong  association that the ACSC runs the program. Overall, Stay Smart Online has a  limited trust rating among those aware of it.  Awareness and  trust of Stay Smart  Online is low  Irrespective of low awareness levels, the ACSC is nominated by approximately one  out of two Australians as the organisation that can assist with cyber security  information (54%), reporting a cyber crime (45%) and assisting with cyber crimes  (46%). Among those aware of the ACSC, it has exceptionally high levels of trust,  on par with the AFP – the only limitation is the ACSC’s low awareness.  ACSC – the name  gives the  organisation  credibility  The ACSC has a low level of awareness (31%) in comparison to organisations such  as the AFP (75%) and Border Force (65%). Interestingly, there is greater  awareness among those who have high levels of concern about cyber security for  both personal (37%) and business (60%) as well as those who self-classify as  having an ‘expert’ or ‘good’ understanding of cyber security.  The ACSC has relatively low awareness, although Stay  Smart Online awareness is even lower  58Q25. Which of the following organisations or programs are you aware of?

There is less, but still considerable, appetite for following the  ACSC on social media (42%) or subscribing to the ACSC alert service (39%).  ACSC – a one-stop-  shop for cyber  security  Given an explanation of the ACSC and its mission, 47% claim some awareness,  but only 19% say they have even limited knowledge of the ACSC. This contrasts  with the 31% who earlier said they are aware of the ACSC and claim to know  something. It can be hypothesised that, initially, Australians may have confused it  with another organisation, such as the ACCC.  The ACSC needs to  define its role and  raise its profile  Awareness of the 2020 Cyber Security Strategy is low, with only about one in ten  (12%) having ‘definitely’ heard of it. Once prompted, there is a lot of interest in  hearing about the different initiatives, particularly the 24/7 cyber security advice  hotline (32%). More than a quarter (27%) want to know about all aspects of the  Strategy and less than one in five (18%) are not interested in hearing anything.

Q32. The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) provides advice and information about how to protect you, your family and your business  online. ACSC leads the Australian Government’s efforts to improve cyber security. Their role is to help make Australia the safest place to  connect online. The ACSC is also responsible for running the Stay Smart Online program.

One in four Australians want to know about all  potential threats. In addition to more information, Australians are also eager to  learn how to be more secure online, with only 10% having no interest in more  information about how to be secure online.  Avoiding internet  fraud and theft is of  paramount concern  There is unmet  demand for more  cyber security  information  There is an unmet demand for more, readily accessible information about  cyber security. One in every two Australians (50%) wants to hear more. This figure  is even higher among those who have already expressed that they are ‘extremely’  or ‘very concerned’ about cyber security. Only 6% have no interest in any  information. There is an urgency to provide this information due to the level of  exposure to cyber attacks of a notable proportion of SMEs and households.  ACSC is the ideal  source for  disseminating  cyber security  information  For most Australians, the preferred source to receive cyber security information is  through Government websites. A single dedicated Government website is the  leading preference of two out of every five Australians (38%), coupled with other  Government websites such as myGov (33%). A single site is more appropriate as  it is a single touchpoint for everything cyber-related. It simplifies the search  process and reduces confusion, an important consideration for people who are  confused and concerned about cyber security.  Half the population wants to hear more on cyber security,  more so among older and lower income Australians  69Q34. How much do you want to hear about cyber security?

This stage can be accomplished  by exhausting the service or overloading the component of the network  infrastructure. 1 Malicious actors increased the number of attacks by  targeting more sectors with different motives. While defence mechanisms  and strategies are becoming more robust, malicious actors are also  advancing their technical skills. Reports 3,4,5  suggest that the usage of  reflected and amplified attack techniques facilitating new vectors other  than the commonly known ones (UDP amplification etc.) has increased. 6  Malicious actors are also improving their commercial tactics by starting to  advertise their services on the web. Historically, DDoS services were  advertised in the dark web forums, but now they use common social  media channels such as YouTube and Redit to promote their services. 2  In 2019, we saw new entries in the top 10 list of source countries  generating DDoS traffic (Hong Kong, South Africa, etc.). 7 It was also the  year that saw an increase in DDoS activity by botnets. IoT devices are a  ‘hotbed’ for DDoS botnets, and China (24%), Brazil (9%) and Iran (6%) were  considered as the countries most infected with botnet agents. 3 A security  researcher predicted that, the implementation and distribution of 5G  networks will exponentially increase the number of connected devices,  hence the expansion of botnet networks. 3  Although DoS attacks are not new to cybersecurity and network  defenders, their level of sophistication is increasing, and malicious actors  are observed to be actively running more reconnaissance activities than  before. 3,8  2  3  __Findings  241%_increase in total number of attacks during  Q3 2019 compared with the same period of 20183  79,7%_of all DDoS attacks were SYN-Floods7  86%_of the mitigated attacks during Q3 2019  were using more than two vectors9  84%_of the DDoS attacks lasted less than 10  minutes10,11  509_hours was the duration of the longest DDoS  attack in Q2 20193  4  Kill chain  Reconnaissance Weaponisation Delivery Exploitation  Step of Attack Workflow  Width of Purpose  Denial of service  5  Installation Command &  Control  Actions on  Objectives  MORE INFORMATION  The Cyber Kill Chain® framework was developed by  Lockheed Martin, adapted from a military concept related  with the structure of an attack. To study a particular attack  vector, use this kill-chain diagram to map each step of the  process and reference the tools, techniques and  procedures used by the attacker.  https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html  6  500-580 MILLION PACKETS PER SECOND SYN FLOODS. Among all the  techniques used by malicious actors, SYN Flood is still considered to be  challenging to mitigate based on its characteristics, the infrastructure  targeted and the fact that they require more hardware to handle a high  volume of packets. In January 2019, a security researcher observed a  record of SYN flood activity distributing 500 million packets per second  (mpps) targeting one of its clients and, subsequently, in April 2019, the  volume increased to 580 mpps. 12  WS-DISCOVERY. Web services dynamic discovery 13  (WS-Discovery) is a  multicast discovery protocol. It has been observed being used mostly by  IoT devices to automatically discover each node on local area networks  (LANs) but, like other protocols, it may not be used only for its intended  purpose, especially in the IoT realm 5.  Malicious actors have found it to be  a good hotbed for amplifying attacks. A security researcher reported 3 an  amplification factor of 95x while another researcher reported an  increase of 15.000% compared with the original byte size. 14  REFLECTED AND AMPLIFIED ATTACKS. These types of attacks are widely  and historically known to feature a small request to deliver a larger  payload. In summary, the malicious actor will spoof the sender’s (victim)  IP address and subsequently, the recipient host will send all the related  responses to the victim. 9 This methodology is mainly effective on UDP  based protocol because of their connectionless nature and amplification  factor (i.e. CLDAP has an amplification factor of x50-x70). However, TCP  protocol is not prone to this type of attack. 15  _The top five DDoS attacks  Incidents  7  A good example of such attempts are SYN-ACK reflected and amplified  flooding attacks – this type of flood does not necessarily need to be high  bandwidth to have an impact. In contrast, having a high packet per second  ration can keep the attack below the radar and increase its effectiveness. 3  BIT-AND-PIECE/CARPET BOMBING DDoS. This type of distributed and  reflective denial of service (DRDoS) attack is known to target mostly  telecommunication and service provider industries. 17  In one instance 18  of  this attack, a random selection of IP addresses of an Internet Service  Provider was targeted to reflect the traffic to the edge routers of the  provider. Thus, the victim was not able to identify the DDoS until their  service was overwhelmed by their own selected IP range. 19  MULTI-VECTOR DDOS ATTACKS. Malicious actors often carry out multiple  vectors of DoS attacks to add complexity and variety to their attempt. This  means that by merely automating different application layer (HTTP Flood,  DNS Flood etc.) and network layer (UDP/TCP reflection/amplification etc.)  types of attack, they will try to maximise its impact by saturating the  bandwidth as well as resources or services in the targeted environment. 16  0.50%  1.70%  9.40%  79.70%  ICMP  HTTP  UDP  SYN  0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%  Distribution of DDoS attacks by type.

SYN flood,  DNS response and TCP based attacks followed UDP floods in the list of top  attack vectors.  Multi-vector attacks were also observed during this period. However, a  security researcher believes that some of the multi-vector attacks are an  unintended by-product of a DoS attempt. 11  A cybersecurity report 17  suggested that DNS Amplification attacks were  observed by its team as the top DDoS attack vector followed by HTTP  flood and TCP SYN attacks.

Ensuring a response plan is in place  for such scenarios. 20   Depending on the requirements, considering DDoS protection service  or a DDoS managed service provider . Use of methods such as  monitoring for fast identification of infections. 1   Similar to the above point, publishing services through content  delivery networks can be an effective way of absorbing volumetric  attempts (requires other techniques in place for more sophisticated  attacks). 21   Internet Service and Cloud Providers play a critical role in defending  against DDoS attacks.  Having a clear communication plan and channel  with them is key to a successful response to a denial of service attack.   Developing a proactive and strong defensive posture before a critical  failure occurs involving the related team and vendors to configure and  tune controls based on specific business requirements. 22  Facilitating  cache servers or dropping inappropriate queries/request in the  application layer at source and implementing BCP 23  for service  providers are good instances of proactive measures.   Ensure you test and re-evaluate your defence techniques, technologies  and providers.   Produce a risk register by analysing your environment inside-out.  Starting from your critical assets inside and working your way to your  Internet footprint and presence. 24  11  “Although DDoS attacks are not new  to cybersecurity and  network defenders,  their level of  sophistication is  increasing, and  malicious actors are  observed to be  actively running  more reconnaissance  activities than  before”  in ETL 2020  12  References  1. “Understanding Denial-of-Service Attacks” November 20, 2019.

Ensuring a response plan is in place  for such scenarios. 20   Depending on the requirements, considering DDoS protection service  or a DDoS managed service provider . Use of methods such as  monitoring for fast identification of infections. 1   Similar to the above point, publishing services through content  delivery networks can be an effective way of absorbing volumetric  attempts (requires other techniques in place for more sophisticated  attacks). 21   Internet Service and Cloud Providers play a critical role in defending  against DDoS attacks.  Having a clear communication plan and channel  with them is key to a successful response to a denial of service attack.   Developing a proactive and strong defensive posture before a critical  failure occurs involving the related team and vendors to configure and  tune controls based on specific business requirements. 22  Facilitating  cache servers or dropping inappropriate queries/request in the  application layer at source and implementing BCP 23  for service  providers are good instances of proactive measures.   Ensure you test and re-evaluate your defence techniques, technologies  and providers.   Produce a risk register by analysing your environment inside-out.  Starting from your critical assets inside and working your way to your  Internet footprint and presence. 24  11  “Although DDoS attacks are not new  to cybersecurity and  network defenders,  their level of  sophistication is  increasing, and  malicious actors are  observed to be  actively running  more reconnaissance  activities than  before”  in ETL 2020  12  References  1. “Understanding Denial-of-Service Attacks” November 20, 2019.

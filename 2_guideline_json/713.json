If a supplier, manufacturer, distributor or  retailer (i.e. businesses that constitute a cyber supply chain) are involved in products or services used by an  organisation, there will be a cyber supply chain risk originating from those businesses. Likewise, an organisation will  transfer any cyber supply chain risk they hold to their customers.  Effective cyber supply chain risk management ensures, as much as possible, the secure supply of products and services  throughout their lifetime. This includes their design, manufacture, delivery, maintenance, decommissioning and  disposal. As such, cyber supply chain risk management forms a significant component of any organisation’s overall  cyber security strategy.  Managing the cyber supply chain  Cyber supply chain risk management can be achieved by identifying the cyber supply chain, understanding cyber supply  chain risk, setting cyber security expectations, auditing for compliance, and monitoring and improving cyber supply  chain security practices.  Identify the cyber supply chain  The first step in cyber supply chain risk management for an organisation is to identify their cyber supply chain. This  includes identifying all suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and retailers, and where possible, their sub-contractors.  Furthermore, it is important organisations know the value of data they process, store and communicate, as well as the  value of any data they entrust to other businesses.  As a starting point, organisations should establish a list of suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and retailers they have  business arrangements with. While an exhaustive list of such businesses, especially their sub-contractors, may not be  possible, the identification of those responsible for products or services with security enforcing functions, privileged  access, handling sensitive data, or will be used in sensitive locations should be prioritised.  Understand cyber supply chain risk  Following the establishment of a list of suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and retailers that organisations have  business arrangements with, organisations should seek to understand the cyber supply chain risk that those businesses  pose through established risk management practices. In many cases, cyber supply chain risk will be the result of foreign  control or interference, poor security practices, a lack of transparency, enduring access, or poor business practices.  More information can be found on these topics in the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC)’s Identifying Cyber  Supply Chain Risks publication.  Cyber Supply Chain  Risk Management  First published: November 2019  Last updated: May 2023  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/outsourcing-and-procurement/cyber-supply-chains/identifying-cyber-supply-chain-risks https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/outsourcing-and-procurement/cyber-supply-chains/identifying-cyber-supply-chain-risks  2  While the determination of cyber supply chain risk will often be the responsibility of individual organisations, in some  cases the Government may deem a particular supplier, manufacturer, distributor or retailer, or one of their products or  services, to be a national security concern. In such cases, there may be a specific direction issued in relation to  managing the associated cyber supply chain risk. In particular, for non-corporate Commonwealth entities and critical  infrastructure providers, the Protective Security Policy Framework and the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018  respectively grant provisions for directions to be issued by the Government where national security concerns exist.  As a result of understanding their cyber supply chain risk, organisations should be able to develop both a list of trusted  suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and retailers that can be used as well as a list of high risk suppliers,  manufacturers, distributors and retailers that should not be used. It is important to note though that organisations  should not only consider the cyber supply chain risk posed by other businesses but also the cyber supply chain risk that  they pose to their customers.  Set cyber security expectations  Regardless of which suppliers, manufacturers, distributors or retailers are used, organisations should seek to establish  cyber security expectations with all of these businesses. As part of this, cyber security expectations should be clearly  documented in contracts or memorandum of understandings where possible in order to ensure that businesses are  appropriately managing their own security posture, including their cyber supply chain risk. Furthermore, it is critical  that such agreements stipulate the requirement for any cyber security incidents to be openly and transparently  reported to their customers and appropriate authorities in a timely manner.  In many cases, cyber security expectations set out in contracts or memorandum of understandings should not be  excessively restrictive; except where suppliers, manufacturers, distributors or retailers are involved in the provision or  support to highly sensitive systems or facilities. Rather, cyber security expectations should be justifiable, achievable and  proportional to the data being entrusted to other businesses or the role that their products or services play in an  organisation’s systems or facilities. For example, organisations may seek businesses to demonstrate good faith efforts  to implement the ACSC’s Cyber Security Principles and/or the Essential Eight Maturity Model.  Audit for compliance  Once cyber security expectations have been established with suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and retailers, it is  important that organisations have confidence that those expectations are being met. One way to achieve such  assurances is through routine audits or other forms of technical assessments. Provisions for such activities should be  stipulated within contracts or memorandum of understandings (often referred to as a ‘right to audit’ clause) and can  serve as a way to gain independent assurances of the security posture of businesses.  Monitor and improve cyber supply chain security practices  Ultimately, effective cyber supply chain risk management is based upon trusted partnerships between suppliers,  manufacturers, distributors, retailers and their customers. Such partnerships can be strengthened through common  cyber security goals, data sharing arrangements (such as sharing best practices and threat intelligence), assisting each  other with responding to cyber security incidents and involving each other in cyber security exercises.  Further information  The Information Security Manual is a cyber security framework that organisations can apply to protect their systems  and data from cyber threats. The advice in the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents, along with its Essential  Eight, complements this framework.

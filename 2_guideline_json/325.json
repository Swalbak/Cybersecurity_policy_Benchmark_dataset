When security breaches are encountered in the headlines of bulletins,  blogs, newspapers, and technical reports, the focus is mostly either on  adversaries or on the catastrophic failure of the cyber-defence processes  and techniques. Nevertheless, the undisputable truth is that, despite the  impact or scope of such an event, the breach is usually caused by an  individual’s action or by an organisational process failure. 2  2  3  __Findings  2.013_confirmed data disclosures in 2019  During the first half of 2019, the organisations experienced an  11% increase in disclosures compared with 2018.5,6  14%_of all incidents in the financial sector were  data disclosures In 47% of them, the victim was a bank.9  4,1_billion data records were exposed globally in  the first half of 2019 E-mail and passwords were at the top of the list.10  €5,46_million is the highest cost incurred by  healthcare sector11  4  Kill chain  Reconnaissance Weaponisation Delivery Exploitation  Step of Attack Workflow  Width of Purpose  Information leakage  5  Installation Command &  Control  Actions on  Objectives  MORE INFORMATION  The Cyber Kill Chain® framework was developed by  Lockheed Martin, adapted from a military concept related  with the structure of an attack. To study a particular attack  vector, use this kill-chain diagram to map each step of the  process and reference the tools, techniques and  procedures used by the attacker.  https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html  6  Incidents   In January 2019, the independent researcher Troy Hunt found 773  million users’ e-mail addresses and passwords in the cloud-storage  service MEGA. Hunt named this breached dataset as ‘Collection#1’ and  notified the service ‘Have I been Pwned?’ so it could notify the account  owners to change their login passwords for accessing MEGA platform.12  In the same month, rogue individuals released personal details, private  communications, and financial information of hundreds of German  politicians, with targets representing every political party but the far-  right AfD (Alternative für Deutschland).6   In February 2019, more than 61 million accounts were culled from 16  websites and put up for sale on the dark web. Site owners of  Whitepages, Dubsmash, Armor Games, 500px and ShareThis saw their  users' stolen data sold for less than US $20.000 (ca. €17.000) in Bitcoin.13   In March 2019, hundreds of millions of Facebook and Instagram users  saw that their credentials were exposed by the social media company's  poor password storage management.14   In April 2019, 12,5 million medical records of pregnant women were  exposed in India, because of a leaky government server belonging to a  healthcare agency. The medical information exposed was related to the  pre-conception and pre-natal diagnostic techniques act, an Indian law  passed which that banning pre-natal sex determination in an attempt to  prevent Indian families from aborting unborn girls and skewing the sex  ratio towards boys.15  _ Top data leak incidents  7  Information disclosure root causes.

The subsequent investigation  determined that information such as names, e-mail addresses, delivery  addresses, order history, phone numbers and passwords had been  accessed. The company said that the last four digits of some  consumers' credit cards and bank account numbers had also been  accessed.16   In June 2019, the American Medical Collection Agency (AMCA) began  notifying clients of a system hack that breached the billing and medical  data of some of its clients, including 11,9 million records of Quest  Diagnostics, which is one of the largest blood testing companies in the  United States. According to a recent Securities and Exchange  Commission 8K filing, a hacker had gained access to the AMCA’s system  for nearly eight months between 1 August 2018 and March 30 2019.17  8  Incidents   In July 2019, the financial corporation Capital One suffered an  information leakage that affected 100 million credit card applications,  140.000 social security numbers and 80.000 bank account numbers.  Capital One reported that no credit card account numbers or login  credentials were exposed. However, the breach exposed names,  addresses, postal codes, phone numbers, e-mail addresses and birth  dates.18   In August 2019, 160 million records of MoviePass were left  unencrypted. Because the company's database wasn't password-  protected, it left customers' credit card numbers and other details  exposed. The database remained online for several days.19 Meanwhile, a  massive leak exposed 27,8 million biometric staff records held by the  British Metropolitan Police, banks and defence contractors. The  database was administered by Suprema, a company that collaborates  with the British police.20,21   In September 2019, more than 218 million ‘Words with Friends’ player  accounts were hacked. The users’ database included data from Android  and iOS players who had installed the game before September 2. The  hacker team ‘Gnostic players’ accessed information such as players'  names, e-mail addresses, login identities and more.23   In October 2019, Adobe left 7,5 million Creative Cloud customer records  on an insecure database. The information leakage included the users’ e-  mail addresses and payment status.24   In November 2019, Facebook gave inappropriate access to the profile  data of its 70.000 customers to about 100 app developers. One of them  stole the personal data and later used these data to scam them.25  _ Top data leak incidents  9   In December 2019, a Dutch politician faced 3 years in prison for  hacking 100 women’s iCloud accounts and leaking nude pictures. The  politician was found to have hacked the women's personal iCloud  accounts with credentials found in earlier public database breaches.26  During the same month, the details of over 10,7 million Metro-  Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) resort guests were disclosed on a hacking  forum. The leaked information included full customer name, home  addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and birth dates.27  Breach incident rates by level of security spent.

This term is  used to describe a person with an interest in ‘exfiltrating’ important inside  information on behalf of a third party. Other common attack vectors used  by this threat are misconfigurations, vulnerabilities and human errors.  _How  Types of sensitive or regulated data stored.

Deploy data and portable system and device encryption, and  secure gateways.36,38   A business continuity plan (BCP) is crucial for dealing with a data  breach. This plan outlines the type of data being stored and their  location, and what potential liabilities could arise when implementing  data security and recovery actions. A BCP entails an effective incident  response, which aims to address, manage, and rectify the damages  caused by such an incident.39  13  “In many cases,  companies or  organisations are  not aware of a data  breach happening in  their environment  because of the  sophistication of the  attack and  sometimes the lack  of visibility and  classification in  their information  system.”  in ETL 2020  14  References  1. “What is a data breach and what do we have to do in case of a data breach?” European  Commission. https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/reckless-campaign-cyber-attacks-russian-military- intelligence-service-exposed.  2.  “The humn factor of cyber security.” CSO.  https://www.csoonline.com/article/3504813/the- human-factor-of-cyber-security.html  3.

    "original document": "ENISA ETL2020 - Information Leakage  From January 2019 to April 2020  Information leakage ENISA Threat Landscape  Overview  A data breach occurs when data, for which an organisation is  responsible, is subject to a security incident resulting in a breach of  confidentiality, availability or integrity. 1  A data breach frequently causes  an information leakage, which is one of the major cyber threats, covering  a wide variety of compromised information from personal identifiable  information (PII), financial data stored in IT infrastructures to personal  health information (PHI) kept in healthcare providers’ repositories.  When security breaches are encountered in the headlines of bulletins,  blogs, newspapers, and technical reports, the focus is mostly either on  adversaries or on the catastrophic failure of the cyber-defence processes  and techniques. Nevertheless, the undisputable truth is that, despite the  impact or scope of such an event, the breach is usually caused by an  individual’s action or by an organisational process failure. 2  2  3  __Findings  2.013_confirmed data disclosures in 2019  During the first half of 2019, the organisations experienced an  11% increase in disclosures compared with 2018.5,6  14%_of all incidents in the financial sector were  data disclosures In 47% of them, the victim was a bank.9  4,1_billion data records were exposed globally in  the first half of 2019 E-mail and passwords were at the top of the list.10  €5,46_million is the highest cost incurred by  healthcare sector11  4  Kill chain  Reconnaissance Weaponisation Delivery Exploitation  Step of Attack Workflow  Width of Purpose  Information leakage  5  Installation Command &  Control  Actions on  Objectives  MORE INFORMATION  The Cyber Kill Chain® framework was developed by  Lockheed Martin, adapted from a military concept related  with the structure of an attack. To study a particular attack  vector, use this kill-chain diagram to map each step of the  process and reference the tools, techniques and  procedures used by the attacker.  https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html  6  Incidents   In January 2019, the independent researcher Troy Hunt found 773  million users’ e-mail addresses and passwords in the cloud-storage  service MEGA. Hunt named this breached dataset as ‘Collection#1’ and  notified the service ‘Have I been Pwned?’ so it could notify the account  owners to change their login passwords for accessing MEGA platform.12  In the same month, rogue individuals released personal details, private  communications, and financial information of hundreds of German  politicians, with targets representing every political party but the far-  right AfD (Alternative für Deutschland).6   In February 2019, more than 61 million accounts were culled from 16  websites and put up for sale on the dark web. Site owners of  Whitepages, Dubsmash, Armor Games, 500px and ShareThis saw their  users' stolen data sold for less than US $20.000 (ca. €17.000) in Bitcoin.13   In March 2019, hundreds of millions of Facebook and Instagram users  saw that their credentials were exposed by the social media company's  poor password storage management.14   In April 2019, 12,5 million medical records of pregnant women were  exposed in India, because of a leaky government server belonging to a  healthcare agency. The medical information exposed was related to the  pre-conception and pre-natal diagnostic techniques act, an Indian law  passed which that banning pre-natal sex determination in an attempt to  prevent Indian families from aborting unborn girls and skewing the sex  ratio towards boys.15  _ Top data leak incidents  7  Information disclosure root causes.

The subsequent investigation  determined that information such as names, e-mail addresses, delivery  addresses, order history, phone numbers and passwords had been  accessed. The company said that the last four digits of some  consumers' credit cards and bank account numbers had also been  accessed.16   In June 2019, the American Medical Collection Agency (AMCA) began  notifying clients of a system hack that breached the billing and medical  data of some of its clients, including 11,9 million records of Quest  Diagnostics, which is one of the largest blood testing companies in the  United States. According to a recent Securities and Exchange  Commission 8K filing, a hacker had gained access to the AMCA’s system  for nearly eight months between 1 August 2018 and March 30 2019.17  8  Incidents   In July 2019, the financial corporation Capital One suffered an  information leakage that affected 100 million credit card applications,  140.000 social security numbers and 80.000 bank account numbers.  Capital One reported that no credit card account numbers or login  credentials were exposed. However, the breach exposed names,  addresses, postal codes, phone numbers, e-mail addresses and birth  dates.18   In August 2019, 160 million records of MoviePass were left  unencrypted. Because the company's database wasn't password-  protected, it left customers' credit card numbers and other details  exposed. The database remained online for several days.19 Meanwhile, a  massive leak exposed 27,8 million biometric staff records held by the  British Metropolitan Police, banks and defence contractors. The  database was administered by Suprema, a company that collaborates  with the British police.20,21   In September 2019, more than 218 million ‘Words with Friends’ player  accounts were hacked. The users’ database included data from Android  and iOS players who had installed the game before September 2. The  hacker team ‘Gnostic players’ accessed information such as players'  names, e-mail addresses, login identities and more.23   In October 2019, Adobe left 7,5 million Creative Cloud customer records  on an insecure database. The information leakage included the users’ e-  mail addresses and payment status.24   In November 2019, Facebook gave inappropriate access to the profile  data of its 70.000 customers to about 100 app developers. One of them  stole the personal data and later used these data to scam them.25  _ Top data leak incidents  9   In December 2019, a Dutch politician faced 3 years in prison for  hacking 100 women’s iCloud accounts and leaking nude pictures. The  politician was found to have hacked the women's personal iCloud  accounts with credentials found in earlier public database breaches.26  During the same month, the details of over 10,7 million Metro-  Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) resort guests were disclosed on a hacking  forum. The leaked information included full customer name, home  addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and birth dates.27  Breach incident rates by level of security spent.

This term is  used to describe a person with an interest in ‘exfiltrating’ important inside  information on behalf of a third party. Other common attack vectors used  by this threat are misconfigurations, vulnerabilities and human errors.  _How  Types of sensitive or regulated data stored.

Deploy data and portable system and device encryption, and  secure gateways.36,38   A business continuity plan (BCP) is crucial for dealing with a data  breach. This plan outlines the type of data being stored and their  location, and what potential liabilities could arise when implementing  data security and recovery actions. A BCP entails an effective incident  response, which aims to address, manage, and rectify the damages  caused by such an incident.39  13  “In many cases,  companies or  organisations are  not aware of a data  breach happening in  their environment  because of the  sophistication of the  attack and  sometimes the lack  of visibility and  classification in  their information  system.”  in ETL 2020  14  References  1. “What is a data breach and what do we have to do in case of a data breach?” European  Commission. https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/reckless-campaign-cyber-attacks-russian-military- intelligence-service-exposed.  2.  “The humn factor of cyber security.” CSO.  https://www.csoonline.com/article/3504813/the- human-factor-of-cyber-security.html  3.

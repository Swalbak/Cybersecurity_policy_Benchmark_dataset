Nevertheless, the main goal of this document is to identify the  cybersecurity threats to European society and to identify priorities in research that will lead to mitigations  before those cybersecurity threats materialise. By identifying future problem areas, Europe can take a  proactive approach in defending against anticipated threats. The security of our information is  fundamental and as the pervasive digital transformation takes place, our lives become more exposed to  cybersecurity threats.  Based on desktop research and interviews with experts, an effort was made to foresee European society in  the near future of 2025, in doing so we have identified the key driving forces and uncertainties, and the  changes in society brought by innovation in the digitally connected world. In the effort to explore emerging  challenges in a systematic way, a framework has been introduced to guide the analysis. The framework  consists of three axes: social aspects, technology and business, along which future developments are  forecast. We have recognized the interdependencies among the digital and physical world, the  pervasiveness of connectivity in all aspects of society and industries, the evolution of the technologies and  their effect on society.  The report focuses on identifying emerging challenges and on those current challenges that are evolving  into significant risks to society. Closely related are those challenges in social dynamics brought about by  changes in society that have been enabled by technology. Underpinning this is a concern related to  education and awareness of the changing threat or risk environment. Based on this analysis, the report  identifies the following themes that suggest where future research should be focused on:   Awareness building – societal challenge  o Addressing the need, across society, to build awareness of the impact of technological  change on social evolution and hence on societal risk   Capacity building – educational challenge  o This recognises the shortage of cybersecurity experts and considers means to refresh  education at secondary and tertiary levels to bridge the gap   Existential threats – those threats that if enacted have potential to destroy the directly impacted  part of society, industry or business  o Artificial Intelligence - thanks to the pervasiveness of data collection by the Internet of  Everything (IoE), the processing power and storage capacity offered by the cloud, pattern  recognition and automatic decision will develop at great speed bringing new opportunities  and risks  o Quantum technologies, where uncertainty is a key characteristic, may be used in both  attack against current cryptographic protection methods, and in the development of new  computational models for further acceleration of change  o Complexity of interconnectedness that may lead to cascade fail of multiple systems across  the supply chain  o Cybercrime- thanks to digital transformation, digital identities and valuable assets may  become prey during a cyberattack.  Detection and mitigation of cyberattacks becomes  extremely important  o The threat to privacy is increasing with “big data” collection and unexpected inference  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  06  1. Introduction  The present document provides a series of recommendations for the priorities in the EU for R&D in the  domain of ICT security made after analysis of a wide series of interviews with domain experts.  The proposed research priorities have the aim to make Europe, ”a global leader in cybersecurity by 2025, in  order to ensure the trust, confidence and protection of our citizens, consumers and enterprises online and  to enable a free and law-governed internet”,1 as stated at the Tallinn Digital Summit in September 2017.  The focus of the report is to highlight and recommend how focussed R&D can address emerging challenges  that might pose a severe risk to our society. A key element is the recognition that the world is moving  digitally and fast. The speed of adoption of new technologies has a potentially huge benefit resulting in  increasing productivity, but at the same time may also pose risks if the technology where used against the  best interests of society. Social norms take dozens of years to develop and the digital transformation is  creating an increasingly blurred distinction between the digital and the physical world. In the digital world,  a small number of corporations, popularly referred to as Internet giants2, are increasingly required to  service the societies of the 21st century. However, this requires a trade-off between the user’s data and the  internet giants’ services: the users allow the digital platforms to track their location, record their interests  and monitor their online activities in return for a wide series of services demanded by the users. Data  collected from users are used for analytics purposes, which ranges from marketing campaigns and  promotions to deep machine learning and data mining.  It is a major challenge to imagine how society will be in a few years from now, and to consider the threats  to society at that time. In order to frame this, the broad assumption is that ICT will reach further into  society with more connectivity, further integration with everyday life activities through ICT, and this will  demand a response in both the design of ICT and the cybersecurity features of ICT products and services.  The concerns of the next few years however stretch far beyond the remit of only security technology and  many of the recommendations in the present document extend to gaining better understanding of how  ICT in general, and in particular, ICT incorporating cybersecurity features impact daily life.  Encouraging R&D in ICT security is essential to respond to the societal challenges that will arise from a fast  developing and fast changing ICT centred world that both contributes to, and threatens, the sustainable  development of the global economy and, particularly global social stability. The concern for making the  activity of the world secure, and the role of ICT technologies in supporting that world, is complex and  cannot be simply addressed in technology, thus this report asserts that the R&D focus has to be wider than  simply technology and address wider societal issues. In security, it is essential to consider the golden  triangle of People, Process, and Technology. If just one element of the three is missing, the risk rises  significantly.  1 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/soteu2018-cybersecurity-centres-regulation-630_en.pdf  2 Realistically this includes the largest companies quoted in the stock exchanges: Amazon with Amazon Web Services  and Alexa products; the Alphabet corporation, which owns the Google search engine, the YouTube platform and the  Android operating system for smartphones; Microsoft with operating systems and the Azure web service platform;  Apple with their ecosystem; Facebook with Instagram which dominates the social network in the western world. In  combination, their market capitalisation exceed of $3trilion in market, close to 20% of the combined GDP of the  EU28.  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  07  Unfortunately, it is a generally held view that security is a cost only exercise, and that making people pay  for security is often difficult. In fact, it is not always clear if the investment in security is effective, rather  than an attacker simply failing to carry out a successful attack. Thus, the cost effectiveness of working  security is often considered as hard to quantify.  In order to be able to prioritise research topics, and, perhaps more importantly, to be able to see the larger  picture and develop research programmes that are capable of addressing society challenges also a  broader, a high-level overview is needed, that shows how the many topics relate to each other. In that  light, Chapter 2 contains a narrative scenario that sketches a broad picture of society in 2025.  Based on this scenario, Chapter 3 provides a short description of the identified challenges and the  existential threats along with the associated recommendations to mitigate them.  A detailed analysis of the identified strategic topics and the related research questions are discussed in  Annex A: Awareness and education challenges and Annex B:Existential Threats.  Annex C concludes with the methodology used in the report, the European policy context and European  funding scheme for research and development.  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  08  2. Our Europe in 2025: a plausible scenario  Europe in 2025. Devices are connected to the internet and have permeated everywhere. All the essential  operators in all sectors (i.e. energy, transport, banks, digital infrastructure, hospitals), in all public  administrations and across industry are providing connected services. 80 billion devices (10 per person on  the planet) are connected through the internet and the quantities of data produced has been doubling  every 2 years.  Internet of everything (IoE) has transformed the ecosystem where we live and smart objects  have brought about an increase in productivity. It is common to use wearable devices controlled by voice  to reserve a table on line for a dinner, as well as having a 5G-connected autonomous shared car driving to a  business meeting. Education and training have been made more effective thanks to augmented reality and  gamification, which guarantee an immersive sensation and leverage the natural desire for socializing,  learning and competition. Important societal strategies have been identified to increase cybersecurity and  strengthen resilience to cyber-attacks. People's awareness, knowledge and motivation to be secure online  have been strengthened as media have been drawing attention to the issue. Community initiatives to  promote security by design in local infrastructures and systems have flourished, and companies and public  administrations have been developing procedures and implementing training programmes. However, this  has created a workforce of cyber-aware elites and a sub-culture of less aware workers that has increased  social tensions.  Governments are now demanding online-only access to taxes, pension and benefits, that require all  citizens to have and to use digital identities. Massive computing power and storage capacity are available  on the cloud and maintained in huge server farms that place significant demands on power and  telecommunications infrastructure. Industries have increased productivity by introducing sophisticated  sensor networks, machine-to-machine communication, additive manufacturing, robotics, machine  intelligence, analytics, and others enabled by smart sensors, cloud technology and virtualisation of  processes. More automation has been introduced across almost all forms of businesses. This automation  has been augmented by the application of artificial intelligence to provide significant levels of behavioural  analysis to the data captured from the always-online society, to provide greater insight and understanding  of consumer and business behaviour, and to develop ever more products and services to respond to their  needs.  In a completely digitized Europe, the internet giants have been able to assert even more control over the  economy, but additionally their platforms underpin almost all aspects of society (government, commerce,  health, transport, etc.). They are not only able to respond to customer demands, but they are the engines  that drive customers’ desires, making the customer both the product and the source of revenue driving  society. This has raised major concerns in government and in society regarding not just the power of the  internet giants but also regarding who leads and governs society. Some activists are refusing to use  internet at all driven by concerns regarding privacy risks, others are paying for hiding their online  behaviours.  As society has become more experienced in the use of the internet to share information, the already  evidenced poisoning of information has become increasingly widespread and controlled by both organised  crime and rogue states (or rogue elements in nation states). Using a number of psychologically informed  triggers to enforce confirmation bias through ”fake news” and by the ability to filter out any contrary  opinion, bad actors are actively removing informed societal debate. This has led to the spread of digital  ghettos of like-minded people on social networks that are seen as a risk to democracy by removing the  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  09  search for, and agreement on, a consensus, often requiring concessions for the greater good, that is  required in democratic societies.  In spite of the proliferation of a connected society, many public authorities still face the challenge of large  and complex, and in some cases, outdated ICT systems making it difficult to guarantee their security.  Citizens, business, and government have been increasingly the target of sophisticated attacks by malicious  parties. The capability to respond to cyber-attacks has been enhanced although the impact of cyber- attacks and cyber-crimes have been devastating. Law enforcement still do not have the capability to act as  fast as the criminals, who move freely in cyber space and take advantage of the uncertainty of  geographical location to keep ahead of law enforcement and of attempts to mitigate their actions.  The percentage of global reliance on ICT is difficult to judge. The growing dependence on an always  digitally connected society, where all sectors are dependent to some extent on ICT may lead to consider a  failure in ICT as an existential crisis. In fact, ICT is the binding critical infrastructure and a loss of ICT  through cyber-attack could lead to failure of all other critical infrastructures.  Quantum computing is still perceived as both an opportunity and a threat. Mastering quantum computing  might allow solving classes of problems that cannot be solved with classical computing in a reasonable  time. The public-key cryptographic solutions resistant to quantum computers has been emerging although  the wider problem of migration has no viable solution in sight.  Given the huge number of network-enabled relationships on which EU citizens’ and governments rely,  cybersecurity and privacy are areas of major policy concern.  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  10  3. Key Messages and Recommendations  In this chapter, the identified threats are briefly explained based on the scenario of Europe in 2025, which  has been presented in the previous chapter. Associated with each threat, an area of intervention that  might mitigate the emerging threat is proposed. This constitutes the base of our recommendations for the  strategic priorities in research and development. A detailed analysis of the identified strategic topics and  the related research questions are further discussed in Annex A: Awareness and education challenges and  Annex B: Existential Threats.  Awareness building – societal challenge  Any irrevocable societal change takes time to become a behavioural norm. Digital transformation is an  example of an irrevocable societal change that is rapidly changing how we behave. The pace of  transformation has left too many unaware of the impact of that change and the consequent risks that the  new behaviour introduces.  Up to now, cybersecurity campaigns have not had the desired outcome and  many still do not know how to behave safely in the digital world.  Cybersecurity must become a shared responsibility and all the actors should facilitate a secure and  responsible digital world. However, to achieve that, it is essential to have a thorough understanding of  related risks and threats, as well as ways to secure and protect against them. This requires a deep  understanding of the human behaviour and psychology of change, of how societies work and of social  science in general. Bringing these disciplines together is one path to ensure that the changes wrought by  increasing digitisation of society, and the resultant change in threat and risk, can be safely managed.  Recommendations on the societal challenge: awareness building  Promote an understanding of how people use and adapt to technology, in order to better  model both risk perception and risk reality with a view to providing a concrete basis of why  cyber-security technology is required and what its limitations are.  Promote systems that are designed with security and privacy protection features in place and  have intuitive user interfaces  Encourage innovations on communicating cybersecurity risks  Based on these high-level recommendations, we identified specific research actions:   Multi-disciplinary research is needed to model and design future systems in such a way that they are  more easily comprehended. This needs a strong collaboration between experts in social disciplines  (e.g. anthropology, psychology, sociology) in economics (e.g game theory) and in technology. Large- scale demonstrators should be used to prove the research solutions are valid in real social  environments. The intent of this field of research is to gain understanding of how people adopt and  use new technology and how risk is perceived in the digital world.   Research and experimentation in the field of social science is needed to create more awareness of  security risks. Moreover, it should be understood how people perceive threats in the digital world and  how that perception is used to generate both conscious and impulsive mitigations. Some help in this  area is likely to come through the use of simulation experiments (perhaps employing artificial  intelligence) to allow greater understanding of the unconscious and intuitive reactions to threats. For  that, cognitive modelling and augmented reality could be used to improve the understanding of  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  11  appropriate interaction of the users. However, any classroom bias (in which participants are aware  they are in a simulation and exhibit false behaviour in gaming the experiment) has to been removed.  Capacity building – educational challenge  On the education side, the principle of security by design and security by default should be the norm and  should embrace all phases of the development lifecycle. We identify that the challenge is manifold:  cybersecurity has not been considered a disciplinary subject; software security is not included in standard  education programmes in computer science, and the effectiveness of the courses might be improved using  realistic environments.  Cybersecurity capacity building should not be tackled only from the technological point of view because it  has a holistic perspective. Future cybersecurity experts should not only focus on technology, but also on  people behaviour at individual and social level (psychology/sociology) and on organisational aspects  (processes). Unless cybersecurity experts learn, either individually or in groups, to be experts across  disciplines (i.e. technical, human behaviour, organisational and regulatory), the ability to build a socially  inclusive secure future for ICT will be lacking. Addressing this problem at the root through education, can  contribute to unifying cybersecurity initiatives between these groups. Security is a complex issue that must  be considered across every component during the lifecycle of the product. It must also be addressed from  a systems perspective, to ensure that the composition of secure individual components into an integrated  system yields the desired security properties through the testing and deployment. Integrating security  concepts in computer science courses will create a new generation of professionals who understand the  security basics and are able to create software with security and privacy in mind. Specialist courses for  cybersecurity practitioners should also use simulated realistic environments in order to improve the  efficacy of the training including multidisciplinary elements.  Annex A.2 presents in more details the  education challenge and the rationale behind our  recommendations.  Recommendations on the educational challenge: capacity building  Encourage the transfer of knowledge from specialized security experts to the wider academic  environment, particularly in ICT domains, but also across all societal sciences.  Facilitate the teaching of security principles in all computer science and software engineering  courses in such a way that the new generations of software engineers have security principles  integrated in their course curricula.  Promote the development of new teaching environments that encourage the design,  implementation and validation of new methods, technologies and processes.  Foster the development of multi-disciplinary curricula in cybersecurity  Artificial Intelligence – an opportunity and an existential threat  Artificial intelligence (AI) has at its core the promise of huge benefit with similarly huge risk. Enabled by the  massive amount of collected data by the evolving Internet of Everything (IoE), the ubiquitous fast  connectivity and cloud infrastructure, new applications using artificial intelligence are proposed every day.  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  12  Whilst closely related to the concept of “big data”, AI is able to pick out patterns and make automatic  decisions through the sub-disciplines of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. That is where both  opportunity and risk lie – the decision may be beneficial, or it may be catastrophic. A false or misleading  assertion by AI could lead to significant harm to the intended societal beneficiary. However, the attraction  of building new business on AI is considerable and the reach of AI is immense.  It is this depth of intrusion  of AI into everyday life that requires a focus of technological research.  Main Recommendation on Artificial Intelligence threat  Promote a robust, safe, secure and inclusive Artificial intelligence where humans can  understand the rationale and trust the results.  Foster verification, validation, security, control of the machine learning algorithms and input  data have not been manipulated  Annex B.1 contains a more detailed analysis on the applications, opportunities and risks of AI for the  security of society. Based on that, more specific research actions are summarized here:   Research in developing AI techniques that produce more explainable models while maintaining  prediction accuracy (usually called in research Explainable Artificial intelligence).   Research in verification, validation, security and control of the machine learning algorithms for  preventing safety issues.   Research in adversarial machine learning in order to avoid wrong results due to the introduction of  false data (either in the algorithm or in the trained data) in the machine.   In applications where machine learning is unsupervised and there is an interaction with people, AI  experiments have shown bias and unfair results. Research is needed how to build inclusive and no  discriminatory AI.  It is also considered that longer term research is necessary in the field of having ethically 'correct' Artificial  intelligence. The rationale is that as AI becomes increasingly trusted, following the results from the areas  highlighted above, it will increasingly become involved in areas of decision making where in conventional  human discourse an ethics panel may sit.  Quantum technology  The impact of quantum technology on security can be divided into 2 classes:  1. Techniques to provide resistance to attacks using quantum computing - post-quantum  cryptography or Quantum Safe Cryptography (QSC);  2. Techniques taking advantage of quantum effects (e.g. superposition, entanglement, uncertainty)  as typified by Quantum Key Distribution (QKD).  The first of these has been identified as a reaction to an existential threat – that by defeating, absolutely,  any security claims made against the asymmetric cryptography used today in digital transactions. In other  words, quantum computers might be able to undermine the security that underpins e-commerce, e- government.  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  13  The second class of quantum technology  uses quantum technologies to agree on a secret key in order to  establish a secure communication channel resistant to attacks by quantum computers. Although QKD  technology has several limitations, including the dependence on physical channels and the need for  intermediate trusted node, development of innovative QKD systems might create a niche market in high  secure digital communications.  Whilst there are a number of extant research projects into both classes of quantum technology, relevant  fundamental research challenges and development issues are present and it might need many years of  R&D to bring substantial results. Moreover, when quantum safe cryptographic solutions emerge, further  effort and research will be needed to adapt solutions for each user case. Obviously, this priority might  need to be reassessed based on the advancement of quantum computers and their practical ability to  break current asymmetric cryptography.  Main Recommendations on Quantum technologies  Facilitate the research on post quantum cryptography and their successive applications when  candidates will become available  Support the development of Quantum Key Distribution geographical high-speed networks (by  using satellite and terrestrial links) for high security communications  The state of the art research in quantum technologies for cybersecurity and the underlying research issues  are described in Annex B.2.  Complexity, cascade and supply chain threats  The digital transformation has engendered a subtle transformation that has made all sectors increasingly  dependent on digital infrastructures. For example, cloud providers offer many services now and any  unavailability, loss of integrity, or violation of confidentiality, may have serious consequences for  businesses or governments who use their services. In the same way, the unavailability of financial  operations – due for instance to a denial of service attack - has the potential to affect the operations and  economy of most countries and businesses.  Unfortunately, the security of systems cannot be guaranteed to 100%. But efforts must be done to secure  the systems in order to reduce the risk at an acceptable level and guarantee resilience and business  continuity.  Main Recommendations on Complexity threat  Foster the development of a new approach for impact assessment of complex and  interdependent systems.  Promote the definition of secure and interoperable interfaces among critical infrastructures to  prevent cascading effects.  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  14  Based on these high-level recommendations, we identified more specific research actions (as also detailed  in Annex B.3) :   New approaches for dependency and interdependency impact assessment   Research on the cybersecurity measurements (by catching meaningful parameters from empirical data  analytics) might be extremely important to determine trends to better utilize security resources and  judge the success or failure of implemented security solutions.   Convergence of safety, security and quality elements that might be used to assess the maturity model  and the resilience of the system   Define secure, interoperable interfaces among different critical infrastructures to prevent from  cascading effects.   New approaches to mitigate against the increasing value of attacks as a result of data centralisation  Cybercrime: Detection, Mitigation and Attribution of Cyber-attacks  Criminal activity is common in all areas of life and it is not a surprise that criminal activity has spread to the  digital world. With the digital transformation, many valuable assets are online and they may become the  prey of cybercriminals. Some of the attacks use methodologies and attack vulnerabilities that are already  known; others, the most sophisticated ones, use creative solutions and unknown techniques. Cyber-attack  patterns need to be better recorded and understood in order to apply effective mitigation measurements.  Main Recommendations on Cybercrime: Detection, Mitigation and Attributions of Attacks  Facilitate the research on technical prioritization of security efforts and the development of  innovative situational awareness tools  Help the development of independent evidence-based cyber threat intelligence and  understand the trends through historical data.  Based on these high-level recommendations, further R&D investment is needed on these topics (also  described in Annex B.4):   Research on technical prioritization of the security effort (e.g. Advanced threat intelligence which  simplify the process of combining and prioritizing alerts from multiple sources)   Development of novel approaches for providing organisations the appropriate situational awareness in  relation to cyber security threats allowing them to detect and quickly and effectively respond to  sophisticated cyber-attacks.   Development of novel techniques to collect forensic information   Development of independent evidence-based cyber threat intelligence for fighting cybercrime,  understand the trends through the position of sensors able to do sinkholing and collect malware  samples   Research and development on malware /attack prediction using data analytics and machine  prediction.  That will need the creation of very large updated data sets of labelled malware to train the  machine predictor.  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  15  Privacy threat  Privacy is a fundamental right cited in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights3 and in the European  Convention of Human Rights4, and many efforts have been made in regulation and legal frameworks to  protect those rights. The most recent important example in Europe being the General Data Protection  Regulation (GDPR) 5, which had a considerable impact on how corporations and organisations manage  personal data. The GDPR introduce a risk-based approach that encourages organizations to implement  appropriate measures corresponding to the level of risk of their data processing activities. That might be  seen as an administrative burden, but if it helps to protect the privacy that is always at risks in this always  more connected data-centric digital world. The forthcoming Regulation on Privacy and Electronic  Communications may reinforce the legal basis for the protection of privacy in electronic communications.  Main Recommendations on Privacy threat  Promote and diffuse Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) across different components (e.g.  big data, cloud, IoT ) and through application domains (e.g. healthcare, transportation, energy)  Promote the development of privacy assessment tools for guaranteeing appropriate  measurements are in place to protect private information.  As described in Annex B.5, the research challenge are manifold:   New anonymization privacy models and methods are required   New Analytics tools where the principle of data minimisation is applied.   New Model of safeguarding mechanisms following the privacy by design and by default requirements  3 http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/  4 https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf  5 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1528874672298&uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  16  Annex A: Awareness and education challenges  Awareness building – societal challenge  The digital world has a different pace. Understanding this, being aware of it, is the key to progress and  improvement. Cybersecurity represents both risk and opportunity. In the physical world, society has spent  many centuries developing both awareness and understanding of the environment and developing coping  mechanisms to manage both risk and opportunity. The digital world and its inherent risks and  opportunities have been with us for at most a few decades. The pace of its arrival has meant that unlike in  the past the older generation has time to learn and teach the next generation a set of coping behaviours.  In the digital age all generations are experiencing and learning at the same time – this tends to encourage  sharing experiences and behaviours amongst peers.  The call to “Don’t take candies from strangers”, “Don’t talk to strangers”? is in many societies used  throughout childhood to teach risk aware behaviour and became part of the social norms upon which  society is built. The viability and success of these forms of teaching has taken many years to develop but on  occasion still fail: Children still accept candies from strangers and in some occasions place themselves at  extreme risk as a result. In contrast, the digital world is comparatively new and is evolving too fast for  simple social teaching and social norms to develop in order that learned protections become native.  Moreover, in this context the threats are continually changing.  In many cases, people cannot translate what is safe and polite behaviour in the physical world to the digital  world6. There are some demographic generalisations that may apply: Exposure only as adults with limited  desire to become safe and protected digital citizens; A younger generation has been born using technology  as the basis of learning and communicating (i.e. mobile phones and computers are the new norms). There  is also a general expectation that the ICT infrastructure (the services, the network) will work as intended,  and that failure has no hard consequences, other than requiring a reboot. There is also a significant mind- gap between pure IT appliances (telephones, computers, TVs, tablets), whose life expectancy is relatively  small, and physical-IT appliances (cars, fridges, heaters, AC unit, etc.) which have a long lifetime, and are  even supposed to be used by multiple owners and have resale value. Ensuring that the ICT part of these  objects follows the same principles as the physical part, which can be sold without leaving “traces”, is  certainly difficult.  Typical reactions to advice on cybersecurity are generally negative: “the interfaces are too complicated”, “I  did not know”, “it is too boring”, “I know but I don’t care”. The lesson of this appears to be that people find  the concept of cybersecurity both difficult and of no interest. In the physical world, safety is provided for  them or is learnt through both direct and indirect exposure to risk. Taking all of the risk management  onboard as an individual is not acceptable so it is often discounted as somebody else’s responsibility. So,  the question is either:   how can citizens be empowered with the knowledge and a sense of shared responsibility to  practice safe and informed behaviours on the Internet? or,  6 The European Cybersecurity Month initiative has been promoting awareness in cybersecurity since 2011. It  advocates for change in the perception of cyber-threats by promoting data and information security, education,  sharing of good practices and competitions. In particular the slogan STOP. THINK. CONNECT.™ aims to educate all  Internet users to be more vigilant about practicing safe online habits; to ensure that Internet safety is perceived as a  shared responsibility at home, in the workplace, and throughout our communities. https://cybersecuritymonth.eu  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  17   how can citizens be assured that they are not exposed to risk?  Further research is required to answer either of these questions with any degree of certainty.  Capacity building – educational challenge  Cybersecurity experts are in high demand and it is predicted that more than 350K additional experts will be  required by 20227. Cybersecurity education will play a fundamental role for forming a new generation of  experts.  A.2.1 Enabling the multidisciplinary approach  Cybersecurity is a multidisciplinary subject, well described in the Camino8 H2020 project as formed by  these aspects:   Technical - related to technology, concrete technological approaches and solutions that can be used to  fight against cyber-crime and cyber-terrorism,   Human - related to human factors, behavioural aspects, privacy issues, as well as raising awareness  and knowledge of society with regards to cyber-crime and terrorism threats,   Organisational - related to processes, procedures and policies within organisations, as well as  cooperation (public-private, public-public) between organisations,   Regulatory - related to law provisioning, standardisation and forensics.  Very simply unless cybersecurity experts learn, either individually or in groups, to be expert across all of  these disciplines and their many sub-disciplines, the ability to build a socially inclusive secure future for ICT  will be lacking. Quite simply as has been shown in the research to date, experts focusing on different  cybersecurity aspects often find it difficult to communicate effectively together because their incentives,  languages, knowledge bases, and worldviews are different. Addressing this problem at the root through  education, can contribute to unifying cybersecurity initiatives between these groups9. The assertion is that  it is known what needs to be done, that is to become multidisciplinary, the challenge is to enable it.  An approach in this direction is the Cyber Security Academy 10 where students are required to learn the  relations between technical, legal and social scientific aspects of cybersecurity, so they can come to  effective and sustainable solutions for cyber risks and threats and contribute effectively to sustainable  strategies for digital defensibility and security of society as a whole. An effective way to achieve this goal  appears not to have a clear answer as to what must be done. This guarantees that is has to be a priority  in research.  A.2.2 Cybersecurity in computing  If the assertion is made that ICT embraces cybersecurity, and that ICT is enabled by computing, then it  follows that cybersecurity and computing should be addressed together.  Every day developers release code that contains defects. Whilst not all defects are necessarily security  flaws, many of them may be exploited to become security or safety concerns. Even if a defect or bug exists  the functional goal of the code may be achieved, and the existence of the defect may not be seen in  7 Global Information Security Workforce Study 2017  8 http://www.fp7-camino.eu/  9 Ramirez, R, ‘Making cyber security interdisciplinary : recommendations for a novel curriculum and terminology  harmonization’, MIT 2017  10 https://www.csacademy.nl/en/  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  18  conventional use and deployment. The existence of defects that may become vectors of attack should not  be a surprise given that software security is usually not included in the standard educational programs in  computer science and security and privacy by design are too often taught only in specialized optional  courses. Findings such as those of the CSEC2017 Joint Task Force11 recommending that efforts be made to  standardize curricula for the programme in cybersecurity, and by doing so to restructure the curricula in  Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Information Systems, Information Technology, Software  Engineering and introduce cybersecurity concepts in specialized classes, are a significant step forward.  Security must be considered from the top to the low level, across every component, between every  component from the architecture of the systems, through the testing and operation and deep into the  silicon that carries out the computing. That is a not trivial exercise. The issue in programming is complex  and range from architectural security issues to a single bug exploit by a creative attacker, this is also true  for decisions regarding the use and reuse of library code where the reuse may disclose defects not present  in the originally targeted use.  Recently DevSecOps12 13 has gained traction in IT development: it indicated the development, security and  operation team work together in agile way and they think about security and application from the start. It  is all about introducing the security elements sooner in the life cycle of application development14 to  minimize vulnerabilities and have everyone involved become responsible for security. The idea is to  automate core security tasks by integrating security processes and controls earlier in the development  side. That is also beneficial the overall quality of the products and services offered.  Security by design should be the norm along and should embrace all phases of the lifecycle. The research  interviews that informed the present report indicated a need of material with updated examples and  guidelines that might facilitate the transfer of the knowledge from specialized security expert to the  wider computer science.  In particular, development of guidance and education material for computer science is needed to ensure  education in the following fields:   Validation methods which can trap and eradicate known vulnerabilities (e.g. built in immunity to SQL  injection attacks)   Authentication, authorization, and session management in order to remove mechanisms by which an  attacker gains unauthorized access (prevention of privilege escalation).   Secure programming including characteristics of each language that impact security including  cryptographic utilities, the storing and access to sensitive information, protecting data in memory.  11 https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/education/curricula-recommendations/csec2017.pdf  12 https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-devsecops  13 https://www.csoonline.com/article/3245748/devops/what-is-devsecops-developing-more-secure- applications.html  14 Microsoft has develop a Security Development Lifecycle that introduces security and privacy early and throughout  all phases of the development process including an Agile approach: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en- us/library/windows/desktop/84aed186-1d75-4366-8e61-8d258746bopq.aspx  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  19   Methodology for software development, which takes into consideration security in the lifecycle of the  software - from design through development to deployment, maintenance by secure software update  until both the end of life, and reassignment of life15.   Static analysis automatic tools to identify insecure code (e.g. Potential buffer overflows, tainted inputs  and integer overflows) and perform security and vulnerability testing  Research is also needed to use artificial intelligence to analyse software both in static and runtime modes  in order to provide intelligent insights such as application stability, failure patterns, defects and failure  prediction.  A.2.3 Simulation and visualisation  Cybersecurity skills need to be continuously advanced at all levels and the experts need to adapt their  expertise to a constantly evolving landscape with increasingly sophisticated and novel cyber-attacks,  against a widening attack surface of exposed ICT systems and services. A mechanism that may achieve  refinement of skills is through the cyber range, a form of war-gaming where procedures, technical  elements and coordination activities can be exercised and responses validated. War gaming has long been  an accepted practice in the training of armies, emergency services and civil response units. In this context,  an example is offered by the European Cyber Security Challenge initiative16 that through a sort of war  gaming among  national teams tries to mitigate the shortage of skill in cybersecurity and at the same time  encourage young people to pursue a career in cybersecurity.  In this simulated environment, whilst it can offer a platform for research into the design, implementation  and validation of new security measures, most usefully it offers an opportunity to teach the role of the  multidisciplinary elements of cybersecurity.  In this simulated environment, research must be done on the design, implementation and validation of  new methods, technologies and processes in order to achieve a higher level of security to increase the  resilience against the growing threat of cyber-attacks. The simulated environment will also help for  training activities, by developing skills that can be immediately used in the real world environment.  15 Many ICT devices are re-purposed for a second life after their primary purpose is fulfilled, this may be as simple as  passing a laptop from parent to child when the former upgrades, but also has to address the second hand market in  ICT tools and technologies  16 https://www.europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  20  Annex B: Existential Threats  Artificial intelligence: the new frontier in cybersecurity  B.1.1 Artificial Intelligence in the world of Internet of Everything  Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a significant new frontier of technology that is developing at great speed and  becoming applied as an integral element in the software of all environments and industries. The promise  of these advances is that AI acts as a transforming capability in all sectors bringing innovative solutions to  the market. As AI capabilities advance and as AI systems take on increasing importance in societal  functions, the fundamental challenges discussed below are expected to become increasingly significant.  It is necessary to refine what is meant by AI. In the present document, AI refers to the broad sweep of  technologies in which a machine demonstrates intelligence leading to an optimal, or close to optimal,  solution for a given problem (e.g. machine learning, deep learning). As AI develops it will be the root of  many applications that are proposed to be introduced where machines act in increasingly autonomous  modes, i.e. responding to and interacting with their environment in flexible, resilient and self-learning  ways.  The core characteristic of AI-enabled machines is that they analyse and interpret data in order to solve a  problem, or to gain insights from data17. AI is assumed to learn in real time through trial and error, in the  same way humans do, and for that requires massive amounts of “cleaned” data to train the model.  However Artificial Intelligence has been talked about forever. The only difference is that now the fast  processing, the fast networking and the massive amounts of generated data sets enables AI to reveal the  full potential.  In fact, citizens are living in smart houses, driving autonomous cars, wearing smart wearables and  enormous quantities of data are produced and processed by AI-enabled machines. The core concept of  “Big Data” analytics using AI is able to transform unstructured data into meaningful information and a  trained AI model is able to take real-time decisions based on previous behaviours. Many of the major  cloud providers have already started to provide Artificial Intelligence as a Service18 19 20 21. Whilst it may  require further effort to discover viable solutions for all business cases, the direction is set.  Unfortunately, AI does not only offer opportunities but it also poses security threats and safety risks that  will impact efforts to create a defence for the beneficial use of AI.  B.1.2 A few applications of AI today  Autonomous vehicles  Autonomous cars are now becoming a reality. They use a variety of sensing technologies including radar,  optical recognition, which can function in tandem with GPS and inertial measurement sensors to model  17  The field of big data and data analytics, which allows gaining insight from data to take better decision, is often a  different considered a separate field of study and development.  18 https://www.ibm.com/cloud/machine-learning  19 https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning-service/  20 https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/  21 https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  21  the current dynamic behaviour of the vehicle. Moreover, the sensor data can provide accurate estimates  of the location and direction of the vehicle. This facilitates convergence with a cooperative Intelligent  transportation systems (ITS) to build up a detailed dynamic map of the operating environment and its  relation to the planned route of the vehicle. AI technologies are abundant in the vehicle to enable this  dynamic map and to estimate the behaviour of other vehicles with either human or AI drivers in order to  maximise the safety of the vehicle and its environment.  However, cybersecurity might not have been a priority area of research in the development of  autonomous vehicles since the exploit of autonomous cars have been extensive: hackers taking control of  the car22, modifying the system into not following the posted traffic signs23, lock the systems for ransom24.  The AI itself could be taught to act in a way that makes the driving environment unsafe or dangerous to  both the AI controlled vehicle and its environment. As AI becomes closer to some meaning of sentience  different AIs may behave in similarly random ways to the human intelligences that they seek to replace25  Image and video manipulation  Now it is possible to produce synthetic images that are nearly indistinguishable from real photos. Soon  probably, humans might not be able to distinguish which videos are created artificially from the real one.  As production and dissemination of high-quality forgeries becomes increasingly low-cost, synthetic  multimedia may constitute a large portion of the media and information ecosystem and they might spread  using social networks. Obviously, the advance in machine learning might allow the detection of synthetic  multimedia with a greater level of accuracy.  Surveillance  Surveillance systems have been developed that can follow trajectories of individuals, count people and  predict where crowd congestion may occur without26 human intervention27. Many deployed CCTV systems  have the technical ability to deploy AI processing to perform a number of tasks including gait recognition  and facial recognition that recognize particular individuals. Whilst technically available not all such  technologies can be deployed due to legal restrictions – however their existence suggests a particular  challenge in assuring citizen privacy28.  Concern of dual use  Artificial intelligence is a dual-use area of technology. It can be used in both an attacking and defending  role, for civilian or military application, and more broadly, toward both beneficial and harmful ends. For  example, systems that examine software for vulnerabilities have both offensive and defensive applications.  The DARPA’s Cyber Grand Challenge29 created a \"Capture the Flag” tournament where autonomous  machines attacked the other six machines participating at the tournament while defending their own  system. This required breakthrough approaches in a variety of disciplines, (e.g. computer security, program  22 https://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/  23 Eykholt, K, ‘Robust Physical-World Attacks on Deep Learning Models’, Corr, 2017  24 https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-dangers-of-the-hackable-car-1505700481  25 There is necessary overlap between AI in autonomous vehicles and the establishment of ethical AI that is addressed  in more detail later in this report.  http://moralmachine.mit.edu/ provides a website for building a crowd-sourced  picture of human opinion on how machines should make decisions when faced with moral dilemmas and for  discussion of potential scenarios of moral consequence.  26 https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-human-os/robotics/artificial-intelligence/hacking-the-brain-with-adversarial-images  27 https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/23/16907238/artificial-intelligence-surveillance-cameras-security  28 http://www.hitachi.com/New/cnews/month/2017/03/170327.html  29 https://www.darpa.mil/program/cyber-grand-challenge  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  22  analysis, and data visualization) to perform automatic identification of software flaws, formulation of  patches and deployment on the network in real time.  Unsupervised AI and bias  There have been a number of examples of unsupervised AI that have made news headlines due to  unwanted behaviour:   The twitter chatbot used to test and improve Microsoft's understanding of conversational language  was suspended after 16 hours when it began to behave in an unforeseen and unintended manner30.   Amazon’s proposed automatic tool for recruitment was scrapped due to it exhibiting signs of sexual  discrimination31.   In a study analysing the risk of using Northpointe’s AI assisted tool COMPAS (Correctional Offender  Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) it was discovered that the AI tool was introducing  racial discrimination32 by wrongly identifying black defendants at higher risk of reoffending (recidivism)  than white defendants thus reinforcing custodial sentencing for black offenders.  Examples exist of social-media sites filtering news that amplify behavioural biases by showing only media  that reinforces natural confirmation bias and, by design, protect the reader from being challenged with  contradictory sources of news. That opens questions at moral and ethical levels:  How to ensure a fair and  equal representation in the data used to train AI data across all dimensions of diversity, racial, cultural,  gender, linguistics in order to avoid discriminations, racism, extreme political views? How can AI decisions  be made that achieve fair and inclusive views and balance different positions? How to engage and support  the marginalized people and the most vulnerable in our society?  The conclusion here is that research is needed in order to de-bias AI and to ensure that training schemes  for AI do not inherit biases from their programmers.  B.1.3 Research for an explainable robust and safe AI  Artificial intelligence offers tremendous opportunities in all sectors. “The risks, however, are also  substantial and plausibly pose extreme governance challenges. These include labour displacement,  inequality, an oligopolistic global market structure, reinforced totalitarianism, shifts and volatility in  national power, strategic instability, and an AI race that sacrifices safety and other values”33. In this  document, the scope is narrower and focusses on a few technical elements that are related to the  technology centric security aspects. To be accepted in a society, an AI machine has to be trusted34.  Research is desired to lead to proof that an unsupervised AI performs robustly as desired and the results  are in line with the expectations. This can be translated into 4 areas of research: 35   Verification: How to prove that a system satisfies certain desired formal properties. (Did I build the  system right?)  30 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tay_(bot)  31 https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45809919  32 https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm  33 Dafoe, A.,’AI Governance: A Research Agenda’, Future of Humanity Institute, University of Oxford, 2018  34 Samek, W et at, ‘Explainable Artificial Intelligence: Understanding, Visualizing and Interpreting Deep Learning  Models’, ITU Journal: ICT discoveries, Oct 2017  35 Russell, S et al, “Research Priorities for Robust and Beneficial Artificial Intelligence”, AI Magazine 36, No 4, 2015  https://futureoflife.org/static/data/documents/research_priorities.pdf?x93895  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  23   Validity: How to ensure that a system that meets its formal requirements does not have unwanted  behaviours and consequences. (Did I build the right system?)   Security: How to prevent intentional or unintentional manipulation by unauthorized parties.   Control: How to enable meaningful human control over an AI system after it begins to operate.   Traceability: How to be able to trace how the AI system has taken a certain decision.  Poor design of AI systems may cause unsafe and harmful behaviour. The following list shows some of the  research problems regarding a safe AI36:   Avoiding negative side effects: How to ensure that an AI agent will not cause unintended and  destructive effects to the rest of the environment?   Avoiding Reward Hacking: “How can we ensure that an AI agent will no game its reward function?  For example, if we reward the robot for achieving an environment free of messes, it might disable  its vision so that it won't see any messes, or cover over messes with materials it can't see through,  or simply hide when humans are around so they can't tell it about new types of messes”37   Distributional shift: How can it be ensured that an AI agent behaves robustly when its test or  deployment environment differs from the training environment? 38   Safe exploration: How can an AI agent be built that respects constraints and limits?   Absent supervisor: How can an AI agent ensure that it does not behave differently depending on  the presence or absence of a supervisor?   Safe interrupt ability: How to ensure an AI agent, in order to achieve its goal, does not disable any  designed in kill switch?39  All these issues for safety and security can be better managed through explainable robust AI. This field of  research aims to produce more explainable models in the way that humans can understand the rationale,  trust the results and be able to predict how the AI will behave in the future.  B.1.4 Adversarial machine learning intelligence and the challenge to recognize the unknowns  Adversarial machine learning in which an attacker produces carefully perturbed input samples aimed to  mislead detection at deployment is an additional area in which research is required. There have been  reported cases where a Black Box attack has been carried out in closed systems surveillance systems,  autonomous car, and speech recognition40  as examples of adversarial machine learning. Adversarial AI  often deals with unknown unknowns wherein on deployment they misclassify never-before-seen inputs  that are sufficiently different from known training data41. This threat needs further research in order to  avoid a false sense of security in the mitigation and detection of attacks done using AI where unknown  unknowns poses a risk of misclassification on the defence monitoring tool.  36 See some of the works done for the AI Safety Research programme: https://futureoflife.org/ai-safety-research/  37 Amodei, D et al, “Concrete Problems in AI Safety”, 2016, https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565  38 Leike ,J, “AI Safety Gridworlds”, 2017, https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09883  39 Orseau, L et Amstrong, S. “Safely Interruptible Agents”, Proc. of Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence  2016, New York City. Machine Intelligence Research Institute, 1 June 2016,  https://intelligence.org/files/Interruptibility.pdf  40 Narodytska, N et Kasiviswanathan, S. “Simple Black-Box Adversarial Perturbations for Deep Networks, 2017,  https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.06299  41 Biggio, B et Roli, F, “Wild Patterns: Ten Years After the Rise of Adversarial Machine Learning”, 2018,  https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03141  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  24  B.1.5 Artificial intelligence and ethics  A more provocative area of research is the relation between AI and ethics.  Robots will increasingly gain intelligence and the resulting robots may be used in the future as defence  tools.  A first question is how to define an AI that can recognize what is ethically 'correct' or not. Any  solution that eliminates the uncertainty of sentience, such as creating programs with explicitly formulated  rules, rather than asking a robot to derive its own, is defeating the rationale for sentient or autonomous AI.  There are many ways to consider and gamify ethical dilemmas. The challenge to be faced in research is  that of providing a structure of ethics that allows a robot to interact with humans (and other sentient  things (machine or animal). An ethical black box, which is able to maintain a record of the inputs and  actions that led to any decision, may be critical to the process of discovering why and how a robot caused  an accident, and thus an essential part of establishing accountability and responsibility 42. Society's  acceptance of such machines will depend on whether they can be programmed to act in ways that  maximize safety, fit in with social norms, and encourage trust. However, a more philosophical set of  question remain:  Can machines have sentience? How can a sentient machine be recognised? This restates  the Turing test: Can machines think?43 How to distinguish a human from a machine?  The resultant codification of AI, of Ethics, has to be interoperable across a wide range of technologies and  there has to be a very close relationship between R&D and exploitation or deployment. This has to address  such issues as codification in policy and legislation as well as in the ICT requirement to share knowledge  and information.  Quantum technology  . The current state of the art in asymmetric cryptography is predicated on “hard” problems, that is  problems which have no feasible means of being solved. If these hard problems can be solved then the  security assumptions are made null and void. Research in the field of quantum computing and the  application to such problems has produced credible threats to the underlying assumptions behind these  “hard” problems to such an extent that research has been focussed in recent years on identifying  alternative schemes to the existing pervasive cryptosystems of RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography.  The impact of quantum technology on security can be divided into 2 classes:  3. Techniques to provide resistance to attacks using quantum computing - post-quantum  cryptography or Quantum Safe Cryptography;  4. Techniques taking advantage of quantum effects (e.g. superposition, entanglement, uncertainty)  most often demonstrated in Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)  State of the art  In June 2015, ETSI has released a survey of current cryptographic principles, the possible impact of  quantum computing on their effectiveness and what can be done to mitigate the risks in an economically  and technically practical manner44. This study has been followed up by a large number of ETSI  42 Winfield, Alan et Jirotka, Mrina, “The Case for an Ethical Black Box”, Part of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science  book series (LNCS, volume 10454)  43 Turing, Alan, \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\", Mind, LIX (236): 433–460, Oct 1950,  doi:10.1093/mind/LIX.236.433, ISSN 0026-4423  44 http://www.etsi.org/images/files/ETSIWhitePapers/QuantumSafeWhitepaper.pdf  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  25  publications45 on the threat from quantum computing and on characterisation of cryptographic primitives  that enable resistance against attacks using quantum computers46.  In parallel ETSI ISG QKD has developed a number of specifications47 relating to the physical layer  capabilities of quantum-based data transfer that allow for a completely secure means to achieve  agreement on some shared random data, the most obvious semantic form for this random data is a key for  use in a future cryptographic function. Note that QKD only addresses the threat of capture of a key in  transit and does not address any further distribution of the key once agreed. It should be stressed that  QKD is a purely physical phenomenon whereas QSC is able to be applied at any abstracted layer in the  conventional OSI model.  Whilst in April 2016 NIST published “NIST Interagency Report (NISTIR) 8105: Report on Post-Quantum  Cryptography”48, which indicated the status of quantum computing and post-quantum cryptography up to  that point, it also outlined NIST’s initial plan to move forward in this space. The next steps have been seen  in the invitation for assessment of future quantum safe cryptographic algorithms which are undergoing  detail analysis49. Submissions include some that were (co-)designed by PQCRYPTO50 and SAFEcrypto51, two  H2020 projects completed in 2018 with a focus on developing post quantum cryptography solutions.  The contrast between quantum technology in security and resistance to the application of quantum  computing to defeat security has to be stressed. Very simply there are no visible developments in the  application of quantum mechanics in security – in this context the role of QKD is that of key establishment  and does not of itself address security (the nature of QKD is that a secret is exchanged between 2 parties  but that secret is not known in advance nor it is part of a recoverable key management scheme).  In 2016 the EU commission prepared a communication “Commission Staff Working Document on Quantum  Technologies”52 which reviews current issues in creating industrially and societally relevant Quantum  Technologies and discusses concerns to be addressed by a roadmap for turning Europe's global leadership  in research into a future world-class European Quantum Industry.  The Commission Expert Group on Quantum Technologies – High Level Steering Committee - has delivered  in June 2017 the Quantum Technologies Flagship Final Report53. It focuses around four mission-driven  research and innovation domains, representing the major applied areas in the field: Communication,  Computation, Simulation, as well as Sensing and Metrology. The Quantum communication involves  generation and use of quantum states and resources for communication protocols (i.e. quantum random  number generators (QRNG) for secret keys and quantum key distribution (QKD) for their secure  distribution).  45 See the work done in ETSI related to cybersecurity: https://www.etsi.org/technologies- clusters/technologies/cyber-security  46 This work was conducted by the ETSI TC CYBER and the ETSI ISG QSC group,  now integrated as a specialist working  group of ETSI TC CYBER  47 https://www.etsi.org/technologies-clusters/technologies/quantum-key-distribution  48 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8105  49 https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Post-Quantum-Cryptography/Post-Quantum-Cryptography-Standardization  50 https://pqcrypto.eu.org/  51 https://www.safecrypto.eu/  52 ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=15270  53 https://tinyurl.com/QT-/HLSC-report  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  26  Based on Quantum Technologies Flagship Report, the EU commission has recently opened some calls:   H2020-FETFLAG-2018-2020 to build a strongly networked European Quantum Technologies 54-Ramp- up phase in H2020 to further develop R&D in Quantum Technologies   SU-ICT-04-2019 QKD testbed call for building an experimental platform to test and validate the  concept of end-to-end security, providing quantum key distribution as a service. This will be a pilot to  determine the maturity of QKD to identify the practical implementation issues55  All these initiative goes in the right direction and both Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and post-quantum  cryptography present relevant fundamental research and development challenges and might need many  years of research to bring substantial results. Moreover, when quantum safe cryptographic solutions will  emerges, further efforts is needed to adapt the best solutions for each user case. Obviously, this priority  might need to be reassessed based on the advancement of quantum computers and their capability to  break the current asymmetric cryptography56.  Complexity, cascade effect and supply chain threat  The complexity of networks and systems has increased dramatically over the last years, and there is no  reason to suggest that this trend will stop. It is already challenging to consider the relations in each of big  monolithic or small-interconnected systems, but the complexity increases exponentially when it involved  complex systems from different sectors and cross borders. It is necessary to look at the complexity and  interdependency in different areas that are critical for our society and economy. In fact, a loss or damage  will lead to significant negative impact on the safety, security or health of the population.  A domino effect, in which the failure of one component can instantiate a chain of failures across a wide set  of loosely connected components should be addressed in design. A more technical definition of the  domino effect is cascade failure. The impact of security incidents may propagate across sectors via such  cyber dependencies and interdependencies.  Due to the digitisation of services, all major sectors have an increasing level of dependency on digital  infrastructures. For example, many services now are offered by cloud providers and any unavailability, loss  of integrity, or violation of confidentiality, may have serious consequences for businesses or governments  who use their services. The use of multitenant cloud storage also poses security risks that cannot be  completely unconsidered. Moreover, the unavailability of financial operations – due for instance to a  denial of service attack - has the potential to affect the operations and economy of most countries and  businesses.  Another example of the complexity and the dependencies in our everyday life is shown by the supply chain  attack57. An instance is the NotPetya attack58, where a compromised software posed a single point of  54 http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/fetflag-03-2018.html  55 https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/su-ict-04-2019.html  56 BSI in 2017 has published a comprehensive study on the evolution of quantum computers in order to understand  the status of the art, the actors and the current technology to build a Quantum Computer - https://www.bsi.bund.de/qcstudie  57 Examples of supply chain attacks: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/info-notes/supply-chain-attacks  58 https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/  reports that at least  four hospitals in Kiev, six power companies, two airports, more than 22 Ukrainian banks, ATMs and card payment  systems in retailers and transport, and practically every federal agency were affected. And the attack had serious  consequence in other countries and in important businesses.  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  27  failure for the security of several entities that offered critical services. Strictly related to it, it is the failure  of assurance that products introduced in the supply chain do not present cybersecurity defects (at any  layer from the silicon to the customer interface), which when exploited can create failures with domino  effects.  Unfortunately, the security of systems cannot be guaranteed to 100%. But efforts must be done to secure  the systems in order to reduce the risk at an acceptable level and guarantee resilience and business  continuity. A risk-based approach is the most used methodological approach for security although it is  often not difficult to quantify the risk brought by interdependencies.  The present report therefore suggests the following areas for research:   New approaches for dependency and interdependency impact assessment starting from the  Identification and Modelling of Dependencies and Interdependencies, through the Analysis and  Measurement (e.g. Network based approaches that capture information flows among individual  components to depict dependencies and interdependencies)   The quantitative measurements in cybersecurity59 are extremely difficult and most often organizations  use metrics which may include a subjective attribute. Research on the cybersecurity measurements (by  catching meaningful parameters from empirical data analytics) might be extremely important to  determine trends to better utilize security resources and judge the success or failure of implemented  security solutions.   Convergence of safety, security and quality elements that might be used to assess the maturity model  and the resilience of the system   Define Secure, interoperable interfaces among different critical infrastructures to prevent from  cascading effects.   New approaches to mitigate against the increasing value of attacks as a result of data centralisation.   Development of system-wide attack mitigation patterns that should be included in systems to provide  graceful failure modes instead of catastrophic modes.  Cybercrime: Detection, Mitigation and Attribution of attacks against Cyber threats  As cyberspace grows in size and complexity and digital transformation evolves, the risk of cyber-attack for  business and individuals increases60. The economic benefit for the attackers is reported very high and risk  for individuals might include not only a financial or cyber dimension but also a physical one (e.g. the theft  of personally identifiable information or biometric data may be used for a criminal impersonation).  High-profile data breaches61 have made headlines recently and the growing number of incidents require  extra effort for detecting and mitigating the attacks. The fight against cybercrime can be approached at  different levels (policy, regulatory, technical, organizational, etc.) although the present report focusses on  the technical level.  59 The ETSI Information Security Indicators ISG is already publishing standards in the area of quantitative evaluation of  cybersecurity performance for organizations. The work already done includes indicators, a maturity model, and in the  future, they might propose data analytics to compute part of the indicators automatically.  60 The Global Risk Report 2018 from the World Economic Forum has identifies cyber-attacks as the most probable  risks after natural disasters in a 10 period time https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-risks-report-2018  61 Largest data breaches in the last years :  https://www.techworld.com/security/uks-most-infamous-data-breaches-3604586/  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  28  To effectively tackle ever more sophisticated cyber threats requires an understanding of the actors, their  determination or motivation, in order that the defenders have a clear understanding of the attack surface  and how it can be reduced.  One of technical issue for both government and business protecting against cyber-attack is the relative  inefficiency of threat analytics. Whilst solutions such as the Security Information and Event Management  (SIEM) have existed for an extended period of time, the complexity of the systems, the inability to extract  information from noise, the lack of skilled resources to interpret and the analyse the available data, and  sometimes the sophistication of attacks has left many attacks undetected for long periods of time, and this  results in discrediting of the tools at hand. Research into new predictive security analytic machines may  play a significant role by utilising the tools of big data analytics to provide an analyst with everything they  need to know or make an automated decision based on the measured elements62.  However, the fight against cyberattacks should not be underestimated: the adversary can be creative (e.g.  zero-day attacks), might not follow any rules, the knowledge of labelled data on malware or attacks is  limited to a few cyber security companies and new sample might be available too late in certain critical  environment. Research and development in this field is necessary although that might be proved  extremely challenging considering that categorize the unknowns is not possible and it is extremely  challenging to predict an attack who has not been before. However, a concrete move in this area to might  be beneficial to provide an effective first layer of defence. The higher level of security might still only be  offered by whitelisting the known software and connections to reputable partners and leaving an expert or  another algorithm to judge the other cases. Anyway in many environments, defence-in-depth approach as  well as cyber resilience and response capabilities appear as the only solutions viable to respond to the  threats and limit the damage.  There is also a significant trade-off between security controls and ease of use. Monitoring and detection  provide a solution that enables users to carry on with their work, while detecting anomalies and  supporting corrective measures later.  The present report therefore suggests the following areas which need further R&D investment:   Research on technical prioritization of the security effort (e.g. Advanced threat intelligence which  simplify the process of combining and prioritizing alerts from multiple sources)   Development of novel approaches for providing organisations the appropriate situational awareness in  relation to cyber security threats allowing them to detect and quickly and effectively respond to  sophisticated cyber-attacks.   Development of novel techniques to collect forensic information   Development of independent evidence-based cyber threat intelligence for fighting cybercrime,  understand the trends through the position of sensors able to do sinkholing and collect malware  samples   Research and development on malware /attack prediction using data analytics and machine  prediction.  That will need the creation of very large updated data sets of labelled malware to train the  machine predictor.  62 Hanan, et al. \"A Taxonomy and Survey of Intrusion Detection System Design Techniques, Network Threats and  Datasets.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.03517 (2018) presents a taxonomy of Malicious Traffic for Intrusion Detection  Systems and they highlight the difficulty to evaluate them due to a shortage of open–source datasets representing  accurately network traffic and their associated threats.  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  29  Privacy threat and the innovation brought by the GDPR  GDPR has had a considerable impact on how corporate manages personal data. Perhaps one of the most  significant issues behind this success is the punitive nature of violations by data controllers and processors.  It may be argued that fear of punishment of itself is the driver for more care in the design of processing  but it might offer an economic incentive to minimize the risk. The GDPR introduces a risk-based approach:  the higher the risk (for the rights and freedoms of data subjects), the more rigorous the measures that the  controller or the processor needs to take (in order to manage the risk).  GDPR provision for a risk-based approach is horizontal as there are not exemptions or light weight  approaches based on the organization size, availability of recourses and capabilities. That means that all  individuals, SME and big corporate has this legislative obligation that can be seen as a costly administrative  burden. However, GDPR might offer a competitive-advantage for companies: applying effectively the  principle of privacy-by-design can help to build and retain customer trust. GDPR compliance tools can  facilitate the privacy assessment and automatic tools give power to consumers to own their data and have  a choice of whom they share this with and for what return.  The forthcoming Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications is expected to give new impetus to  the way privacy is protected in electronic communications.  However further innovation is needed in different fields which can contribute at a more effective data  protection and at creating business opportunities.  Technical elements such as Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs), e.g. encryption, protocols for  anonymous communications, attribute based credentials and private search of databases are the primary  areas of research. In addition there are very important ground for research on how to guarantee data  portability in an online platform, prevent online and mobile tracking, consent management in a multi- ownership environment, guarantee in automatic way the subject’s right, e.g. right to erasure, access and  correction, data deletion especially in a cloud environment63.  In a big data and Artificial intelligence environment, the challenges at technical level for research are  further more64 65:   New anonymization privacy models and methods are required when data are continuously and  massively collected.   New encryption techniques are necessary to efficiently allow search and do other computations over  the stored data without decrypting the data (e.g. Attribute-Based-Encryption, Encryption search,  Privacy preserving computations).   New Analytics environments where the principle of data minimisation are applied.   New Model of data protection and privacy requirements where policy definition and enforcement is  automatic in a way that one party cannot refuse to honour the policy of another party in the chain of  co-controllership and information sharing  63 For instance, blockchain technology might offers individuals greater sovereignty over their data and allow them to  manage and own their data on a shared ledger.  64 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/privacy-and-data-protection-by-design  65 The Norwegian Data Protection Officer has prepared a report on AI challenges and GDPR:  https://www.datatilsynet.no/en/about-privacy/reports-on-specific-subjects/ai-and-privacy/  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  30  While the technical research community is continuing improving existing building blocks, interdisciplinary  research is needed for connecting privacy to economics, law, ethnography, psychology, medicine,  biotechnology, human rights. Obviously, PETs need to be rooted in a data governance strategy for  unfolding their full benefit for privacy and data protection. In big corporation, the new obligation can help  to think break down organisation barriers and might create a fertile ground for innovation with data.  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  31  Annex C: Methodology, policy context and R&D funding scheme  Methodology used in the report  This study was carried out using a four-step methodology starting from the scope definition, the initial  information gathering, the collection of expert opinion and ending with the development of a report.  Figure 1 Steps used in the methodology of the report  1. Scope definition and Desktop research: The first step was to establish the report’s scope and  perimeter. In parallel an investigation was carried out to identify existing publications and  information on the topics and to conduct brainstorming session with ENISA experts in different  fields, so as to gather their input and knowledge in relation to the objectives of this report.  2. Collection of external stakeholders’ and experts’ point of view: A series of interviews were  conducted with the selected experts from ENISA permanent stakeholder group and selected  member of academia and industry. In the interview, the experts express their opinions on the  strategic research priorities in cybersecurity for a safer Europe. It was also asked to give the  rationale behind these chooses and their supporting evidences.  3. Analysis and development: The results from the desktop research and the interviews were  analysed and contrasted to align them with the objectives of the report. A qualitative approach  was used to prioritize the identified research topics and to evaluate the supporting evidence. The  analysis included triangulation of the data across different stakeholder groups and with validation  by ENISA experts. A critical assessment of contributions was made since the stakeholders may vest  interest.  4. Report write-up: The last step was to synthesise all the findings from the desktop research and the  interviews with the experts, shaping this report.  European Policy Context  The current approach to Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) and resilience within the EU  has its roots in the Commission communication of 2009, entitled “Protecting Europe from large-scale  Scope definition and Desktop  research  Collection of external stakeholders’  and experts’ point of view  Analysis and development  Report write-up  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  32  cyber-attacks and disruptions: enhancing preparedness, security and resilience”66. In 2013, the  Commission released the Cybersecurity Strategy of the EU, which laid down a number of fundamental  principles that support the EU approach to cybersecurity, including the need of achieving cyber resilience,  strong and effective legislation on the cyber domain, the promotion of a Single Market for cyber security  products, and fostering R&D investments and innovation.  The Directive on security of network and information systems (NIS Directive)67 was the first piece of EU- wide legislation on cybersecurity. It provided legal measures to boost the overall level of cybersecurity in  the EU forcing all the EU member states in adopting a national strategy on the security of network and  information systems, to create a cooperation group in order to support and facilitate strategic cooperation  and the exchange of information among Member States, to introduce security measures and incident  reporting obligations for operators of essential services and digital service providers.  On 13 September 2017, the Commission adopted a cybersecurity package68. The Commission identifies  that “the scale and cross-border nature of the threat make a powerful case for EU action providing  incentives and support for Member States to develop and maintain more and better national cybersecurity  capabilities, while at the same time building EU-level capacity. This approach is designed [..] to give  cybersecurity the priority it needs to build resilience and deliver a better EU response to cyber-attacks”.  The cybersecurity package created a focus on:   Building EU resilience to cyber-attacks and stepping up the EU's cybersecurity capacity through a  reinforced ENISA with the mandate to put in place and implement the EU-wide cybersecurity  certification framework   Stepping up EU's cybersecurity capacity by establishing an European Cybersecurity Research and  Competence Centre, acting as a blueprint for how Europe and its Member States can respond quickly  and encourage cooperation as a means of developing stronger cyber defence capabilities   Creating an effective response in criminal law   Strengthening global stability through international cooperation  The package builds upon existing instruments and presents new initiatives to further improve EU cyber  resilience and response.  The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)69 who came into effect in May 2018 was designed to  harmonize data privacy laws across Europe, to protect and empower all EU citizens with regard to data  privacy. It reshaped how organizations approach data privacy for all the European citizens (independently  of where the company is located) and mandate a number of security approaches, such as:   Privacy by Design and by Default   New transparency requirements: the condition for consent (where required) must be clear and easily  intelligible   More control over personal data for individuals: right to rectification, to be forgotten, to data  portability, to object to automated individual decision making and profiling   Notification of a data breach that is likely to affect the rights and the freedom of individuals  66 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52009DC0149  67 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG  68 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1505294563214&uri=JOIN:2017:450:FIN  69 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:02016R0679-20160504&from=EN  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  33   Serious Penalties for infringement  The new regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications (ePR), which at the time of writing is still in  EU trilogue process, aims at aligning Europe’s ePrivacy regime more closely with the regime set out in the  General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Its focus however is on a high level of privacy for all electronic  communications, regardless of the technology used, thus addressing the IoT and M2M domains explicitly,  and independently whether it contains personal or non-personal data. Moreover, it aims to simplify rules  on cookies and to encourage the developers of web browser to ensure clear and open access to users to  set their browser settings that are also correctly implemented in the web services they navigate to.  R&D activities and funding schemes  As a key priority to foster R&D and innovation across Europe, a structure of research facilities and funding  schemes is in place to provide expertise and management to research and innovation projects, and to  promote synergies between these activities, to benefit both economic growth and the EU citizenship. The  beneficiaries of the funding programmes include SMEs, research centres, universities, large companies, the  types of funds range from supporting start-ups to various clusters.  Horizon 2020- known also as H2020- has been the biggest running EU research and innovation programme  with 75 billion euro of funding available over a seven year period (2014 to 2020). H2020 has been focusing  on supporting EU competitiveness through the delivery of ideas and development of technology to help  achieve smart, sustainable and inclusive economic growth. The goal is to ensure that Europe produces  world-class science and technology, removes barriers to innovation and makes it easier for the public and  private sectors to work together in delivering solutions to big challenges facing our society.  The new program for EU research funding called Horizon Europe has a proposed budget of €97 billion for  2021-2027. The commission has also proposed to allocate €13 billion to the European Defence Fund and  specifically €4.1billion for funding of collaborative defence research to address emerging and future  security threats.  The Commission has also identified a “new programme dedicated to increasing and maximising the  benefits of the digital transformation for all European citizens, public administrations and businesses”70  called Digital Europe. Its aim is to provide a spending instrument that is tailored to the operational  requirements of capacity building in the areas of high-performance computing, artificial intelligence and  cybersecurity. This programme will focus on large-scale digital capacity and infrastructure building, with  the objective of wide uptake and deployment across Europe of critical existing or tested innovative digital  solutions. €2 billion “will be invested into safeguarding the EU's digital economy, society and democracies  through boosting cyber defence and the EU's cybersecurity industry, financing state-of-the-art cybersecurity  equipment and infrastructure as well as supporting the development of the necessary skills and  knowledge”71 in the period 2021-2027.  It is acknowledged that whilst cyber-security is not the sole beneficiary of such funding it should also be  taken into account that any project proposal requiring network connectivity, or which makes use of  network resident resources, should take security and privacy concerns into account. This does not suggest  that every research project is a health and safety (H&S) project, or that every research project is an  ICT/cybersecurity project, but rather, that H&S and ICT/cybersecurity are essential elements of every  70 Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL establishing the Digital Europe  programme for the period 2021-2027 - COM(2018) 434 final  71 http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-4043_en.htm  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  34  project. This insistence at the genesis of a project on addressing H&S and ICT/cybersecurity is an essential  step in moving towards security by default, privacy by design, and safe by design.

Nevertheless, the main goal of this document is to identify the  cybersecurity threats to European society and to identify priorities in research that will lead to mitigations  before those cybersecurity threats materialise. By identifying future problem areas, Europe can take a  proactive approach in defending against anticipated threats. The security of our information is  fundamental and as the pervasive digital transformation takes place, our lives become more exposed to  cybersecurity threats.  Based on desktop research and interviews with experts, an effort was made to foresee European society in  the near future of 2025, in doing so we have identified the key driving forces and uncertainties, and the  changes in society brought by innovation in the digitally connected world. In the effort to explore emerging  challenges in a systematic way, a framework has been introduced to guide the analysis. The framework  consists of three axes: social aspects, technology and business, along which future developments are  forecast. We have recognized the interdependencies among the digital and physical world, the  pervasiveness of connectivity in all aspects of society and industries, the evolution of the technologies and  their effect on society.  The report focuses on identifying emerging challenges and on those current challenges that are evolving  into significant risks to society. Closely related are those challenges in social dynamics brought about by  changes in society that have been enabled by technology. Underpinning this is a concern related to  education and awareness of the changing threat or risk environment. Based on this analysis, the report  identifies the following themes that suggest where future research should be focused on:   Awareness building – societal challenge  o Addressing the need, across society, to build awareness of the impact of technological  change on social evolution and hence on societal risk   Capacity building – educational challenge  o This recognises the shortage of cybersecurity experts and considers means to refresh  education at secondary and tertiary levels to bridge the gap   Existential threats – those threats that if enacted have potential to destroy the directly impacted  part of society, industry or business  o Artificial Intelligence - thanks to the pervasiveness of data collection by the Internet of  Everything (IoE), the processing power and storage capacity offered by the cloud, pattern  recognition and automatic decision will develop at great speed bringing new opportunities  and risks  o Quantum technologies, where uncertainty is a key characteristic, may be used in both  attack against current cryptographic protection methods, and in the development of new  computational models for further acceleration of change  o Complexity of interconnectedness that may lead to cascade fail of multiple systems across  the supply chain  o Cybercrime- thanks to digital transformation, digital identities and valuable assets may  become prey during a cyberattack.  Detection and mitigation of cyberattacks becomes  extremely important  o The threat to privacy is increasing with “big data” collection and unexpected inference  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  06  1. Introduction  The present document provides a series of recommendations for the priorities in the EU for R&D in the  domain of ICT security made after analysis of a wide series of interviews with domain experts.  The proposed research priorities have the aim to make Europe, ”a global leader in cybersecurity by 2025, in  order to ensure the trust, confidence and protection of our citizens, consumers and enterprises online and  to enable a free and law-governed internet”,1 as stated at the Tallinn Digital Summit in September 2017.  The focus of the report is to highlight and recommend how focussed R&D can address emerging challenges  that might pose a severe risk to our society. A key element is the recognition that the world is moving  digitally and fast. The speed of adoption of new technologies has a potentially huge benefit resulting in  increasing productivity, but at the same time may also pose risks if the technology where used against the  best interests of society. Social norms take dozens of years to develop and the digital transformation is  creating an increasingly blurred distinction between the digital and the physical world. In the digital world,  a small number of corporations, popularly referred to as Internet giants2, are increasingly required to  service the societies of the 21st century. However, this requires a trade-off between the user’s data and the  internet giants’ services: the users allow the digital platforms to track their location, record their interests  and monitor their online activities in return for a wide series of services demanded by the users. Data  collected from users are used for analytics purposes, which ranges from marketing campaigns and  promotions to deep machine learning and data mining.  It is a major challenge to imagine how society will be in a few years from now, and to consider the threats  to society at that time. In order to frame this, the broad assumption is that ICT will reach further into  society with more connectivity, further integration with everyday life activities through ICT, and this will  demand a response in both the design of ICT and the cybersecurity features of ICT products and services.  The concerns of the next few years however stretch far beyond the remit of only security technology and  many of the recommendations in the present document extend to gaining better understanding of how  ICT in general, and in particular, ICT incorporating cybersecurity features impact daily life.  Encouraging R&D in ICT security is essential to respond to the societal challenges that will arise from a fast  developing and fast changing ICT centred world that both contributes to, and threatens, the sustainable  development of the global economy and, particularly global social stability. The concern for making the  activity of the world secure, and the role of ICT technologies in supporting that world, is complex and  cannot be simply addressed in technology, thus this report asserts that the R&D focus has to be wider than  simply technology and address wider societal issues. In security, it is essential to consider the golden  triangle of People, Process, and Technology. If just one element of the three is missing, the risk rises  significantly.  1 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/soteu2018-cybersecurity-centres-regulation-630_en.pdf  2 Realistically this includes the largest companies quoted in the stock exchanges: Amazon with Amazon Web Services  and Alexa products; the Alphabet corporation, which owns the Google search engine, the YouTube platform and the  Android operating system for smartphones; Microsoft with operating systems and the Azure web service platform;  Apple with their ecosystem; Facebook with Instagram which dominates the social network in the western world. In  combination, their market capitalisation exceed of $3trilion in market, close to 20% of the combined GDP of the  EU28.  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  07  Unfortunately, it is a generally held view that security is a cost only exercise, and that making people pay  for security is often difficult. In fact, it is not always clear if the investment in security is effective, rather  than an attacker simply failing to carry out a successful attack. Thus, the cost effectiveness of working  security is often considered as hard to quantify.  In order to be able to prioritise research topics, and, perhaps more importantly, to be able to see the larger  picture and develop research programmes that are capable of addressing society challenges also a  broader, a high-level overview is needed, that shows how the many topics relate to each other. In that  light, Chapter 2 contains a narrative scenario that sketches a broad picture of society in 2025.  Based on this scenario, Chapter 3 provides a short description of the identified challenges and the  existential threats along with the associated recommendations to mitigate them.  A detailed analysis of the identified strategic topics and the related research questions are discussed in  Annex A: Awareness and education challenges and Annex B:Existential Threats.  Annex C concludes with the methodology used in the report, the European policy context and European  funding scheme for research and development.  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  08  2. Our Europe in 2025: a plausible scenario  Europe in 2025. Devices are connected to the internet and have permeated everywhere. All the essential  operators in all sectors (i.e. energy, transport, banks, digital infrastructure, hospitals), in all public  administrations and across industry are providing connected services. 80 billion devices (10 per person on  the planet) are connected through the internet and the quantities of data produced has been doubling  every 2 years.  Internet of everything (IoE) has transformed the ecosystem where we live and smart objects  have brought about an increase in productivity. It is common to use wearable devices controlled by voice  to reserve a table on line for a dinner, as well as having a 5G-connected autonomous shared car driving to a  business meeting. Education and training have been made more effective thanks to augmented reality and  gamification, which guarantee an immersive sensation and leverage the natural desire for socializing,  learning and competition. Important societal strategies have been identified to increase cybersecurity and  strengthen resilience to cyber-attacks. People's awareness, knowledge and motivation to be secure online  have been strengthened as media have been drawing attention to the issue. Community initiatives to  promote security by design in local infrastructures and systems have flourished, and companies and public  administrations have been developing procedures and implementing training programmes. However, this  has created a workforce of cyber-aware elites and a sub-culture of less aware workers that has increased  social tensions.  Governments are now demanding online-only access to taxes, pension and benefits, that require all  citizens to have and to use digital identities. Massive computing power and storage capacity are available  on the cloud and maintained in huge server farms that place significant demands on power and  telecommunications infrastructure. Industries have increased productivity by introducing sophisticated  sensor networks, machine-to-machine communication, additive manufacturing, robotics, machine  intelligence, analytics, and others enabled by smart sensors, cloud technology and virtualisation of  processes. More automation has been introduced across almost all forms of businesses. This automation  has been augmented by the application of artificial intelligence to provide significant levels of behavioural  analysis to the data captured from the always-online society, to provide greater insight and understanding  of consumer and business behaviour, and to develop ever more products and services to respond to their  needs.  In a completely digitized Europe, the internet giants have been able to assert even more control over the  economy, but additionally their platforms underpin almost all aspects of society (government, commerce,  health, transport, etc.). They are not only able to respond to customer demands, but they are the engines  that drive customers’ desires, making the customer both the product and the source of revenue driving  society. This has raised major concerns in government and in society regarding not just the power of the  internet giants but also regarding who leads and governs society. Some activists are refusing to use  internet at all driven by concerns regarding privacy risks, others are paying for hiding their online  behaviours.  As society has become more experienced in the use of the internet to share information, the already  evidenced poisoning of information has become increasingly widespread and controlled by both organised  crime and rogue states (or rogue elements in nation states). Using a number of psychologically informed  triggers to enforce confirmation bias through ”fake news” and by the ability to filter out any contrary  opinion, bad actors are actively removing informed societal debate. This has led to the spread of digital  ghettos of like-minded people on social networks that are seen as a risk to democracy by removing the  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  09  search for, and agreement on, a consensus, often requiring concessions for the greater good, that is  required in democratic societies.  In spite of the proliferation of a connected society, many public authorities still face the challenge of large  and complex, and in some cases, outdated ICT systems making it difficult to guarantee their security.  Citizens, business, and government have been increasingly the target of sophisticated attacks by malicious  parties. The capability to respond to cyber-attacks has been enhanced although the impact of cyber- attacks and cyber-crimes have been devastating. Law enforcement still do not have the capability to act as  fast as the criminals, who move freely in cyber space and take advantage of the uncertainty of  geographical location to keep ahead of law enforcement and of attempts to mitigate their actions.  The percentage of global reliance on ICT is difficult to judge. The growing dependence on an always  digitally connected society, where all sectors are dependent to some extent on ICT may lead to consider a  failure in ICT as an existential crisis. In fact, ICT is the binding critical infrastructure and a loss of ICT  through cyber-attack could lead to failure of all other critical infrastructures.  Quantum computing is still perceived as both an opportunity and a threat. Mastering quantum computing  might allow solving classes of problems that cannot be solved with classical computing in a reasonable  time. The public-key cryptographic solutions resistant to quantum computers has been emerging although  the wider problem of migration has no viable solution in sight.  Given the huge number of network-enabled relationships on which EU citizens’ and governments rely,  cybersecurity and privacy are areas of major policy concern.  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  10  3. Key Messages and Recommendations  In this chapter, the identified threats are briefly explained based on the scenario of Europe in 2025, which  has been presented in the previous chapter. Associated with each threat, an area of intervention that  might mitigate the emerging threat is proposed. This constitutes the base of our recommendations for the  strategic priorities in research and development. A detailed analysis of the identified strategic topics and  the related research questions are further discussed in Annex A: Awareness and education challenges and  Annex B: Existential Threats.  Awareness building – societal challenge  Any irrevocable societal change takes time to become a behavioural norm. Digital transformation is an  example of an irrevocable societal change that is rapidly changing how we behave. The pace of  transformation has left too many unaware of the impact of that change and the consequent risks that the  new behaviour introduces.  Up to now, cybersecurity campaigns have not had the desired outcome and  many still do not know how to behave safely in the digital world.  Cybersecurity must become a shared responsibility and all the actors should facilitate a secure and  responsible digital world. However, to achieve that, it is essential to have a thorough understanding of  related risks and threats, as well as ways to secure and protect against them. This requires a deep  understanding of the human behaviour and psychology of change, of how societies work and of social  science in general. Bringing these disciplines together is one path to ensure that the changes wrought by  increasing digitisation of society, and the resultant change in threat and risk, can be safely managed.  Recommendations on the societal challenge: awareness building  Promote an understanding of how people use and adapt to technology, in order to better  model both risk perception and risk reality with a view to providing a concrete basis of why  cyber-security technology is required and what its limitations are.  Promote systems that are designed with security and privacy protection features in place and  have intuitive user interfaces  Encourage innovations on communicating cybersecurity risks  Based on these high-level recommendations, we identified specific research actions:   Multi-disciplinary research is needed to model and design future systems in such a way that they are  more easily comprehended. This needs a strong collaboration between experts in social disciplines  (e.g. anthropology, psychology, sociology) in economics (e.g game theory) and in technology. Large- scale demonstrators should be used to prove the research solutions are valid in real social  environments. The intent of this field of research is to gain understanding of how people adopt and  use new technology and how risk is perceived in the digital world.   Research and experimentation in the field of social science is needed to create more awareness of  security risks. Moreover, it should be understood how people perceive threats in the digital world and  how that perception is used to generate both conscious and impulsive mitigations. Some help in this  area is likely to come through the use of simulation experiments (perhaps employing artificial  intelligence) to allow greater understanding of the unconscious and intuitive reactions to threats. For  that, cognitive modelling and augmented reality could be used to improve the understanding of  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  11  appropriate interaction of the users. However, any classroom bias (in which participants are aware  they are in a simulation and exhibit false behaviour in gaming the experiment) has to been removed.  Capacity building – educational challenge  On the education side, the principle of security by design and security by default should be the norm and  should embrace all phases of the development lifecycle. We identify that the challenge is manifold:  cybersecurity has not been considered a disciplinary subject; software security is not included in standard  education programmes in computer science, and the effectiveness of the courses might be improved using  realistic environments.  Cybersecurity capacity building should not be tackled only from the technological point of view because it  has a holistic perspective. Future cybersecurity experts should not only focus on technology, but also on  people behaviour at individual and social level (psychology/sociology) and on organisational aspects  (processes). Unless cybersecurity experts learn, either individually or in groups, to be experts across  disciplines (i.e. technical, human behaviour, organisational and regulatory), the ability to build a socially  inclusive secure future for ICT will be lacking. Addressing this problem at the root through education, can  contribute to unifying cybersecurity initiatives between these groups. Security is a complex issue that must  be considered across every component during the lifecycle of the product. It must also be addressed from  a systems perspective, to ensure that the composition of secure individual components into an integrated  system yields the desired security properties through the testing and deployment. Integrating security  concepts in computer science courses will create a new generation of professionals who understand the  security basics and are able to create software with security and privacy in mind. Specialist courses for  cybersecurity practitioners should also use simulated realistic environments in order to improve the  efficacy of the training including multidisciplinary elements.  Annex A.2 presents in more details the  education challenge and the rationale behind our  recommendations.  Recommendations on the educational challenge: capacity building  Encourage the transfer of knowledge from specialized security experts to the wider academic  environment, particularly in ICT domains, but also across all societal sciences.  Facilitate the teaching of security principles in all computer science and software engineering  courses in such a way that the new generations of software engineers have security principles  integrated in their course curricula.  Promote the development of new teaching environments that encourage the design,  implementation and validation of new methods, technologies and processes.  Foster the development of multi-disciplinary curricula in cybersecurity  Artificial Intelligence – an opportunity and an existential threat  Artificial intelligence (AI) has at its core the promise of huge benefit with similarly huge risk. Enabled by the  massive amount of collected data by the evolving Internet of Everything (IoE), the ubiquitous fast  connectivity and cloud infrastructure, new applications using artificial intelligence are proposed every day.  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  12  Whilst closely related to the concept of “big data”, AI is able to pick out patterns and make automatic  decisions through the sub-disciplines of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. That is where both  opportunity and risk lie – the decision may be beneficial, or it may be catastrophic. A false or misleading  assertion by AI could lead to significant harm to the intended societal beneficiary. However, the attraction  of building new business on AI is considerable and the reach of AI is immense.  It is this depth of intrusion  of AI into everyday life that requires a focus of technological research.  Main Recommendation on Artificial Intelligence threat  Promote a robust, safe, secure and inclusive Artificial intelligence where humans can  understand the rationale and trust the results.  Foster verification, validation, security, control of the machine learning algorithms and input  data have not been manipulated  Annex B.1 contains a more detailed analysis on the applications, opportunities and risks of AI for the  security of society. Based on that, more specific research actions are summarized here:   Research in developing AI techniques that produce more explainable models while maintaining  prediction accuracy (usually called in research Explainable Artificial intelligence).   Research in verification, validation, security and control of the machine learning algorithms for  preventing safety issues.   Research in adversarial machine learning in order to avoid wrong results due to the introduction of  false data (either in the algorithm or in the trained data) in the machine.   In applications where machine learning is unsupervised and there is an interaction with people, AI  experiments have shown bias and unfair results. Research is needed how to build inclusive and no  discriminatory AI.  It is also considered that longer term research is necessary in the field of having ethically 'correct' Artificial  intelligence. The rationale is that as AI becomes increasingly trusted, following the results from the areas  highlighted above, it will increasingly become involved in areas of decision making where in conventional  human discourse an ethics panel may sit.  Quantum technology  The impact of quantum technology on security can be divided into 2 classes:  1. Techniques to provide resistance to attacks using quantum computing - post-quantum  cryptography or Quantum Safe Cryptography (QSC);  2. Techniques taking advantage of quantum effects (e.g. superposition, entanglement, uncertainty)  as typified by Quantum Key Distribution (QKD).  The first of these has been identified as a reaction to an existential threat – that by defeating, absolutely,  any security claims made against the asymmetric cryptography used today in digital transactions. In other  words, quantum computers might be able to undermine the security that underpins e-commerce, e- government.  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  13  The second class of quantum technology  uses quantum technologies to agree on a secret key in order to  establish a secure communication channel resistant to attacks by quantum computers. Although QKD  technology has several limitations, including the dependence on physical channels and the need for  intermediate trusted node, development of innovative QKD systems might create a niche market in high  secure digital communications.  Whilst there are a number of extant research projects into both classes of quantum technology, relevant  fundamental research challenges and development issues are present and it might need many years of  R&D to bring substantial results. Moreover, when quantum safe cryptographic solutions emerge, further  effort and research will be needed to adapt solutions for each user case. Obviously, this priority might  need to be reassessed based on the advancement of quantum computers and their practical ability to  break current asymmetric cryptography.  Main Recommendations on Quantum technologies  Facilitate the research on post quantum cryptography and their successive applications when  candidates will become available  Support the development of Quantum Key Distribution geographical high-speed networks (by  using satellite and terrestrial links) for high security communications  The state of the art research in quantum technologies for cybersecurity and the underlying research issues  are described in Annex B.2.  Complexity, cascade and supply chain threats  The digital transformation has engendered a subtle transformation that has made all sectors increasingly  dependent on digital infrastructures. For example, cloud providers offer many services now and any  unavailability, loss of integrity, or violation of confidentiality, may have serious consequences for  businesses or governments who use their services. In the same way, the unavailability of financial  operations – due for instance to a denial of service attack - has the potential to affect the operations and  economy of most countries and businesses.  Unfortunately, the security of systems cannot be guaranteed to 100%. But efforts must be done to secure  the systems in order to reduce the risk at an acceptable level and guarantee resilience and business  continuity.  Main Recommendations on Complexity threat  Foster the development of a new approach for impact assessment of complex and  interdependent systems.  Promote the definition of secure and interoperable interfaces among critical infrastructures to  prevent cascading effects.  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  14  Based on these high-level recommendations, we identified more specific research actions (as also detailed  in Annex B.3) :   New approaches for dependency and interdependency impact assessment   Research on the cybersecurity measurements (by catching meaningful parameters from empirical data  analytics) might be extremely important to determine trends to better utilize security resources and  judge the success or failure of implemented security solutions.   Convergence of safety, security and quality elements that might be used to assess the maturity model  and the resilience of the system   Define secure, interoperable interfaces among different critical infrastructures to prevent from  cascading effects.   New approaches to mitigate against the increasing value of attacks as a result of data centralisation  Cybercrime: Detection, Mitigation and Attribution of Cyber-attacks  Criminal activity is common in all areas of life and it is not a surprise that criminal activity has spread to the  digital world. With the digital transformation, many valuable assets are online and they may become the  prey of cybercriminals. Some of the attacks use methodologies and attack vulnerabilities that are already  known; others, the most sophisticated ones, use creative solutions and unknown techniques. Cyber-attack  patterns need to be better recorded and understood in order to apply effective mitigation measurements.  Main Recommendations on Cybercrime: Detection, Mitigation and Attributions of Attacks  Facilitate the research on technical prioritization of security efforts and the development of  innovative situational awareness tools  Help the development of independent evidence-based cyber threat intelligence and  understand the trends through historical data.  Based on these high-level recommendations, further R&D investment is needed on these topics (also  described in Annex B.4):   Research on technical prioritization of the security effort (e.g. Advanced threat intelligence which  simplify the process of combining and prioritizing alerts from multiple sources)   Development of novel approaches for providing organisations the appropriate situational awareness in  relation to cyber security threats allowing them to detect and quickly and effectively respond to  sophisticated cyber-attacks.   Development of novel techniques to collect forensic information   Development of independent evidence-based cyber threat intelligence for fighting cybercrime,  understand the trends through the position of sensors able to do sinkholing and collect malware  samples   Research and development on malware /attack prediction using data analytics and machine  prediction.  That will need the creation of very large updated data sets of labelled malware to train the  machine predictor.  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  15  Privacy threat  Privacy is a fundamental right cited in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights3 and in the European  Convention of Human Rights4, and many efforts have been made in regulation and legal frameworks to  protect those rights. The most recent important example in Europe being the General Data Protection  Regulation (GDPR) 5, which had a considerable impact on how corporations and organisations manage  personal data. The GDPR introduce a risk-based approach that encourages organizations to implement  appropriate measures corresponding to the level of risk of their data processing activities. That might be  seen as an administrative burden, but if it helps to protect the privacy that is always at risks in this always  more connected data-centric digital world. The forthcoming Regulation on Privacy and Electronic  Communications may reinforce the legal basis for the protection of privacy in electronic communications.  Main Recommendations on Privacy threat  Promote and diffuse Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) across different components (e.g.  big data, cloud, IoT ) and through application domains (e.g. healthcare, transportation, energy)  Promote the development of privacy assessment tools for guaranteeing appropriate  measurements are in place to protect private information.  As described in Annex B.5, the research challenge are manifold:   New anonymization privacy models and methods are required   New Analytics tools where the principle of data minimisation is applied.   New Model of safeguarding mechanisms following the privacy by design and by default requirements  3 http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/  4 https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf  5 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1528874672298&uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  16  Annex A: Awareness and education challenges  Awareness building – societal challenge  The digital world has a different pace. Understanding this, being aware of it, is the key to progress and  improvement. Cybersecurity represents both risk and opportunity. In the physical world, society has spent  many centuries developing both awareness and understanding of the environment and developing coping  mechanisms to manage both risk and opportunity. The digital world and its inherent risks and  opportunities have been with us for at most a few decades. The pace of its arrival has meant that unlike in  the past the older generation has time to learn and teach the next generation a set of coping behaviours.  In the digital age all generations are experiencing and learning at the same time – this tends to encourage  sharing experiences and behaviours amongst peers.  The call to “Don’t take candies from strangers”, “Don’t talk to strangers”? is in many societies used  throughout childhood to teach risk aware behaviour and became part of the social norms upon which  society is built. The viability and success of these forms of teaching has taken many years to develop but on  occasion still fail: Children still accept candies from strangers and in some occasions place themselves at  extreme risk as a result. In contrast, the digital world is comparatively new and is evolving too fast for  simple social teaching and social norms to develop in order that learned protections become native.  Moreover, in this context the threats are continually changing.  In many cases, people cannot translate what is safe and polite behaviour in the physical world to the digital  world6. There are some demographic generalisations that may apply: Exposure only as adults with limited  desire to become safe and protected digital citizens; A younger generation has been born using technology  as the basis of learning and communicating (i.e. mobile phones and computers are the new norms). There  is also a general expectation that the ICT infrastructure (the services, the network) will work as intended,  and that failure has no hard consequences, other than requiring a reboot. There is also a significant mind- gap between pure IT appliances (telephones, computers, TVs, tablets), whose life expectancy is relatively  small, and physical-IT appliances (cars, fridges, heaters, AC unit, etc.) which have a long lifetime, and are  even supposed to be used by multiple owners and have resale value. Ensuring that the ICT part of these  objects follows the same principles as the physical part, which can be sold without leaving “traces”, is  certainly difficult.  Typical reactions to advice on cybersecurity are generally negative: “the interfaces are too complicated”, “I  did not know”, “it is too boring”, “I know but I don’t care”. The lesson of this appears to be that people find  the concept of cybersecurity both difficult and of no interest. In the physical world, safety is provided for  them or is learnt through both direct and indirect exposure to risk. Taking all of the risk management  onboard as an individual is not acceptable so it is often discounted as somebody else’s responsibility. So,  the question is either:   how can citizens be empowered with the knowledge and a sense of shared responsibility to  practice safe and informed behaviours on the Internet? or,  6 The European Cybersecurity Month initiative has been promoting awareness in cybersecurity since 2011. It  advocates for change in the perception of cyber-threats by promoting data and information security, education,  sharing of good practices and competitions. In particular the slogan STOP. THINK. CONNECT.™ aims to educate all  Internet users to be more vigilant about practicing safe online habits; to ensure that Internet safety is perceived as a  shared responsibility at home, in the workplace, and throughout our communities. https://cybersecuritymonth.eu  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  17   how can citizens be assured that they are not exposed to risk?  Further research is required to answer either of these questions with any degree of certainty.  Capacity building – educational challenge  Cybersecurity experts are in high demand and it is predicted that more than 350K additional experts will be  required by 20227. Cybersecurity education will play a fundamental role for forming a new generation of  experts.  A.2.1 Enabling the multidisciplinary approach  Cybersecurity is a multidisciplinary subject, well described in the Camino8 H2020 project as formed by  these aspects:   Technical - related to technology, concrete technological approaches and solutions that can be used to  fight against cyber-crime and cyber-terrorism,   Human - related to human factors, behavioural aspects, privacy issues, as well as raising awareness  and knowledge of society with regards to cyber-crime and terrorism threats,   Organisational - related to processes, procedures and policies within organisations, as well as  cooperation (public-private, public-public) between organisations,   Regulatory - related to law provisioning, standardisation and forensics.  Very simply unless cybersecurity experts learn, either individually or in groups, to be expert across all of  these disciplines and their many sub-disciplines, the ability to build a socially inclusive secure future for ICT  will be lacking. Quite simply as has been shown in the research to date, experts focusing on different  cybersecurity aspects often find it difficult to communicate effectively together because their incentives,  languages, knowledge bases, and worldviews are different. Addressing this problem at the root through  education, can contribute to unifying cybersecurity initiatives between these groups9. The assertion is that  it is known what needs to be done, that is to become multidisciplinary, the challenge is to enable it.  An approach in this direction is the Cyber Security Academy 10 where students are required to learn the  relations between technical, legal and social scientific aspects of cybersecurity, so they can come to  effective and sustainable solutions for cyber risks and threats and contribute effectively to sustainable  strategies for digital defensibility and security of society as a whole. An effective way to achieve this goal  appears not to have a clear answer as to what must be done. This guarantees that is has to be a priority  in research.  A.2.2 Cybersecurity in computing  If the assertion is made that ICT embraces cybersecurity, and that ICT is enabled by computing, then it  follows that cybersecurity and computing should be addressed together.  Every day developers release code that contains defects. Whilst not all defects are necessarily security  flaws, many of them may be exploited to become security or safety concerns. Even if a defect or bug exists  the functional goal of the code may be achieved, and the existence of the defect may not be seen in  7 Global Information Security Workforce Study 2017  8 http://www.fp7-camino.eu/  9 Ramirez, R, ‘Making cyber security interdisciplinary : recommendations for a novel curriculum and terminology  harmonization’, MIT 2017  10 https://www.csacademy.nl/en/  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  18  conventional use and deployment. The existence of defects that may become vectors of attack should not  be a surprise given that software security is usually not included in the standard educational programs in  computer science and security and privacy by design are too often taught only in specialized optional  courses. Findings such as those of the CSEC2017 Joint Task Force11 recommending that efforts be made to  standardize curricula for the programme in cybersecurity, and by doing so to restructure the curricula in  Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Information Systems, Information Technology, Software  Engineering and introduce cybersecurity concepts in specialized classes, are a significant step forward.  Security must be considered from the top to the low level, across every component, between every  component from the architecture of the systems, through the testing and operation and deep into the  silicon that carries out the computing. That is a not trivial exercise. The issue in programming is complex  and range from architectural security issues to a single bug exploit by a creative attacker, this is also true  for decisions regarding the use and reuse of library code where the reuse may disclose defects not present  in the originally targeted use.  Recently DevSecOps12 13 has gained traction in IT development: it indicated the development, security and  operation team work together in agile way and they think about security and application from the start. It  is all about introducing the security elements sooner in the life cycle of application development14 to  minimize vulnerabilities and have everyone involved become responsible for security. The idea is to  automate core security tasks by integrating security processes and controls earlier in the development  side. That is also beneficial the overall quality of the products and services offered.  Security by design should be the norm along and should embrace all phases of the lifecycle. The research  interviews that informed the present report indicated a need of material with updated examples and  guidelines that might facilitate the transfer of the knowledge from specialized security expert to the  wider computer science.  In particular, development of guidance and education material for computer science is needed to ensure  education in the following fields:   Validation methods which can trap and eradicate known vulnerabilities (e.g. built in immunity to SQL  injection attacks)   Authentication, authorization, and session management in order to remove mechanisms by which an  attacker gains unauthorized access (prevention of privilege escalation).   Secure programming including characteristics of each language that impact security including  cryptographic utilities, the storing and access to sensitive information, protecting data in memory.  11 https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/education/curricula-recommendations/csec2017.pdf  12 https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-devsecops  13 https://www.csoonline.com/article/3245748/devops/what-is-devsecops-developing-more-secure- applications.html  14 Microsoft has develop a Security Development Lifecycle that introduces security and privacy early and throughout  all phases of the development process including an Agile approach: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en- us/library/windows/desktop/84aed186-1d75-4366-8e61-8d258746bopq.aspx  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  19   Methodology for software development, which takes into consideration security in the lifecycle of the  software - from design through development to deployment, maintenance by secure software update  until both the end of life, and reassignment of life15.   Static analysis automatic tools to identify insecure code (e.g. Potential buffer overflows, tainted inputs  and integer overflows) and perform security and vulnerability testing  Research is also needed to use artificial intelligence to analyse software both in static and runtime modes  in order to provide intelligent insights such as application stability, failure patterns, defects and failure  prediction.  A.2.3 Simulation and visualisation  Cybersecurity skills need to be continuously advanced at all levels and the experts need to adapt their  expertise to a constantly evolving landscape with increasingly sophisticated and novel cyber-attacks,  against a widening attack surface of exposed ICT systems and services. A mechanism that may achieve  refinement of skills is through the cyber range, a form of war-gaming where procedures, technical  elements and coordination activities can be exercised and responses validated. War gaming has long been  an accepted practice in the training of armies, emergency services and civil response units. In this context,  an example is offered by the European Cyber Security Challenge initiative16 that through a sort of war  gaming among  national teams tries to mitigate the shortage of skill in cybersecurity and at the same time  encourage young people to pursue a career in cybersecurity.  In this simulated environment, whilst it can offer a platform for research into the design, implementation  and validation of new security measures, most usefully it offers an opportunity to teach the role of the  multidisciplinary elements of cybersecurity.  In this simulated environment, research must be done on the design, implementation and validation of  new methods, technologies and processes in order to achieve a higher level of security to increase the  resilience against the growing threat of cyber-attacks. The simulated environment will also help for  training activities, by developing skills that can be immediately used in the real world environment.  15 Many ICT devices are re-purposed for a second life after their primary purpose is fulfilled, this may be as simple as  passing a laptop from parent to child when the former upgrades, but also has to address the second hand market in  ICT tools and technologies  16 https://www.europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  20  Annex B: Existential Threats  Artificial intelligence: the new frontier in cybersecurity  B.1.1 Artificial Intelligence in the world of Internet of Everything  Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a significant new frontier of technology that is developing at great speed and  becoming applied as an integral element in the software of all environments and industries. The promise  of these advances is that AI acts as a transforming capability in all sectors bringing innovative solutions to  the market. As AI capabilities advance and as AI systems take on increasing importance in societal  functions, the fundamental challenges discussed below are expected to become increasingly significant.  It is necessary to refine what is meant by AI. In the present document, AI refers to the broad sweep of  technologies in which a machine demonstrates intelligence leading to an optimal, or close to optimal,  solution for a given problem (e.g. machine learning, deep learning). As AI develops it will be the root of  many applications that are proposed to be introduced where machines act in increasingly autonomous  modes, i.e. responding to and interacting with their environment in flexible, resilient and self-learning  ways.  The core characteristic of AI-enabled machines is that they analyse and interpret data in order to solve a  problem, or to gain insights from data17. AI is assumed to learn in real time through trial and error, in the  same way humans do, and for that requires massive amounts of “cleaned” data to train the model.  However Artificial Intelligence has been talked about forever. The only difference is that now the fast  processing, the fast networking and the massive amounts of generated data sets enables AI to reveal the  full potential.  In fact, citizens are living in smart houses, driving autonomous cars, wearing smart wearables and  enormous quantities of data are produced and processed by AI-enabled machines. The core concept of  “Big Data” analytics using AI is able to transform unstructured data into meaningful information and a  trained AI model is able to take real-time decisions based on previous behaviours. Many of the major  cloud providers have already started to provide Artificial Intelligence as a Service18 19 20 21. Whilst it may  require further effort to discover viable solutions for all business cases, the direction is set.  Unfortunately, AI does not only offer opportunities but it also poses security threats and safety risks that  will impact efforts to create a defence for the beneficial use of AI.  B.1.2 A few applications of AI today  Autonomous vehicles  Autonomous cars are now becoming a reality. They use a variety of sensing technologies including radar,  optical recognition, which can function in tandem with GPS and inertial measurement sensors to model  17  The field of big data and data analytics, which allows gaining insight from data to take better decision, is often a  different considered a separate field of study and development.  18 https://www.ibm.com/cloud/machine-learning  19 https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning-service/  20 https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/  21 https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  21  the current dynamic behaviour of the vehicle. Moreover, the sensor data can provide accurate estimates  of the location and direction of the vehicle. This facilitates convergence with a cooperative Intelligent  transportation systems (ITS) to build up a detailed dynamic map of the operating environment and its  relation to the planned route of the vehicle. AI technologies are abundant in the vehicle to enable this  dynamic map and to estimate the behaviour of other vehicles with either human or AI drivers in order to  maximise the safety of the vehicle and its environment.  However, cybersecurity might not have been a priority area of research in the development of  autonomous vehicles since the exploit of autonomous cars have been extensive: hackers taking control of  the car22, modifying the system into not following the posted traffic signs23, lock the systems for ransom24.  The AI itself could be taught to act in a way that makes the driving environment unsafe or dangerous to  both the AI controlled vehicle and its environment. As AI becomes closer to some meaning of sentience  different AIs may behave in similarly random ways to the human intelligences that they seek to replace25  Image and video manipulation  Now it is possible to produce synthetic images that are nearly indistinguishable from real photos. Soon  probably, humans might not be able to distinguish which videos are created artificially from the real one.  As production and dissemination of high-quality forgeries becomes increasingly low-cost, synthetic  multimedia may constitute a large portion of the media and information ecosystem and they might spread  using social networks. Obviously, the advance in machine learning might allow the detection of synthetic  multimedia with a greater level of accuracy.  Surveillance  Surveillance systems have been developed that can follow trajectories of individuals, count people and  predict where crowd congestion may occur without26 human intervention27. Many deployed CCTV systems  have the technical ability to deploy AI processing to perform a number of tasks including gait recognition  and facial recognition that recognize particular individuals. Whilst technically available not all such  technologies can be deployed due to legal restrictions – however their existence suggests a particular  challenge in assuring citizen privacy28.  Concern of dual use  Artificial intelligence is a dual-use area of technology. It can be used in both an attacking and defending  role, for civilian or military application, and more broadly, toward both beneficial and harmful ends. For  example, systems that examine software for vulnerabilities have both offensive and defensive applications.  The DARPA’s Cyber Grand Challenge29 created a \"Capture the Flag” tournament where autonomous  machines attacked the other six machines participating at the tournament while defending their own  system. This required breakthrough approaches in a variety of disciplines, (e.g. computer security, program  22 https://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/  23 Eykholt, K, ‘Robust Physical-World Attacks on Deep Learning Models’, Corr, 2017  24 https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-dangers-of-the-hackable-car-1505700481  25 There is necessary overlap between AI in autonomous vehicles and the establishment of ethical AI that is addressed  in more detail later in this report.  http://moralmachine.mit.edu/ provides a website for building a crowd-sourced  picture of human opinion on how machines should make decisions when faced with moral dilemmas and for  discussion of potential scenarios of moral consequence.  26 https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-human-os/robotics/artificial-intelligence/hacking-the-brain-with-adversarial-images  27 https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/23/16907238/artificial-intelligence-surveillance-cameras-security  28 http://www.hitachi.com/New/cnews/month/2017/03/170327.html  29 https://www.darpa.mil/program/cyber-grand-challenge  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  22  analysis, and data visualization) to perform automatic identification of software flaws, formulation of  patches and deployment on the network in real time.  Unsupervised AI and bias  There have been a number of examples of unsupervised AI that have made news headlines due to  unwanted behaviour:   The twitter chatbot used to test and improve Microsoft's understanding of conversational language  was suspended after 16 hours when it began to behave in an unforeseen and unintended manner30.   Amazon’s proposed automatic tool for recruitment was scrapped due to it exhibiting signs of sexual  discrimination31.   In a study analysing the risk of using Northpointe’s AI assisted tool COMPAS (Correctional Offender  Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) it was discovered that the AI tool was introducing  racial discrimination32 by wrongly identifying black defendants at higher risk of reoffending (recidivism)  than white defendants thus reinforcing custodial sentencing for black offenders.  Examples exist of social-media sites filtering news that amplify behavioural biases by showing only media  that reinforces natural confirmation bias and, by design, protect the reader from being challenged with  contradictory sources of news. That opens questions at moral and ethical levels:  How to ensure a fair and  equal representation in the data used to train AI data across all dimensions of diversity, racial, cultural,  gender, linguistics in order to avoid discriminations, racism, extreme political views? How can AI decisions  be made that achieve fair and inclusive views and balance different positions? How to engage and support  the marginalized people and the most vulnerable in our society?  The conclusion here is that research is needed in order to de-bias AI and to ensure that training schemes  for AI do not inherit biases from their programmers.  B.1.3 Research for an explainable robust and safe AI  Artificial intelligence offers tremendous opportunities in all sectors. “The risks, however, are also  substantial and plausibly pose extreme governance challenges. These include labour displacement,  inequality, an oligopolistic global market structure, reinforced totalitarianism, shifts and volatility in  national power, strategic instability, and an AI race that sacrifices safety and other values”33. In this  document, the scope is narrower and focusses on a few technical elements that are related to the  technology centric security aspects. To be accepted in a society, an AI machine has to be trusted34.  Research is desired to lead to proof that an unsupervised AI performs robustly as desired and the results  are in line with the expectations. This can be translated into 4 areas of research: 35   Verification: How to prove that a system satisfies certain desired formal properties. (Did I build the  system right?)  30 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tay_(bot)  31 https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45809919  32 https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm  33 Dafoe, A.,’AI Governance: A Research Agenda’, Future of Humanity Institute, University of Oxford, 2018  34 Samek, W et at, ‘Explainable Artificial Intelligence: Understanding, Visualizing and Interpreting Deep Learning  Models’, ITU Journal: ICT discoveries, Oct 2017  35 Russell, S et al, “Research Priorities for Robust and Beneficial Artificial Intelligence”, AI Magazine 36, No 4, 2015  https://futureoflife.org/static/data/documents/research_priorities.pdf?x93895  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  23   Validity: How to ensure that a system that meets its formal requirements does not have unwanted  behaviours and consequences. (Did I build the right system?)   Security: How to prevent intentional or unintentional manipulation by unauthorized parties.   Control: How to enable meaningful human control over an AI system after it begins to operate.   Traceability: How to be able to trace how the AI system has taken a certain decision.  Poor design of AI systems may cause unsafe and harmful behaviour. The following list shows some of the  research problems regarding a safe AI36:   Avoiding negative side effects: How to ensure that an AI agent will not cause unintended and  destructive effects to the rest of the environment?   Avoiding Reward Hacking: “How can we ensure that an AI agent will no game its reward function?  For example, if we reward the robot for achieving an environment free of messes, it might disable  its vision so that it won't see any messes, or cover over messes with materials it can't see through,  or simply hide when humans are around so they can't tell it about new types of messes”37   Distributional shift: How can it be ensured that an AI agent behaves robustly when its test or  deployment environment differs from the training environment? 38   Safe exploration: How can an AI agent be built that respects constraints and limits?   Absent supervisor: How can an AI agent ensure that it does not behave differently depending on  the presence or absence of a supervisor?   Safe interrupt ability: How to ensure an AI agent, in order to achieve its goal, does not disable any  designed in kill switch?39  All these issues for safety and security can be better managed through explainable robust AI. This field of  research aims to produce more explainable models in the way that humans can understand the rationale,  trust the results and be able to predict how the AI will behave in the future.  B.1.4 Adversarial machine learning intelligence and the challenge to recognize the unknowns  Adversarial machine learning in which an attacker produces carefully perturbed input samples aimed to  mislead detection at deployment is an additional area in which research is required. There have been  reported cases where a Black Box attack has been carried out in closed systems surveillance systems,  autonomous car, and speech recognition40  as examples of adversarial machine learning. Adversarial AI  often deals with unknown unknowns wherein on deployment they misclassify never-before-seen inputs  that are sufficiently different from known training data41. This threat needs further research in order to  avoid a false sense of security in the mitigation and detection of attacks done using AI where unknown  unknowns poses a risk of misclassification on the defence monitoring tool.  36 See some of the works done for the AI Safety Research programme: https://futureoflife.org/ai-safety-research/  37 Amodei, D et al, “Concrete Problems in AI Safety”, 2016, https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565  38 Leike ,J, “AI Safety Gridworlds”, 2017, https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09883  39 Orseau, L et Amstrong, S. “Safely Interruptible Agents”, Proc. of Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence  2016, New York City. Machine Intelligence Research Institute, 1 June 2016,  https://intelligence.org/files/Interruptibility.pdf  40 Narodytska, N et Kasiviswanathan, S. “Simple Black-Box Adversarial Perturbations for Deep Networks, 2017,  https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.06299  41 Biggio, B et Roli, F, “Wild Patterns: Ten Years After the Rise of Adversarial Machine Learning”, 2018,  https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03141  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  24  B.1.5 Artificial intelligence and ethics  A more provocative area of research is the relation between AI and ethics.  Robots will increasingly gain intelligence and the resulting robots may be used in the future as defence  tools.  A first question is how to define an AI that can recognize what is ethically 'correct' or not. Any  solution that eliminates the uncertainty of sentience, such as creating programs with explicitly formulated  rules, rather than asking a robot to derive its own, is defeating the rationale for sentient or autonomous AI.  There are many ways to consider and gamify ethical dilemmas. The challenge to be faced in research is  that of providing a structure of ethics that allows a robot to interact with humans (and other sentient  things (machine or animal). An ethical black box, which is able to maintain a record of the inputs and  actions that led to any decision, may be critical to the process of discovering why and how a robot caused  an accident, and thus an essential part of establishing accountability and responsibility 42. Society's  acceptance of such machines will depend on whether they can be programmed to act in ways that  maximize safety, fit in with social norms, and encourage trust. However, a more philosophical set of  question remain:  Can machines have sentience? How can a sentient machine be recognised? This restates  the Turing test: Can machines think?43 How to distinguish a human from a machine?  The resultant codification of AI, of Ethics, has to be interoperable across a wide range of technologies and  there has to be a very close relationship between R&D and exploitation or deployment. This has to address  such issues as codification in policy and legislation as well as in the ICT requirement to share knowledge  and information.  Quantum technology  . The current state of the art in asymmetric cryptography is predicated on “hard” problems, that is  problems which have no feasible means of being solved. If these hard problems can be solved then the  security assumptions are made null and void. Research in the field of quantum computing and the  application to such problems has produced credible threats to the underlying assumptions behind these  “hard” problems to such an extent that research has been focussed in recent years on identifying  alternative schemes to the existing pervasive cryptosystems of RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography.  The impact of quantum technology on security can be divided into 2 classes:  3. Techniques to provide resistance to attacks using quantum computing - post-quantum  cryptography or Quantum Safe Cryptography;  4. Techniques taking advantage of quantum effects (e.g. superposition, entanglement, uncertainty)  most often demonstrated in Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)  State of the art  In June 2015, ETSI has released a survey of current cryptographic principles, the possible impact of  quantum computing on their effectiveness and what can be done to mitigate the risks in an economically  and technically practical manner44. This study has been followed up by a large number of ETSI  42 Winfield, Alan et Jirotka, Mrina, “The Case for an Ethical Black Box”, Part of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science  book series (LNCS, volume 10454)  43 Turing, Alan, \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\", Mind, LIX (236): 433–460, Oct 1950,  doi:10.1093/mind/LIX.236.433, ISSN 0026-4423  44 http://www.etsi.org/images/files/ETSIWhitePapers/QuantumSafeWhitepaper.pdf  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  25  publications45 on the threat from quantum computing and on characterisation of cryptographic primitives  that enable resistance against attacks using quantum computers46.  In parallel ETSI ISG QKD has developed a number of specifications47 relating to the physical layer  capabilities of quantum-based data transfer that allow for a completely secure means to achieve  agreement on some shared random data, the most obvious semantic form for this random data is a key for  use in a future cryptographic function. Note that QKD only addresses the threat of capture of a key in  transit and does not address any further distribution of the key once agreed. It should be stressed that  QKD is a purely physical phenomenon whereas QSC is able to be applied at any abstracted layer in the  conventional OSI model.  Whilst in April 2016 NIST published “NIST Interagency Report (NISTIR) 8105: Report on Post-Quantum  Cryptography”48, which indicated the status of quantum computing and post-quantum cryptography up to  that point, it also outlined NIST’s initial plan to move forward in this space. The next steps have been seen  in the invitation for assessment of future quantum safe cryptographic algorithms which are undergoing  detail analysis49. Submissions include some that were (co-)designed by PQCRYPTO50 and SAFEcrypto51, two  H2020 projects completed in 2018 with a focus on developing post quantum cryptography solutions.  The contrast between quantum technology in security and resistance to the application of quantum  computing to defeat security has to be stressed. Very simply there are no visible developments in the  application of quantum mechanics in security – in this context the role of QKD is that of key establishment  and does not of itself address security (the nature of QKD is that a secret is exchanged between 2 parties  but that secret is not known in advance nor it is part of a recoverable key management scheme).  In 2016 the EU commission prepared a communication “Commission Staff Working Document on Quantum  Technologies”52 which reviews current issues in creating industrially and societally relevant Quantum  Technologies and discusses concerns to be addressed by a roadmap for turning Europe's global leadership  in research into a future world-class European Quantum Industry.  The Commission Expert Group on Quantum Technologies – High Level Steering Committee - has delivered  in June 2017 the Quantum Technologies Flagship Final Report53. It focuses around four mission-driven  research and innovation domains, representing the major applied areas in the field: Communication,  Computation, Simulation, as well as Sensing and Metrology. The Quantum communication involves  generation and use of quantum states and resources for communication protocols (i.e. quantum random  number generators (QRNG) for secret keys and quantum key distribution (QKD) for their secure  distribution).  45 See the work done in ETSI related to cybersecurity: https://www.etsi.org/technologies- clusters/technologies/cyber-security  46 This work was conducted by the ETSI TC CYBER and the ETSI ISG QSC group,  now integrated as a specialist working  group of ETSI TC CYBER  47 https://www.etsi.org/technologies-clusters/technologies/quantum-key-distribution  48 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8105  49 https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Post-Quantum-Cryptography/Post-Quantum-Cryptography-Standardization  50 https://pqcrypto.eu.org/  51 https://www.safecrypto.eu/  52 ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=15270  53 https://tinyurl.com/QT-/HLSC-report  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  26  Based on Quantum Technologies Flagship Report, the EU commission has recently opened some calls:   H2020-FETFLAG-2018-2020 to build a strongly networked European Quantum Technologies 54-Ramp- up phase in H2020 to further develop R&D in Quantum Technologies   SU-ICT-04-2019 QKD testbed call for building an experimental platform to test and validate the  concept of end-to-end security, providing quantum key distribution as a service. This will be a pilot to  determine the maturity of QKD to identify the practical implementation issues55  All these initiative goes in the right direction and both Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and post-quantum  cryptography present relevant fundamental research and development challenges and might need many  years of research to bring substantial results. Moreover, when quantum safe cryptographic solutions will  emerges, further efforts is needed to adapt the best solutions for each user case. Obviously, this priority  might need to be reassessed based on the advancement of quantum computers and their capability to  break the current asymmetric cryptography56.  Complexity, cascade effect and supply chain threat  The complexity of networks and systems has increased dramatically over the last years, and there is no  reason to suggest that this trend will stop. It is already challenging to consider the relations in each of big  monolithic or small-interconnected systems, but the complexity increases exponentially when it involved  complex systems from different sectors and cross borders. It is necessary to look at the complexity and  interdependency in different areas that are critical for our society and economy. In fact, a loss or damage  will lead to significant negative impact on the safety, security or health of the population.  A domino effect, in which the failure of one component can instantiate a chain of failures across a wide set  of loosely connected components should be addressed in design. A more technical definition of the  domino effect is cascade failure. The impact of security incidents may propagate across sectors via such  cyber dependencies and interdependencies.  Due to the digitisation of services, all major sectors have an increasing level of dependency on digital  infrastructures. For example, many services now are offered by cloud providers and any unavailability, loss  of integrity, or violation of confidentiality, may have serious consequences for businesses or governments  who use their services. The use of multitenant cloud storage also poses security risks that cannot be  completely unconsidered. Moreover, the unavailability of financial operations – due for instance to a  denial of service attack - has the potential to affect the operations and economy of most countries and  businesses.  Another example of the complexity and the dependencies in our everyday life is shown by the supply chain  attack57. An instance is the NotPetya attack58, where a compromised software posed a single point of  54 http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/fetflag-03-2018.html  55 https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/su-ict-04-2019.html  56 BSI in 2017 has published a comprehensive study on the evolution of quantum computers in order to understand  the status of the art, the actors and the current technology to build a Quantum Computer - https://www.bsi.bund.de/qcstudie  57 Examples of supply chain attacks: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/info-notes/supply-chain-attacks  58 https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/  reports that at least  four hospitals in Kiev, six power companies, two airports, more than 22 Ukrainian banks, ATMs and card payment  systems in retailers and transport, and practically every federal agency were affected. And the attack had serious  consequence in other countries and in important businesses.  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  27  failure for the security of several entities that offered critical services. Strictly related to it, it is the failure  of assurance that products introduced in the supply chain do not present cybersecurity defects (at any  layer from the silicon to the customer interface), which when exploited can create failures with domino  effects.  Unfortunately, the security of systems cannot be guaranteed to 100%. But efforts must be done to secure  the systems in order to reduce the risk at an acceptable level and guarantee resilience and business  continuity. A risk-based approach is the most used methodological approach for security although it is  often not difficult to quantify the risk brought by interdependencies.  The present report therefore suggests the following areas for research:   New approaches for dependency and interdependency impact assessment starting from the  Identification and Modelling of Dependencies and Interdependencies, through the Analysis and  Measurement (e.g. Network based approaches that capture information flows among individual  components to depict dependencies and interdependencies)   The quantitative measurements in cybersecurity59 are extremely difficult and most often organizations  use metrics which may include a subjective attribute. Research on the cybersecurity measurements (by  catching meaningful parameters from empirical data analytics) might be extremely important to  determine trends to better utilize security resources and judge the success or failure of implemented  security solutions.   Convergence of safety, security and quality elements that might be used to assess the maturity model  and the resilience of the system   Define Secure, interoperable interfaces among different critical infrastructures to prevent from  cascading effects.   New approaches to mitigate against the increasing value of attacks as a result of data centralisation.   Development of system-wide attack mitigation patterns that should be included in systems to provide  graceful failure modes instead of catastrophic modes.  Cybercrime: Detection, Mitigation and Attribution of attacks against Cyber threats  As cyberspace grows in size and complexity and digital transformation evolves, the risk of cyber-attack for  business and individuals increases60. The economic benefit for the attackers is reported very high and risk  for individuals might include not only a financial or cyber dimension but also a physical one (e.g. the theft  of personally identifiable information or biometric data may be used for a criminal impersonation).  High-profile data breaches61 have made headlines recently and the growing number of incidents require  extra effort for detecting and mitigating the attacks. The fight against cybercrime can be approached at  different levels (policy, regulatory, technical, organizational, etc.) although the present report focusses on  the technical level.  59 The ETSI Information Security Indicators ISG is already publishing standards in the area of quantitative evaluation of  cybersecurity performance for organizations. The work already done includes indicators, a maturity model, and in the  future, they might propose data analytics to compute part of the indicators automatically.  60 The Global Risk Report 2018 from the World Economic Forum has identifies cyber-attacks as the most probable  risks after natural disasters in a 10 period time https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-risks-report-2018  61 Largest data breaches in the last years :  https://www.techworld.com/security/uks-most-infamous-data-breaches-3604586/  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  28  To effectively tackle ever more sophisticated cyber threats requires an understanding of the actors, their  determination or motivation, in order that the defenders have a clear understanding of the attack surface  and how it can be reduced.  One of technical issue for both government and business protecting against cyber-attack is the relative  inefficiency of threat analytics. Whilst solutions such as the Security Information and Event Management  (SIEM) have existed for an extended period of time, the complexity of the systems, the inability to extract  information from noise, the lack of skilled resources to interpret and the analyse the available data, and  sometimes the sophistication of attacks has left many attacks undetected for long periods of time, and this  results in discrediting of the tools at hand. Research into new predictive security analytic machines may  play a significant role by utilising the tools of big data analytics to provide an analyst with everything they  need to know or make an automated decision based on the measured elements62.  However, the fight against cyberattacks should not be underestimated: the adversary can be creative (e.g.  zero-day attacks), might not follow any rules, the knowledge of labelled data on malware or attacks is  limited to a few cyber security companies and new sample might be available too late in certain critical  environment. Research and development in this field is necessary although that might be proved  extremely challenging considering that categorize the unknowns is not possible and it is extremely  challenging to predict an attack who has not been before. However, a concrete move in this area to might  be beneficial to provide an effective first layer of defence. The higher level of security might still only be  offered by whitelisting the known software and connections to reputable partners and leaving an expert or  another algorithm to judge the other cases. Anyway in many environments, defence-in-depth approach as  well as cyber resilience and response capabilities appear as the only solutions viable to respond to the  threats and limit the damage.  There is also a significant trade-off between security controls and ease of use. Monitoring and detection  provide a solution that enables users to carry on with their work, while detecting anomalies and  supporting corrective measures later.  The present report therefore suggests the following areas which need further R&D investment:   Research on technical prioritization of the security effort (e.g. Advanced threat intelligence which  simplify the process of combining and prioritizing alerts from multiple sources)   Development of novel approaches for providing organisations the appropriate situational awareness in  relation to cyber security threats allowing them to detect and quickly and effectively respond to  sophisticated cyber-attacks.   Development of novel techniques to collect forensic information   Development of independent evidence-based cyber threat intelligence for fighting cybercrime,  understand the trends through the position of sensors able to do sinkholing and collect malware  samples   Research and development on malware /attack prediction using data analytics and machine  prediction.  That will need the creation of very large updated data sets of labelled malware to train the  machine predictor.  62 Hanan, et al. \"A Taxonomy and Survey of Intrusion Detection System Design Techniques, Network Threats and  Datasets.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.03517 (2018) presents a taxonomy of Malicious Traffic for Intrusion Detection  Systems and they highlight the difficulty to evaluate them due to a shortage of open–source datasets representing  accurately network traffic and their associated threats.  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  29  Privacy threat and the innovation brought by the GDPR  GDPR has had a considerable impact on how corporate manages personal data. Perhaps one of the most  significant issues behind this success is the punitive nature of violations by data controllers and processors.  It may be argued that fear of punishment of itself is the driver for more care in the design of processing  but it might offer an economic incentive to minimize the risk. The GDPR introduces a risk-based approach:  the higher the risk (for the rights and freedoms of data subjects), the more rigorous the measures that the  controller or the processor needs to take (in order to manage the risk).  GDPR provision for a risk-based approach is horizontal as there are not exemptions or light weight  approaches based on the organization size, availability of recourses and capabilities. That means that all  individuals, SME and big corporate has this legislative obligation that can be seen as a costly administrative  burden. However, GDPR might offer a competitive-advantage for companies: applying effectively the  principle of privacy-by-design can help to build and retain customer trust. GDPR compliance tools can  facilitate the privacy assessment and automatic tools give power to consumers to own their data and have  a choice of whom they share this with and for what return.  The forthcoming Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications is expected to give new impetus to  the way privacy is protected in electronic communications.  However further innovation is needed in different fields which can contribute at a more effective data  protection and at creating business opportunities.  Technical elements such as Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs), e.g. encryption, protocols for  anonymous communications, attribute based credentials and private search of databases are the primary  areas of research. In addition there are very important ground for research on how to guarantee data  portability in an online platform, prevent online and mobile tracking, consent management in a multi- ownership environment, guarantee in automatic way the subject’s right, e.g. right to erasure, access and  correction, data deletion especially in a cloud environment63.  In a big data and Artificial intelligence environment, the challenges at technical level for research are  further more64 65:   New anonymization privacy models and methods are required when data are continuously and  massively collected.   New encryption techniques are necessary to efficiently allow search and do other computations over  the stored data without decrypting the data (e.g. Attribute-Based-Encryption, Encryption search,  Privacy preserving computations).   New Analytics environments where the principle of data minimisation are applied.   New Model of data protection and privacy requirements where policy definition and enforcement is  automatic in a way that one party cannot refuse to honour the policy of another party in the chain of  co-controllership and information sharing  63 For instance, blockchain technology might offers individuals greater sovereignty over their data and allow them to  manage and own their data on a shared ledger.  64 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/privacy-and-data-protection-by-design  65 The Norwegian Data Protection Officer has prepared a report on AI challenges and GDPR:  https://www.datatilsynet.no/en/about-privacy/reports-on-specific-subjects/ai-and-privacy/  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  30  While the technical research community is continuing improving existing building blocks, interdisciplinary  research is needed for connecting privacy to economics, law, ethnography, psychology, medicine,  biotechnology, human rights. Obviously, PETs need to be rooted in a data governance strategy for  unfolding their full benefit for privacy and data protection. In big corporation, the new obligation can help  to think break down organisation barriers and might create a fertile ground for innovation with data.  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  31  Annex C: Methodology, policy context and R&D funding scheme  Methodology used in the report  This study was carried out using a four-step methodology starting from the scope definition, the initial  information gathering, the collection of expert opinion and ending with the development of a report.  Figure 1 Steps used in the methodology of the report  1. Scope definition and Desktop research: The first step was to establish the report’s scope and  perimeter. In parallel an investigation was carried out to identify existing publications and  information on the topics and to conduct brainstorming session with ENISA experts in different  fields, so as to gather their input and knowledge in relation to the objectives of this report.  2. Collection of external stakeholders’ and experts’ point of view: A series of interviews were  conducted with the selected experts from ENISA permanent stakeholder group and selected  member of academia and industry. In the interview, the experts express their opinions on the  strategic research priorities in cybersecurity for a safer Europe. It was also asked to give the  rationale behind these chooses and their supporting evidences.  3. Analysis and development: The results from the desktop research and the interviews were  analysed and contrasted to align them with the objectives of the report. A qualitative approach  was used to prioritize the identified research topics and to evaluate the supporting evidence. The  analysis included triangulation of the data across different stakeholder groups and with validation  by ENISA experts. A critical assessment of contributions was made since the stakeholders may vest  interest.  4. Report write-up: The last step was to synthesise all the findings from the desktop research and the  interviews with the experts, shaping this report.  European Policy Context  The current approach to Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) and resilience within the EU  has its roots in the Commission communication of 2009, entitled “Protecting Europe from large-scale  Scope definition and Desktop  research  Collection of external stakeholders’  and experts’ point of view  Analysis and development  Report write-up  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  32  cyber-attacks and disruptions: enhancing preparedness, security and resilience”66. In 2013, the  Commission released the Cybersecurity Strategy of the EU, which laid down a number of fundamental  principles that support the EU approach to cybersecurity, including the need of achieving cyber resilience,  strong and effective legislation on the cyber domain, the promotion of a Single Market for cyber security  products, and fostering R&D investments and innovation.  The Directive on security of network and information systems (NIS Directive)67 was the first piece of EU- wide legislation on cybersecurity. It provided legal measures to boost the overall level of cybersecurity in  the EU forcing all the EU member states in adopting a national strategy on the security of network and  information systems, to create a cooperation group in order to support and facilitate strategic cooperation  and the exchange of information among Member States, to introduce security measures and incident  reporting obligations for operators of essential services and digital service providers.  On 13 September 2017, the Commission adopted a cybersecurity package68. The Commission identifies  that “the scale and cross-border nature of the threat make a powerful case for EU action providing  incentives and support for Member States to develop and maintain more and better national cybersecurity  capabilities, while at the same time building EU-level capacity. This approach is designed [..] to give  cybersecurity the priority it needs to build resilience and deliver a better EU response to cyber-attacks”.  The cybersecurity package created a focus on:   Building EU resilience to cyber-attacks and stepping up the EU's cybersecurity capacity through a  reinforced ENISA with the mandate to put in place and implement the EU-wide cybersecurity  certification framework   Stepping up EU's cybersecurity capacity by establishing an European Cybersecurity Research and  Competence Centre, acting as a blueprint for how Europe and its Member States can respond quickly  and encourage cooperation as a means of developing stronger cyber defence capabilities   Creating an effective response in criminal law   Strengthening global stability through international cooperation  The package builds upon existing instruments and presents new initiatives to further improve EU cyber  resilience and response.  The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)69 who came into effect in May 2018 was designed to  harmonize data privacy laws across Europe, to protect and empower all EU citizens with regard to data  privacy. It reshaped how organizations approach data privacy for all the European citizens (independently  of where the company is located) and mandate a number of security approaches, such as:   Privacy by Design and by Default   New transparency requirements: the condition for consent (where required) must be clear and easily  intelligible   More control over personal data for individuals: right to rectification, to be forgotten, to data  portability, to object to automated individual decision making and profiling   Notification of a data breach that is likely to affect the rights and the freedom of individuals  66 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52009DC0149  67 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG  68 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1505294563214&uri=JOIN:2017:450:FIN  69 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:02016R0679-20160504&from=EN  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  33   Serious Penalties for infringement  The new regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications (ePR), which at the time of writing is still in  EU trilogue process, aims at aligning Europe’s ePrivacy regime more closely with the regime set out in the  General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Its focus however is on a high level of privacy for all electronic  communications, regardless of the technology used, thus addressing the IoT and M2M domains explicitly,  and independently whether it contains personal or non-personal data. Moreover, it aims to simplify rules  on cookies and to encourage the developers of web browser to ensure clear and open access to users to  set their browser settings that are also correctly implemented in the web services they navigate to.  R&D activities and funding schemes  As a key priority to foster R&D and innovation across Europe, a structure of research facilities and funding  schemes is in place to provide expertise and management to research and innovation projects, and to  promote synergies between these activities, to benefit both economic growth and the EU citizenship. The  beneficiaries of the funding programmes include SMEs, research centres, universities, large companies, the  types of funds range from supporting start-ups to various clusters.  Horizon 2020- known also as H2020- has been the biggest running EU research and innovation programme  with 75 billion euro of funding available over a seven year period (2014 to 2020). H2020 has been focusing  on supporting EU competitiveness through the delivery of ideas and development of technology to help  achieve smart, sustainable and inclusive economic growth. The goal is to ensure that Europe produces  world-class science and technology, removes barriers to innovation and makes it easier for the public and  private sectors to work together in delivering solutions to big challenges facing our society.  The new program for EU research funding called Horizon Europe has a proposed budget of €97 billion for  2021-2027. The commission has also proposed to allocate €13 billion to the European Defence Fund and  specifically €4.1billion for funding of collaborative defence research to address emerging and future  security threats.  The Commission has also identified a “new programme dedicated to increasing and maximising the  benefits of the digital transformation for all European citizens, public administrations and businesses”70  called Digital Europe. Its aim is to provide a spending instrument that is tailored to the operational  requirements of capacity building in the areas of high-performance computing, artificial intelligence and  cybersecurity. This programme will focus on large-scale digital capacity and infrastructure building, with  the objective of wide uptake and deployment across Europe of critical existing or tested innovative digital  solutions. €2 billion “will be invested into safeguarding the EU's digital economy, society and democracies  through boosting cyber defence and the EU's cybersecurity industry, financing state-of-the-art cybersecurity  equipment and infrastructure as well as supporting the development of the necessary skills and  knowledge”71 in the period 2021-2027.  It is acknowledged that whilst cyber-security is not the sole beneficiary of such funding it should also be  taken into account that any project proposal requiring network connectivity, or which makes use of  network resident resources, should take security and privacy concerns into account. This does not suggest  that every research project is a health and safety (H&S) project, or that every research project is an  ICT/cybersecurity project, but rather, that H&S and ICT/cybersecurity are essential elements of every  70 Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL establishing the Digital Europe  programme for the period 2021-2027 - COM(2018) 434 final  71 http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-4043_en.htm  Analysis of the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity  December 2018  34  project. This insistence at the genesis of a project on addressing H&S and ICT/cybersecurity is an essential  step in moving towards security by default, privacy by design, and safe by design.

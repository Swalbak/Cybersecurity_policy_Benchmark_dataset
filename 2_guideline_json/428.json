This is also valid for new systems that make extensive use of digital technologies and which require a high  level of security. National initiatives have been emerging to set high-level cybersecurity requirements for  ICT components on traditional infrastructure, including certification requirements. Important as they may  be, they may nurture risks such as market fragmentation and challenges to interoperability.  This study seeks to identify and analyse the current landscape of ICT security certification laboratories in  EU Member States, comparing them also with third countries practices. The findings of this study will  constitute the basis for the Agency’s proposal towards an EU wide ICT products and services certification  framework.  Terms and their definitions are discussed in order to enable the identification of certification and/or  evaluation models, and their instances usually called ‘certification (evaluation) schemes’ where respective  entities can play different roles with different relations among them. To recognize equivalents, similarities  and differences among terms in use, the following contexts are discussed: general normative, legal,  specific normative and arranged.  The legal framework in the context of the certification of products can be seen on different levels as  follows:  1. General requirements as set up by Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament,  2. National level requirements from relevant accreditation bodies,  3. Certification or evaluation requirements from various standards,  4. Requirements resulting from international arrangements.  It has been found that in general, laboratories operate under respective national schemes. Although all are  providing services of evaluating the security of ICT products based on an approved and unified  methodology, their legal and business context varies, reflecting characteristics of local economies and  policies of the Certification Body. By researching all licensed laboratories world-wide this report identifies  relevant patterns, similarities and differences. The research will focus on the important implication from  the European Union’s perspective.  Standards used in the evaluation process include mainly ISO/IEC 15408-3 and ISO/IEC TR 18045. The main  use of ISO/IEC 15408 is to assess the security of IT products. There are direct relationships between  ISO/IEC 15408-3 assurance structure and the structure of evaluation process as described in ISO/IEC TR  18045. The ISO/IEC TR 18045 provides a description of evaluation process in terms of: roles and  responsibilities and general evaluation model.  The evaluation according to Common Criteria usually happens in a typical ping-pong run. Evaluations are  organized by examining several assurance classes separately. By the time this report has been prepared  (November 2017) a total of 1864 certificates have been reported under www.commoncriteriaportal.org  (main portal for CC certification) by European laboratories (around 150 per year). It falls into the  responsibility of the certification body to ensure that evaluation labs meet the requirements. This includes  competence requirements for evaluators. In this context, some certification authorities also have  documented criteria that summarize the requirements.  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  06  1. Introduction and scope  Today’s societies and economies are based on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT).  Digitalisation increases cyber security risk across many sectors. There is a need to minimize the risk  inherent in the use of ICT in society and the economy. One of the ways to achieve this is through ICT  product certification. The certification obligations are implied by existing EU legislations; by the market  needs, the industry, and ICT risk owners’ expectations.  Certification plays an important role in raising the level of trust and security in ICT products and services.  This is also valid for new systems that make extensive use of digital technologies and which require a high  level of security. National initiatives have been emerging to set high-level cybersecurity requirements for  ICT components on traditional infrastructure, including certification requirements. Important as they may  be, they may nurture risks such as market fragmentation and challenges to interoperability.  Taking due account of recent legislative and policy developments, such as the adoption of the NIS  directive1, publication of the European Commission (EC) position on the cPPP2, and most importantly, the  draft proposal of the EU Cybersecurity Act3 ENISA continues to support the EC and the Member States in  developing a certification framework for ICT security products and services, which on one hand will boost  competition, and on the other promote mutual recognition of certificates and harmonisation of  certification practices up to defined levels.  This study identifies and analyses the current landscape of ICT security certification laboratories in EU  Member States, comparing them also with third countries’ practices. The findings of this study will  constitute the basis for the Agency’s proposal towards an EU wide ICT products and services certification  framework.  In the following sections, several aspects of the functioning of certification laboratories for ICT products  will be described and analysed:   Terms and definitions   Legal framework   Organisation of laboratories   Standards used in the evaluation process   Practices of laboratories  1 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/network-and-information-security-nis-directive  2 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/commission-staff-working-document-cppp-and-accompanying- measures  3 https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/initiatives/com-2017-477_en  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/network-and-information-security-nis-directive https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/commission-staff-working-document-cppp-and-accompanying-measures https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/commission-staff-working-document-cppp-and-accompanying-measures https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/initiatives/com-2017-477_en  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  07  2. Terms and definitions  Introduction  Discussing terms and their definition enables the identification of certification and/or evaluation models, and their  instances usually called ‘certification (evaluation) schemes’ where respective entities can play different roles with  different relations among them. Furthermore, it helps to recognize equivalents, similarities and differences among  the terms in use depending on various contexts.  To recognize:  A. equivalents – i.e. terms having the same meaning regardless the context,  B. similarities –i.e.  terms relevant for a particular scheme while their meanings can be considered as  narrowing the context, and  C. differences – i.e. terms relevant for a particular context only, or the same terms of different  meanings,  this chapter discusses the following context:  1. general normative – introduced by the ISO harmonized standards specifying broad context for  conformity assessment activities performed by organizations with defined roles and  responsibilities,  2. legal -  as introduced by the Regulation 765/2008 as a conformity assessment framework,  3. specific normative – introduced by international standards i.e. ISO/IEC 15408 series and ISO/IEC  18045 (called hereinafter Common Criteria or CC), with regards to security evaluation and  certification of IT products,  4. arranged –introduced in international arrangements i.e. CCRA and SOGIS-MRA, containing more  detailed requirements, as agreed among the parties of these arrangements.  Set of relevant terms and definitions followed by illustration of relevant models are presented in clauses 2.2 -2.5.  Then, clause 2.6 of this chapter will identify equivalents, similarities and differences between relevant terms.  General normative context  The primary concept of conformity assessment has been established in ISO’s series of international standards, in  particular, EN ISO/IEC 17000:2004, EN ISO/IEC 17065:2012 and EN ISO/IEC 17025:2017 (mentioning of a  publication is a designation of the most recent version of a standard).  The defined approach - which is called hereafter ‘General normative context’ - refers to a concept of conformity  assessment to specific requirements. It is described further by attestation activities which lead to a clear statement  of conformity for a given product or service. Such a result could be achieved by using organizations, rules,  procedures and management.  Terms and respective definitions for this general normative context are presented in the tables below. The first  table shows the general conformity assessment environment (see Table 1).  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  08  TERM DEFINITION  concept:  conformity assessment  demonstration that specified requirements relating to a product, process, system, person or  body are fulfilled  specified requirements  need or expectation that is stated  Note 1 to entry: Specified requirements may be stated in normative documents such as  regulations, standards and technical specifications  organization:  accreditation body authoritative body that performs accreditation  conformity assessment  body  body that performs conformity assessment services  conformity assessment  system  rules, procedures, and management for carrying out conformity assessment  conformity assessment  scheme  conformity assessment system related to specified objects of conformity assessment, to  which the same specified requirements, specific rules and procedures apply  agreement group bodies that are signatories to the agreement on which an arrangement is based  activities:  peer assessment  assessment of a body against specified requirements by representatives of other bodies in, or  candidates for, an agreement group  Table 1: General normative context for conformity assessment based on the ISO 17000  By introducing the concept of ‘attestation’ one can narrow the conformity assessment context to a certification  context by defining more specifically:   organizations i.e. certification bodies (operating certification schemes) and laboratories  (performing some of the conformity assessment activities needed to demonstrate the conformity  with specified requirements by a given product or service), and   activities i.e. certification and evaluation.  In such arrangements results of all conformity assessments are presented in the form of a statement issued by the  respective body showing clearly the scope and relations in a given conformity assessment scheme.  This part of the general normative concept is presented in Table 2.

Further, it is worth to know that the general normative context does not identify which  select and demonstrable function is assigned to a particular conformity assessment body. This has to be defined in  a particular certification (conformity assessment) scheme.  Legal context  The legal context of conformity assessment appears from terms whose definitions are taken from the Regulation  765/2008 (see Table 3). The Regulation introduces strict organization of the market surveillance by using  accreditation mechanisms for conformity assessment bodies. Only one accreditation body per Member State is  allowed.  Conceptually, the legal context does not disturb the general normative one.  TERM DEFINITION  concept:  conformity assessment  process demonstrating whether specified requirements relating to a product, process,  service, system, person or body have been fulfilled  entities:  national accreditation body  sole body in a Member State that performs accreditation with authority  derived from the State  conformity assessment body  body that performs conformity assessment activities including calibration, testing,  certification and inspection  activities:  accreditation  attestation by a national accreditation body that a conformity assessment body meets the  requirements set by harmonized standards and, where applicable, any additional  requirements including those set out in relevant sectoral schemes, to carry out a specific  conformity assessment activity  peer evaluation  process for the assessment of a national accreditation body by other national  accreditation bodies, carried out in accordance with the requirements (EC) No 765/2008,  and, where applicable, additional sectoral technical specifications  Table 3: Terms of definitions establishing the legal context according to Regulation 765/2008  Please refer to chapter 3 for a more detailed overview of the legal context according to Regulation  765/2008.  Specific normative context  A specific normative context is established by adopting terms and their definitions from the Common Criteria  standards4. First, the general normative context is narrowed by introducing specific types of objects to the  conformity assessment performance i.e. TOE (Target of Evaluation), Protection Profile (Protection Profile), and ST  (Security Target). Secondly, ‘conformity assessment’ is expressed as ‘evaluation’. Finally, the standards define a  specific framework under which all activities related to evaluation are performed, and impose specific  requirements on organizations involved with regard to their activities.  4 Currently, the whole series of ISO/IEC 15408 and ISO/IEC 18045 are subject to revision process. All terms and  definitions are from official published editions dated to 2009  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  11  A systematic approach to relevant terms and definitions is presented in Table 4.

This term has more rigorous  connotations. The term “verify” is used in the context of evaluator  actions where an independent effort is required of the evaluator.  ISO/IEC 15408-1  Table 4: Specific normative concept of conformity assessment based on the Common Criteria approach  It should be noted that activities related to evaluation are expressed in different terms and meanings than  selecting and demonstrating functions to be performed with regard to conformity assessment, as described in ISO  17000.  Arranged context  This context for conformity assessment of IT products security is given by international arrangements such as the  Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement (CCRA)6 – world-wide, gathering organizations from several countries,  and Senior Officer Group Information Security Mutual Recognition Arrangement (SOGIS MRA)7 – gathering  organizations from the EU plus Norway. As these two arrangements both implement the same certification and  evaluation framework based on the Common Criteria, the context will be described further using the SOGIS MRA  documents, as relevant to European Certification Framework.  The arranged context is presented in the following table:  TERMS DEFINITION  concept:  evaluation:  assessment of an IT product or a protection profile against the IT security evaluation  criteria and IT security evaluation methods to determine whether or not the claims  made are justified  certification: process carried out by a CB leading to the issuing of a certificate  organization:  participant A signatory to this Agreement.  accreditation body  independent organization responsible for assessing the performance of other  organizations against a recognized standard, and for formally confirming the status of  those that meet the requirements of the standard  6 https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/ccra/  7 https://www.sogis.org/  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  13  certification body (CB)  organization responsible for carrying out certification and for overseeing the day-to-day  operation of an evaluation and certification scheme  evaluation facility  organization which carries out evaluations, independently of the developers of the IT  products or protection profiles evaluated  IT Security Evaluation Facility  (ITSEF)  accredited Evaluation Facility, licensed  or approved to perform evaluations within the  context of a particular IT Security Evaluation and Certification Scheme  evaluation and certification  scheme  systematic organization of the functions of evaluation and certification under the  authority CB in order to ensure that high standards of competence and impartiality are  maintained and consistency is achieved  relationships imposed by the arrangement:  accredited  formally confirmed by an accreditation body as meeting a predetermined standard of  impartiality and general technical, methodological and procedural competence  licensed  assessed by a  CB as technically competent in the specific IT technical domain and field  of security evaluation and formally authorized to carry out evaluations  within the  context of a particular within the context of a particular evaluation and certification  scheme  conformant certificate  public document issued by a compliant CB and authorized by a Participant which  confirms that a specific IT product or protection profile has successfully completed  evaluation by an ITSEF  monitoring of evaluation  procedure by which representatives of a CB observe evaluations in progress or review  completed evaluations in order to satisfy themselves that an ITSEF is carrying out its  functions in a proper and professional manner.  voluntarily periodic assessment  assessment of compliant CBs  (term not defined although described in the  arrangement)  Table 5: Concept of evaluation and certification based on provisions of the SOGIS MRA  Comparison of terms use in different contexts  2.6.1 Equivalents  Part of fundamental terms or group of terms represent the same concept and share the same meaning regardless  of the context they function in.

Legal framework and regulations for evaluation laboratories  The legal framework in the context of the certification of products can be seen on different levels as  follows:  1. General requirements as set up by the Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament,  2. National level requirements from relevant accreditation bodies,  3. Certification or evaluation requirements from various standards,  4. Requirements resulting from international arrangements.  More details on these levels will be described in the following subchapters. The complete overview is  summarized in the following figures:  National  Accreditation  Body  National  Accreditation  Body  European co-  operation for  Accreditation (EA)  European  level  National  level  Conformity  Assessment Body/  Certification Body  Multilateral  arrangement  level  Conformity  Assessment Body/  ITSEF (laboratory)  Accreditation  EC  Regulation  765/2008  EN ISO/IEC  17065/EN  ISO/IEC  17025  SOGIS  MRA/  CCRA  *in some schemes licensing can be done in parallel with accreditation or as a part of accreditation  Figure 1: Overview of requirements  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  16  SOGIS MRA  Conformity  Assessment Body/  Certification Body  Conformity  Assessment Body/  ITSEF (laboratory)  EN ISO/IEC  17065  ISO/IEC  15408  EN ISO/IEC  17025  ISO/IEC  18045  CC CEM  JIL  Docs  International  standards  Other normative docs  CCRA  CC CEM  CCDB  Docs  European  harmonized  standards  Figure 2: Sources of requirements for laboratories and Certification Bodies  Regulation No 765/2008  With Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 the EU set requirements related to the accreditation of bodies who  perform conformity assessments for products. This regulation applies to European national accreditation  bodies that in turn perform the accreditation of the evaluation laboratories.  It is an essential part of this regulation that each Member State of the European Union shall appoint a  single national accreditation body. (Article 4, 1).  This national accreditation body shall, when requested by a conformity assessment body, determine  whether that conformity assessment body is competent to carry out a specific conformity assessment  activity. Where it is found to be competent, the national accreditation body shall issue an accreditation  attestation to that effect. This way, a harmonized European structure for the accreditation of laboratories  is built.  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  17  On the European level, one body has been recognized as the European Body for Accreditation. This body is  the European co-operation for Accreditation or EA. EA is an association of national accreditation bodies in  Europe that are officially recognised by their national governments to assess and verify—against  international standards—organisations that carry out conformity assessment services such as certification,  verification, inspection, testing and calibration.  For the use in this report, EA has the following roles:   EA cooperates with the European Commission in questions of accreditation,   EA shall allow national accreditation bodies within the Members States to become a member of  EA, provided that they comply with the rules of EA,   EA shall provide its members with peer evaluation services.  In the context of this report, the peer evaluation services of this body are of specific importance.  ‘peer evaluation’ refers to a process for the assessment of a national accreditation body by other national  accreditation bodies, carried out in accordance with the requirements (EC) No 765/2008, and, where  applicable, additional sectoral technical specifications;  Each member of EA (i.e. each European Accreditation body) agrees to take part in the process of peer  evaluation, both actively and passively in order to ensure that all members of EA follow the corresponding  regulations.  By the use of the peer evaluation procedures, a consistent quality should be guaranteed  throughout the complete system.  National level  When the scope of our view changes to the national level, [ISO17025] and [ISO17065] are the most  relevant standards after which each of the national accreditation bodies will perform the accreditation of  the conformity assessment bodies. Further, from the laboratories perspective, [17027] is of the utmost  interest.  [ISO17025] defines general requirements on competency that will have to be met by the laboratory  providing testing (including evaluation), or calibration services. It specifically poses requirements on:   General Management Requirements  o Control of Documents  o Subcontracting, purchasing and service to the customer (including complaints)  o Control of nonconformity testing and/or calibration work  o Improvements, Corrective Actions, internal audits and reviews   Technical Requirements  o General requirements  o Accommodation and environmental conditions  o Test and calibration methods  o Equipment  o Measurement traceability  o Handling of test and calibration items  o Assuring the quality of test and calibration results  o Requirements on reporting the results  A new edition of [ISO17025] is being elaborated at the time of writing of this report. Among new features,  it will offer a process oriented approach, which constitutes new value and significant changes in  accreditation schemes.  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  18  Even though it is not a strict requirement, evaluation laboratories in the area of IT-security often also  maintain a quality management system in accordance with [ISO9000] and an information security  management system in accordance with [ISO27000].  [ISO17065] defines the requirements that will have to be met by the certification authority. It specifically  poses requirements on:   General Requirements  o Legal requirements  o Impartiality  o Liability and financing  o Non-discriminatory conditions  o Confidentiality  o Publicly available information   Structural Requirements  o Organization Structure  o Mechanisms for safeguarding impartiality   Resource Requirements  o Personnel  o Ressources for evaluation   Process Requirements  o Applications and Application Review  o Evaluation and Review  o Certification decision and documentation  o Directory of certified products  o Surveillance  o Changes affecting certification  o Termination, reduction, suspension or withdrawal of certification  o Records  o Complaints   Management System Requirements  o Options  o General management system documentation  o Control of documents and records  o Management review  o Internal audits  o Corrective actions  o Preventive actions  Standard Level  Below the level of [ISO17025] and a potentially implemented management system, the view will change to  the standards according to which a conformity assessment body (i.e. the actual evaluation laboratory)  performs its assessments.  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  19  Prominent examples include the Common Criteria (aka ISO/IEC 15408 ([ISO15408] and ISO/IEC 18045  [18045]9) and [ISO19790]10  Beside their technical criteria for conformity assessment, these standards bring further organizational  requirements.  As an example, this can be analyzed for the Common Criteria (CC):  Requirements from international arrangements  The CC distinguishes between the processes of evaluation and certification. The evaluation is the process  that can be seen as the assessment of a product (the so-called Target of Evaluation) against defined  requirements.  The certification process oversees the evaluation and ends with the actual certificate. CC requires that the  certification process is performed by a party independent from the evaluation laboratory.  3.4.1 General considerations  The international recognition of certifications that are performed according to Common Criteria is one of  the major advantages and benefits of using Common Criteria as reference standards. However, from the  perspective of an evaluation laboratory, this advantage also goes along with an additional set of  requirements that have to be met. The following two subchapters introduce the major areas from which  these requirements arise, namely the CCRA and the SOG-IS agreement.  3.4.2 CCRA  The arrangement on the Recognition of Common Criteria Certificates in the Field of IT Security ([CCRA]) is  the first agreement on the international recognition of certificates issued on conformity assessment  against Common Criteria.  The purpose of this Arrangement is to ensure that evaluations are performed based on consistent  standards and with a high level of assurance, to improve the availability of evaluated products and  Protection Profiles, to eliminate the burden of redundant evaluations and to continuously improve the  efficiency and cost-effectiveness of evaluations.  The primary goal of the arrangement is to ensure that IT products and protection profiles which earn a  Common Criteria certificate can be procured or used without the need for further evaluations.  A Management Committee, composed of senior representatives from each signatory’s country of the  CCRA, has been established to implement the Arrangement and to provide guidance to the respective  national schemes conducting evaluation and validation activities.  9 Basically, Common Criteria consist of: 1) 3-part standard containing: concepts and models (ISO/IEC 15408- 1),  security functional requirements (ISO/IEC 15408 2), security assurance requirements (ISO/IEC 15408-3) and 1-part  standard containing evaluation methodology description (ISO/IEC 18045 “Common Methodology for Information  Technology Security Evaluation” (CEM)). Further details are provided in Chapter 5.  10 ISO/IEC 19790 deals with Security requirements for cryptographic modules. It is the ISO pendant of the FIPS 140-2  requirements.  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  20  The requirements of the Common Criteria are mainly developed by an international consortium known as  Common Criteria Development Board (CCDB) and Common Criteria Maintenance Board (CCMB). Usually,  members of these consortia have a governmental background.  CCDB manages the technical work program for the maintenance and ongoing development of the CC and  CEM and reach agreement on the application of the CC and CEM to evaluations being carried out by the  CCRA certificate producing nations to ensure harmonization across qualifying nations. The principal  purpose of CCMB is to process requests for inclusion of Change Proposals (CP), based upon national CC and  CEM development requirements and taking into account CCRA requirements as specified by the CCDB.  For an evaluation laboratory, the work of the CCDB goes along with a set of requirements for the daily  work. Beside the criteria that are laid down in CC and a set of supporting documents that are developed  and maintained by the CCDB, the certification body of each member of the CCRA is responsible for  oversight of the compliance of the evaluation laboratory with the criteria.  3.4.3 SOG-IS  Beside the arrangement laid down in the CCRA, an additional recognition agreement exists on the  European Level.  The SOG-IS (Senior Officers Group) agreement was produced in response to the EU Council Decision of  March 31st 1992 (92/242/EEC) in the field of security of information systems, and the subsequent Council  recommendation of April 7th (1995/144/EC) on common information technology security evaluation  criteria.  The participants of the SOG-IS agreement have a slightly different perspective than the participants of the  CCRA. SOG-IS mainly focusses on coordinating evaluation activities around Common Criteria among  European Certification Bodies (also to gain a strong standing within CCRA) and to coordinate the  development of Protection Profiles. It should be noted that the SOGIS MRA scope of interest is limited to  two technical domains of IT products i.e. “Hardware devices with security boxes CC” and “Smartcards and  similar devices CC”.  However, the SOG-IS agreement also comprises a recognition of Common Criteria certificates among the  participants of the agreement. In contrast to the CCRA, two things are important to mention about the  recognition that are regulated under this agreement:  1) The recognition of certificates covers all evaluation assurance levels up to EAL7 (compared to only  EAL2 typically under the CCRA)  2) The recognition above EAL 4 is only covered for defined technical areas when schemes have been  approved by the management committee for this level.  Similar to CCRA, the arrangement provides for member nations to participate as certificate consuming  participants or as certificate producers.  The original arrangement signed in 1997 (updated to incorporate the use of Common Criteria in 1999) was  updated in 2010 for two reasons; firstly, to provide a robust mechanism allowing new schemes to take part  as certificate producers and, secondly, to limit the higher levels of recognition to agreed technical domains  where adequate agreement around evaluation methodology, laboratory requirements, attack methods  etc. are in place.  In order to achieve the higher level of recognition under the SOG-IS agreement, it has been necessary to  develop and publish a set of supporting documents that have been developed by different working groups  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  21  in the context of the SOG-IS agreement. These documents build up the Joint Interpretation Library (aka JIL  documents) and comprise mandatory documents that have to be followed during each evaluation of a  product that falls into a technical domain covered by the SOG-IS agreement and guidance documents that  are optional regarding their use. More details will be given in Chapter 5.  The certification bodies which are part of the arrangement ensure that all evaluation bodies will follow  those criteria in addition to the criteria that has been published by the CCMD/CCDB under the CCRA.  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  22  4. Organisation of laboratories  Legal forms of laboratories  4.1.1 Introduction  In general, laboratories operate under respective national schemes (see 4.2). Although all are providing  services of evaluating the security of ICT products based on an approved and unified methodology, their  legal and business context varies, reflecting characteristics of local economies and policies of the  Certification Body. By researching all licensed laboratories world-wide this report will try to identify  relevant patterns, similarities and differences. The research will focus on the important implication from  the European Union’s perspective. Respective European schemes are indicated in pink in every table.  4.1.2 Research methodology  Presented information has been gathered by means of Internet based research.  For all licensed laboratories the type of legal entity has been determined, using the respective country’s  business register. The following types have been identified:   Private company – independent legal entity, usually similar in form to a limited liability  corporation,   Traded private company – independent legal entity, traded on a local stock exchange,   Research institute – non-profit entities, set up by industry members or universities, and   Government agency – laboratories which are part of the country’s government.  By investigating companies’ websites the importance of the Common Criteria evaluations (and ICT  certification more broadly) for their business model has been qualified, estimating them on a range from  core to minimal, with labels “IT Security oriented” and “certification oriented” signaling states in between.  The assessment is subjective.  4.1.3 Presentation of results  4.1.3.1 Laboratories in numbers  All laboratories listed as being currently in operation within the CCRA framework11 were the subject of  analysis. It should be emphasized that laboratories operating in the context of the SOGIS Mutual  Recognition Arrangement12 are a subset of the analyzed set of laboratories.  Major findings with regard to licensed laboratories are presented below.  This report analyzes 67 laboratories licensed under 16 operating schemes. As some laboratories are  providing evaluation services under more than one national scheme (see below) a total of 60 separate  entities has been counted in total.  The number of licensed laboratories operating under respective scheme range from 1 (India) to 9 (USA).  11 https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/labs/  12 https://www.sogis.org/uk/status_participant_en.html  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  23  less than 3 6 Australia, India, Malaysia, the  Netherlands, Sweden, UK  3-5 5 Canada, Japan, Norway, Spain, Turkey  6 and more 5 France, Germany, Italy, Korea, US  Table 9: Number of licensed laboratories under different schemes  37 laboratories fall under the category of ‘(traded) private company’ which is more than 50% of all licensed  laboratories. In the context of this study they are called ‘legally independent’. Legally independent  laboratories constitute a majority of licensed laboratories in Norway (100%), Germany (87%) and France  (60%).  The second group of security evaluation providers consists of laboratories operating as parts of  multinational companies with a wide portfolio of ICT products and services. They constitute a majority of  licensed labs in Australia (100%), UK (100%) and Canada (75%).  The third group includes research institutes (both industry funded and affiliated with universities) and  government agencies. There are several cases that highlight their importance. A governmental agency is  the only licensed laboratory under the Indian scheme. Research institutes constitute a significant  proportion of licensed labs in Japan and Korea.  All discussed figures are presented in Table 10.

Considering the following  classification:  o Core: Common Criteria evaluations is the core business of the entity; additionally, the  security certification (as in both cases of importance) focus also falls under 'Core' label;  o IT security oriented: the entity focuses on ICT security services, however, Common Criteria  evaluations play important role in their portfolio;  o Certification oriented: the entity provides wide range of evaluation and certification  services in many fields;  o Minimal: CC evaluations are only a small part of a wide portfolio of products and services,  including providing integrated IT or IT security solutions.  We have quantified laboratories per business type, with regards to all analyzed schemes (see Table 12).

It appears majority of licensed laboratories operating under the SOGIS scheme are independent private  companies focused on evaluation services themselves, and this figure is significantly higher than for  laboratories under the CCRA.  This finding is summarized in Figure  and Figure 4, respectively.  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  26  Figure 3: Licensed laboratories operating under CCRA scheme  Figure 4: Licensed laboratories operating under SOGIS MRA scheme  Considering the importance of the Common Criteria evaluation from the business perspective one can  compare European and non-European schemes. For this purpose, 52 individual business entities ie.  local  branches counted as singular, multinationals - as one instance have been identified. The results are  presented in Figure 5 and Figure 6, respectively.  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  27  Figure 5: Importance of CC evaluation for the companies' business model under the CCRA  Figure 6: Importance of CC evaluation for the companies' business model under the SOGIS MRA  Worldwide, for 46% of the studied laboratories certification under CC is deemed as core business. A much  smaller proportion (13%) of the laboratories focuses on IT security, of which certification is only a part. The  smallest group (6%) consists of laboratories that provide certification services in many fields. The rest of  the laboratories (35%) are parts of large companies, often multinational, for which CC certification is of  minimal importance. Results of classification limited to the SOGIS MRA follow similar patterns, with the  exception of the relative greater importance of IT security oriented business model.  Licensing and supervising  4.2.1 Introduction  For the purpose of analysing relevant characteristics, the scheme processes have been divided into two  phases: licensing and then supervising.  The research has been conducted with respect to all 16  Core 46%  IT security  oriented  13%  Certification  oriented  6%  Minimal 35%  Core 36%  IT security  oriented  21%  Certification  oriented  7%  Minimal 36%  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  28  certification schemes although finding a complete set of information for all these schemes has not been  possible in the given timeframe.  4.2.2 Licensing  4.2.2.1 Application procedure  A licencing mechanism has been identified in all analysed schemes. The most distinguished features are:   one- or two-step procedure: the proceeding for granting a license can be divided into two phases.  In some schemes it is allowed to obtain a provisional appointment after passing technical  examination of the laboratory readiness, and then a permanent license after successfully  completing the test evaluation,   technical examination of the applicant capability is sufficient, or additionally, performing a test  evaluation is necessary for the applicant to get a license,   getting an accreditation as a prerequisite: being accredited against ISO/IEC 17025 is mandatory in  all analysed schemes, however, in some schemes currently it is allowed to start the assessment by  a Certification Body without fulfilling the accreditation requirement by the applicant.  It should be noted that European schemes are licensing the laboratories under CCRA and - in parallel -  under SOGIS MRA. The characteristics of the application procedure are summarized below.  APPLICATION PROCEDURE  No. Country Fulfilling technical requirements  Test evaluation performed by  the applicant  Accreditation against  ISO/IEC 17025 as a  prerequisite  1 UK Provisional Appointment  Permanent Appointment no  2  Australia & New  Zealand  license granted after assessment  and upon a licensing agreement  not applicable no  3 Sweden  part of the assessment  procedure  license granted no  4 Canada  part of the assessment  procedure  license granted yes  5 Germany  part of the assessment  procedure  license granted yes  6 The Netherlands  part of the assessment  procedure  both, accreditation and  licensing based on successful  trial evaluation  no  7 USA  license granted after assessment  and upon a licensing agreement  not applicable yes  8 Malaysia license granted after assessment not applicable no  9 Japan  part of the assessment  procedure  license granted yes  Table 13: Application procedure differences among schemes  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  29  4.2.2.2 Licensing fees  There is a variety of licensing fee models among schemes. Some do not apply any fee, some others have  only an introductory fee (for the Application), and then for renewal of the license, and some implement  subscriptions. It should be noted that fees can be applicable to accreditation, but this is out of the schemes  control hence not discussed here.  All findings concerning the fee models for licensing are summarized in Table 14.  COUNTRY LICENSE FEES  Introductory fee Subscription or membership  1 UK no  (see next column)  yes (applicable to Provision Applicants as  well)  2  Australia & New  Zealand  no no  3 Sweden  1) Application  2) License  yes (annual)  5 Germany Dependent on the inspection field renewal - every 2 years  7 USA no no  8 Malaysia Application  Annual subscription for 3 consecutive years)  Renewal - every 3 years  9 Japan  1) Application  2) Evaluator Qualification  not identified  Table 14: Licence fee models for laboratories  4.2.2.3 Independency of evaluation  Preserving independency of evaluation is fundamental for the third-party evaluation. Schemes impose on  licensed laboratories various requirements to ensure actual independency of evaluations. The great  majority of commercial laboratories provides consultancy services, which pose a significant source of  potential conflict of interests. Every scheme addresses the issue, some provide a time period, in which  consultancy work prohibits an individual from working as an evaluator, some others set up general rules  only for avoiding conflicts of interest. We have found the strongest rule in the Japanese scheme where  providing consultancy services in parallel to the evaluation with regards to a given evaluated product is  clearly forbidden.  A summary of requirements concerning independency is given in Table 15.  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  30  COUNTRY RULES FOR THE EVALUATION INDEPENDENCE  1 UK   autonomous in operational and administrative;   evaluation independent of TOE development;   no evaluation of the work of any group or division within the parent company (the rule may  be relaxed at the discretion of the CB);   consultancy can be provided unless it does not impair the independence of the evaluation  i.e. an individual cannot evaluate his or her own work.  2  Australia & New  Zealand   functional separation from the lab's parent organization must be maintained;   evaluating a product of parent company or within the group is not allowed;   evaluation support consultancy and evaluation services are permitted, however the  laboratory must be able to demonstrate the separation of these activities from evaluation  activities.  3 Sweden   establishing and implementing documented procedures for identifying conflicts of interest  and for ensuring that such conflicts do not adversely influence the quality of the  evaluations is required;   pre-evaluation consulting may be provided by the laboratory providing proper separation  of evaluation and consultancy work;   personal involvement of the laboratory personnel with the supplier of a product under  evaluation within the preceding two years, either in design of the product or consultancy  services to the supplier regarding methods of dealing with matters that are barriers to the  product being certified, is prohibited.  4 Canada   sufficient separation of control with the parent company shall be demonstrated;  procedures to ensure no conflict of interest between personnel advising and evaluating  shall be established and implemented.  5 Germany   conflict of interests with regards to the outcome of an evaluation for the laboratory , its  parent corporation and individual staff members shall be identified and removed;   labs have to identify potential conflicts of interest in the beginning of an evaluation and  report to the certification authority;   any person active in the evaluation process cannot have been involved in the TOE  development.  6 The Netherlands   an individual cannot be hired by the Sponsor for consultancy within 2 years of termination  of their employment at the laboratory performing the evaluation.  7 USA   conflict of interest with regards to the outcome of an evaluation for the laboratory , its  parent corporation and individual staff members shall be identified and removed ;   consulting and evaluation activities shall be separated within the laboratory (ie. different  people shall be assigned to the two).  8 Malaysia   any person active in the evaluation process cannot have been involved in the TOE  development, consultancy to the Sponsor within the last 2 years.  9 Japan   laboratories are prohibited from providing consulting services in parallel to evaluation one  with regards to a given evaluation;   in case of divisions of larger companies labs have to be operational independent, and  operating on own budget.  Table 15: Independency requirements  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  31  4.2.3 Supervision  4.2.3.1 Supervising the evaluations  In general, certification bodies are obliged to oversee the evaluation process as they are held responsible  for issued certificates. General provisions on the supervision activities can be found in relevant  documentation of every scheme. However, schemes differ significantly if it comes to details. In some  schemes dedicated certifiers actively participate in the evaluation, in others a lead certifier even validates  every part of the evaluation process, while in some others the nominated certifier plays a passive role, and  only approves the final Evaluation Technical Report. Various approaches depending on the perceived  complexity of evaluation can be applied as well (for example, see the Spanish scheme characteristics).  The summary of findings is presented in Table 16.  COUNTRY CB'S ROLE IN THE EVALUATION PROCESS  1 UK   determining whether a TOE will be certifiable in principle;   monitoring all evaluations conducted under the Scheme;   assessing all evaluations’ results and issuing certificates;   (optionally) conducting Evaluation Progress Reviews.  2  Australia & New  Zealand   accepting evaluation tasks and plans to conduct evaluation;   allocating  two certifiers allocated to an evaluation task (certifiers conduct oversight  through meetings, discussing technical details, reviewing reports, maintaining certification  records, monthly reports on progress);   reviewing draft Evaluation Technical Report.  3 Sweden   deciding whether to undertake or decline the Certification;   evaluating partially the result by single evaluation reports (SER), each submitted to the  certifier for acceptance, and full evaluation report acceptance;   creating technical oversight reports;   possible direct supervising the Developer Sites or evaluator's independent testing by  evaluator.  4 Canada   determining whether the Target of Evaluation is suitable for evaluation;   providing technical oversight (allocated personnel, i.e. independently performing a subset  of evaluation activities and comparing the results, directly observing activities in progress,  reviewing reports);   accepting Evaluation Technical Report (ETR).  5 Germany   determining whether a TOE will be certifiable in principle;   oversighting the process;   monitoring certain activities of the evaluation facility, such as the execution of  tests/penetration tests or the execution of site audits at the developer in each case on site,   partial reports are only \"reviewed and commented on\" only final ETR is subject to approval.  6 The Netherlands   accepting applications for certificates;   supervising every evaluation (by appointing Certifier who accepts reports and creates  Certification Report);   executing the evaluator obligations to submit monthly status reports.  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  32  7 USA   implementing active involvement in the evaluation process:   government evaluators may be assigned as members of a laboratory evaluation team;   each evaluation gets a Validator, as a liaison between certification body and a laboratory  (they decide what is the scope of their involvement), mostly for technical oversight;  observation reports;   Technical Rapid Response Team is assigned for each technology type and is expected to  provide timely response to questions;   Evaluation Consistency Review is to ensure the LT technical consistency, in conjunction  with TRRT addresses issues across multiple evaluations  8 Malaysia   accepting the evaluation;   supervising (at least 2 certifiers assigned) the evaluations by:   technical review of evaluators' work at predefined key points in the evaluation;  monthly progress reports;   review and approve test plans;   prepare certification report.  9 Japan   accepting the evaluation;   agreeing on evaluation work plan.  10 Norway   implementing oversight activities: as part of inspections may be in place, certifiers may be  present during testing;   approving the ETR.  11 Spain   introducing 3 levels of monitoring of an evaluation:   basic level (low complexity, not long, only ETR required),   medium level (default: partial reports corresponding to the evaluation activities, which  in turn correspond with the evaluation of the security assurance requirement classes in  the standard),   monitoring level (exceptionally to evaluations having a larger than normal number of  nonconformities, special technological challenges - at discretion of the CB).  12 France   oversighting the process;   approving the ETR.  Table 16: Supervising the evaluation in relevant schemes  4.2.3.2 Auditing or monitoring  Schemes vary in their understanding of auditing or monitoring with respect to licensed laboratories. Such activities  are part of continuous supervision of the laboratories. However, the approach, depth and frequency of such  activities show different ways of achieving the objective. Some schemes include a procedure for monitoring the  laboratory operations upon defining trigger criteria, others rely on periodic technical assessments, and some  others on analysing periodic reports submitted by the laboratory.  The findings are presented in Table 17.  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  33  COUNTRY AUDIT OR MONITORING PROCEDURE  1 UK   monitoring the performance of a laboratory can be activated at any  point during the  laboratory membership of the scheme;   as a minimum: annual audit to co-incide with a laboratory annual contract extension (in  case, an existing laboratory wishes to extend their scope of operation).  2  Australia & New  Zealand   obligatory reporting to the CB of future evaluation tasks, changes to staff every 3 months.  3 Sweden   yearly assessment resulting in automatically renewal of the license;  surveillance of the  laboratory operation by continuous certification oversight.  4 Canada   Observation Reports generated in response to issues that require corrective action by the  laboratory;   assessment of personal changes.  5 Germany  annual audits  6 The Netherlands   submitting a list of the qualified evaluators with proofs of competence on annual base is  required;   annual formal technical assessment of the laboratory.  7 USA  new audit process \"Check-In/Check-Out\" is currently being implemented*  8 Malaysia   submitting an annual business report  with  key performance measures: time to complete;  effort spent; vulnerabilities discovered; consumer satisfaction etc;   reviewing of the laboratory operations at the discretion of CB.  9 Japan   periodic assessments by the CB (not if lab is periodically assessed by the Japanese  Accreditation Body).  10 France   licensing audit performed every 2 years;   checking e if the laboratory meets the licensing criteria - at any time.  *CB conducts periodic meetings in which those involved in the evaluation process will track progress and discuss issued within a  specific evaluation  Table 17: Auditing or monitoring the licensed laboratories  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  34  5. Standards used in the evaluation process  Assurance paradigm in ISO/IEC 15408-3  The main use of ISO/IEC 15408 is to assess the security of IT products. However, every IT product may be  used in many ways, and in many types of environment, so the notion of security can vary with context.  That means that the result of an ISO/IEC 15408 evaluation is never “this IT product is secure”, but is always  “this IT product meets this security specification”. In other words, security evaluation is a process of  determining and then proving - with sufficient level of assurance – that the IT product is conformant (or  not) to defined criteria.  As ISO/IEC 15408-3 states, assurance is gained by active investigation performed by an evaluator. This  includes the use of various techniques like:   analysis and checking of process(es) and procedure(s);   checking that process(es) and procedure(s) are being applied;   analysis of the correspondence between TOE design representations;   analysis of the TOE design representation against the requirements;   verification of proofs;   analysis of guidance documents;   analysis of functional tests developed and the results provided;   independent functional testing;   analysis for vulnerabilities (including flaw hypothesis);   penetration testing (i.e. finding and exploring vulnerabilities).  The ISO/IEC 15408 philosophy asserts that greater assurance results from the application of greater  evaluation effort. This increasing level of effort is based upon:  1. scope -- that is, the effort is greater because a larger portion of the IT product is included;  2. depth -- that is, the effort is greater because it is deployed to a finer level of design and  implementation detail;  3. rigour -- that is, the effort is greater because it is applied in a more structured, formal manner.  To structure all assurance requirements of every IT product subject to evaluation is described in formal  language of assurance classes, families and components.  It is beyond the scope of this paper to describe all assurance elements presented in ISO/IEC 15408-3 in  detail, but one should notice the least grained element i.e. assurance component - relevant to the IT  product - includes all information needed to perform an evaluation in the scope of such element:  a) Dependencies with other assurance components, either from the same family/class, or different  one;  b) Developer action elements:  i.e. set of actions is further qualified by evidential material referenced  in the following set of elements.  c) Content and presentation of evidence elements: i.e. the evidence required, what the evidence  shall demonstrate, and what information the evidence shall convey.  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  35  d) Evaluator action elements: i.e. a set of actions that explicitly includes confirmation that the  requirements prescribed in the content and presentation of evidence elements have been met. It  also includes explicit actions and analysis that shall be performed in addition to that already  performed by the developer. Implicit evaluator actions are also to be performed as a result of  developer action elements which are not covered by content and presentation of evidence  requirements.  An example of the assurance component and related actions on the evidence submitted is presented  in Table 18.  Table 18: AVA_VAN.1 assurance component presentation  The overall assurance of a given evaluation is expressed then by including building blocks in the form of the  relevant assurance components reflecting the scope, depth and rigour of the evaluation effort, as  described above. To make comparison among evaluated products easier ISO/IEC 15408-3 comes with  predefined assurance packages called ‘evaluation assurance level n’ (EALn),  n=1,....,7. The rule for the  EALn+1 is that it includes all assurance components of the EALn plus set of components representing  broader scope,  deeper or more rigorous approach to the evaluation than relevant components of the  EALn.  Evaluation process according to ISO/IEC TR 18045  There are direct relationships between ISO/IEC 15408-3 assurance structure (i.e. class, family, component  and element) and the structure of evaluation process as described in ISO/IEC TR 18045 (see Figure 7).  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  36  Figure 7: Structural relationships in the evaluation process (source: ISO/IEC 18045)  The ISO/IEC TR 18045 provides a description of evaluation process in terms of:  a) roles and responsibilities of the parties involved, and  b) a general evaluation model, as a direct consequence of relationships presented above.  The general model defines the following roles: sponsor, developer, evaluator and evaluation  Four distinct roles i.e. sponsor, developer, evaluator and evaluation authority13 are involved in the  evaluation process.  The sponsor is responsible for requesting and supporting an evaluation. This means that the sponsor  establishes the different agreements for the evaluation (e.g. commissioning the evaluation). The sponsor  ensures that the evaluator is provided with the evaluation evidence.  The developer produces the TOE and is responsible for providing the evidence required for the evaluation  (e.g. training, design information), on behalf of the sponsor. One should observe that these two roles are  not necessarily distinguishing each other in every evaluation. In simple instances (e.g. EAL1 evaluations) it  could be one person.  The evaluator performs the evaluation tasks required in the context of an evaluation: the evaluator  receives the evaluation evidence from the developer on behalf of the sponsor or directly from the sponsor,  13 ‘Evaluation authority’ can be called ‘certification body in specific contexts, see Chapter 2 for further details.  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  37  performs the evaluation sub-activities and provides the results of the evaluation assessment to the  evaluation authority.  The evaluation authority establishes and maintains the scheme, monitors the evaluation conducted by the  evaluator, and issues certification/validation reports as well as certificates based on the evaluation results  provided by the evaluator.  Each evaluation, whether of a PP (Protection Profile) or TOE (Target of Evaluation) with its ST (Security  Target), follows the same general model, and has four evaluator tasks in common: the input task, the  output task, the evaluation sub-activities, and the demonstration of the technical competence to the  evaluation authority task.  The input task and the output tasks are related to management of evaluation evidence and to report  generation, respectively.  Every evaluation sub-activity is performed with respect to an ISO/IEC 15408-3-mapped evaluator action  element (explicit or implied) and ends with the evaluator verdict as a result of the corresponding  evaluation. An initial state of the verdict is ‘inconclusive’, and can be changed into ‘pass’ or fail’ after the  sub-activity is completed. If all conditions for completing the evaluator action element are not fulfilled, the  verdict remains as ‘inconclusive’. An overall verdict is ‘pass’ if only if all partial verdicts are ‘pass’ as well.  The demonstration of the technical competence to the evaluation authority task may be fulfilled by the  evaluation authority analysis of the output tasks results, or may include the demonstration by the  evaluators of their understanding of the inputs for the evaluation sub-activities. This task ends with the  evaluator authority verdict.  This description of evaluation process is summarized in the action flow and presented using BPMN 2.0  notation (see  Figure 8 below).  Figure 8: The evaluation process according to ISO/IEC TR 18045  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  38  Requirements for laboratories operating in international schemes  5.3.1 CCRA  An Arrangement on the Recognition of Common Criteria Certificates In the field of Information Technology  Security (CCRA)14 imposes several requirements on the laboratories (called here ‘Evaluation Facilities’). In  general, laboratories shall be:   either accredited by relevant accreditation body in accordance with ISO/IEC 17025, or   established under the laws, statutory instruments, or other official administrative procedures valid  in the country concerned.  In both cases, common requirements apply, as specified in one of the Annexes15 of CCRA. In particular, the  laboratory shall be licensed or otherwise approved by the Certification Body. Furthermore, the Evaluation  Facility also has to demonstrate that it is technically competent in the specific field of IT security evaluation  and that it is compliant with the rules of the scheme concerned.  Finally, the CCRA states each scheme can establish its own requirements in relation to security, personnel  training and operating procedures. Differences among schemes with regard to requirements for  laboratories are discussed in Chapter 4.  Apart from the arrangement itself, CCDB16 publishes supportive documents, mandatory for use by the  laboratories, which include requirements for the evaluator’s activities in specific areas of evaluation such  as Stateful Traffic Filter Firewalls or Integrated Circuits. Full list of supportive documents (SDs) is presented  in the CCRA official web site17.  5.3.2 SOGIS-MRA  This arrangement provides the same general requirements for laboratories as the CCRA. However, due to  narrower scope of operation than CCRA, and higher requirements with regard to assurance, there are  additional obligations imposed on laboratories.  These obligations are described in two documents:   Minimum ITSEF Requirements for Security Evaluations of Smart cards and similar devices18,   Minimum ITSEF Requirements for Security Evaluations of Hardware Devices with Security Boxes19.  The first document contains several requirements concerning:  o basic and detailed knowledge and experience of evaluators in several areas related to Integrated  circuit (IC) technology, including: the IC design and production processes, security of IC devices and  14 https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/CCRA%20-%20July%202,%202014%20- %20Ratified%20September%208%202014.pdf  15 namely, Annex B.3 Accreditation and Licensing of Evaluation Facilities  16 CCDB – Common Criteria Development Board manages the technical work program for the maintenance and  ongoing development of the CC and CEM and reach agreement on the application of the CC and CEM to evaluations.  17 https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/cc/#supporting  18 https://www.sogis.org/uk/supporting_doc_en.html  19 This document is not publicly available  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  39  the environment they are operating, hardware physical and software-related attack techniques  that could compromise a secure IC, cryptography techniques used in the ICs,  o the evaluators’ ability to use dedicated hardware and software tools to perform attacks against the  IC components, and further to analyse the data gathered as a result of data-capture and signal  processing procedures.  Additionally, the document lists types of equipment indispensable for performing specific attacks against  the ICs and similar devices, and discuss the way the laboratory can use them. Furthermore, it describes  required capabilities of the laboratory to perform composite evaluations of software and hardware of the  product, in terms of tools and necessary equipment.  Finally, the document contains basic requirements to the organization of the evaluations and use of  subcontractors.  The second document discusses similar topics but in relation to another technical domain ie. hardware  devices with security boxes (sometimes called ‘hardware security modules’ - HSM). It includes specific  requirements with regard to:   the evaluators,  in terms of their skills and experience i.e:  o basic knowledge in the area of electricity and chemistry,  o detailed knowledge and experience of design principles of integrated circuits,  microcontroller architecture, functionality and packaging, several attack techniques  against the hardware and programmable micro-controllers, cryptographic algorithms and  random number generators,  o ability to use the equipment to perform independent tests and attacks.   the laboratory unrestricted access to dedicated facilities such as  o environment control equipment (e.g. to control communication, voltage, clock and  temperature)  o chemical and mechanical lab equipment (i.e. for sample preparation and analysis)  o imaging equipment (e.g. cameras, microscopes)  o logical test tools (e.g. for interface testing, vulnerability scanning, operating system testing,  randomness analysis, source code analysis, circuit layout analysis, fuzzing tools)   the laboratory organization for evaluations, in term of the use of bespoken equipment, directly or  by subcontracting.  Additionally, it should be noted there are several detailed supporting documents for evaluations,  mandatory to use for laboratories under the SOGIS MRA. These are listed in Table 199.

Consequently, specific and detailed knowledge, skills and experiences are  expected from evaluators in these areas as well.  Several standards which support the evaluation methodology as described in ISO/IEC TR 18045, in  particular for vulnerability assessments, are listed in Table 200.

Practices of laboratories  Typical processes and timeframes for evaluation  The evaluation according to Common Criteria usually happens in a typical ping-pong run. The developer  provides evidence to the evaluation laboratory that the product (the Target of Evaluation, to be more  precise) meets certain requirements as determined in the Security Target documentation; the laboratory  reviews and tests the evidence and provides feedback to the developer. Relevant documentation and the  TOE itself are revised and the process starts over.  Evaluations are typically organized by examining several assurance classes separately. This means that the  following areas of an evaluation are addressed one after the other:   The Security Target specification   The Design Documentation (Class ADV)   The Guidance Documentation (Class AGD)   The Life-Cycle Documentation (Class ALC)   Testing and Vulnerability Analysis (Class ATE and AVA)  In the context of the international recognition of the criteria and the overall complexity of the Target of  Evaluation, some of the documentation to be provided for an evaluation can get complex. In this context,  it is common that the evaluation/testing of a certain piece of information or its revision takes several  weeks rather than few days.  The overall timeframe that needs to be planned for an evaluation depends on the following factors (in that  order):   The chosen Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL). The basis for the estimations is the list of work units  from [ISO18045] that relate to the chosen EAL.   The complexity of the Target of Evaluation   The experience of the developer   The experience of the lab and   the maturity of the criteria  The question of the overall timeframe of an evaluation is hard to answer but the following lists should  provide a first overview:  Timeframes after EAL:   EAL 1,2,3: evaluations typically can take less than 6 months   EAL 4: evaluations are typically planned in a timeframe of a year   EAL 5 and above: 1 1/2 years and above  In this context, it should be noted that the listed timeframes should just be taken as examples based on  the experience of the editors. Timeframes vary significantly from scheme to scheme and are even  restricted by some schemes (e.g. in the US).  Timeframe considering the complexity of the product:   Simple products: See above  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  44   Products of medium complexity: add 10-20%   Complex products: add 50 % or more  The experience of the developer plays a very important part regarding the schedule of an evaluation. A  well experienced developer can easily cut the timeframes that have been mentioned before even by half,  specifically if a predecessor version of the product already has been certified. On the other hand, novices  in the field of Common Criteria, are well advised to allow some extra time in their schedule.  The experience of the evaluation laboratory and the maturity of the evaluation criteria are two influencing  factors that are less often discussed. Even though, no reliable data exists for this question, empirical  observations lead to the conclusion that the experience of the laboratory has  significant impact on the  timeframe of an evaluation. This does not only refer to the experience of the laboratory in general  (meaning how many evaluations a laboratory has carried out) but it specifically refers to the experience of  the laboratory with respect to similar products. As an example: A laboratory that has already performed  evaluations of firewalls according to a certain Protection Profile will have a significant advantage for  evaluations in this area (even over other labs that are more experienced in general but have less specific  experience).  Last, but not least, the maturity of the criteria is an important aspect. This does not relate to the maturity  of the Common Criteria itself but relates more to the maturity of dedicated Protection Profiles,  interpretations and guidance documents. Specifically, when these criteria are used for the first time,  evaluations usually take significantly longer.  Operational procedures  Operational procedures for working in a laboratory should be seen in different contexts as follows:   Working as an evaluator   Working as a lead/senior evaluator   Managing a laboratory  The work of an evaluator comprises the review of the documentation that has been provided by the  developer as well as tests and vulnerability assessment of the product itself. In larger laboratories, it is  common that evaluators specialize in certain aspects of evaluation procedures. Even though it is usually  the case that evaluators are capable to conduct all aspects of an evaluation, they often focus on certain  aspects of an evaluation in their daily work.  From the evaluator perspective, the daily work is characterized by the four-eyes principle that is inherent  to the Common Criteria requirements in many different places. Every step of work that is performed by the  evaluator is typically reviewed by at least one competent co-worker. The extensive amount of reviews and  checks facilitates the high quality of the evaluation procedures according to Common Criteria.  Every evaluation is led by a senior/lead evaluator. The work in such role usually includes strict and active  supervision of the evaluator but is augmented by aspects of project management and customer relations.  The senior evaluator should be a well experienced professional and therewith is the first point of contact  for all evaluators in a project if questions arise. Also, it is typical that sensitive decisions and test results  that potentially have an impact on entire evaluation are discussed and double-checked with the  senior/lead evaluator.  The senior/lead evaluator overlooks the entire project and also consider the effect of a technical decision  on the overall project schedule and budget. Also, senior/lead evaluators usually are responsible for  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  45  contacting customers, establishing modes of co-operation, leading milestone meeting and similar  activities.  The manager of the laboratory oversees all evaluation processes which are conducted in that laboratory.  With respect to the evaluation processes themselves, the lab manager represents another level of  escalation. If a technical dispute among evaluators (or between evaluators and the developer or sponsor)  comes up, the lab manager can be involved. However, in a large number of laboratories, the position of a  lab manager is seen as a management position rather than a technical one. This means that a lab manager  does not necessarily have the technical background and knowledge to discuss all technical issues. The  primary focus of the lab manager in daily life is:   to ensure that the laboratory follows all regulations,   to ensure that new interpretations and information about the Common Criteria are circulated  amongst all evaluators and utilized during evaluations,   to communicate with the certification and accreditation authorities in all substantial issues with  regard to the accreditation of licensing of laboratory.  Capacity and capabilities  Gaining an overview of the capabilities of all evaluation laboratories in Europe that work in the area of  Common Criteria is not an easy task. The main reasons for this are:  1) There is no obligation for a certification or evaluation authority to report on finished  certification.  2) Evaluations can remain unreported for a variety of reasons as such:  a. The evaluation fails,  b. The evaluation is performed in the context of confidential project (e.g. a project with  military scope or a classified project, in general)  3) The primary, central source for certifications under www.commoncriteriaportal.org often  remains obsolete.  The analysis in this chapter is based on the information as published on www.commoncriteriaportal.org  and augmented by the knowledge of the experts who authored this report.  By the time this report has been prepared (November 2017) a total of 1864 certificates have been  reported under www.commoncriteriaportal.org by European laboratories.  Over the last few years, the numbers are as follows:   2016: 83 certificates   2015: 147 certificates   2014: 163 certificates  When looking at these numbers, one should keep in mind that quite a few of these products the  certificates are granted to, have actually been re-certified.  The following table shows, how the certificates in 2014-2016 are distributed over the European countries  that issue certificates:  http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/ http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/ http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  46  2014 2015 2016 TOTAL  Germany 62 46 11 878  Spain 7 7 8 80  France 75 57 57 777  Italy 1 8 3 21  thNetherlands 5 12  45  Sweden 6 7 3 21  UK 7 10 1 41  Table 23: Number of certificates per country 2014-2016  The following figures show how the published certificates are distributed among the various classes of  products (the most populated categories shown for clarity of presentation).  Figure 9: Number of certificates by category  It becomes immediately obvious that the vast majority of certificates are issued for smart cards and similar  devices.  If one filters out the smart card related certificates (see Figure 10) and repeats the analysis, the next top 3  are not so obvious as they change over the years. However, it’s probably fair to say that the next most  popular categories for certification are databases, products for digital signatures and network devices.  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  47  Figure 10: Numbers of certificates by category w/o smart cards  Personnel  A plethora of requirements that have to be met by the personal are covered by the criteria as introduced  previously. In this context, it falls into the responsibility of the certification body to ensure that evaluation  labs meet the requirements. This includes competence requirements for evaluators. In this context, some  certification authorities also have documented criteria that summarize the requirements.  While developing this report, investigation has also been performed with respect to the question, how the  various schemes address the requirements on personnel. The outcome of this investigation can be found  in Table 22  COUNTRY  CERTIFICATION BODY  (CB)  PRIVATE  COMPANY  EVALUATION  FACILITY (EF)  NAME  REQUIREMENTS FOR EVALUATORS  UK  National Cyber Security  Centre (NCSC)  Commercial  Evaluation  Facility (CLEF)  Commercial  Evaluation  Facility  (CLEF)  3 levels of qualification: Trainee evaluator  (successful training, which is APPROVED by  the CB and CONDUCTED by a Qualified  Evaluator [or Specialist if appropriate field]);  Qualified evaluator (a Trainee Evaluator who  has been assessed by the CB to be capable of  evaluation work w/o supervision; Specialist  evaluator (assessed as Qualified for some  subset of the CC Assurance Classess, for  others he/she is equivalent to a Trainee).

In order to facilitate a harmonization of the requirements in this context, ISO/IEC  SC27 WG3 has started a project in this area. The three-part standard ISO/IEC 19896-1,2,3 Information  technology — Security techniques — Competence requirements for information security testers and  evaluators comprises the following parts   Part 1 introduces the general concept and some general requirements   Part 2 specifies Knowledge, skills and effectiveness requirements for ISO/IEC 19790 testers   Part 3 specifies Knowledge, skills and effectiveness requirements for ISO/IEC 15408 (Common  Criteria) evaluators  The international standardization of these requirements in the context of ISO will lead to a further  harmonization of the competence requirements for evaluators in different fields that will - in the end -also  help to improve the quality and comparability of evaluations in general.

This is also valid for new systems that make extensive use of digital technologies and which require a high  level of security. National initiatives have been emerging to set high-level cybersecurity requirements for  ICT components on traditional infrastructure, including certification requirements. Important as they may  be, they may nurture risks such as market fragmentation and challenges to interoperability.  This study seeks to identify and analyse the current landscape of ICT security certification laboratories in  EU Member States, comparing them also with third countries practices. The findings of this study will  constitute the basis for the Agency’s proposal towards an EU wide ICT products and services certification  framework.  Terms and their definitions are discussed in order to enable the identification of certification and/or  evaluation models, and their instances usually called ‘certification (evaluation) schemes’ where respective  entities can play different roles with different relations among them. To recognize equivalents, similarities  and differences among terms in use, the following contexts are discussed: general normative, legal,  specific normative and arranged.  The legal framework in the context of the certification of products can be seen on different levels as  follows:  1. General requirements as set up by Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament,  2. National level requirements from relevant accreditation bodies,  3. Certification or evaluation requirements from various standards,  4. Requirements resulting from international arrangements.  It has been found that in general, laboratories operate under respective national schemes. Although all are  providing services of evaluating the security of ICT products based on an approved and unified  methodology, their legal and business context varies, reflecting characteristics of local economies and  policies of the Certification Body. By researching all licensed laboratories world-wide this report identifies  relevant patterns, similarities and differences. The research will focus on the important implication from  the European Union’s perspective.  Standards used in the evaluation process include mainly ISO/IEC 15408-3 and ISO/IEC TR 18045. The main  use of ISO/IEC 15408 is to assess the security of IT products. There are direct relationships between  ISO/IEC 15408-3 assurance structure and the structure of evaluation process as described in ISO/IEC TR  18045. The ISO/IEC TR 18045 provides a description of evaluation process in terms of: roles and  responsibilities and general evaluation model.  The evaluation according to Common Criteria usually happens in a typical ping-pong run. Evaluations are  organized by examining several assurance classes separately. By the time this report has been prepared  (November 2017) a total of 1864 certificates have been reported under www.commoncriteriaportal.org  (main portal for CC certification) by European laboratories (around 150 per year). It falls into the  responsibility of the certification body to ensure that evaluation labs meet the requirements. This includes  competence requirements for evaluators. In this context, some certification authorities also have  documented criteria that summarize the requirements.  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  06  1. Introduction and scope  Today’s societies and economies are based on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT).  Digitalisation increases cyber security risk across many sectors. There is a need to minimize the risk  inherent in the use of ICT in society and the economy. One of the ways to achieve this is through ICT  product certification. The certification obligations are implied by existing EU legislations; by the market  needs, the industry, and ICT risk owners’ expectations.  Certification plays an important role in raising the level of trust and security in ICT products and services.  This is also valid for new systems that make extensive use of digital technologies and which require a high  level of security. National initiatives have been emerging to set high-level cybersecurity requirements for  ICT components on traditional infrastructure, including certification requirements. Important as they may  be, they may nurture risks such as market fragmentation and challenges to interoperability.  Taking due account of recent legislative and policy developments, such as the adoption of the NIS  directive1, publication of the European Commission (EC) position on the cPPP2, and most importantly, the  draft proposal of the EU Cybersecurity Act3 ENISA continues to support the EC and the Member States in  developing a certification framework for ICT security products and services, which on one hand will boost  competition, and on the other promote mutual recognition of certificates and harmonisation of  certification practices up to defined levels.  This study identifies and analyses the current landscape of ICT security certification laboratories in EU  Member States, comparing them also with third countries’ practices. The findings of this study will  constitute the basis for the Agency’s proposal towards an EU wide ICT products and services certification  framework.  In the following sections, several aspects of the functioning of certification laboratories for ICT products  will be described and analysed:   Terms and definitions   Legal framework   Organisation of laboratories   Standards used in the evaluation process   Practices of laboratories  1 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/network-and-information-security-nis-directive  2 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/commission-staff-working-document-cppp-and-accompanying- measures  3 https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/initiatives/com-2017-477_en  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/network-and-information-security-nis-directive https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/commission-staff-working-document-cppp-and-accompanying-measures https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/commission-staff-working-document-cppp-and-accompanying-measures https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/initiatives/com-2017-477_en  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  07  2. Terms and definitions  Introduction  Discussing terms and their definition enables the identification of certification and/or evaluation models, and their  instances usually called ‘certification (evaluation) schemes’ where respective entities can play different roles with  different relations among them. Furthermore, it helps to recognize equivalents, similarities and differences among  the terms in use depending on various contexts.  To recognize:  A. equivalents – i.e. terms having the same meaning regardless the context,  B. similarities –i.e.  terms relevant for a particular scheme while their meanings can be considered as  narrowing the context, and  C. differences – i.e. terms relevant for a particular context only, or the same terms of different  meanings,  this chapter discusses the following context:  1. general normative – introduced by the ISO harmonized standards specifying broad context for  conformity assessment activities performed by organizations with defined roles and  responsibilities,  2. legal -  as introduced by the Regulation 765/2008 as a conformity assessment framework,  3. specific normative – introduced by international standards i.e. ISO/IEC 15408 series and ISO/IEC  18045 (called hereinafter Common Criteria or CC), with regards to security evaluation and  certification of IT products,  4. arranged –introduced in international arrangements i.e. CCRA and SOGIS-MRA, containing more  detailed requirements, as agreed among the parties of these arrangements.  Set of relevant terms and definitions followed by illustration of relevant models are presented in clauses 2.2 -2.5.  Then, clause 2.6 of this chapter will identify equivalents, similarities and differences between relevant terms.  General normative context  The primary concept of conformity assessment has been established in ISO’s series of international standards, in  particular, EN ISO/IEC 17000:2004, EN ISO/IEC 17065:2012 and EN ISO/IEC 17025:2017 (mentioning of a  publication is a designation of the most recent version of a standard).  The defined approach - which is called hereafter ‘General normative context’ - refers to a concept of conformity  assessment to specific requirements. It is described further by attestation activities which lead to a clear statement  of conformity for a given product or service. Such a result could be achieved by using organizations, rules,  procedures and management.  Terms and respective definitions for this general normative context are presented in the tables below. The first  table shows the general conformity assessment environment (see Table 1).

In such arrangements results of all conformity assessments are presented in the form of a statement issued by the  respective body showing clearly the scope and relations in a given conformity assessment scheme.  This part of the general normative concept is presented in Table 2.

Further, it is worth to know that the general normative context does not identify which  select and demonstrable function is assigned to a particular conformity assessment body. This has to be defined in  a particular certification (conformity assessment) scheme.  Legal context  The legal context of conformity assessment appears from terms whose definitions are taken from the Regulation  765/2008 (see Table 3). The Regulation introduces strict organization of the market surveillance by using  accreditation mechanisms for conformity assessment bodies. Only one accreditation body per Member State is  allowed.  Conceptually, the legal context does not disturb the general normative one.  TERM DEFINITION  concept:  conformity assessment  process demonstrating whether specified requirements relating to a product, process,  service, system, person or body have been fulfilled  entities:  national accreditation body  sole body in a Member State that performs accreditation with authority  derived from the State  conformity assessment body  body that performs conformity assessment activities including calibration, testing,  certification and inspection  activities:  accreditation  attestation by a national accreditation body that a conformity assessment body meets the  requirements set by harmonized standards and, where applicable, any additional  requirements including those set out in relevant sectoral schemes, to carry out a specific  conformity assessment activity  peer evaluation  process for the assessment of a national accreditation body by other national  accreditation bodies, carried out in accordance with the requirements (EC) No 765/2008,  and, where applicable, additional sectoral technical specifications  Table 3: Terms of definitions establishing the legal context according to Regulation 765/2008  Please refer to chapter 3 for a more detailed overview of the legal context according to Regulation  765/2008.  Specific normative context  A specific normative context is established by adopting terms and their definitions from the Common Criteria  standards4. First, the general normative context is narrowed by introducing specific types of objects to the  conformity assessment performance i.e. TOE (Target of Evaluation), Protection Profile (Protection Profile), and ST  (Security Target). Secondly, ‘conformity assessment’ is expressed as ‘evaluation’. Finally, the standards define a  specific framework under which all activities related to evaluation are performed, and impose specific  requirements on organizations involved with regard to their activities.  4 Currently, the whole series of ISO/IEC 15408 and ISO/IEC 18045 are subject to revision process. All terms and  definitions are from official published editions dated to 2009  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  11  A systematic approach to relevant terms and definitions is presented in Table 4.

ISO/IEC 15408-1  Table 4: Specific normative concept of conformity assessment based on the Common Criteria approach  It should be noted that activities related to evaluation are expressed in different terms and meanings than  selecting and demonstrating functions to be performed with regard to conformity assessment, as described in ISO  17000.  Arranged context  This context for conformity assessment of IT products security is given by international arrangements such as the  Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement (CCRA)6 – world-wide, gathering organizations from several countries,  and Senior Officer Group Information Security Mutual Recognition Arrangement (SOGIS MRA)7 – gathering  organizations from the EU plus Norway. As these two arrangements both implement the same certification and  evaluation framework based on the Common Criteria, the context will be described further using the SOGIS MRA  documents, as relevant to European Certification Framework.  The arranged context is presented in the following table:  TERMS DEFINITION  concept:  evaluation:  assessment of an IT product or a protection profile against the IT security evaluation  criteria and IT security evaluation methods to determine whether or not the claims  made are justified  certification: process carried out by a CB leading to the issuing of a certificate  organization:  participant A signatory to this Agreement.  accreditation body  independent organization responsible for assessing the performance of other  organizations against a recognized standard, and for formally confirming the status of  those that meet the requirements of the standard  6 https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/ccra/  7 https://www.sogis.org/  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  13  certification body (CB)  organization responsible for carrying out certification and for overseeing the day-to-day  operation of an evaluation and certification scheme  evaluation facility  organization which carries out evaluations, independently of the developers of the IT  products or protection profiles evaluated  IT Security Evaluation Facility  (ITSEF)  accredited Evaluation Facility, licensed  or approved to perform evaluations within the  context of a particular IT Security Evaluation and Certification Scheme  evaluation and certification  scheme  systematic organization of the functions of evaluation and certification under the  authority CB in order to ensure that high standards of competence and impartiality are  maintained and consistency is achieved  relationships imposed by the arrangement:  accredited  formally confirmed by an accreditation body as meeting a predetermined standard of  impartiality and general technical, methodological and procedural competence  licensed  assessed by a  CB as technically competent in the specific IT technical domain and field  of security evaluation and formally authorized to carry out evaluations  within the  context of a particular within the context of a particular evaluation and certification  scheme  conformant certificate  public document issued by a compliant CB and authorized by a Participant which  confirms that a specific IT product or protection profile has successfully completed  evaluation by an ITSEF  monitoring of evaluation  procedure by which representatives of a CB observe evaluations in progress or review  completed evaluations in order to satisfy themselves that an ITSEF is carrying out its  functions in a proper and professional manner.  voluntarily periodic assessment  assessment of compliant CBs  (term not defined although described in the  arrangement)  Table 5: Concept of evaluation and certification based on provisions of the SOGIS MRA  Comparison of terms use in different contexts  2.6.1 Equivalents  Part of fundamental terms or group of terms represent the same concept and share the same meaning regardless  of the context they function in.

Legal framework and regulations for evaluation laboratories  The legal framework in the context of the certification of products can be seen on different levels as  follows:  1. General requirements as set up by the Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament,  2. National level requirements from relevant accreditation bodies,  3. Certification or evaluation requirements from various standards,  4. Requirements resulting from international arrangements.  More details on these levels will be described in the following subchapters. The complete overview is  summarized in the following figures:  National  Accreditation  Body  National  Accreditation  Body  European co-  operation for  Accreditation (EA)  European  level  National  level  Conformity  Assessment Body/  Certification Body  Multilateral  arrangement  level  Conformity  Assessment Body/  ITSEF (laboratory)  Accreditation  EC  Regulation  765/2008  EN ISO/IEC  17065/EN  ISO/IEC  17025  SOGIS  MRA/  CCRA  *in some schemes licensing can be done in parallel with accreditation or as a part of accreditation  Figure 1: Overview of requirements  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  16  SOGIS MRA  Conformity  Assessment Body/  Certification Body  Conformity  Assessment Body/  ITSEF (laboratory)  EN ISO/IEC  17065  ISO/IEC  15408  EN ISO/IEC  17025  ISO/IEC  18045  CC CEM  JIL  Docs  International  standards  Other normative docs  CCRA  CC CEM  CCDB  Docs  European  harmonized  standards  Figure 2: Sources of requirements for laboratories and Certification Bodies  Regulation No 765/2008  With Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 the EU set requirements related to the accreditation of bodies who  perform conformity assessments for products. This regulation applies to European national accreditation  bodies that in turn perform the accreditation of the evaluation laboratories.  It is an essential part of this regulation that each Member State of the European Union shall appoint a  single national accreditation body. (Article 4, 1).  This national accreditation body shall, when requested by a conformity assessment body, determine  whether that conformity assessment body is competent to carry out a specific conformity assessment  activity. Where it is found to be competent, the national accreditation body shall issue an accreditation  attestation to that effect. This way, a harmonized European structure for the accreditation of laboratories  is built.  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  17  On the European level, one body has been recognized as the European Body for Accreditation. This body is  the European co-operation for Accreditation or EA. EA is an association of national accreditation bodies in  Europe that are officially recognised by their national governments to assess and verify—against  international standards—organisations that carry out conformity assessment services such as certification,  verification, inspection, testing and calibration.  For the use in this report, EA has the following roles:   EA cooperates with the European Commission in questions of accreditation,   EA shall allow national accreditation bodies within the Members States to become a member of  EA, provided that they comply with the rules of EA,   EA shall provide its members with peer evaluation services.  In the context of this report, the peer evaluation services of this body are of specific importance.  ‘peer evaluation’ refers to a process for the assessment of a national accreditation body by other national  accreditation bodies, carried out in accordance with the requirements (EC) No 765/2008, and, where  applicable, additional sectoral technical specifications;  Each member of EA (i.e. each European Accreditation body) agrees to take part in the process of peer  evaluation, both actively and passively in order to ensure that all members of EA follow the corresponding  regulations.  By the use of the peer evaluation procedures, a consistent quality should be guaranteed  throughout the complete system.  National level  When the scope of our view changes to the national level, [ISO17025] and [ISO17065] are the most  relevant standards after which each of the national accreditation bodies will perform the accreditation of  the conformity assessment bodies. Further, from the laboratories perspective, [17027] is of the utmost  interest.  [ISO17025] defines general requirements on competency that will have to be met by the laboratory  providing testing (including evaluation), or calibration services. It specifically poses requirements on:   General Management Requirements  o Control of Documents  o Subcontracting, purchasing and service to the customer (including complaints)  o Control of nonconformity testing and/or calibration work  o Improvements, Corrective Actions, internal audits and reviews   Technical Requirements  o General requirements  o Accommodation and environmental conditions  o Test and calibration methods  o Equipment  o Measurement traceability  o Handling of test and calibration items  o Assuring the quality of test and calibration results  o Requirements on reporting the results  A new edition of [ISO17025] is being elaborated at the time of writing of this report. Among new features,  it will offer a process oriented approach, which constitutes new value and significant changes in  accreditation schemes.  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  18  Even though it is not a strict requirement, evaluation laboratories in the area of IT-security often also  maintain a quality management system in accordance with [ISO9000] and an information security  management system in accordance with [ISO27000].  [ISO17065] defines the requirements that will have to be met by the certification authority. It specifically  poses requirements on:   General Requirements  o Legal requirements  o Impartiality  o Liability and financing  o Non-discriminatory conditions  o Confidentiality  o Publicly available information   Structural Requirements  o Organization Structure  o Mechanisms for safeguarding impartiality   Resource Requirements  o Personnel  o Ressources for evaluation   Process Requirements  o Applications and Application Review  o Evaluation and Review  o Certification decision and documentation  o Directory of certified products  o Surveillance  o Changes affecting certification  o Termination, reduction, suspension or withdrawal of certification  o Records  o Complaints   Management System Requirements  o Options  o General management system documentation  o Control of documents and records  o Management review  o Internal audits  o Corrective actions  o Preventive actions  Standard Level  Below the level of [ISO17025] and a potentially implemented management system, the view will change to  the standards according to which a conformity assessment body (i.e. the actual evaluation laboratory)  performs its assessments.  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  19  Prominent examples include the Common Criteria (aka ISO/IEC 15408 ([ISO15408] and ISO/IEC 18045  [18045]9) and [ISO19790]10  Beside their technical criteria for conformity assessment, these standards bring further organizational  requirements.  As an example, this can be analyzed for the Common Criteria (CC):  Requirements from international arrangements  The CC distinguishes between the processes of evaluation and certification. The evaluation is the process  that can be seen as the assessment of a product (the so-called Target of Evaluation) against defined  requirements.  The certification process oversees the evaluation and ends with the actual certificate. CC requires that the  certification process is performed by a party independent from the evaluation laboratory.  3.4.1 General considerations  The international recognition of certifications that are performed according to Common Criteria is one of  the major advantages and benefits of using Common Criteria as reference standards. However, from the  perspective of an evaluation laboratory, this advantage also goes along with an additional set of  requirements that have to be met. The following two subchapters introduce the major areas from which  these requirements arise, namely the CCRA and the SOG-IS agreement.  3.4.2 CCRA  The arrangement on the Recognition of Common Criteria Certificates in the Field of IT Security ([CCRA]) is  the first agreement on the international recognition of certificates issued on conformity assessment  against Common Criteria.  The purpose of this Arrangement is to ensure that evaluations are performed based on consistent  standards and with a high level of assurance, to improve the availability of evaluated products and  Protection Profiles, to eliminate the burden of redundant evaluations and to continuously improve the  efficiency and cost-effectiveness of evaluations.  The primary goal of the arrangement is to ensure that IT products and protection profiles which earn a  Common Criteria certificate can be procured or used without the need for further evaluations.  A Management Committee, composed of senior representatives from each signatory’s country of the  CCRA, has been established to implement the Arrangement and to provide guidance to the respective  national schemes conducting evaluation and validation activities.  9 Basically, Common Criteria consist of: 1) 3-part standard containing: concepts and models (ISO/IEC 15408- 1),  security functional requirements (ISO/IEC 15408 2), security assurance requirements (ISO/IEC 15408-3) and 1-part  standard containing evaluation methodology description (ISO/IEC 18045 “Common Methodology for Information  Technology Security Evaluation” (CEM)). Further details are provided in Chapter 5.  10 ISO/IEC 19790 deals with Security requirements for cryptographic modules. It is the ISO pendant of the FIPS 140-2  requirements.  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  20  The requirements of the Common Criteria are mainly developed by an international consortium known as  Common Criteria Development Board (CCDB) and Common Criteria Maintenance Board (CCMB). Usually,  members of these consortia have a governmental background.  CCDB manages the technical work program for the maintenance and ongoing development of the CC and  CEM and reach agreement on the application of the CC and CEM to evaluations being carried out by the  CCRA certificate producing nations to ensure harmonization across qualifying nations. The principal  purpose of CCMB is to process requests for inclusion of Change Proposals (CP), based upon national CC and  CEM development requirements and taking into account CCRA requirements as specified by the CCDB.  For an evaluation laboratory, the work of the CCDB goes along with a set of requirements for the daily  work. Beside the criteria that are laid down in CC and a set of supporting documents that are developed  and maintained by the CCDB, the certification body of each member of the CCRA is responsible for  oversight of the compliance of the evaluation laboratory with the criteria.  3.4.3 SOG-IS  Beside the arrangement laid down in the CCRA, an additional recognition agreement exists on the  European Level.  The SOG-IS (Senior Officers Group) agreement was produced in response to the EU Council Decision of  March 31st 1992 (92/242/EEC) in the field of security of information systems, and the subsequent Council  recommendation of April 7th (1995/144/EC) on common information technology security evaluation  criteria.  The participants of the SOG-IS agreement have a slightly different perspective than the participants of the  CCRA. SOG-IS mainly focusses on coordinating evaluation activities around Common Criteria among  European Certification Bodies (also to gain a strong standing within CCRA) and to coordinate the  development of Protection Profiles. It should be noted that the SOGIS MRA scope of interest is limited to  two technical domains of IT products i.e. “Hardware devices with security boxes CC” and “Smartcards and  similar devices CC”.  However, the SOG-IS agreement also comprises a recognition of Common Criteria certificates among the  participants of the agreement. In contrast to the CCRA, two things are important to mention about the  recognition that are regulated under this agreement:  1) The recognition of certificates covers all evaluation assurance levels up to EAL7 (compared to only  EAL2 typically under the CCRA)  2) The recognition above EAL 4 is only covered for defined technical areas when schemes have been  approved by the management committee for this level.  Similar to CCRA, the arrangement provides for member nations to participate as certificate consuming  participants or as certificate producers.  The original arrangement signed in 1997 (updated to incorporate the use of Common Criteria in 1999) was  updated in 2010 for two reasons; firstly, to provide a robust mechanism allowing new schemes to take part  as certificate producers and, secondly, to limit the higher levels of recognition to agreed technical domains  where adequate agreement around evaluation methodology, laboratory requirements, attack methods  etc. are in place.  In order to achieve the higher level of recognition under the SOG-IS agreement, it has been necessary to  develop and publish a set of supporting documents that have been developed by different working groups  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  21  in the context of the SOG-IS agreement. These documents build up the Joint Interpretation Library (aka JIL  documents) and comprise mandatory documents that have to be followed during each evaluation of a  product that falls into a technical domain covered by the SOG-IS agreement and guidance documents that  are optional regarding their use. More details will be given in Chapter 5.  The certification bodies which are part of the arrangement ensure that all evaluation bodies will follow  those criteria in addition to the criteria that has been published by the CCMD/CCDB under the CCRA.

Organisation of laboratories  Legal forms of laboratories  4.1.1 Introduction  In general, laboratories operate under respective national schemes (see 4.2). Although all are providing  services of evaluating the security of ICT products based on an approved and unified methodology, their  legal and business context varies, reflecting characteristics of local economies and policies of the  Certification Body. By researching all licensed laboratories world-wide this report will try to identify  relevant patterns, similarities and differences. The research will focus on the important implication from  the European Union’s perspective. Respective European schemes are indicated in pink in every table.  4.1.2 Research methodology  Presented information has been gathered by means of Internet based research.  For all licensed laboratories the type of legal entity has been determined, using the respective country’s  business register. The following types have been identified:   Private company – independent legal entity, usually similar in form to a limited liability  corporation,   Traded private company – independent legal entity, traded on a local stock exchange,   Research institute – non-profit entities, set up by industry members or universities, and   Government agency – laboratories which are part of the country’s government.  By investigating companies’ websites the importance of the Common Criteria evaluations (and ICT  certification more broadly) for their business model has been qualified, estimating them on a range from  core to minimal, with labels “IT Security oriented” and “certification oriented” signaling states in between.  The assessment is subjective.  4.1.3 Presentation of results  4.1.3.1 Laboratories in numbers  All laboratories listed as being currently in operation within the CCRA framework11 were the subject of  analysis. It should be emphasized that laboratories operating in the context of the SOGIS Mutual  Recognition Arrangement12 are a subset of the analyzed set of laboratories.  Major findings with regard to licensed laboratories are presented below.  This report analyzes 67 laboratories licensed under 16 operating schemes. As some laboratories are  providing evaluation services under more than one national scheme (see below) a total of 60 separate  entities has been counted in total.  The number of licensed laboratories operating under respective scheme range from 1 (India) to 9 (USA).  11 https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/labs/  12 https://www.sogis.org/uk/status_participant_en.html  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  23  less than 3 6 Australia, India, Malaysia, the  Netherlands, Sweden, UK  3-5 5 Canada, Japan, Norway, Spain, Turkey  6 and more 5 France, Germany, Italy, Korea, US  Table 9: Number of licensed laboratories under different schemes  37 laboratories fall under the category of ‘(traded) private company’ which is more than 50% of all licensed  laboratories. In the context of this study they are called ‘legally independent’. Legally independent  laboratories constitute a majority of licensed laboratories in Norway (100%), Germany (87%) and France  (60%).  The second group of security evaluation providers consists of laboratories operating as parts of  multinational companies with a wide portfolio of ICT products and services. They constitute a majority of  licensed labs in Australia (100%), UK (100%) and Canada (75%).  The third group includes research institutes (both industry funded and affiliated with universities) and  government agencies. There are several cases that highlight their importance. A governmental agency is  the only licensed laboratory under the Indian scheme. Research institutes constitute a significant  proportion of licensed labs in Japan and Korea.

Considering the following  classification:  o Core: Common Criteria evaluations is the core business of the entity; additionally, the  security certification (as in both cases of importance) focus also falls under 'Core' label;  o IT security oriented: the entity focuses on ICT security services, however, Common Criteria  evaluations play important role in their portfolio;  o Certification oriented: the entity provides wide range of evaluation and certification  services in many fields;  o Minimal: CC evaluations are only a small part of a wide portfolio of products and services,  including providing integrated IT or IT security solutions.  We have quantified laboratories per business type, with regards to all analyzed schemes (see Table 12).

It appears majority of licensed laboratories operating under the SOGIS scheme are independent private  companies focused on evaluation services themselves, and this figure is significantly higher than for  laboratories under the CCRA.  This finding is summarized in Figure  and Figure 4, respectively.  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  26  Figure 3: Licensed laboratories operating under CCRA scheme  Figure 4: Licensed laboratories operating under SOGIS MRA scheme  Considering the importance of the Common Criteria evaluation from the business perspective one can  compare European and non-European schemes. For this purpose, 52 individual business entities ie.  local  branches counted as singular, multinationals - as one instance have been identified. The results are  presented in Figure 5 and Figure 6, respectively.  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  27  Figure 5: Importance of CC evaluation for the companies' business model under the CCRA  Figure 6: Importance of CC evaluation for the companies' business model under the SOGIS MRA  Worldwide, for 46% of the studied laboratories certification under CC is deemed as core business. A much  smaller proportion (13%) of the laboratories focuses on IT security, of which certification is only a part. The  smallest group (6%) consists of laboratories that provide certification services in many fields. The rest of  the laboratories (35%) are parts of large companies, often multinational, for which CC certification is of  minimal importance. Results of classification limited to the SOGIS MRA follow similar patterns, with the  exception of the relative greater importance of IT security oriented business model.  Licensing and supervising  4.2.1 Introduction  For the purpose of analysing relevant characteristics, the scheme processes have been divided into two  phases: licensing and then supervising.  The research has been conducted with respect to all 16  Core 46%  IT security  oriented  13%  Certification  oriented  6%  Minimal 35%  Core 36%  IT security  oriented  21%  Certification  oriented  7%  Minimal 36%  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  28  certification schemes although finding a complete set of information for all these schemes has not been  possible in the given timeframe.  4.2.2 Licensing  4.2.2.1 Application procedure  A licencing mechanism has been identified in all analysed schemes. The most distinguished features are:   one- or two-step procedure: the proceeding for granting a license can be divided into two phases.  In some schemes it is allowed to obtain a provisional appointment after passing technical  examination of the laboratory readiness, and then a permanent license after successfully  completing the test evaluation,   technical examination of the applicant capability is sufficient, or additionally, performing a test  evaluation is necessary for the applicant to get a license,   getting an accreditation as a prerequisite: being accredited against ISO/IEC 17025 is mandatory in  all analysed schemes, however, in some schemes currently it is allowed to start the assessment by  a Certification Body without fulfilling the accreditation requirement by the applicant.  It should be noted that European schemes are licensing the laboratories under CCRA and - in parallel -  under SOGIS MRA. The characteristics of the application procedure are summarized below.  APPLICATION PROCEDURE  No. Country Fulfilling technical requirements  Test evaluation performed by  the applicant  Accreditation against  ISO/IEC 17025 as a  prerequisite  1 UK Provisional Appointment  Permanent Appointment no  2  Australia & New  Zealand  license granted after assessment  and upon a licensing agreement  not applicable no  3 Sweden  part of the assessment  procedure  license granted no  4 Canada  part of the assessment  procedure  license granted yes  5 Germany  part of the assessment  procedure  license granted yes  6 The Netherlands  part of the assessment  procedure  both, accreditation and  licensing based on successful  trial evaluation  no  7 USA  license granted after assessment  and upon a licensing agreement  not applicable yes  8 Malaysia license granted after assessment not applicable no  9 Japan  part of the assessment  procedure  license granted yes  Table 13: Application procedure differences among schemes  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  29  4.2.2.2 Licensing fees  There is a variety of licensing fee models among schemes. Some do not apply any fee, some others have  only an introductory fee (for the Application), and then for renewal of the license, and some implement  subscriptions. It should be noted that fees can be applicable to accreditation, but this is out of the schemes  control hence not discussed here.  All findings concerning the fee models for licensing are summarized in Table 14.

Schemes impose on  licensed laboratories various requirements to ensure actual independency of evaluations. The great  majority of commercial laboratories provides consultancy services, which pose a significant source of  potential conflict of interests. Every scheme addresses the issue, some provide a time period, in which  consultancy work prohibits an individual from working as an evaluator, some others set up general rules  only for avoiding conflicts of interest. We have found the strongest rule in the Japanese scheme where  providing consultancy services in parallel to the evaluation with regards to a given evaluated product is  clearly forbidden.  A summary of requirements concerning independency is given in Table 15.  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  30  COUNTRY RULES FOR THE EVALUATION INDEPENDENCE  1 UK   autonomous in operational and administrative;   evaluation independent of TOE development;   no evaluation of the work of any group or division within the parent company (the rule may  be relaxed at the discretion of the CB);   consultancy can be provided unless it does not impair the independence of the evaluation  i.e. an individual cannot evaluate his or her own work.  2  Australia & New  Zealand   functional separation from the lab's parent organization must be maintained;   evaluating a product of parent company or within the group is not allowed;   evaluation support consultancy and evaluation services are permitted, however the  laboratory must be able to demonstrate the separation of these activities from evaluation  activities.  3 Sweden   establishing and implementing documented procedures for identifying conflicts of interest  and for ensuring that such conflicts do not adversely influence the quality of the  evaluations is required;   pre-evaluation consulting may be provided by the laboratory providing proper separation  of evaluation and consultancy work;   personal involvement of the laboratory personnel with the supplier of a product under  evaluation within the preceding two years, either in design of the product or consultancy  services to the supplier regarding methods of dealing with matters that are barriers to the  product being certified, is prohibited.  4 Canada   sufficient separation of control with the parent company shall be demonstrated;  procedures to ensure no conflict of interest between personnel advising and evaluating  shall be established and implemented.  5 Germany   conflict of interests with regards to the outcome of an evaluation for the laboratory , its  parent corporation and individual staff members shall be identified and removed;   labs have to identify potential conflicts of interest in the beginning of an evaluation and  report to the certification authority;   any person active in the evaluation process cannot have been involved in the TOE  development.  6 The Netherlands   an individual cannot be hired by the Sponsor for consultancy within 2 years of termination  of their employment at the laboratory performing the evaluation.  7 USA   conflict of interest with regards to the outcome of an evaluation for the laboratory , its  parent corporation and individual staff members shall be identified and removed ;   consulting and evaluation activities shall be separated within the laboratory (ie. different  people shall be assigned to the two).  8 Malaysia   any person active in the evaluation process cannot have been involved in the TOE  development, consultancy to the Sponsor within the last 2 years.  9 Japan   laboratories are prohibited from providing consulting services in parallel to evaluation one  with regards to a given evaluation;   in case of divisions of larger companies labs have to be operational independent, and  operating on own budget.  Table 15: Independency requirements  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  31  4.2.3 Supervision  4.2.3.1 Supervising the evaluations  In general, certification bodies are obliged to oversee the evaluation process as they are held responsible  for issued certificates. General provisions on the supervision activities can be found in relevant  documentation of every scheme. However, schemes differ significantly if it comes to details. In some  schemes dedicated certifiers actively participate in the evaluation, in others a lead certifier even validates  every part of the evaluation process, while in some others the nominated certifier plays a passive role, and  only approves the final Evaluation Technical Report. Various approaches depending on the perceived  complexity of evaluation can be applied as well (for example, see the Spanish scheme characteristics).  The summary of findings is presented in Table 16.  COUNTRY CB'S ROLE IN THE EVALUATION PROCESS  1 UK   determining whether a TOE will be certifiable in principle;   monitoring all evaluations conducted under the Scheme;   assessing all evaluations’ results and issuing certificates;   (optionally) conducting Evaluation Progress Reviews.  2  Australia & New  Zealand   accepting evaluation tasks and plans to conduct evaluation;   allocating  two certifiers allocated to an evaluation task (certifiers conduct oversight  through meetings, discussing technical details, reviewing reports, maintaining certification  records, monthly reports on progress);   reviewing draft Evaluation Technical Report.  3 Sweden   deciding whether to undertake or decline the Certification;   evaluating partially the result by single evaluation reports (SER), each submitted to the  certifier for acceptance, and full evaluation report acceptance;   creating technical oversight reports;   possible direct supervising the Developer Sites or evaluator's independent testing by  evaluator.  4 Canada   determining whether the Target of Evaluation is suitable for evaluation;   providing technical oversight (allocated personnel, i.e. independently performing a subset  of evaluation activities and comparing the results, directly observing activities in progress,  reviewing reports);   accepting Evaluation Technical Report (ETR).  5 Germany   determining whether a TOE will be certifiable in principle;   oversighting the process;   monitoring certain activities of the evaluation facility, such as the execution of  tests/penetration tests or the execution of site audits at the developer in each case on site,   partial reports are only \"reviewed and commented on\" only final ETR is subject to approval.  6 The Netherlands   accepting applications for certificates;   supervising every evaluation (by appointing Certifier who accepts reports and creates  Certification Report);   executing the evaluator obligations to submit monthly status reports.

Table 16: Supervising the evaluation in relevant schemes  4.2.3.2 Auditing or monitoring  Schemes vary in their understanding of auditing or monitoring with respect to licensed laboratories. Such activities  are part of continuous supervision of the laboratories. However, the approach, depth and frequency of such  activities show different ways of achieving the objective. Some schemes include a procedure for monitoring the  laboratory operations upon defining trigger criteria, others rely on periodic technical assessments, and some  others on analysing periodic reports submitted by the laboratory.  The findings are presented in Table 17.  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  33  COUNTRY AUDIT OR MONITORING PROCEDURE  1 UK   monitoring the performance of a laboratory can be activated at any  point during the  laboratory membership of the scheme;   as a minimum: annual audit to co-incide with a laboratory annual contract extension (in  case, an existing laboratory wishes to extend their scope of operation).  2  Australia & New  Zealand   obligatory reporting to the CB of future evaluation tasks, changes to staff every 3 months.  3 Sweden   yearly assessment resulting in automatically renewal of the license;  surveillance of the  laboratory operation by continuous certification oversight.  4 Canada   Observation Reports generated in response to issues that require corrective action by the  laboratory;   assessment of personal changes.  5 Germany  annual audits  6 The Netherlands   submitting a list of the qualified evaluators with proofs of competence on annual base is  required;   annual formal technical assessment of the laboratory.  7 USA  new audit process \"Check-In/Check-Out\" is currently being implemented*  8 Malaysia   submitting an annual business report  with  key performance measures: time to complete;  effort spent; vulnerabilities discovered; consumer satisfaction etc;   reviewing of the laboratory operations at the discretion of CB.  9 Japan   periodic assessments by the CB (not if lab is periodically assessed by the Japanese  Accreditation Body).  10 France   licensing audit performed every 2 years;   checking e if the laboratory meets the licensing criteria - at any time.  *CB conducts periodic meetings in which those involved in the evaluation process will track progress and discuss issued within a  specific evaluation  Table 17: Auditing or monitoring the licensed laboratories  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  34  5. Standards used in the evaluation process  Assurance paradigm in ISO/IEC 15408-3  The main use of ISO/IEC 15408 is to assess the security of IT products. However, every IT product may be  used in many ways, and in many types of environment, so the notion of security can vary with context.  That means that the result of an ISO/IEC 15408 evaluation is never “this IT product is secure”, but is always  “this IT product meets this security specification”. In other words, security evaluation is a process of  determining and then proving - with sufficient level of assurance – that the IT product is conformant (or  not) to defined criteria.  As ISO/IEC 15408-3 states, assurance is gained by active investigation performed by an evaluator. This  includes the use of various techniques like:   analysis and checking of process(es) and procedure(s);   checking that process(es) and procedure(s) are being applied;   analysis of the correspondence between TOE design representations;   analysis of the TOE design representation against the requirements;   verification of proofs;   analysis of guidance documents;   analysis of functional tests developed and the results provided;   independent functional testing;   analysis for vulnerabilities (including flaw hypothesis);   penetration testing (i.e. finding and exploring vulnerabilities).  The ISO/IEC 15408 philosophy asserts that greater assurance results from the application of greater  evaluation effort. This increasing level of effort is based upon:  1. scope -- that is, the effort is greater because a larger portion of the IT product is included;  2. depth -- that is, the effort is greater because it is deployed to a finer level of design and  implementation detail;  3. rigour -- that is, the effort is greater because it is applied in a more structured, formal manner.  To structure all assurance requirements of every IT product subject to evaluation is described in formal  language of assurance classes, families and components.  It is beyond the scope of this paper to describe all assurance elements presented in ISO/IEC 15408-3 in  detail, but one should notice the least grained element i.e. assurance component - relevant to the IT  product - includes all information needed to perform an evaluation in the scope of such element:  a) Dependencies with other assurance components, either from the same family/class, or different  one;  b) Developer action elements:  i.e. set of actions is further qualified by evidential material referenced  in the following set of elements.  c) Content and presentation of evidence elements: i.e. the evidence required, what the evidence  shall demonstrate, and what information the evidence shall convey.  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  35  d) Evaluator action elements: i.e. a set of actions that explicitly includes confirmation that the  requirements prescribed in the content and presentation of evidence elements have been met. It  also includes explicit actions and analysis that shall be performed in addition to that already  performed by the developer. Implicit evaluator actions are also to be performed as a result of  developer action elements which are not covered by content and presentation of evidence  requirements.  An example of the assurance component and related actions on the evidence submitted is presented  in Table 18.  Table 18: AVA_VAN.1 assurance component presentation  The overall assurance of a given evaluation is expressed then by including building blocks in the form of the  relevant assurance components reflecting the scope, depth and rigour of the evaluation effort, as  described above. To make comparison among evaluated products easier ISO/IEC 15408-3 comes with  predefined assurance packages called ‘evaluation assurance level n’ (EALn),  n=1,....,7. The rule for the  EALn+1 is that it includes all assurance components of the EALn plus set of components representing  broader scope,  deeper or more rigorous approach to the evaluation than relevant components of the  EALn.  Evaluation process according to ISO/IEC TR 18045  There are direct relationships between ISO/IEC 15408-3 assurance structure (i.e. class, family, component  and element) and the structure of evaluation process as described in ISO/IEC TR 18045 (see Figure 7).  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  36  Figure 7: Structural relationships in the evaluation process (source: ISO/IEC 18045)  The ISO/IEC TR 18045 provides a description of evaluation process in terms of:  a) roles and responsibilities of the parties involved, and  b) a general evaluation model, as a direct consequence of relationships presented above.  The general model defines the following roles: sponsor, developer, evaluator and evaluation  Four distinct roles i.e. sponsor, developer, evaluator and evaluation authority13 are involved in the  evaluation process.  The sponsor is responsible for requesting and supporting an evaluation. This means that the sponsor  establishes the different agreements for the evaluation (e.g. commissioning the evaluation). The sponsor  ensures that the evaluator is provided with the evaluation evidence.  The developer produces the TOE and is responsible for providing the evidence required for the evaluation  (e.g. training, design information), on behalf of the sponsor. One should observe that these two roles are  not necessarily distinguishing each other in every evaluation. In simple instances (e.g. EAL1 evaluations) it  could be one person.  The evaluator performs the evaluation tasks required in the context of an evaluation: the evaluator  receives the evaluation evidence from the developer on behalf of the sponsor or directly from the sponsor,  13 ‘Evaluation authority’ can be called ‘certification body in specific contexts, see Chapter 2 for further details.  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  37  performs the evaluation sub-activities and provides the results of the evaluation assessment to the  evaluation authority.  The evaluation authority establishes and maintains the scheme, monitors the evaluation conducted by the  evaluator, and issues certification/validation reports as well as certificates based on the evaluation results  provided by the evaluator.  Each evaluation, whether of a PP (Protection Profile) or TOE (Target of Evaluation) with its ST (Security  Target), follows the same general model, and has four evaluator tasks in common: the input task, the  output task, the evaluation sub-activities, and the demonstration of the technical competence to the  evaluation authority task.  The input task and the output tasks are related to management of evaluation evidence and to report  generation, respectively.  Every evaluation sub-activity is performed with respect to an ISO/IEC 15408-3-mapped evaluator action  element (explicit or implied) and ends with the evaluator verdict as a result of the corresponding  evaluation. An initial state of the verdict is ‘inconclusive’, and can be changed into ‘pass’ or fail’ after the  sub-activity is completed. If all conditions for completing the evaluator action element are not fulfilled, the  verdict remains as ‘inconclusive’. An overall verdict is ‘pass’ if only if all partial verdicts are ‘pass’ as well.  The demonstration of the technical competence to the evaluation authority task may be fulfilled by the  evaluation authority analysis of the output tasks results, or may include the demonstration by the  evaluators of their understanding of the inputs for the evaluation sub-activities. This task ends with the  evaluator authority verdict.  This description of evaluation process is summarized in the action flow and presented using BPMN 2.0  notation (see  Figure 8 below).  Figure 8: The evaluation process according to ISO/IEC TR 18045  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  38  Requirements for laboratories operating in international schemes  5.3.1 CCRA  An Arrangement on the Recognition of Common Criteria Certificates In the field of Information Technology  Security (CCRA)14 imposes several requirements on the laboratories (called here ‘Evaluation Facilities’). In  general, laboratories shall be:   either accredited by relevant accreditation body in accordance with ISO/IEC 17025, or   established under the laws, statutory instruments, or other official administrative procedures valid  in the country concerned.  In both cases, common requirements apply, as specified in one of the Annexes15 of CCRA. In particular, the  laboratory shall be licensed or otherwise approved by the Certification Body. Furthermore, the Evaluation  Facility also has to demonstrate that it is technically competent in the specific field of IT security evaluation  and that it is compliant with the rules of the scheme concerned.  Finally, the CCRA states each scheme can establish its own requirements in relation to security, personnel  training and operating procedures. Differences among schemes with regard to requirements for  laboratories are discussed in Chapter 4.  Apart from the arrangement itself, CCDB16 publishes supportive documents, mandatory for use by the  laboratories, which include requirements for the evaluator’s activities in specific areas of evaluation such  as Stateful Traffic Filter Firewalls or Integrated Circuits. Full list of supportive documents (SDs) is presented  in the CCRA official web site17.  5.3.2 SOGIS-MRA  This arrangement provides the same general requirements for laboratories as the CCRA. However, due to  narrower scope of operation than CCRA, and higher requirements with regard to assurance, there are  additional obligations imposed on laboratories.  These obligations are described in two documents:   Minimum ITSEF Requirements for Security Evaluations of Smart cards and similar devices18,   Minimum ITSEF Requirements for Security Evaluations of Hardware Devices with Security Boxes19.  The first document contains several requirements concerning:  o basic and detailed knowledge and experience of evaluators in several areas related to Integrated  circuit (IC) technology, including: the IC design and production processes, security of IC devices and  14 https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/CCRA%20-%20July%202,%202014%20- %20Ratified%20September%208%202014.pdf  15 namely, Annex B.3 Accreditation and Licensing of Evaluation Facilities  16 CCDB – Common Criteria Development Board manages the technical work program for the maintenance and  ongoing development of the CC and CEM and reach agreement on the application of the CC and CEM to evaluations.  17 https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/cc/#supporting  18 https://www.sogis.org/uk/supporting_doc_en.html  19 This document is not publicly available  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  39  the environment they are operating, hardware physical and software-related attack techniques  that could compromise a secure IC, cryptography techniques used in the ICs,  o the evaluators’ ability to use dedicated hardware and software tools to perform attacks against the  IC components, and further to analyse the data gathered as a result of data-capture and signal  processing procedures.  Additionally, the document lists types of equipment indispensable for performing specific attacks against  the ICs and similar devices, and discuss the way the laboratory can use them. Furthermore, it describes  required capabilities of the laboratory to perform composite evaluations of software and hardware of the  product, in terms of tools and necessary equipment.  Finally, the document contains basic requirements to the organization of the evaluations and use of  subcontractors.  The second document discusses similar topics but in relation to another technical domain ie. hardware  devices with security boxes (sometimes called ‘hardware security modules’ - HSM). It includes specific  requirements with regard to:   the evaluators,  in terms of their skills and experience i.e:  o basic knowledge in the area of electricity and chemistry,  o detailed knowledge and experience of design principles of integrated circuits,  microcontroller architecture, functionality and packaging, several attack techniques  against the hardware and programmable micro-controllers, cryptographic algorithms and  random number generators,  o ability to use the equipment to perform independent tests and attacks.   the laboratory unrestricted access to dedicated facilities such as  o environment control equipment (e.g. to control communication, voltage, clock and  temperature)  o chemical and mechanical lab equipment (i.e. for sample preparation and analysis)  o imaging equipment (e.g. cameras, microscopes)  o logical test tools (e.g. for interface testing, vulnerability scanning, operating system testing,  randomness analysis, source code analysis, circuit layout analysis, fuzzing tools)   the laboratory organization for evaluations, in term of the use of bespoken equipment, directly or  by subcontracting.  Additionally, it should be noted there are several detailed supporting documents for evaluations,  mandatory to use for laboratories under the SOGIS MRA. These are listed in Table 199.

Consequently, specific and detailed knowledge, skills and experiences are  expected from evaluators in these areas as well.  Several standards which support the evaluation methodology as described in ISO/IEC TR 18045, in  particular for vulnerability assessments, are listed in Table 200.

According to the Commission Implementing Decision No 650/2016 laying down standards for the security  assessment of qualified signature and seal creation devices (...)22, ISO/IEC 15408, part 1-3, and ISO/IEC  18045 are designated as the reference documents for the security assessment of information technology  products that apply to the certification of qualified electronic signature creation devices or qualified  electronic seal creation devices. Further, the decision refers to multi-part European Standard EN 419211  Protection profiles for secure signature creation device, containing subjects for evaluations and subsequent  certifications ie. Protection Profiles for relevant electronic signature/electronic seal devices (see Table  221).  20 Based on the ISO/IEC JTC1/SC27 Programme of Work, document not publicly available  21 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG  22 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016D0650  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  42  EN 419211 PART EUROPEAN STANDARD TITLE  EN 419211-1:2014 Overview  EN 419211-2:2013 Device with key generation  EN 419211-3:2013 Device with key import  EN 419211-4:2013  Extension for device with key generation and trusted channel to certificate generation  application  EN 419211-5:2013  Extension for device with key generation and trusted channel to signature creation  application  EN 419211-6:2014  Extension for device with key import and trusted channel to signature creation  application  Table 221: European Standards referenced in the Commission Implementation Decision no 650/2016  There are other European Standards, not referenced in the Decision 650/2016, which are relevant for  performing security evaluations of  electronic signature related devices such as these included in Table 22.

Practices of laboratories  Typical processes and timeframes for evaluation  The evaluation according to Common Criteria usually happens in a typical ping-pong run. The developer  provides evidence to the evaluation laboratory that the product (the Target of Evaluation, to be more  precise) meets certain requirements as determined in the Security Target documentation; the laboratory  reviews and tests the evidence and provides feedback to the developer. Relevant documentation and the  TOE itself are revised and the process starts over.  Evaluations are typically organized by examining several assurance classes separately. This means that the  following areas of an evaluation are addressed one after the other:   The Security Target specification   The Design Documentation (Class ADV)   The Guidance Documentation (Class AGD)   The Life-Cycle Documentation (Class ALC)   Testing and Vulnerability Analysis (Class ATE and AVA)  In the context of the international recognition of the criteria and the overall complexity of the Target of  Evaluation, some of the documentation to be provided for an evaluation can get complex. In this context,  it is common that the evaluation/testing of a certain piece of information or its revision takes several  weeks rather than few days.  The overall timeframe that needs to be planned for an evaluation depends on the following factors (in that  order):   The chosen Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL). The basis for the estimations is the list of work units  from [ISO18045] that relate to the chosen EAL.   The complexity of the Target of Evaluation   The experience of the developer   The experience of the lab and   the maturity of the criteria  The question of the overall timeframe of an evaluation is hard to answer but the following lists should  provide a first overview:  Timeframes after EAL:   EAL 1,2,3: evaluations typically can take less than 6 months   EAL 4: evaluations are typically planned in a timeframe of a year   EAL 5 and above: 1 1/2 years and above  In this context, it should be noted that the listed timeframes should just be taken as examples based on  the experience of the editors. Timeframes vary significantly from scheme to scheme and are even  restricted by some schemes (e.g. in the US).  Timeframe considering the complexity of the product:   Simple products: See above  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  44   Products of medium complexity: add 10-20%   Complex products: add 50 % or more  The experience of the developer plays a very important part regarding the schedule of an evaluation. A  well experienced developer can easily cut the timeframes that have been mentioned before even by half,  specifically if a predecessor version of the product already has been certified. On the other hand, novices  in the field of Common Criteria, are well advised to allow some extra time in their schedule.  The experience of the evaluation laboratory and the maturity of the evaluation criteria are two influencing  factors that are less often discussed. Even though, no reliable data exists for this question, empirical  observations lead to the conclusion that the experience of the laboratory has  significant impact on the  timeframe of an evaluation. This does not only refer to the experience of the laboratory in general  (meaning how many evaluations a laboratory has carried out) but it specifically refers to the experience of  the laboratory with respect to similar products. As an example: A laboratory that has already performed  evaluations of firewalls according to a certain Protection Profile will have a significant advantage for  evaluations in this area (even over other labs that are more experienced in general but have less specific  experience).  Last, but not least, the maturity of the criteria is an important aspect. This does not relate to the maturity  of the Common Criteria itself but relates more to the maturity of dedicated Protection Profiles,  interpretations and guidance documents. Specifically, when these criteria are used for the first time,  evaluations usually take significantly longer.  Operational procedures  Operational procedures for working in a laboratory should be seen in different contexts as follows:   Working as an evaluator   Working as a lead/senior evaluator   Managing a laboratory  The work of an evaluator comprises the review of the documentation that has been provided by the  developer as well as tests and vulnerability assessment of the product itself. In larger laboratories, it is  common that evaluators specialize in certain aspects of evaluation procedures. Even though it is usually  the case that evaluators are capable to conduct all aspects of an evaluation, they often focus on certain  aspects of an evaluation in their daily work.  From the evaluator perspective, the daily work is characterized by the four-eyes principle that is inherent  to the Common Criteria requirements in many different places. Every step of work that is performed by the  evaluator is typically reviewed by at least one competent co-worker. The extensive amount of reviews and  checks facilitates the high quality of the evaluation procedures according to Common Criteria.  Every evaluation is led by a senior/lead evaluator. The work in such role usually includes strict and active  supervision of the evaluator but is augmented by aspects of project management and customer relations.  The senior evaluator should be a well experienced professional and therewith is the first point of contact  for all evaluators in a project if questions arise. Also, it is typical that sensitive decisions and test results  that potentially have an impact on entire evaluation are discussed and double-checked with the  senior/lead evaluator.  The senior/lead evaluator overlooks the entire project and also consider the effect of a technical decision  on the overall project schedule and budget. Also, senior/lead evaluators usually are responsible for  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  45  contacting customers, establishing modes of co-operation, leading milestone meeting and similar  activities.  The manager of the laboratory oversees all evaluation processes which are conducted in that laboratory.  With respect to the evaluation processes themselves, the lab manager represents another level of  escalation. If a technical dispute among evaluators (or between evaluators and the developer or sponsor)  comes up, the lab manager can be involved. However, in a large number of laboratories, the position of a  lab manager is seen as a management position rather than a technical one. This means that a lab manager  does not necessarily have the technical background and knowledge to discuss all technical issues. The  primary focus of the lab manager in daily life is:   to ensure that the laboratory follows all regulations,   to ensure that new interpretations and information about the Common Criteria are circulated  amongst all evaluators and utilized during evaluations,   to communicate with the certification and accreditation authorities in all substantial issues with  regard to the accreditation of licensing of laboratory.  Capacity and capabilities  Gaining an overview of the capabilities of all evaluation laboratories in Europe that work in the area of  Common Criteria is not an easy task. The main reasons for this are:  1) There is no obligation for a certification or evaluation authority to report on finished  certification.  2) Evaluations can remain unreported for a variety of reasons as such:  a. The evaluation fails,  b. The evaluation is performed in the context of confidential project (e.g. a project with  military scope or a classified project, in general)  3) The primary, central source for certifications under www.commoncriteriaportal.org often  remains obsolete.  The analysis in this chapter is based on the information as published on www.commoncriteriaportal.org  and augmented by the knowledge of the experts who authored this report.  By the time this report has been prepared (November 2017) a total of 1864 certificates have been  reported under www.commoncriteriaportal.org by European laboratories.  Over the last few years, the numbers are as follows:   2016: 83 certificates   2015: 147 certificates   2014: 163 certificates  When looking at these numbers, one should keep in mind that quite a few of these products the  certificates are granted to, have actually been re-certified.  The following table shows, how the certificates in 2014-2016 are distributed over the European countries  that issue certificates:  http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/ http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/ http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  46  2014 2015 2016 TOTAL  Germany 62 46 11 878  Spain 7 7 8 80  France 75 57 57 777  Italy 1 8 3 21  thNetherlands 5 12  45  Sweden 6 7 3 21  UK 7 10 1 41  Table 23: Number of certificates per country 2014-2016  The following figures show how the published certificates are distributed among the various classes of  products (the most populated categories shown for clarity of presentation).  Figure 9: Number of certificates by category  It becomes immediately obvious that the vast majority of certificates are issued for smart cards and similar  devices.  If one filters out the smart card related certificates (see Figure 10) and repeats the analysis, the next top 3  are not so obvious as they change over the years. However, it’s probably fair to say that the next most  popular categories for certification are databases, products for digital signatures and network devices.  Overview of ICT certification laboratories  Final  |  v1.1  |  January 2018  47  Figure 10: Numbers of certificates by category w/o smart cards  Personnel  A plethora of requirements that have to be met by the personal are covered by the criteria as introduced  previously. In this context, it falls into the responsibility of the certification body to ensure that evaluation  labs meet the requirements. This includes competence requirements for evaluators. In this context, some  certification authorities also have documented criteria that summarize the requirements.  While developing this report, investigation has also been performed with respect to the question, how the  various schemes address the requirements on personnel. The outcome of this investigation can be found  in Table 22  COUNTRY  CERTIFICATION BODY  (CB)  PRIVATE  COMPANY  EVALUATION  FACILITY (EF)  NAME  REQUIREMENTS FOR EVALUATORS  UK  National Cyber Security  Centre (NCSC)  Commercial  Evaluation  Facility (CLEF)  Commercial  Evaluation  Facility  (CLEF)  3 levels of qualification: Trainee evaluator  (successful training, which is APPROVED by  the CB and CONDUCTED by a Qualified  Evaluator [or Specialist if appropriate field]);  Qualified evaluator (a Trainee Evaluator who  has been assessed by the CB to be capable of  evaluation work w/o supervision; Specialist  evaluator (assessed as Qualified for some  subset of the CC Assurance Classess, for  others he/she is equivalent to a Trainee).

In order to facilitate a harmonization of the requirements in this context, ISO/IEC  SC27 WG3 has started a project in this area. The three-part standard ISO/IEC 19896-1,2,3 Information  technology — Security techniques — Competence requirements for information security testers and  evaluators comprises the following parts   Part 1 introduces the general concept and some general requirements   Part 2 specifies Knowledge, skills and effectiveness requirements for ISO/IEC 19790 testers   Part 3 specifies Knowledge, skills and effectiveness requirements for ISO/IEC 15408 (Common  Criteria) evaluators  The international standardization of these requirements in the context of ISO will lead to a further  harmonization of the competence requirements for evaluators in different fields that will - in the end -also  help to improve the quality and comparability of evaluations in general.

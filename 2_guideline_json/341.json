These devices are typically used by malicious actors to conduct  Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks   . Operating in a peer-to-peer  (P2P) 1  mode or from a Command and Control (C2) 2  center, botnets are  remotely controlled by a malicious actor to operate in a synchronised  way to obtain a certain result. 3  Technological advancements in distributed computing and automation  have created an opportunity for malicious actors to explore new  techniques and improve their tools and attack methods. Thanks to this,  botnets operate in much more distributed and automated ways and are  available from self-service and ready-to-use providers.  Malicious bots, referred as ‘bad bots’, are not only constantly evolving but  people’s skillsets and the bots’ level of development are becoming highly  specialised in certain applications, such as defence-providers or even  evasions techniques. 4  From a different perspective, botnets provide a  vector for cybercriminals to launch various operations from e-banking  fraud to ransomware   , mining cryptocurrencies and DDoS attacks. 5  2  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/etl-review-folder/etl-2020-denial-of-service etl-2020-ransomware  3  __Findings  7,7_million IoT devices are connected  to the Internet every day Of these, 1 in 20 is estimated to be behind a firewall or similar  network security tools. 6  57%_increase in the number of Mirai  variants detected during 2019 Although Mirai variants are known to use brute-force attempts  predominantly for compromising IoT devices, there was an  increase in both brute-force (51%) and web exploitation (87%)  attempts during 2019. 7  300.000_notifications of Emotet  botnet traffic observed during 2019 This accounted for over 100.000 more victim alerts than same  period in 2018. Researchers believed that there was a 913%  increase in the number Emotet samples having compared the  second halve of 2018 and 2019. 7  60%_of new rival botnet activity is  associated with stealing credentials9  17.602_ fully functional botnet C2  servers found in 2019 71,5% increase compared with 2018.  5  4  Kill chain  Reconnaissance Weaponisation Delivery Exploitation  Step of Attack Workflow  Width of Purpose  5  Installation Command &  Control  Actions on  Objectives  Botnet  MORE INFORMATION  The Cyber Kill Chain® framework was developed by  Lockheed Martin, adapted from a military concept related  with the structure of an attack. To study a particular attack  vector, use this kill-chain diagram to map each step of the  process and reference the tools, techniques and  procedures used by the attacker.  https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html  6  Trends  _Bots are big money  Bots are facilitating brute-force capabilities by luring victims into buying  limited-edition items or items on promotional offers and subsequently  reselling them at a higher price. This fact was identified by analysing a job  posting in which the advertiser was looking for a software developer with  experience of evading security defences, creating bots with evasion  techniques (i.e. web scrapping, reCAPTCHA bypass, cookie generation, etc.)  and willing to pay US$ 15.000 (ca. €12.750) for the right candidate. 4  _The bricking Silexbot  During June 2019, a security researcher17 analysed a new bot sample  developed to disrupt the functionalities of insecure IoT devices. In other  words, this bot was designed to use known/default credentials of IoT  devices to log-in and subsequently kill the device by deleting network  configurations and adding an IP tables’ rule to drop all connections. On top  of the technical capabilities, an interesting point was the note left on the  malware   sample. The threat actor apologises for their activity and  explains their actions as a way of preventing mass exploitation of insecure  IoT devices to build botnets for malicious purposes. `  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/etl-review-folder/etl-2020-malware  7  _Necurs on the fall while Emotet rises  again  During January 2019, Necurs was observed moving into an amateur type  of spam campaign, which made researchers think that the malicious  actors behind it had a significant decrease in their skillset. 20  In contrast,  Emotet’s activity increased substantially since September 2019 and  continued surging towards the end of 2019, dropping unique compiled  binaries representing persistent delivery vector and communication  mechanisms. 7  An analysis revealed a sharp increase in the distribution of  Emotet by e-mail. 22  _Echobot and its growing threat vector  During June 2019, a security researcher identified an updated version of  Echobot. In this analysis, the researcher observed an x86 compiled sample  leading to attack vectors used by this Mirai variant in 26 different  incidents. 10  During August, another security researcher found an increase  in Echobot, exploiting 50 different vulnerabilities including the ‘command  injection over HTTP’ (CPAI-2016-0658 ). 25, 26  In December 2019, another  team detected an enhanced version of Echobot including 71 exploits. The  newly added exploits were targeting old and new vulnerabilities and had a  significant added capability of targeting Industrial Control System (ICS)  devices. This included companies and devices such as Mitsubishi, Citrix  NetScaler app-delivery controls, Barracuda web application firewall and  endpoint administration tools. 27  8  Trends  _Retadup, the Botnet behind Monero- Mining has fallen  Retadup was mostly active as the Monero-mining worm that developed  polymorphic capabilities. 23  It had infected Windows machines in Latin  America. This bot had capabilities raging from mining to deploying custom  code and downloaded files to the victims’ machines (it was also observed  distributing STOP ransomware 24  ). A security researcher started monitoring  the Retadup activity in March 2019 and noticed that the C2 protocol was  designed in a simple way. The team identified a flaw in the protocol that  enabled them to remove infections from the victim by taking over the C2  server. The infrastructure for this malicious activity was identified as being  mostly in France. The botnet was taken down with the collaboration of the  National Gendarmerie (France) and around 850.000 computers were  disinfected.  _Mirai is dead, long live Mirai  It might be because of the lack of skills and features in the original code  that Mirai and its variants still dominate in the botnet families, and more  than 20.000 unique samples were observed monthly during the first half  of 2019. These variants use different techniques for compromising IoTs,  from brute-forcing default hard-coded passwords to exploits. 6 There is  also a broad diversity of system architectures targeted by these variants  according to two security researchers. More statistics on Emotet activity  presented in Figure 1. 7,18  9  _The P2P Roboto botnet  Roboto’s activity was first observed during August 2019 by a security  research team as a P2P botnet program. The first sample captured was a  suspicious ELF file. During October the research team identified another  sample (ELF file) which turns out to be the downloader of the previous  sample. Upon further analysis, the research team discovered that Roboto  botnet can support seven function, namely reverse shell, self-deactivation,  process and network information gathering, bot information gathering,  executing URL specified files, DDoS attacks and running system attacks.  Interestingly, it seems that a DDoS attack is not its main use case according  to the researcher. Unlike other botnets, this bot was spreading by  exploiting the Webmin RCE vulnerability (CVE-2019-1507 28  ). 11  _Mozi, another DHT based botnet  Named after its propagation filename, Mozi has been identified as a brand  new DHT based botnet observed by a security researcher in September  2019. An initial analysis of the sample conducted by another security  researcher 38  identified it as Gafgyt. However, that was because the sample  partially reused the code from Gafgyt. This botnet spreads by using a  handful of exploits and exploiting weak passwords for telnet. Analysis of  its functionalities revealed that it could be capable of running DDoS  attacks, information gathering, executing and updating sample/payload  using a specified URL and executing commands. 29, 30  10  Trends  __Statistics on Emotet activity  Figure 1: Source: Spamhaus 5  Finding Statistic  Total number of ASn detected: 5.430  Total number of unique IPs detected: 120.764  Total countries participating: 193  Total emails sent: 10.935.346  Total distribution URLs: 4.726  Distinct RCPTs targeted: 8.052.961  1 1  “Technological  advancements in  distributed  computing and  automation have  created an  opportunity for  malicious actors to  explore new  techniques and  improve their tools  and attack  methods”  in ETL 2020  12  Findings  _Statistics and other relevant numbers  According to a security researcher, 7,7 million IoT devices are connected  to the Internet every day and only 1 in every 20 is estimated to be  behind a firewall or similar network security tool. 6  This estimation reveals  that IoT devices are still vulnerable and susceptible to exploitation by  cybersecurity threats such as Mirai.   During the first half of 2019, botnet activity and hosting C2 servers  increased substantially. 32  This increase represented 7% of all botnet  detections and 1,8% of C2s around the world. Financial services and  their customers was the sector most often targeted.   Thailand was the top country in terms of hosting C2 servers while  Malaysia came second followed by the Philippines, Singapore and  Indonesia.   Based on Interpol research, the Andromeda botnet was the most  dominant in terms of detection although it was dismantled in 2017. 33  Conficker 34  came second followed by Necurs 35  , Sality 36  and Gozi 37  .  During 2019, the number of Mirai variants detected increased by more  than 57% compared with 2018 as depicted in Figure 2.  Although Mirai variants are known to use brute-force attempts  predominantly for compromising IoT devices, during 2019 there was an  increase in both brute-force (51%) and web exploitation (87%) attempts.  13  __Mirai sample count  34,517  143,344  225,855  2017 2018 2019  0  50,000  100,000  150,000  200,000  250,000  Figure 2: Source: NETSCOUT 7  14  Findings  _Statistics and other relevant numbers   During 2019, a security researcher observed nearly 300.000 more  notifications of Emotet botnet traffic and over 100.000 more victim  alerts compared with the same period in 2018. The researcher believes  that there was a 913% increase in the number of Emotet samples  having compared the second halves of 2018 and 2019. 7,22   There was an increase in P2P botnet activity since Roboto and Mozi  became active. 8   Linux based botnets were responsible for almost 97,4% of attacks. 8   The highest share of botnets were registered in the United States  (58,33%) in Q4 2019. While this is an increase compared with Q3 2019  (47,55%), the total number of C2 servers almost halved. The United  Kingdom was is in fourth place and jumped to second place with  14,29%, while China maintained the same position at 9.52%. The most  significant decrease in C2 registered servers was in the Netherlands  (from 45% to ~1%). For more information about botnet C2 servers  distribution by country please consult Figure 3. 8   In 2019, LokiBot remained at the top of the list of credential stealing  bots with an increase in the number of C2 activity by 74% compared  with 2018. AZORult was in second position right behind LokiBot. 39   17.602 botnet C2 servers were live during 2019, representing a 71,5%  increase compared with 2018. 39  15  __Distribution of botnet C&C  servers by country  1.19%  1.19%  1.19%  1.19%  2.38%  3.57%  9.52%  14.29%  58.33%  5.95%  Hong Kong  Canada  Netherlands  Switzerland  Iran  Russia  China  United Kingdom  United States  Other  0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70%  Figure 3: Source: Kapersky 8  16  Attack vectors  _ The botnet attacks  According to a security researcher, in 2019, nearly 60% of new rival  botnet activity was associated with stealing credentials. As previously  mentioned, LokiBot is the most active in this area. In addition to the  credential-stealing activity, e-banking and financial fraud are other  areas where botnet’s presence is vast. Emotet and TrickBot are prime  examples of this activity with an updated model covering not only e-  banking fraud but also pay-per-install (PPI). 9  Moreover, Remote Access Trojans (RATs) were among the most used  tools in botnets C2 activities. During 2018, most of these activities were  associated with Adwind, but in 2019, its activity was reduced and  replaced by NanoCore. 5  Specific attack vectors were adopted in 2019. Botnets use various  attack vectors to reach their objectives. Infected machines or zombie  networks are created by exploiting common vulnerabilities with brute-  force and other common infection techniques. 10,11,12  Subsequently, the  botmaster is capable of providing a platform for different attacks  including the widespread spamming and malware campaign, stealing and  reusing credentials, crypto-mining and DDoS.  Another example of an attack vector used in a botnet attack is the ‘Triple  Threat’. In this technique, the targeted organisation is initially infected  with Emotet malware   . Then the Emotet malware delivers the TrickBot  Trojan, targeting and exploring sensitive information. If the information is  found and the targeted environment/network is in the attacker’s list, Ryuk  ransomware is delivered. 13  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/etl-review-folder/ETL2020 - Malware A4.pdf  17  __Number of botnet C2 servers observed  between 2014 and 2019  Source: Spamhaus5  7,314  8,480  7,314  9,500  10,263  17,602  2014  2015  2016  2017  2018  2019  0 5,000 10,000 15,000 20,000  18  Mitigation  _ Proposed actions  One key aspect of having a solid defence is the concept of knowing the  environment. This will help to identify malicious activity within the traffic  based on the possible baseline (i.e. behavioural detections) 14  measured  by a traffic monitoring tool. 4  Considering that substantial botnet traffic is  associated with DDoS activity, mitigation techniques for DDoS threat also  apply.   Deploy border gateway protocol feeds with the capability to look for  dTLDs (decentralised top-level domains) to block connections to IP  addresses related to botnet C2 activity. 8   Understand and categorise vulnerabilities and implement a strong  patching and updating practice. 15,16   Restrict or block cryptocurrency mining pools and monitor the  environment for required users. 5   Deploy challenge based capabilities for required websites to check the  origin of traffic (i.e reCAPTCHA). 16   Deploy strong password and authentication (2FA) policies on public-  facing servers or infrastructure to avoid being a victim of weak  password/authentication exploitation. 5   Deploy and configure network and application firewalls.  19  “The threat landscape  is becoming extremely  difficult to map.

    "original document": "ENISA ETL2020 - Botnet  From January 2019 to April 2020  Botnet ENISA Threat Landscape  EN  Overview  A botnet is a network of connected devices infected by bot malware.  These devices are typically used by malicious actors to conduct  Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks   . Operating in a peer-to-peer  (P2P) 1  mode or from a Command and Control (C2) 2  center, botnets are  remotely controlled by a malicious actor to operate in a synchronised  way to obtain a certain result. 3  Technological advancements in distributed computing and automation  have created an opportunity for malicious actors to explore new  techniques and improve their tools and attack methods. Thanks to this,  botnets operate in much more distributed and automated ways and are  available from self-service and ready-to-use providers.  Malicious bots, referred as ‘bad bots’, are not only constantly evolving but  people’s skillsets and the bots’ level of development are becoming highly  specialised in certain applications, such as defence-providers or even  evasions techniques. 4  From a different perspective, botnets provide a  vector for cybercriminals to launch various operations from e-banking  fraud to ransomware   , mining cryptocurrencies and DDoS attacks. 5  2  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/etl-review-folder/etl-2020-denial-of-service etl-2020-ransomware  3  __Findings  7,7_million IoT devices are connected  to the Internet every day Of these, 1 in 20 is estimated to be behind a firewall or similar  network security tools. 6  57%_increase in the number of Mirai  variants detected during 2019 Although Mirai variants are known to use brute-force attempts  predominantly for compromising IoT devices, there was an  increase in both brute-force (51%) and web exploitation (87%)  attempts during 2019. 7  300.000_notifications of Emotet  botnet traffic observed during 2019 This accounted for over 100.000 more victim alerts than same  period in 2018. Researchers believed that there was a 913%  increase in the number Emotet samples having compared the  second halve of 2018 and 2019. 7  60%_of new rival botnet activity is  associated with stealing credentials9  17.602_ fully functional botnet C2  servers found in 2019 71,5% increase compared with 2018.  5  4  Kill chain  Reconnaissance Weaponisation Delivery Exploitation  Step of Attack Workflow  Width of Purpose  5  Installation Command &  Control  Actions on  Objectives  Botnet  MORE INFORMATION  The Cyber Kill Chain® framework was developed by  Lockheed Martin, adapted from a military concept related  with the structure of an attack. To study a particular attack  vector, use this kill-chain diagram to map each step of the  process and reference the tools, techniques and  procedures used by the attacker.  https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html  6  Trends  _Bots are big money  Bots are facilitating brute-force capabilities by luring victims into buying  limited-edition items or items on promotional offers and subsequently  reselling them at a higher price. This fact was identified by analysing a job  posting in which the advertiser was looking for a software developer with  experience of evading security defences, creating bots with evasion  techniques (i.e. web scrapping, reCAPTCHA bypass, cookie generation, etc.)  and willing to pay US$ 15.000 (ca. €12.750) for the right candidate. 4  _The bricking Silexbot  During June 2019, a security researcher17 analysed a new bot sample  developed to disrupt the functionalities of insecure IoT devices. In other  words, this bot was designed to use known/default credentials of IoT  devices to log-in and subsequently kill the device by deleting network  configurations and adding an IP tables’ rule to drop all connections. On top  of the technical capabilities, an interesting point was the note left on the  malware   sample. The threat actor apologises for their activity and  explains their actions as a way of preventing mass exploitation of insecure  IoT devices to build botnets for malicious purposes. `  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/etl-review-folder/etl-2020-malware  7  _Necurs on the fall while Emotet rises  again  During January 2019, Necurs was observed moving into an amateur type  of spam campaign, which made researchers think that the malicious  actors behind it had a significant decrease in their skillset. 20  In contrast,  Emotet’s activity increased substantially since September 2019 and  continued surging towards the end of 2019, dropping unique compiled  binaries representing persistent delivery vector and communication  mechanisms. 7  An analysis revealed a sharp increase in the distribution of  Emotet by e-mail. 22  _Echobot and its growing threat vector  During June 2019, a security researcher identified an updated version of  Echobot. In this analysis, the researcher observed an x86 compiled sample  leading to attack vectors used by this Mirai variant in 26 different  incidents. 10  During August, another security researcher found an increase  in Echobot, exploiting 50 different vulnerabilities including the ‘command  injection over HTTP’ (CPAI-2016-0658 ). 25, 26  In December 2019, another  team detected an enhanced version of Echobot including 71 exploits. The  newly added exploits were targeting old and new vulnerabilities and had a  significant added capability of targeting Industrial Control System (ICS)  devices. This included companies and devices such as Mitsubishi, Citrix  NetScaler app-delivery controls, Barracuda web application firewall and  endpoint administration tools. 27  8  Trends  _Retadup, the Botnet behind Monero- Mining has fallen  Retadup was mostly active as the Monero-mining worm that developed  polymorphic capabilities. 23  It had infected Windows machines in Latin  America. This bot had capabilities raging from mining to deploying custom  code and downloaded files to the victims’ machines (it was also observed  distributing STOP ransomware 24  ). A security researcher started monitoring  the Retadup activity in March 2019 and noticed that the C2 protocol was  designed in a simple way. The team identified a flaw in the protocol that  enabled them to remove infections from the victim by taking over the C2  server. The infrastructure for this malicious activity was identified as being  mostly in France. The botnet was taken down with the collaboration of the  National Gendarmerie (France) and around 850.000 computers were  disinfected.  _Mirai is dead, long live Mirai  It might be because of the lack of skills and features in the original code  that Mirai and its variants still dominate in the botnet families, and more  than 20.000 unique samples were observed monthly during the first half  of 2019. These variants use different techniques for compromising IoTs,  from brute-forcing default hard-coded passwords to exploits. 6 There is  also a broad diversity of system architectures targeted by these variants  according to two security researchers. More statistics on Emotet activity  presented in Figure 1. 7,18  9  _The P2P Roboto botnet  Roboto’s activity was first observed during August 2019 by a security  research team as a P2P botnet program. The first sample captured was a  suspicious ELF file. During October the research team identified another  sample (ELF file) which turns out to be the downloader of the previous  sample. Upon further analysis, the research team discovered that Roboto  botnet can support seven function, namely reverse shell, self-deactivation,  process and network information gathering, bot information gathering,  executing URL specified files, DDoS attacks and running system attacks.  Interestingly, it seems that a DDoS attack is not its main use case according  to the researcher. Unlike other botnets, this bot was spreading by  exploiting the Webmin RCE vulnerability (CVE-2019-1507 28  ). 11  _Mozi, another DHT based botnet  Named after its propagation filename, Mozi has been identified as a brand  new DHT based botnet observed by a security researcher in September  2019. An initial analysis of the sample conducted by another security  researcher 38  identified it as Gafgyt. However, that was because the sample  partially reused the code from Gafgyt. This botnet spreads by using a  handful of exploits and exploiting weak passwords for telnet. Analysis of  its functionalities revealed that it could be capable of running DDoS  attacks, information gathering, executing and updating sample/payload  using a specified URL and executing commands. 29, 30  10  Trends  __Statistics on Emotet activity  Figure 1: Source: Spamhaus 5  Finding Statistic  Total number of ASn detected: 5.430  Total number of unique IPs detected: 120.764  Total countries participating: 193  Total emails sent: 10.935.346  Total distribution URLs: 4.726  Distinct RCPTs targeted: 8.052.961  1 1  “Technological  advancements in  distributed  computing and  automation have  created an  opportunity for  malicious actors to  explore new  techniques and  improve their tools  and attack  methods”  in ETL 2020  12  Findings  _Statistics and other relevant numbers  According to a security researcher, 7,7 million IoT devices are connected  to the Internet every day and only 1 in every 20 is estimated to be  behind a firewall or similar network security tool. 6  This estimation reveals  that IoT devices are still vulnerable and susceptible to exploitation by  cybersecurity threats such as Mirai.   During the first half of 2019, botnet activity and hosting C2 servers  increased substantially. 32  This increase represented 7% of all botnet  detections and 1,8% of C2s around the world. Financial services and  their customers was the sector most often targeted.   Thailand was the top country in terms of hosting C2 servers while  Malaysia came second followed by the Philippines, Singapore and  Indonesia.   Based on Interpol research, the Andromeda botnet was the most  dominant in terms of detection although it was dismantled in 2017. 33  Conficker 34  came second followed by Necurs 35  , Sality 36  and Gozi 37  .  During 2019, the number of Mirai variants detected increased by more  than 57% compared with 2018 as depicted in Figure 2.  Although Mirai variants are known to use brute-force attempts  predominantly for compromising IoT devices, during 2019 there was an  increase in both brute-force (51%) and web exploitation (87%) attempts.  13  __Mirai sample count  34,517  143,344  225,855  2017 2018 2019  0  50,000  100,000  150,000  200,000  250,000  Figure 2: Source: NETSCOUT 7  14  Findings  _Statistics and other relevant numbers   During 2019, a security researcher observed nearly 300.000 more  notifications of Emotet botnet traffic and over 100.000 more victim  alerts compared with the same period in 2018. The researcher believes  that there was a 913% increase in the number of Emotet samples  having compared the second halves of 2018 and 2019. 7,22   There was an increase in P2P botnet activity since Roboto and Mozi  became active. 8   Linux based botnets were responsible for almost 97,4% of attacks. 8   The highest share of botnets were registered in the United States  (58,33%) in Q4 2019. While this is an increase compared with Q3 2019  (47,55%), the total number of C2 servers almost halved. The United  Kingdom was is in fourth place and jumped to second place with  14,29%, while China maintained the same position at 9.52%. The most  significant decrease in C2 registered servers was in the Netherlands  (from 45% to ~1%). For more information about botnet C2 servers  distribution by country please consult Figure 3. 8   In 2019, LokiBot remained at the top of the list of credential stealing  bots with an increase in the number of C2 activity by 74% compared  with 2018. AZORult was in second position right behind LokiBot. 39   17.602 botnet C2 servers were live during 2019, representing a 71,5%  increase compared with 2018. 39  15  __Distribution of botnet C&C  servers by country  1.19%  1.19%  1.19%  1.19%  2.38%  3.57%  9.52%  14.29%  58.33%  5.95%  Hong Kong  Canada  Netherlands  Switzerland  Iran  Russia  China  United Kingdom  United States  Other  0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70%  Figure 3: Source: Kapersky 8  16  Attack vectors  _ The botnet attacks  According to a security researcher, in 2019, nearly 60% of new rival  botnet activity was associated with stealing credentials. As previously  mentioned, LokiBot is the most active in this area. In addition to the  credential-stealing activity, e-banking and financial fraud are other  areas where botnet’s presence is vast. Emotet and TrickBot are prime  examples of this activity with an updated model covering not only e-  banking fraud but also pay-per-install (PPI). 9  Moreover, Remote Access Trojans (RATs) were among the most used  tools in botnets C2 activities. During 2018, most of these activities were  associated with Adwind, but in 2019, its activity was reduced and  replaced by NanoCore. 5  Specific attack vectors were adopted in 2019. Botnets use various  attack vectors to reach their objectives. Infected machines or zombie  networks are created by exploiting common vulnerabilities with brute-  force and other common infection techniques. 10,11,12  Subsequently, the  botmaster is capable of providing a platform for different attacks  including the widespread spamming and malware campaign, stealing and  reusing credentials, crypto-mining and DDoS.  Another example of an attack vector used in a botnet attack is the ‘Triple  Threat’. In this technique, the targeted organisation is initially infected  with Emotet malware   . Then the Emotet malware delivers the TrickBot  Trojan, targeting and exploring sensitive information. If the information is  found and the targeted environment/network is in the attacker’s list, Ryuk  ransomware is delivered. 13  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/etl-review-folder/ETL2020 - Malware A4.pdf  17  __Number of botnet C2 servers observed  between 2014 and 2019  Source: Spamhaus5  7,314  8,480  7,314  9,500  10,263  17,602  2014  2015  2016  2017  2018  2019  0 5,000 10,000 15,000 20,000  18  Mitigation  _ Proposed actions  One key aspect of having a solid defence is the concept of knowing the  environment. This will help to identify malicious activity within the traffic  based on the possible baseline (i.e. behavioural detections) 14  measured  by a traffic monitoring tool. 4  Considering that substantial botnet traffic is  associated with DDoS activity, mitigation techniques for DDoS threat also  apply.   Deploy border gateway protocol feeds with the capability to look for  dTLDs (decentralised top-level domains) to block connections to IP  addresses related to botnet C2 activity. 8   Understand and categorise vulnerabilities and implement a strong  patching and updating practice. 15,16   Restrict or block cryptocurrency mining pools and monitor the  environment for required users. 5   Deploy challenge based capabilities for required websites to check the  origin of traffic (i.e reCAPTCHA). 16   Deploy strong password and authentication (2FA) policies on public-  facing servers or infrastructure to avoid being a victim of weak  password/authentication exploitation. 5   Deploy and configure network and application firewalls.  19  “The threat landscape  is becoming extremely  difficult to map.

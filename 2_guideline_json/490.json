The current version of this  document is an updated version of the one published in March 2016.  The Network and Information Security (NIS) Platform1 was created in 2013 to help European stakeholders  carry out appropriate risk management, establish good cyber security policies and processes and further  adopt standards and solutions that will improve the ability to create safer market conditions for the EU. All  this was brought to life as a contribution to the implementation of the Cyber Security Strategy of the EU2.  This document is an input for the NIS Platform for the discussion on incident response and cyber crisis  coordination.  The document focuses on incident response: it briefly introduces what incident response is, who the main  actors are, what baseline capabilities these entities should possess in order to effectively combat cyber- attacks, and what challenges there may be that impede efficiency in incident response. The notion of  Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) as key players in incident response is introduced.  Descriptions of incident response mechanisms will be elaborated, taking into account national-level cyber  security strategies, cyber crisis coordination and management covering both escalation and  communication between CSIRTs and government bodies.  The core material of the document was developed based on previous work undertaken by ENISA in the  field of CSIRTs and Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) and resilience. The main topics used  as input for this document cover the following:   findings and recommendations published under the baseline capabilities of CSIRTs and a brief  description of incident response mechanisms;   work done in the field of national cyber security strategies with special regard to implementation and  evaluation of these strategies;   aspects of cyber crisis cooperation and management focusing on escalation mechanisms and ways of  further enhancing crisis cooperation mechanisms, such as mutual aid, training and exercising and  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).  Some challenges will be raised on the typical issues that slow the incident response mechanisms, and to  address these challenges, ways of enhancing incident handling cooperation will be provided.  1 Information on NIS Platform - https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/nis-platform  2 High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Joint Communication on the  Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace, JOIN(2013) 1 final, 07 February  2013 - http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/nis-platform http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf  Strategies for Incident Response and Cyber Crisis Cooperation  PUBLISHED  |  Version 1.1  |  AUGUST 2016  05  1. Overview and scope of the document  The Network and Information Security (NIS) Platform3 was created in 2013 to help European stakeholders  carry out appropriate risk management, establish good cyber security policies and processes and further  adopt standards and solutions that will improve the ability to create safer market conditions for the EU.  The expert work of the NIS Platform was divided into Working Groups (WGs), all dealing with their special  field of expertise in cyber security. The following WGs were established:  1) WG1 on risk management, including information assurance, risks metrics and awareness raising;  2) WG2 on information exchange and incident coordination, including incident reporting and risks  metrics for the purpose of information exchange;  3) WG3 on secure ICT research and innovation.  WG2 has been established to promote the sharing of cyber threat information and incident coordination in  both the public and private sectors in the EU. It aims to identify requirements and issue recommendations  on sharing cyber threat information as well as appropriate incident management processes in order to  better prevent and best respond to cyber incidents.  WG2 also investigates the feasibility and needs to address the ability of an organisation to share cyber  threat information and to utilize a standard incident management process. This covers both public and  private organisations, and all industry verticals within the private sector, with special focus on Critical  National Infrastructures (CNIs).  The foreseen work by WG2 will be a series of deliverables (Chapters) to be adopted by the NIS Platform,  identifying cyber security good practices, as an implementation of the Cyber Security Strategy of the EU  published in 20134. Incident response and cyber crisis coordination will be encompassed in Chapter 4 of  these deliverables.  The Chapters foreseen by the three WGs are:   Chapter 1: Organisational structures and requirements;   Chapter 2: Verification and auditing of requirements;   Chapter 3: Voluntary information sharing;   Chapter 4: Incident response (current document is prepared as an input for this deliverable);   Chapter 5: Mandatory incident notification;   Chapter 6: Data protection;   Chapter 7: [Optional] Incentives for the uptake of good cyber security practices;   Chapter 8: [Optional] Recommendations on research challenges and opportunities.  In addition to the Chapter on incident response (Chapter 4), WG2 will also be responsible for delivering the  chapters on voluntary information sharing (Chapter 3), mandatory incident notification (Chapter 5) and  data protection (Chapter 6).  3 Information on NIS Platform - https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/nis-platform  4 https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:27035:ed-1:v1:en  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/nis-platform https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:27035:ed-1:v1:en  Strategies for Incident Response and Cyber Crisis Cooperation  PUBLISHED  |  Version 1.1  |  AUGUST 2016  06  The content of this document, which has been compiled as an input for Chapter 4, was developed based  on ENISA’s previous work in the field of Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) and the  resilience of critical information infrastructures. The notion of CSIRTs will be introduced. Descriptions of  incident response mechanisms will be elaborated, taking into account national cyber security strategies, on  how incident response is structured in Member States – covering both escalation and communication  between CSIRTs and government bodies.  This document focuses on incident response: how main incident response capabilities tie in with incident  response mechanisms to potentially cover the cyber security landscape of a Member State.  This document does not go into details on the various aspects mentioned above as it aims to give a  compact overview. However, in case of further interest, references to available literature on the aspects  are provided in footnotes and in the Appendix.  Strategies for Incident Response and Cyber Crisis Cooperation  PUBLISHED  |  Version 1.1  |  AUGUST 2016  07  2. Basics of incident response  An information security incident can be defined as a “single or a series of unwanted or unexpected  information security events that have a significant probability of compromising business operations and  threatening information security”5, while a cyber security incident can be defined as “an IT disruption that  limits or eliminates the expected availability of services, and/or is the unauthorized publication, acquisition  and/or modification of information” 6. A cyber security incident can involve a real or suspected breach or  the unlawful act of exploiting vulnerability. Typical incidents include the introduction of malware into a  network, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, unauthorised alteration of software or hardware  and identity theft of individuals or institutions. Hacking in general can be considered a security incident  unless the perpetrators have been deliberately hired for the specific purpose of testing a computer or  network for vulnerabilities.  Incident response and management is the protection of an organisation's information by developing and  implementing an incident response process (e.g. plans, defined roles, training, communications,  management oversight) in order to quickly discover an attack and then effectively contain the damage,  eradicate the attacker's presence, and restore the integrity of the network and systems.7  The term 'constituency' is used to refer to the customer base or the served group of users of a CSIRT. A  single customer is a ‘constituent’; a group is called ‘constituents’.  A Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) is an organisation that receives reports of security  breaches, conducts analyses of the reports and responds to the senders. A CSIRT may be an established  group or an ad hoc group of experts. Other widely accepted terms exist for CSIRTs, such as CERT  (Computer Emergency Response Team), IRT (Incident Response Team), CIRT (Computer Incident Response  Team) or SERT (Security Emergency Response Team). For a comprehensive list of CSIRTs in Europe, ENISA  regularly updates an inventory of European CSIRTs8, and Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams  (FIRST)9 and Trusted Introducer (TI)10 have public links to their global members as well.  There are various types of CSIRTs. Dedicated incident response teams or CSIRTs may operate as part of a  parent organisation, such as within a government, a corporation, a university or a research network.  National and governmental CSIRTs, for example, oversee incident handling for an entire country or parts of  its critical infrastructure. Typically, CSIRTs rely on information coming from within the organisation’s  information systems and act on an ad hoc basis in the event of a security incident.

Sectoral, national or governmental CSIRTs oversee and act upon network activities of larger sectors or  critical infrastructures. The basic types of service covered by a typical CSIRT will be elaborated upon in the  ‘incident response capabilities’ section.  CSIRTs also provide proactive services, such as alerts and warnings or end-user security training, besides  responding to incidents.  Regardless of the type of CSIRT, one of the main powers of CSIRTs lies in the fact that they can effectively  assist in mitigating incidents on a technical level in a relatively short time. Since attacks on the internet are  borderless, the countermeasures involve cross-border cooperation between CSIRTs. To facilitate this  cooperation, several international and regional CSIRT communities and initiatives have been formed over  the past twenty years. Involvement in the following CSIRT communities is strongly advised for CSIRTs,  including national and governmental CSIRTs:  TF-CSIRT (Task Force of Computer Security Incident Response Teams): this provides a forum where  members of the CSIRT community can exchange experiences and knowledge in a trusted environment in  order to improve cooperation and coordination. It maintains a system for registering and accrediting  CSIRTs, as well as certifying service standards. The task force also develops and provides services for  CSIRTs, promotes the use of common standards and procedures for handling security incidents, and  coordinates joint initiatives where appropriate. This includes the training of CSIRT staff, and assisting in the  establishment and development of new CSIRTs. (http://www.terena.nl/tech/task-forces/tf-csirt)  TI (Trusted Introducer): this forms the trusted backbone of infrastructure services and serves as a  clearinghouse for all security and incident response teams. It lists well-known teams and performs  accreditation and certification of teams according to their demonstrated and checked level of maturity. For  a CSIRT to proceed from the status of ‘listed’ to the status of ‘accredited’, it needs to go through a  formalised accreditation scheme. Once ‘accredited’, the CSIRT can gain access to the restricted TI  repository where details of fellow accredited CSIRTs can be found, along with several value-added services  such as readily downloadable contact lists and PGP-Keyrings, secure discussion forum, automatic RIPE  Database IRT-object registration and more. (https://www.trusted-introducer.org/)  There is an on-going process to better integrate TF-CSIRT and TI to establish a unified European group with  a recognizable membership and to improve coordination and use of staff resources, as well as to establish  a more direct relationship between CSIRTs and the TF-CSIRT leadership12, which will happen under the  structure of GÉANT, formerly TERENA (Trans-European Research and Education Networking Association)13.  FIRST (Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams): this is a premier organisation and a recognized  global leader in incident response. Membership in FIRST enables incident response teams to more  effectively respond to security incidents by providing access to best practices, tools, and trusted  communication with member teams. (http://www.first.org)  EGC (European Government CERTs group): this is an informal group of several governmental CSIRTs that is  developing effective cooperation on incident response matters between its members, building upon the  11 http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/Computer-Security-Incident-Response-Team-CSIRT  12 https://www.terena.org/activities/tf-csirt/publications/restructuring.pdf  13 TERENA (http://www.terena.org/) and DANTE joined forces in October 2014 to become GÉANT Association. From 1  May 2015, the organisation changed its logo and its name to simply 'GÉANT'.

EGC is a closed  group of CSIRTs that only allows European governmental CSIRTs among its members on the basis of  invitation. (http://www.egc-group.org)  CSIRT network: the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive14, adopted in July 2016, foresees the  establishment, also with the support of ENISA, of the CSIRTs network to ensure effective cooperation from  all Member States. Article 12 of this directive indeed provides that: “In order to contribute to the  development of confidence and trust between the Member States and to promote swift and effective  operational cooperation, a network of the national CSIRTs is hereby established. […] The CSIRTs network  shall be composed of representatives of the Member States' CSIRTs and CERT-EU. The Commission shall  participate in the CSIRTs network as an observer. ENISA shall provide the secretariat and shall actively  support the cooperation among the CSIRTs.”  Before the adoption of the NIS Directive, ENISA had formed and is still managing a network of national  and/or governmental CSIRTs in Europe. The Agency reaches out to this network via a mailing list to keep  the network up to date on its activities. ENISA relies heavily on the input from this network when it is  publishing studies. Many experts from this network have been members of expert groups organised by  ENISA, and have been interviewed or have responded to questionnaires. The network is a key input for the  work ENISA is doing in this field. ENISA’s ‘CERTs in Europe’ workshops have been organised since 2005 for  the national and governmental CSIRTs in Europe as an efficient and indispensable method for ENISA in  supporting the teams in improving their capabilities. In 2011, ENISA started to collaborate with Europol to  focus on CSIRT cooperation with law enforcement. From 2012, the annual ENISA workshop was split into  two parts, one part that aimed only at national and governmental CSIRTs and retained a technical focus,  and the other part aimed at both national and governmental CSIRTs and law enforcement representatives,  organised together with Europol. These workshops are particularly important as a forum for information  sharing.  2.1 A brief overview of incident response capabilities  ENISA started its stocktaking of CSIRT capabilities in Europe in 2009. The outcome of this activity was the  first document on baseline capabilities for national and governmental CSIRTs, focusing on operational  aspects15. A follow-up to this was a second document on baseline capabilities focusing on policy  recommendations in 201016. ENISA updated its considerations for the capabilities of national and  governmental CSIRTs in 201217. Although these capabilities are generally valid for all types of CSIRTs,  attention was specifically given to national and governmental CSIRTs in order to align them with the  recommendations laid down in the EU Cyber Strategy. The four baseline capabilities were redefined as  14 Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 concerning measures for a  high common level of security of network and information systems across the Union, http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC  15 Baseline capabilities for national/governmental CERTs (Part 1: Operational Aspects), ENISA, 2009 -  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/files/baseline-capabilities-for-national-governmental- certs/at_download/fullReport  16 Baseline capabilities for national/governmental CERTs (Part 2: Policy recommendations), ENISA, 2010 -  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/files/baseline-capabilities-of-national-governmental-certs- policy-recommendations/at_download/fullReport  17 Baseline capabilities for national/governmental CERTs (Updated recommendations 2012), ENISA, 2012 -  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/files/updated-recommendations-2012/at_download/fullReport  http://www.egc-group.org/ http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/files/baseline-capabilities-for-national-governmental-certs/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/files/baseline-capabilities-for-national-governmental-certs/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/files/baseline-capabilities-of-national-governmental-certs-policy-recommendations/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/files/baseline-capabilities-of-national-governmental-certs-policy-recommendations/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/files/updated-recommendations-2012/at_download/fullReport  Strategies for Incident Response and Cyber Crisis Cooperation  PUBLISHED  |  Version 1.1  |  AUGUST 2016  10  ‘formal capability’, ‘operational-technical capability’, ‘operational-organisational capability’, and ‘co- operational capability’.  2.1.1 Formal capability18  This capability should make the official mandate of the national or governmental CSIRT clear. This mandate  should assume that the CSIRT will be the official national point of contact for incident response issues, or  act as the ’CSIRT of last resort’ in case of emergencies. With the designation of national point of contact,  the CSIRT should be the national representation at the international CSIRT communities.  This capacity should also provide proof of sustainable financial and other resources. Ideally, an existing  cyber security strategy (see later in chapter) should define the roles and responsibilities of the CSIRT, its  relationships with other national public and private stakeholders in the national cyber security landscape  and Incident Response (IR) practice. Generally, the main role of the national or governmental CSIRT should  be supporting the management of security incidents for systems and networks within its state’s borders.  2.1.2 Operational-technical capability19  The service portfolio of any national or governmental CSIRT should consist of the external services it  provides to its constituency and its internal support processes, when the CSIRT is part of a larger host  organisation.  There are four external service categories that cover the main CSIRT activities. Internal services might be,  for example, a good situational awareness, technical cyber security training for staff or participation in  various cyber security exercises (e.g. Cyber Europe Exercise).   Proactive services, which are aimed at improving the infrastructure and security processes of the  constituency before any incident or event occurs or is detected. The main goals are to prevent  incidents and reduce their impact and scope when they do occur.   Reactive services, which are aimed at responding to requests for assistance, reports of incidents  from the CSIRT constituency, and tackling threats or attacks against the CSIRT’s systems.   Other security management services, which are the common services designed to improve the  overall security of an organisation.   Optional (internal) services, covering the field of awareness-raising or cyber security training  within the host organisation.  In the context of core services for the constituency, a national or governmental CSIRT should provide  incident handling and management, be the designated national point of contact, and play a role in the  protection of Critical National Infrastructure (CNI).

Stakeholders  include operators, service providers, hardware and software providers, end-users, public bodies and  national governments, as well as peer organisations with similar responsibilities which require cross- border cooperation. Cooperation in each aspect involves a high level of trust between any participating  members in a cooperation model.  National or governmental CSIRTs bear the responsibility of incident coordination over (part of) a nation’s  critical information infrastructure, which requires prompt action against well-defined metrics. Although  incident types vary in the response required, service level agreements (SLAs) are a good basis to lay down  the expected actions and response times between the CSIRT and its constituents. This should also apply to  the national cooperation mechanisms between CSIRTS and local industry stakeholders.  Since cyberspace is borderless, large-scale incidents impact several nations. As covered above, a CSIRT  should have enhanced co-operational capability to be able to reach out to peer CSIRTs and act in a  coordinated manner. Cooperation in the international arena should also happen based on a voluntary  approach, where peer-CSIRTs share information and act in coordination based on the trust level they have  built. In the context of the NIS Directive, ENISA is to play a significant role in pan-European operational  coordination between national and governmental CSIRTs.  24 National/governmental CERTs; ENISA’s recommendations on baseline capabilities, ENISA, 2014, p.6 - https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/baseline-capabilities/national-governmental-certs-enisas- recommendations-on-baseline-capabilities/at_download/fullReport  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/baseline-capabilities/national-governmental-certs-enisas-recommendations-on-baseline-capabilities/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/baseline-capabilities/national-governmental-certs-enisas-recommendations-on-baseline-capabilities/at_download/fullReport  Strategies for Incident Response and Cyber Crisis Cooperation  PUBLISHED  |  Version 1.1  |  AUGUST 2016  13  3. Key challenges in incident response  In general, incident response carries the burden of remediating any breaches in IT security at an  organisation at micro level, or of a nation at macro level. A number of best practices exist to initiate or  safeguard the level of integrity in IT security, but there is always a gap between legislation and practice.  The current situation in the EU does not always provide the highest protection against NIS incidents and  risks across the EU. Existing NIS capabilities and mechanisms are simply insufficient to keep pace with the  fast-changing landscape of threats and to ensure a common high level of protection in all the EU Member  States. As a first step in aligning the NIS level Member States, incident response capabilities need to meet a  common minimum threshold level.  Currently, several cyber security incidents are cross border by nature but Member States do not  necessarily follow a harmonised approach when it comes to incident responses. However, there are  challenges that need to be addressed when discussing common incident response mechanisms within the  Member States. Having a regulatory framework and the required institutions in place will not  automatically resolve the ever growing cyber threats within the EU boundaries. What need to be taken  into consideration when assessing the incident response capabilities are, amongst others, the following  areas: human resources, processes and procedures, political and legal framework, and technology (tools  and data).  3.1 Human resources at CSIRTs  In general, skilled IT security personnel are hard to find. National and governmental CSIRTs will always lag  behind in recruiting skilled and dedicated long-term staff members as compared to the private sector.  Defining the right size and composition of an incident response team may also be challenging, especially if  the focus tends to fluctuate between deep technical activity and high-level, policy-driven ambitions. So  when choosing the right personnel to staff an incident response team, it is important to ensure that these  professionals are not only skilled in their own respective fields, but are also capable of making high impact  decisions, especially when it comes to escalating an incident to national (or even international) crisis level.  Good management oversight and clearly defined roles and responsibilities should help to overcome this  challenge.  3.2 Processes and procedures  Another aspect that is strongly connected to the human factor in the course of incident response is the  available processes and procedures. A clear, concise, well-documented incident response plan must be in  place that complies with the existing policy framework at organisational level as well as national level.  Overcomplicated response plans will delay the effectiveness of incident response and escalation  procedures. If policies are loose, the incident response team may lack autonomy to act responsibly. It is  vital that personnel are available to engage in the processes and procedures related to incident response.  It is just as vital that the constituents of the national and governmental CSIRTs are also aware of their parts  in the process of managing an incident.  3.3 Political and legal framework  At a political level there may be a lack of full understanding and appreciation of the importance of  investing resources in incident response activities or difficulty in investing more resources due to a need to  balance different priorities.  Strategies for Incident Response and Cyber Crisis Cooperation  PUBLISHED  |  Version 1.1  |  AUGUST 2016  14  In addition, there might be conflicts of responsibilities or challenges in the cooperation between the  different actors, e.g. authorities responsible for the public network, governmental network, military  networks, classified networks, etc.  An adequate political and legal framework25 can help to define various roles and responsibilities and  enhance the overall cooperation in order to resolve an incident in a timely manner. “Cooperation at  [national and] pan-European level is necessary to effectively prepare, but also respond to cyber-attacks.  Comprehensive national cyber security strategies are the first step in this direction”26. The “cyber  cooperation blueprint” announced by the Commission is a welcome effort in this direction at the European  level27.  3.4 Technology: tools and data  Incident response activities rely on tools to enable the discovery of information about systems and people  involved in an incident. Buying the latest and best equipment will not lead to complete protection against  cyber-attacks if used inadequately, unmanaged, untested, not updated, or if the properly trained human  resources are absent. Therefore, continuous updates and training are essential for incident response  teams. (See section on CSIRT training later.) Whether the decision is self-developed tools or services  procured from vendors, the management of pertinent data is always a challenge.  25 On the topic of legal aspects of information between CSIRTs in Europe, see ENISA, A flair for sharing - encouraging  information exchange between CERTs.

Incident response mechanisms  The previous sections briefly introduced what incident response is, who the main actors are, what  capabilities these entities should possess in order to effectively combat cyber-attacks, and what challenges  there may be that impede efficiency in incident response. This section aims to present important  connections between the main elements of incident response, with more emphasis on the daily technical- operational aspects and less focus on the high-level structures of incident response (sections on cyber  security strategies and cyber crisis management will deal with these aspects later).  In the course of incident response, CSIRTs have to assess the information that characterises the existing  cyber threats and attack vectors and all the data that comes from the logs of the number of electronic  information systems under the scope of the CSIRT/incident response team. Also, any activities carried out  and shared by peer CSIRTs need to be taken into consideration. The correlation between any of these  factors will contribute to mitigating the impact of the incidents.  In general, incident response follows the process below:  Figure 1: The typical incident response process28  28 Retrieved from Good Practice Guide for Incident Management, ENISA, 2010, Figure 6 - Incident handling workflow,  p. 37 - https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practice-guide-for-incident-management  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practice-guide-for-incident-management  Strategies for Incident Response and Cyber Crisis Cooperation  PUBLISHED  |  Version 1.1  |  AUGUST 2016  16  4.1 Current threats and ways to respond  Based on the ENISA Threat Landscape 201529, a comprehensive matrix of current threat ranking is  presented below.

Operating early warning systems, using proactive detection methods, and processing and  exchanging actionable information are all part of the operational-technical capability of a CSIRT.31 While  open source threat information is valuable to CSIRTs, an emerging service is Cyber Threat Intelligence,  which provides added value to the constituents. Cyber Threat Intelligence is evidence-based knowledge,  including context, mechanisms, indicators, implications and actionable advice about an existing or  emerging menace or hazard to assets, that can be used to inform decisions regarding the subject’s  response to that menace or hazard. Based on this, the distinction between information and intelligence  can be classified as follows32:  INFORMATION VERSUS INTELLIGENCE  Raw, unfiltered feed Processed, sorted information  Unevaluated when delivered  Evaluated and interpreted by trained intelligence  analysts  Aggregated from virtually every source  Aggregated from reliable sources and cross-correlated  for accuracy  May be true, false, misleading, incomplete, relevant or  irrelevant  Accurate, timely, complete (as possible), assessed for  relevancy  Not actionable Actionable  Table 3: Information vs. intelligence  Cyber Threat Intelligence comes as a service from specialized IT security service providers. CSIRTs or  network operators should ensure that investment in such a service is based on a clear concept of cost- benefit ratio on IT security.33 The advantage of this service is to be able to issue probability-based warnings  of future cyber-attacks and tailored alerts and warnings to the specific risks and threats of the  constituency.34  30 Adapted from the Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union - http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber- security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf  31 Extensive reading is available on information acquisition and use on ENISA’s CERT support section: e.g. proactive  incident detection (http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/proactive-detection), actionable information  (http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information), or alerts, warnings and  announcements (http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/awa)  32 http://www.isightpartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/iSIGHT_Partners_What_Is_20-20_Clarity_Brief1.pdf  33 Introduction to Return on Security Investment, ENISA, 2012 - http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/other- work/introduction-to-return-on-security-investment/at_download/fullReport  34 National/governmental CERTs; ENISA’s recommendations on baseline capabilities, ENISA, 2014, p.4 -  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/baseline-capabilities/national-governmental-certs-enisas- recommendations-on-baseline-capabilities/at_download/fullReport  http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/proactive-detection http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/awa http://www.isightpartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/iSIGHT_Partners_What_Is_20-20_Clarity_Brief1.pdf http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/other-work/introduction-to-return-on-security-investment/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/other-work/introduction-to-return-on-security-investment/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/baseline-capabilities/national-governmental-certs-enisas-recommendations-on-baseline-capabilities/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/baseline-capabilities/national-governmental-certs-enisas-recommendations-on-baseline-capabilities/at_download/fullReport  Strategies for Incident Response and Cyber Crisis Cooperation  PUBLISHED  |  Version 1.1  |  AUGUST 2016  18  Most national and governmental CSIRTs have established incident detection sensors and properly  implemented Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems35 to gather early warning  intelligence and process threat intelligence. Other detection and early warning arrangements may include  monitoring open sources and media coverage, and information exchange between relevant stakeholders.  This exchange could take place within a critical infrastructure information exchange forum, which in some  cases could include large private companies besides the public stakeholders.36  4.3 Information sharing and incident reporting  Information sharing, as an incident coordination tool, is extensively discussed in ‘Chapter 3’ of WG2 of the  NIS Platform (Voluntary information sharing), while mandatory incident notification, as a tool for impact  assessment, is dealt with in ‘Chapter 5’ (Mandatory incident notification) and is briefly listed above in  ‘Overview and scope of the document’.  35 Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) technology supports threat detection and security incident  response through the real-time collection and historical analysis of security events from a wide variety of event and  contextual data sources. It also supports compliance reporting and incident investigation through analysis of  historical data from these sources. The core capabilities of SIEM technology are a broad scope of event collection and  the ability to correlate and analyze events across disparate sources. http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/security- information-and-event-management-siem/  36 Report on Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Management, ENISA, 2014, p.35 -  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/nis-cooperation-plans/ccc- management/ccc-study/at_download/fullReport  http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/security-information-and-event-management-siem/ http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/security-information-and-event-management-siem/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/nis-cooperation-plans/ccc-management/ccc-study/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/nis-cooperation-plans/ccc-management/ccc-study/at_download/fullReport  Strategies for Incident Response and Cyber Crisis Cooperation  PUBLISHED  |  Version 1.1  |  AUGUST 2016  19  5. Incident response in cyber security strategies  The importance of cyberspace and the digital economy has grown over the last fifteen years. Citizens,  businesses and governments became connected to and dependent on more and more complex ICT  systems; the flow of information is borderless and the amount of data and information produced by each  interaction in the Internet economy is rapidly growing. To safeguard the merits of the Internet, and to  ensure the protection of fundamental rights in cyberspace, a new approach to the cyber world was  adopted. Cyber security strategies started emerging in recognition of the changing security landscape  shifting towards the cyber world. Countries, communities with common interest, and international  organisations started publishing their cyber security strategies.  A national cyber security strategy is a strategic framework for a nation’s approach to cyber security. It is a  tool to improve the security and resilience of national infrastructures and services. It is a high-level,  framework that establishes a range of national objectives and priorities that should be achieved in a  specific timeframe. In general, the key objectives of these security strategies focus on the following  aspects37:   to develop cyber defence policies and capabilities;   to achieve cyber resilience;   to reduce cyber-crime;   to support industry on cyber security;   to secure critical information infrastructures38.  The EU published its own cyber security strategy in 201339, in which the Commission set out goals to  Member States, the private sector and the EU agencies to take steps toward a more resilient European  cyberspace. The EU Cyber Security Strategy explicitly makes reference to the existing gaps in terms of  capacities, coordination and preparedness, where actions not only at EU level but also at national level are  required to follow up the recommendations of the EU Cyber Security Strategy. These proposals focus on  the following three areas:  - Member States should meet the baseline requirements in NIS, by which well-functioning CSIRTs shall be  set up; competent authorities shall be in place in NIS; critical information infrastructures protection will  become a priority; and national NIS strategies and cooperation plans shall be drawn up. The same tasks  shall apply to the EU and its institutions to secure the EU IT systems40.  37 An Evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies, ENISA, 2014, p.6 -  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/an-evaluation- framework-for-cyber-security-strategies-1/an-evaluation-framework-for-cyber-security- strategies/at_download/fullReport  38 The example is taken from the Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union - http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu- cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf  39 High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Joint Communication on the  Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace, JOIN(2013) 1 final, 07 February  2013 - http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf  40 CERT-EU, the Computer Emergency Response Team responsible for the security of the IT systems of the EU  institutions, agencies and bodies, was set up in 2012.

The tools developed by industry to respond to incidents, identify causes  and conduct forensic investigations should also benefit the public sector.  ENISA has carried out extensive work on national cyber security strategies41 to support Member States in  the development, implementation and evaluation of these strategies to overcome the existing gaps in  terms of capacities, coordination and preparedness. Since each Member State has its own priorities on  cyber security, there is no uniform solution to the content, but as a general guideline, the following  components should be addressed when developing a national cyber security strategy42:   setting the vision, scope, objectives and priorities;   following a national risk assessment approach;   taking stock of existing policies, regulations and capabilities;   developing a clear governance structure;   identifying and engaging stakeholders;   establishing trusted information-sharing mechanisms;   developing national cyber contingency plans;   organising cyber security exercises;   establishing baseline security requirements;   establishing incident reporting mechanisms;   creating user awareness;   fostering R&D;   strengthening training and educational programmes;   establishing an incident response capability;   addressing cyber-crime;   engaging in international cooperation;   establishing a public-private partnership;   balancing security with privacy.  A national cyber incident contingency plan is designed to respond effectively to a large-scale cyber  incident. The focus should be on baseline mechanisms and procedures for communication between  national public and private stakeholders in the event of large-scale cyber disruptions, incident response  and recovery. The national contingency plans should be based on a national cyber risk assessment of  critical information infrastructures and their dependencies.  harm the interests of the EU.

In the particular case of the  Netherlands43, for instance, GOVCERT.NL, the former Computer Emergency Response Team of the Dutch  government, formed the basis of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) tasked with protecting the  national (critical) information infrastructures.  A national cyber security centre may have responsibilities that concentrate on developing and offering  expertise and advice, supporting and implementing responses to threats or incidents, and strengthening  crisis management. A national cyber security centre may also organise and facilitate Information Sharing  and Analysis Centres (ISACs), involving intelligence, CSIRT communities and critical infrastructure  stakeholders in order to facilitate information-sharing in a trustworthy environment. If ISACs are set up, it  also assumes another key element of a national cyber security strategy, which is the establishment of  public-private partnerships (PPPs), where an organised relationship is created between the public and  private sectors to achieve shared goals.44 Revision and evaluation of a national cyber security strategy  must be undertaken at a higher level. Usually this is done through a National Cyber Security Council, which  has members from both the public and private sectors. A council can advise both government and private  parties on relevant developments in the area of cyber security, prioritize specific (emerging) IT threats, and  ensure that basic values are incorporated in the execution of the strategy.45  43 National Cyber Security Strategy 2 ‘From awareness’ (2013), https://www.ncsc.nl/english/current- topics/news/new-cyber-security-strategy-strengthens-cooperation-between-government-and-businesses.html - The  National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) ‘Strength through cooperation’ (2011), https://www.ncsc.nl/english/current- topics/news/national-cyber-security-strategy-launched.html  44 National Cyber Security Strategies; Practical Guide on Development and Execution, ENISA, 2012, p.35 -  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/national-cyber- security-strategies-an-implementation-guide/at_download/fullReport  45 National Cyber Security Strategies; Practical Guide on Development and Execution, ENISA, 2012, p.36 -  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/national-cyber- security-strategies-an-implementation-guide/at_download/fullReport  https://www.ncsc.nl/english/current-topics/news/new-cyber-security-strategy-strengthens-cooperation-between-government-and-businesses.html https://www.ncsc.nl/english/current-topics/news/new-cyber-security-strategy-strengthens-cooperation-between-government-and-businesses.html https://www.ncsc.nl/english/current-topics/news/national-cyber-security-strategy-launched.html https://www.ncsc.nl/english/current-topics/news/national-cyber-security-strategy-launched.html http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/national-cyber-security-strategies-an-implementation-guide/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/national-cyber-security-strategies-an-implementation-guide/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/national-cyber-security-strategies-an-implementation-guide/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/national-cyber-security-strategies-an-implementation-guide/at_download/fullReport  Strategies for Incident Response and Cyber Crisis Cooperation  PUBLISHED  |  Version 1.1  |  AUGUST 2016  22  6. Ways of enhancing incident handling cooperation  6.1 Cyber crisis cooperation and management  By definition, a crisis is ‘an extraordinary event that differs from the normal and involves serious  disturbance or risk for disturbance of vital societal functions’.46 A ‘crisis’ can be defined respectively as an  abnormal and unstable situation that threatens an organisation’s strategic objectives, reputation or  viability. An event that strikes at the heart of the organization”47.  When it comes to defining a cyber crisis, the main difficulty lies in the fact that “the severity of a crisis  tends to be measured by the severity of its impacts”48. In this regard, a crisis triggered by a cybersecurity  incident in the energy sector, would become an energy crisis, not a cyber crisis. “Nevertheless, the  effective mitigation of any sectorial crisis induced by severe cyber incidents, will depend on the effective  mitigation of the causes of the incidents”49. It is therefore essential to further structure the field of cyber  crisis management.  Cyber crises may also transcend national and geographic boundaries50. A proposal for a strong procedural  triple-layered framework for cooperation51 between EU public organisations – supporting the Member  States’ needs – clearly describes a practical approach to the management of large-scale crisis. The  elements that are required for the management of a cyber crisis are broken down into three levels:  - The strategic level is automatically involved when an incident escalates into a crisis with potential  socio-economic impacts.  Possible actors at this level are the heads of departments, cyber security  councils, national defence councils, national crisis management boards, etc. In case several Member  States are impacted by a crisis, high-level EU crisis management mechanisms may be triggered, such  46 Report on Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Management, ENISA, 2014, p.26 -  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/nis-cooperation-plans/ccc- management/ccc-study/at_download/fullReport  47 Report on Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Management, ENISA, 2014, p.28 -  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/nis-cooperation-plans/ccc- management/ccc-study/at_download/fullReport.

Additionally, the European Commission announced  the development of a cyber crisis plan53, following a proposal made by ENISA54.  - The operational level focuses on threat analysis, situational assessment and mitigation action  measures. Actors at this level are cyber security agencies or authorities, governmental CSIRTs,  national communication authorities, and operational crisis management bodies. The recent pan-  European exercises showed that the operational EU cyber community is still in the capability-building  phase and need to increase their efforts in adopting the EU Cyber Standard Operating Procedures (EU-  CSOPs) in their daily work.  - The technical level involves incident handling by monitoring, detecting and handling the incidents,  and alerting and informing the operational level with the appropriate raw technical information.  Actors at this level include the CSIRTs and abuse teams operating at information systems. CSIRTs have  long-standing information exchange channels that work sufficiently on sharing actionable information,  especially in the case of large-scale cyber incidents.  Figure 2: Crisis escalation model based in the EU55  The key in effective cyber crisis coordination is the shared responsibility and comprehensive approach  among the stakeholders, which involves efficient national information exchange mechanisms and cross- border cooperation between the specific management levels. At the operational level, the EU-CSOPs need  52 More information on the EU integrated political crisis response arrangements -  http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/publications/2014/eu-ipcr/  53 Communication on strengthening Europe's cyber resilience system and fostering a competitive and innovative  cybersecurity Industry, European Commission, pp. 4-5 -  http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=16546  54 Common practices of EU-level crisis management and applicability to cyber crises, 2015, p.5 -  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-level-crisis-man/at_download/fullReport  55 Report on Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Management, ENISA, 2014, p.40 -  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/nis-cooperation-plans/ccc- management/ccc-study/at_download/fullReport  http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/publications/2014/eu-ipcr/ http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=16546 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-level-crisis-man/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/nis-cooperation-plans/ccc-management/ccc-study/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/nis-cooperation-plans/ccc-management/ccc-study/at_download/fullReport  Strategies for Incident Response and Cyber Crisis Cooperation  PUBLISHED  |  Version 1.1  |  AUGUST 2016  24  to be formally adopted to ensure the agreed set of roles and actions to be taken in cross-border cyber  crisis management. At the technical level, the future CSIRT Network set out by the NIS Directive, along with  cyber exercises developed by ENISA, will further structure cooperation activities.  Last but not least, ENISA is singularly positioned to provide a complete and consistent picture within  European borders and domains in addition to operating as a focal point for information-sharing. Indeed,  the role of the Agency in the CSIRT Network and the future cooperation platform financed by the  Connecting Europe Facility framework, but also in the development of the European Cyber Standard  Operating Procedures, places ENISA at the centre of the European cyber crisis coordination apparatus. The  ongoing discussions about the ENISA mandate should take these considerations into account, for it could  significantly improve the response of the Union to the next cyber crisis.  6.2 Mutual Aid to boost preparedness  Cyber crisis management is not limited to the mitigation of cyber-attacks only,  but also includes the  handling of low-probability/high-impact events (Black Swan56), which usually occur at the time of natural  disasters, cross-border power outages or failures in communication networks (due to technological or  human errors). This way, end-users, the ICT traffic capacity, or critical infrastructures may be impacted.  Any of these impacts assume a certain level of emergency, where both the physical world and the cyber  domain need to be handled with the appropriate level of contingency.  To improve the level of preparedness to deal with these Black Swan events, ENISA has carried out a series  of studies that deal with the concept of Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructures in Europe (MARIE).57 The  current observations show that Mutual Aid concepts can only be fully exploited if both the public and  private sectors are involved in the mutual aid agreements, and the previously mentioned strategic,  operational and technical areas have their role in the crisis management. Mutual Aid assumes an  efficiently functioning information exchange mechanism and the cross-border interoperability between ICT  systems. Five recommendations have been proposed in the MARIE report58, as listed below:   governments should be responsive in creating an environment that supports private sector initiatives  that seek to establish Mutual Aid assistance by reducing regulatory obstacles;   the private sector should develop and maintain a standard Mutual Aid agreement template;   the private sector entities with critical infrastructure functions should establish formal Mutual Aid  assistance with industry peers, cross-sector entities and governments;   the private sector, in consultation with government, should develop strategies to manage the scarcest  resources in order to provide relief for the affected public(s);   specific plans are needed for the communication of the temporary unavailability of critical  infrastructure functions.  56 http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Black_swan  57 Further information on the topic is available at https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical- infrastructure-and-services/mutual-aid-assistance  58 Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructures in Europe (MARIE): Phase II recommendations report, ENISA, 2013, pp.10- 20 - https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/mutual-aid- assistance/m-a-r-i-e-phase-ii-recommendations-report/at_download/fullReport  http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Black_swan https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/mutual-aid-assistance https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/mutual-aid-assistance https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/mutual-aid-assistance/m-a-r-i-e-phase-ii-recommendations-report/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/mutual-aid-assistance/m-a-r-i-e-phase-ii-recommendations-report/at_download/fullReport  Strategies for Incident Response and Cyber Crisis Cooperation  PUBLISHED  |  Version 1.1  |  AUGUST 2016  25  Figure 3: Incident Preparedness Improvement scheme59  6.3 Exercises to enhance incident handling cooperation  Cyber exercises are an important tool to assess the preparedness of a community against cyber crises,  technology failures and critical information infrastructure incidents. According to the EU Cyber Security  Strategy, exercises at EU level are essential to simulate cooperation among the Member States and the  private sector. The reason for multinational exercises is the fact that the threat of cyber incidents and  attacks is borderless, thus the cross-border crisis cooperation mechanisms need to be tested and validated  from time to time.  ENISA supports the stakeholders involved in EU cyber exercises60. The first exercise involving the Member  States was carried out in 2010 (‘Cyber Europe 201061’), the second exercise took place in October 2012  (‘Cyber Europe 201262’), and the third EU cyber exercise (‘Cyber Europe 201463’) was carried out in October  2014. The first joint EU-US table-top exercise was carried out in November 2011 (‘Cyber Atlantic 2011’).64  Further exercises are planned for the coming years, continuing the Cyber Europe roadmap.

To facilitate the work of Member States, ENISA has produced a training on how to plan cyber exercises65,  with a focus on crisis coordination exercises. Various elements of the cyber security plans can be tested  during an exercise, involving the technical, operational or strategic level, or even all of them, as was the  case in Cyber Europe 2014.  6.4 CSIRT training to enhance capabilities  Last, but not least, training plays an integral part in CSIRT capability enhancement. A number of courses  and modules are available to teach and train the staff at CSIRTs. The section above on ‘Key challenges in  incident response’ already touched upon the topic of staff preparedness in tools and techniques.  This section on training is far from being exhaustive, but it lists the main CSIRT training courses that are  widely available for the European CSIRT community. There are a number of professional organisations  offering training services that focus on incident response in general, or any of its special fields.  The most widely known CSIRT training course is the TRANSITS training, which takes place at least twice a  year.  ENISA facilitates and supports the TRANSITS courses. The TRANSITS programme consists of basic and  advanced (hands-on) courses. The course materials were developed by the former TERENA66 in  collaboration with members of its Task Force of Computer Security Incident Response Teams (TF-CSIRT)  and are regularly updated. The TRANSITS-I67 course is aimed at new or potential CSIRT personnel who wish  to gain a good grounding in the main aspects of working in an incident handling and response team. The  topics include: 1) organisational, 2) technical, 3) operational, and 4) legal issues. The TRANSITS-II68 course is  aimed at more experienced personnel working for established CSIRTs. It provides an in-depth study of key  areas in incident handling and response operations, training in how to improve communications with  constituents, along with practical exercises. The advanced topics of the course include: 1) netflow analysis,  2) forensics, 3) communication, and 4) CSIRT exercises.  ENISA also plays an important role in CSIRT training. It has developed a number of training resources that  form a module which can be used in organising successful training events or adding a hands-on component  to conferences. The ENISA CSIRT training material was introduced in 2008, and was complemented with  new exercise scenarios in 2012, 2013 and 2014. The material contains essential components for success in  the CSIRT community and in the field of information security. The ENISA website contains the ENISA CSIRT  training resources, including a handbook for teachers, a toolset for students and Virtual Image to support  hands-on training sessions. Most of the training can therefore be undertaken by using this material. ENISA  also offers on-site training. Requests for these training sessions must typically go through the national and  governmental CSIRT or another competent authority of an EU Member State. The training resources are  structured around: 1) technical, 2) operational, 3) setting up a CSIRT, and 4) legal and co-operational  issues. The materials vary from hands-on technical scenarios to handbooks and toolsets. All the resources  65 National and International Cyber Security Exercises; Survey, Analysis and Recommendations, ENISA, 2012 -  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/cce/cyber_exercises/national- exercise-good-practice-guide/at_download/fullReport  66 TERENA and DANTE joined forces in October 2014 to become GÉANT Association.

FIRST, as the largest global CSIRT community, places emphasis on technical CSIRT staff training that focuses  on current threats and trends.70 In the past, FIRST has provided its expertise to the TRANSITS courses and it  has also organised hands-on technical courses co-located with the TF-CSIRT TI events. FIRST, as a global  organisation, plans to develop an education programme for CSIRTs around the world with the help of the  global security community. The development of a curriculum based on ‘CSIRT Services Framework’ will be  a collaboration by the community and convened by FIRST.71  69 More information on ENISA’s training materials - http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/training  70 FIRST Symposia, Technical Colloquia, and Workshops - https://www.first.org/events  71 https://www.first.org/global/education  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/training https://www.first.org/events https://www.first.org/global/education  Strategies for Incident Response and Cyber Crisis Cooperation  PUBLISHED  |  Version 1.1  |  AUGUST 2016  28  7. Conclusions  WG2 of the NIS Platform is tasked with addressing the sharing of cyber threat information and incident  coordination in both the public and private segments of the EU. Incident response is among its objectives  to identify requirements and issue recommendations on sharing cyber threat information as well as  appropriate incident management processes in order to better prevent and best respond to cyber  incidents.  There is a wide range of mechanisms that cover the cyber security landscape of a Member State. Incident  response is just one of many. CSIRTs, as privileged players in incident response, fulfil their roles as defined  by the national plans in cyber security.  The aim of this document is to support and instigate discussion between WG2 members of the NIS  Platform on the topic of incident response and cyber crisis coordination and serve as input for the  compilation of a related deliverable by the WG.  This document set out to introduce the reader to the basics of incident response on a high level. Besides  the main definitions and stakeholders, the separate section was dedicated to the main CSIRT capabilities  regarded as ‘baseline’ which are a desired requirement in the EU Cyber Security Strategy. Some key  challenges were raised on the typical issues that slow the incident response mechanisms, and to address  these challenges, ways of enhancing incident handling cooperation were given.

The current version of this  document is an updated version of the one published in March 2016.  The Network and Information Security (NIS) Platform1 was created in 2013 to help European stakeholders  carry out appropriate risk management, establish good cyber security policies and processes and further  adopt standards and solutions that will improve the ability to create safer market conditions for the EU. All  this was brought to life as a contribution to the implementation of the Cyber Security Strategy of the EU2.  This document is an input for the NIS Platform for the discussion on incident response and cyber crisis  coordination.  The document focuses on incident response: it briefly introduces what incident response is, who the main  actors are, what baseline capabilities these entities should possess in order to effectively combat cyber- attacks, and what challenges there may be that impede efficiency in incident response. The notion of  Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) as key players in incident response is introduced.  Descriptions of incident response mechanisms will be elaborated, taking into account national-level cyber  security strategies, cyber crisis coordination and management covering both escalation and  communication between CSIRTs and government bodies.  The core material of the document was developed based on previous work undertaken by ENISA in the  field of CSIRTs and Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) and resilience. The main topics used  as input for this document cover the following:   findings and recommendations published under the baseline capabilities of CSIRTs and a brief  description of incident response mechanisms;   work done in the field of national cyber security strategies with special regard to implementation and  evaluation of these strategies;   aspects of cyber crisis cooperation and management focusing on escalation mechanisms and ways of  further enhancing crisis cooperation mechanisms, such as mutual aid, training and exercising and  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).  Some challenges will be raised on the typical issues that slow the incident response mechanisms, and to  address these challenges, ways of enhancing incident handling cooperation will be provided.  1 Information on NIS Platform - https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/nis-platform  2 High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Joint Communication on the  Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace, JOIN(2013) 1 final, 07 February  2013 - http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/nis-platform http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf  Strategies for Incident Response and Cyber Crisis Cooperation  PUBLISHED  |  Version 1.1  |  AUGUST 2016  05  1. Overview and scope of the document  The Network and Information Security (NIS) Platform3 was created in 2013 to help European stakeholders  carry out appropriate risk management, establish good cyber security policies and processes and further  adopt standards and solutions that will improve the ability to create safer market conditions for the EU.  The expert work of the NIS Platform was divided into Working Groups (WGs), all dealing with their special  field of expertise in cyber security. The following WGs were established:  1) WG1 on risk management, including information assurance, risks metrics and awareness raising;  2) WG2 on information exchange and incident coordination, including incident reporting and risks  metrics for the purpose of information exchange;  3) WG3 on secure ICT research and innovation.  WG2 has been established to promote the sharing of cyber threat information and incident coordination in  both the public and private sectors in the EU. It aims to identify requirements and issue recommendations  on sharing cyber threat information as well as appropriate incident management processes in order to  better prevent and best respond to cyber incidents.  WG2 also investigates the feasibility and needs to address the ability of an organisation to share cyber  threat information and to utilize a standard incident management process. This covers both public and  private organisations, and all industry verticals within the private sector, with special focus on Critical  National Infrastructures (CNIs).  The foreseen work by WG2 will be a series of deliverables (Chapters) to be adopted by the NIS Platform,  identifying cyber security good practices, as an implementation of the Cyber Security Strategy of the EU  published in 20134. Incident response and cyber crisis coordination will be encompassed in Chapter 4 of  these deliverables.  The Chapters foreseen by the three WGs are:   Chapter 1: Organisational structures and requirements;   Chapter 2: Verification and auditing of requirements;   Chapter 3: Voluntary information sharing;   Chapter 4: Incident response (current document is prepared as an input for this deliverable);   Chapter 5: Mandatory incident notification;   Chapter 6: Data protection;   Chapter 7: [Optional] Incentives for the uptake of good cyber security practices;   Chapter 8: [Optional] Recommendations on research challenges and opportunities.  In addition to the Chapter on incident response (Chapter 4), WG2 will also be responsible for delivering the  chapters on voluntary information sharing (Chapter 3), mandatory incident notification (Chapter 5) and  data protection (Chapter 6).  3 Information on NIS Platform - https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/nis-platform  4 https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:27035:ed-1:v1:en  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/nis-platform https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:27035:ed-1:v1:en  Strategies for Incident Response and Cyber Crisis Cooperation  PUBLISHED  |  Version 1.1  |  AUGUST 2016  06  The content of this document, which has been compiled as an input for Chapter 4, was developed based  on ENISA’s previous work in the field of Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) and the  resilience of critical information infrastructures. The notion of CSIRTs will be introduced. Descriptions of  incident response mechanisms will be elaborated, taking into account national cyber security strategies, on  how incident response is structured in Member States – covering both escalation and communication  between CSIRTs and government bodies.  This document focuses on incident response: how main incident response capabilities tie in with incident  response mechanisms to potentially cover the cyber security landscape of a Member State.  This document does not go into details on the various aspects mentioned above as it aims to give a  compact overview. However, in case of further interest, references to available literature on the aspects  are provided in footnotes and in the Appendix.  Strategies for Incident Response and Cyber Crisis Cooperation  PUBLISHED  |  Version 1.1  |  AUGUST 2016  07  2. Basics of incident response  An information security incident can be defined as a “single or a series of unwanted or unexpected  information security events that have a significant probability of compromising business operations and  threatening information security”5, while a cyber security incident can be defined as “an IT disruption that  limits or eliminates the expected availability of services, and/or is the unauthorized publication, acquisition  and/or modification of information” 6. A cyber security incident can involve a real or suspected breach or  the unlawful act of exploiting vulnerability. Typical incidents include the introduction of malware into a  network, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, unauthorised alteration of software or hardware  and identity theft of individuals or institutions. Hacking in general can be considered a security incident  unless the perpetrators have been deliberately hired for the specific purpose of testing a computer or  network for vulnerabilities.  Incident response and management is the protection of an organisation's information by developing and  implementing an incident response process (e.g. plans, defined roles, training, communications,  management oversight) in order to quickly discover an attack and then effectively contain the damage,  eradicate the attacker's presence, and restore the integrity of the network and systems.7  The term 'constituency' is used to refer to the customer base or the served group of users of a CSIRT. A  single customer is a ‘constituent’; a group is called ‘constituents’.  A Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) is an organisation that receives reports of security  breaches, conducts analyses of the reports and responds to the senders. A CSIRT may be an established  group or an ad hoc group of experts. Other widely accepted terms exist for CSIRTs, such as CERT  (Computer Emergency Response Team), IRT (Incident Response Team), CIRT (Computer Incident Response  Team) or SERT (Security Emergency Response Team). For a comprehensive list of CSIRTs in Europe, ENISA  regularly updates an inventory of European CSIRTs8, and Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams  (FIRST)9 and Trusted Introducer (TI)10 have public links to their global members as well.  There are various types of CSIRTs. Dedicated incident response teams or CSIRTs may operate as part of a  parent organisation, such as within a government, a corporation, a university or a research network.  National and governmental CSIRTs, for example, oversee incident handling for an entire country or parts of  its critical infrastructure. Typically, CSIRTs rely on information coming from within the organisation’s  information systems and act on an ad hoc basis in the event of a security incident.

Sectoral, national or governmental CSIRTs oversee and act upon network activities of larger sectors or  critical infrastructures. The basic types of service covered by a typical CSIRT will be elaborated upon in the  ‘incident response capabilities’ section.  CSIRTs also provide proactive services, such as alerts and warnings or end-user security training, besides  responding to incidents.  Regardless of the type of CSIRT, one of the main powers of CSIRTs lies in the fact that they can effectively  assist in mitigating incidents on a technical level in a relatively short time. Since attacks on the internet are  borderless, the countermeasures involve cross-border cooperation between CSIRTs. To facilitate this  cooperation, several international and regional CSIRT communities and initiatives have been formed over  the past twenty years. Involvement in the following CSIRT communities is strongly advised for CSIRTs,  including national and governmental CSIRTs:  TF-CSIRT (Task Force of Computer Security Incident Response Teams): this provides a forum where  members of the CSIRT community can exchange experiences and knowledge in a trusted environment in  order to improve cooperation and coordination. It maintains a system for registering and accrediting  CSIRTs, as well as certifying service standards. The task force also develops and provides services for  CSIRTs, promotes the use of common standards and procedures for handling security incidents, and  coordinates joint initiatives where appropriate. This includes the training of CSIRT staff, and assisting in the  establishment and development of new CSIRTs. (http://www.terena.nl/tech/task-forces/tf-csirt)  TI (Trusted Introducer): this forms the trusted backbone of infrastructure services and serves as a  clearinghouse for all security and incident response teams. It lists well-known teams and performs  accreditation and certification of teams according to their demonstrated and checked level of maturity. For  a CSIRT to proceed from the status of ‘listed’ to the status of ‘accredited’, it needs to go through a  formalised accreditation scheme. Once ‘accredited’, the CSIRT can gain access to the restricted TI  repository where details of fellow accredited CSIRTs can be found, along with several value-added services  such as readily downloadable contact lists and PGP-Keyrings, secure discussion forum, automatic RIPE  Database IRT-object registration and more. (https://www.trusted-introducer.org/)  There is an on-going process to better integrate TF-CSIRT and TI to establish a unified European group with  a recognizable membership and to improve coordination and use of staff resources, as well as to establish  a more direct relationship between CSIRTs and the TF-CSIRT leadership12, which will happen under the  structure of GÉANT, formerly TERENA (Trans-European Research and Education Networking Association)13.  FIRST (Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams): this is a premier organisation and a recognized  global leader in incident response. Membership in FIRST enables incident response teams to more  effectively respond to security incidents by providing access to best practices, tools, and trusted  communication with member teams.

EGC is a closed  group of CSIRTs that only allows European governmental CSIRTs among its members on the basis of  invitation. (http://www.egc-group.org)  CSIRT network: the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive14, adopted in July 2016, foresees the  establishment, also with the support of ENISA, of the CSIRTs network to ensure effective cooperation from  all Member States. Article 12 of this directive indeed provides that: “In order to contribute to the  development of confidence and trust between the Member States and to promote swift and effective  operational cooperation, a network of the national CSIRTs is hereby established. […] The CSIRTs network  shall be composed of representatives of the Member States' CSIRTs and CERT-EU. The Commission shall  participate in the CSIRTs network as an observer. ENISA shall provide the secretariat and shall actively  support the cooperation among the CSIRTs.”  Before the adoption of the NIS Directive, ENISA had formed and is still managing a network of national  and/or governmental CSIRTs in Europe. The Agency reaches out to this network via a mailing list to keep  the network up to date on its activities. ENISA relies heavily on the input from this network when it is  publishing studies. Many experts from this network have been members of expert groups organised by  ENISA, and have been interviewed or have responded to questionnaires. The network is a key input for the  work ENISA is doing in this field. ENISA’s ‘CERTs in Europe’ workshops have been organised since 2005 for  the national and governmental CSIRTs in Europe as an efficient and indispensable method for ENISA in  supporting the teams in improving their capabilities. In 2011, ENISA started to collaborate with Europol to  focus on CSIRT cooperation with law enforcement. From 2012, the annual ENISA workshop was split into  two parts, one part that aimed only at national and governmental CSIRTs and retained a technical focus,  and the other part aimed at both national and governmental CSIRTs and law enforcement representatives,  organised together with Europol. These workshops are particularly important as a forum for information  sharing.  2.1 A brief overview of incident response capabilities  ENISA started its stocktaking of CSIRT capabilities in Europe in 2009. The outcome of this activity was the  first document on baseline capabilities for national and governmental CSIRTs, focusing on operational  aspects15. A follow-up to this was a second document on baseline capabilities focusing on policy  recommendations in 201016. ENISA updated its considerations for the capabilities of national and  governmental CSIRTs in 201217. Although these capabilities are generally valid for all types of CSIRTs,  attention was specifically given to national and governmental CSIRTs in order to align them with the  recommendations laid down in the EU Cyber Strategy. The four baseline capabilities were redefined as  14 Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 concerning measures for a  high common level of security of network and information systems across the Union, http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC  15 Baseline capabilities for national/governmental CERTs (Part 1: Operational Aspects), ENISA, 2009 -  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/files/baseline-capabilities-for-national-governmental- certs/at_download/fullReport  16 Baseline capabilities for national/governmental CERTs (Part 2: Policy recommendations), ENISA, 2010 -  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/files/baseline-capabilities-of-national-governmental-certs- policy-recommendations/at_download/fullReport  17 Baseline capabilities for national/governmental CERTs (Updated recommendations 2012), ENISA, 2012 -  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/files/updated-recommendations-2012/at_download/fullReport  http://www.egc-group.org/ http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/files/baseline-capabilities-for-national-governmental-certs/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/files/baseline-capabilities-for-national-governmental-certs/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/files/baseline-capabilities-of-national-governmental-certs-policy-recommendations/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/files/baseline-capabilities-of-national-governmental-certs-policy-recommendations/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/files/updated-recommendations-2012/at_download/fullReport  Strategies for Incident Response and Cyber Crisis Cooperation  PUBLISHED  |  Version 1.1  |  AUGUST 2016  10  ‘formal capability’, ‘operational-technical capability’, ‘operational-organisational capability’, and ‘co- operational capability’.  2.1.1 Formal capability18  This capability should make the official mandate of the national or governmental CSIRT clear. This mandate  should assume that the CSIRT will be the official national point of contact for incident response issues, or  act as the ’CSIRT of last resort’ in case of emergencies. With the designation of national point of contact,  the CSIRT should be the national representation at the international CSIRT communities.  This capacity should also provide proof of sustainable financial and other resources. Ideally, an existing  cyber security strategy (see later in chapter) should define the roles and responsibilities of the CSIRT, its  relationships with other national public and private stakeholders in the national cyber security landscape  and Incident Response (IR) practice. Generally, the main role of the national or governmental CSIRT should  be supporting the management of security incidents for systems and networks within its state’s borders.  2.1.2 Operational-technical capability19  The service portfolio of any national or governmental CSIRT should consist of the external services it  provides to its constituency and its internal support processes, when the CSIRT is part of a larger host  organisation.  There are four external service categories that cover the main CSIRT activities. Internal services might be,  for example, a good situational awareness, technical cyber security training for staff or participation in  various cyber security exercises (e.g. Cyber Europe Exercise).   Proactive services, which are aimed at improving the infrastructure and security processes of the  constituency before any incident or event occurs or is detected. The main goals are to prevent  incidents and reduce their impact and scope when they do occur.   Reactive services, which are aimed at responding to requests for assistance, reports of incidents  from the CSIRT constituency, and tackling threats or attacks against the CSIRT’s systems.   Other security management services, which are the common services designed to improve the  overall security of an organisation.   Optional (internal) services, covering the field of awareness-raising or cyber security training  within the host organisation.  In the context of core services for the constituency, a national or governmental CSIRT should provide  incident handling and management, be the designated national point of contact, and play a role in the  protection of Critical National Infrastructure (CNI).

Stakeholders  include operators, service providers, hardware and software providers, end-users, public bodies and  national governments, as well as peer organisations with similar responsibilities which require cross- border cooperation. Cooperation in each aspect involves a high level of trust between any participating  members in a cooperation model.  National or governmental CSIRTs bear the responsibility of incident coordination over (part of) a nation’s  critical information infrastructure, which requires prompt action against well-defined metrics. Although  incident types vary in the response required, service level agreements (SLAs) are a good basis to lay down  the expected actions and response times between the CSIRT and its constituents. This should also apply to  the national cooperation mechanisms between CSIRTS and local industry stakeholders.  Since cyberspace is borderless, large-scale incidents impact several nations. As covered above, a CSIRT  should have enhanced co-operational capability to be able to reach out to peer CSIRTs and act in a  coordinated manner. Cooperation in the international arena should also happen based on a voluntary  approach, where peer-CSIRTs share information and act in coordination based on the trust level they have  built. In the context of the NIS Directive, ENISA is to play a significant role in pan-European operational  coordination between national and governmental CSIRTs.  24 National/governmental CERTs; ENISA’s recommendations on baseline capabilities, ENISA, 2014, p.6 - https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/baseline-capabilities/national-governmental-certs-enisas- recommendations-on-baseline-capabilities/at_download/fullReport  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/baseline-capabilities/national-governmental-certs-enisas-recommendations-on-baseline-capabilities/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/baseline-capabilities/national-governmental-certs-enisas-recommendations-on-baseline-capabilities/at_download/fullReport  Strategies for Incident Response and Cyber Crisis Cooperation  PUBLISHED  |  Version 1.1  |  AUGUST 2016  13  3. Key challenges in incident response  In general, incident response carries the burden of remediating any breaches in IT security at an  organisation at micro level, or of a nation at macro level. A number of best practices exist to initiate or  safeguard the level of integrity in IT security, but there is always a gap between legislation and practice.  The current situation in the EU does not always provide the highest protection against NIS incidents and  risks across the EU. Existing NIS capabilities and mechanisms are simply insufficient to keep pace with the  fast-changing landscape of threats and to ensure a common high level of protection in all the EU Member  States. As a first step in aligning the NIS level Member States, incident response capabilities need to meet a  common minimum threshold level.  Currently, several cyber security incidents are cross border by nature but Member States do not  necessarily follow a harmonised approach when it comes to incident responses. However, there are  challenges that need to be addressed when discussing common incident response mechanisms within the  Member States. Having a regulatory framework and the required institutions in place will not  automatically resolve the ever growing cyber threats within the EU boundaries. What need to be taken  into consideration when assessing the incident response capabilities are, amongst others, the following  areas: human resources, processes and procedures, political and legal framework, and technology (tools  and data).  3.1 Human resources at CSIRTs  In general, skilled IT security personnel are hard to find. National and governmental CSIRTs will always lag  behind in recruiting skilled and dedicated long-term staff members as compared to the private sector.  Defining the right size and composition of an incident response team may also be challenging, especially if  the focus tends to fluctuate between deep technical activity and high-level, policy-driven ambitions. So  when choosing the right personnel to staff an incident response team, it is important to ensure that these  professionals are not only skilled in their own respective fields, but are also capable of making high impact  decisions, especially when it comes to escalating an incident to national (or even international) crisis level.  Good management oversight and clearly defined roles and responsibilities should help to overcome this  challenge.  3.2 Processes and procedures  Another aspect that is strongly connected to the human factor in the course of incident response is the  available processes and procedures. A clear, concise, well-documented incident response plan must be in  place that complies with the existing policy framework at organisational level as well as national level.  Overcomplicated response plans will delay the effectiveness of incident response and escalation  procedures. If policies are loose, the incident response team may lack autonomy to act responsibly. It is  vital that personnel are available to engage in the processes and procedures related to incident response.  It is just as vital that the constituents of the national and governmental CSIRTs are also aware of their parts  in the process of managing an incident.  3.3 Political and legal framework  At a political level there may be a lack of full understanding and appreciation of the importance of  investing resources in incident response activities or difficulty in investing more resources due to a need to  balance different priorities.  Strategies for Incident Response and Cyber Crisis Cooperation  PUBLISHED  |  Version 1.1  |  AUGUST 2016  14  In addition, there might be conflicts of responsibilities or challenges in the cooperation between the  different actors, e.g. authorities responsible for the public network, governmental network, military  networks, classified networks, etc.  An adequate political and legal framework25 can help to define various roles and responsibilities and  enhance the overall cooperation in order to resolve an incident in a timely manner. “Cooperation at  [national and] pan-European level is necessary to effectively prepare, but also respond to cyber-attacks.  Comprehensive national cyber security strategies are the first step in this direction”26. The “cyber  cooperation blueprint” announced by the Commission is a welcome effort in this direction at the European  level27.  3.4 Technology: tools and data  Incident response activities rely on tools to enable the discovery of information about systems and people  involved in an incident. Buying the latest and best equipment will not lead to complete protection against  cyber-attacks if used inadequately, unmanaged, untested, not updated, or if the properly trained human  resources are absent. Therefore, continuous updates and training are essential for incident response  teams. (See section on CSIRT training later.) Whether the decision is self-developed tools or services  procured from vendors, the management of pertinent data is always a challenge.  25 On the topic of legal aspects of information between CSIRTs in Europe, see ENISA, A flair for sharing - encouraging  information exchange between CERTs.

Incident response mechanisms  The previous sections briefly introduced what incident response is, who the main actors are, what  capabilities these entities should possess in order to effectively combat cyber-attacks, and what challenges  there may be that impede efficiency in incident response. This section aims to present important  connections between the main elements of incident response, with more emphasis on the daily technical- operational aspects and less focus on the high-level structures of incident response (sections on cyber  security strategies and cyber crisis management will deal with these aspects later).  In the course of incident response, CSIRTs have to assess the information that characterises the existing  cyber threats and attack vectors and all the data that comes from the logs of the number of electronic  information systems under the scope of the CSIRT/incident response team. Also, any activities carried out  and shared by peer CSIRTs need to be taken into consideration. The correlation between any of these  factors will contribute to mitigating the impact of the incidents.  In general, incident response follows the process below:  Figure 1: The typical incident response process28  28 Retrieved from Good Practice Guide for Incident Management, ENISA, 2010, Figure 6 - Incident handling workflow,  p. 37 - https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practice-guide-for-incident-management  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practice-guide-for-incident-management  Strategies for Incident Response and Cyber Crisis Cooperation  PUBLISHED  |  Version 1.1  |  AUGUST 2016  16  4.1 Current threats and ways to respond  Based on the ENISA Threat Landscape 201529, a comprehensive matrix of current threat ranking is  presented below.

Operating early warning systems, using proactive detection methods, and processing and  exchanging actionable information are all part of the operational-technical capability of a CSIRT.31 While  open source threat information is valuable to CSIRTs, an emerging service is Cyber Threat Intelligence,  which provides added value to the constituents. Cyber Threat Intelligence is evidence-based knowledge,  including context, mechanisms, indicators, implications and actionable advice about an existing or  emerging menace or hazard to assets, that can be used to inform decisions regarding the subject’s  response to that menace or hazard. Based on this, the distinction between information and intelligence  can be classified as follows32:  INFORMATION VERSUS INTELLIGENCE  Raw, unfiltered feed Processed, sorted information  Unevaluated when delivered  Evaluated and interpreted by trained intelligence  analysts  Aggregated from virtually every source  Aggregated from reliable sources and cross-correlated  for accuracy  May be true, false, misleading, incomplete, relevant or  irrelevant  Accurate, timely, complete (as possible), assessed for  relevancy  Not actionable Actionable  Table 3: Information vs. intelligence  Cyber Threat Intelligence comes as a service from specialized IT security service providers. CSIRTs or  network operators should ensure that investment in such a service is based on a clear concept of cost- benefit ratio on IT security.33 The advantage of this service is to be able to issue probability-based warnings  of future cyber-attacks and tailored alerts and warnings to the specific risks and threats of the  constituency.34  30 Adapted from the Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union - http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber- security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf  31 Extensive reading is available on information acquisition and use on ENISA’s CERT support section: e.g. proactive  incident detection (http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/proactive-detection), actionable information  (http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information), or alerts, warnings and  announcements (http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/awa)  32 http://www.isightpartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/iSIGHT_Partners_What_Is_20-20_Clarity_Brief1.pdf  33 Introduction to Return on Security Investment, ENISA, 2012 - http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/other- work/introduction-to-return-on-security-investment/at_download/fullReport  34 National/governmental CERTs; ENISA’s recommendations on baseline capabilities, ENISA, 2014, p.4 -  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/baseline-capabilities/national-governmental-certs-enisas- recommendations-on-baseline-capabilities/at_download/fullReport  http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/proactive-detection http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/awa http://www.isightpartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/iSIGHT_Partners_What_Is_20-20_Clarity_Brief1.pdf http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/other-work/introduction-to-return-on-security-investment/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/other-work/introduction-to-return-on-security-investment/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/baseline-capabilities/national-governmental-certs-enisas-recommendations-on-baseline-capabilities/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/baseline-capabilities/national-governmental-certs-enisas-recommendations-on-baseline-capabilities/at_download/fullReport  Strategies for Incident Response and Cyber Crisis Cooperation  PUBLISHED  |  Version 1.1  |  AUGUST 2016  18  Most national and governmental CSIRTs have established incident detection sensors and properly  implemented Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems35 to gather early warning  intelligence and process threat intelligence. Other detection and early warning arrangements may include  monitoring open sources and media coverage, and information exchange between relevant stakeholders.  This exchange could take place within a critical infrastructure information exchange forum, which in some  cases could include large private companies besides the public stakeholders.36  4.3 Information sharing and incident reporting  Information sharing, as an incident coordination tool, is extensively discussed in ‘Chapter 3’ of WG2 of the  NIS Platform (Voluntary information sharing), while mandatory incident notification, as a tool for impact  assessment, is dealt with in ‘Chapter 5’ (Mandatory incident notification) and is briefly listed above in  ‘Overview and scope of the document’.  35 Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) technology supports threat detection and security incident  response through the real-time collection and historical analysis of security events from a wide variety of event and  contextual data sources. It also supports compliance reporting and incident investigation through analysis of  historical data from these sources. The core capabilities of SIEM technology are a broad scope of event collection and  the ability to correlate and analyze events across disparate sources. http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/security- information-and-event-management-siem/  36 Report on Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Management, ENISA, 2014, p.35 -  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/nis-cooperation-plans/ccc- management/ccc-study/at_download/fullReport  http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/security-information-and-event-management-siem/ http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/security-information-and-event-management-siem/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/nis-cooperation-plans/ccc-management/ccc-study/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/nis-cooperation-plans/ccc-management/ccc-study/at_download/fullReport  Strategies for Incident Response and Cyber Crisis Cooperation  PUBLISHED  |  Version 1.1  |  AUGUST 2016  19  5. Incident response in cyber security strategies  The importance of cyberspace and the digital economy has grown over the last fifteen years. Citizens,  businesses and governments became connected to and dependent on more and more complex ICT  systems; the flow of information is borderless and the amount of data and information produced by each  interaction in the Internet economy is rapidly growing. To safeguard the merits of the Internet, and to  ensure the protection of fundamental rights in cyberspace, a new approach to the cyber world was  adopted. Cyber security strategies started emerging in recognition of the changing security landscape  shifting towards the cyber world. Countries, communities with common interest, and international  organisations started publishing their cyber security strategies.  A national cyber security strategy is a strategic framework for a nation’s approach to cyber security. It is a  tool to improve the security and resilience of national infrastructures and services. It is a high-level,  framework that establishes a range of national objectives and priorities that should be achieved in a  specific timeframe. In general, the key objectives of these security strategies focus on the following  aspects37:   to develop cyber defence policies and capabilities;   to achieve cyber resilience;   to reduce cyber-crime;   to support industry on cyber security;   to secure critical information infrastructures38.  The EU published its own cyber security strategy in 201339, in which the Commission set out goals to  Member States, the private sector and the EU agencies to take steps toward a more resilient European  cyberspace. The EU Cyber Security Strategy explicitly makes reference to the existing gaps in terms of  capacities, coordination and preparedness, where actions not only at EU level but also at national level are  required to follow up the recommendations of the EU Cyber Security Strategy. These proposals focus on  the following three areas:  - Member States should meet the baseline requirements in NIS, by which well-functioning CSIRTs shall be  set up; competent authorities shall be in place in NIS; critical information infrastructures protection will  become a priority; and national NIS strategies and cooperation plans shall be drawn up. The same tasks  shall apply to the EU and its institutions to secure the EU IT systems40.  37 An Evaluation Framework for National Cyber Security Strategies, ENISA, 2014, p.6 -  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/an-evaluation- framework-for-cyber-security-strategies-1/an-evaluation-framework-for-cyber-security- strategies/at_download/fullReport  38 The example is taken from the Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union - http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu- cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf  39 High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Joint Communication on the  Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace, JOIN(2013) 1 final, 07 February  2013 - http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf  40 CERT-EU, the Computer Emergency Response Team responsible for the security of the IT systems of the EU  institutions, agencies and bodies, was set up in 2012.

The tools developed by industry to respond to incidents, identify causes  and conduct forensic investigations should also benefit the public sector.  ENISA has carried out extensive work on national cyber security strategies41 to support Member States in  the development, implementation and evaluation of these strategies to overcome the existing gaps in  terms of capacities, coordination and preparedness. Since each Member State has its own priorities on  cyber security, there is no uniform solution to the content, but as a general guideline, the following  components should be addressed when developing a national cyber security strategy42:   setting the vision, scope, objectives and priorities;   following a national risk assessment approach;   taking stock of existing policies, regulations and capabilities;   developing a clear governance structure;   identifying and engaging stakeholders;   establishing trusted information-sharing mechanisms;   developing national cyber contingency plans;   organising cyber security exercises;   establishing baseline security requirements;   establishing incident reporting mechanisms;   creating user awareness;   fostering R&D;   strengthening training and educational programmes;   establishing an incident response capability;   addressing cyber-crime;   engaging in international cooperation;   establishing a public-private partnership;   balancing security with privacy.  A national cyber incident contingency plan is designed to respond effectively to a large-scale cyber  incident. The focus should be on baseline mechanisms and procedures for communication between  national public and private stakeholders in the event of large-scale cyber disruptions, incident response  and recovery. The national contingency plans should be based on a national cyber risk assessment of  critical information infrastructures and their dependencies.  harm the interests of the EU.

In the particular case of the  Netherlands43, for instance, GOVCERT.NL, the former Computer Emergency Response Team of the Dutch  government, formed the basis of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) tasked with protecting the  national (critical) information infrastructures.  A national cyber security centre may have responsibilities that concentrate on developing and offering  expertise and advice, supporting and implementing responses to threats or incidents, and strengthening  crisis management. A national cyber security centre may also organise and facilitate Information Sharing  and Analysis Centres (ISACs), involving intelligence, CSIRT communities and critical infrastructure  stakeholders in order to facilitate information-sharing in a trustworthy environment. If ISACs are set up, it  also assumes another key element of a national cyber security strategy, which is the establishment of  public-private partnerships (PPPs), where an organised relationship is created between the public and  private sectors to achieve shared goals.44 Revision and evaluation of a national cyber security strategy  must be undertaken at a higher level. Usually this is done through a National Cyber Security Council, which  has members from both the public and private sectors. A council can advise both government and private  parties on relevant developments in the area of cyber security, prioritize specific (emerging) IT threats, and  ensure that basic values are incorporated in the execution of the strategy.45  43 National Cyber Security Strategy 2 ‘From awareness’ (2013), https://www.ncsc.nl/english/current- topics/news/new-cyber-security-strategy-strengthens-cooperation-between-government-and-businesses.html - The  National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) ‘Strength through cooperation’ (2011), https://www.ncsc.nl/english/current- topics/news/national-cyber-security-strategy-launched.html  44 National Cyber Security Strategies; Practical Guide on Development and Execution, ENISA, 2012, p.35 -  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/national-cyber- security-strategies-an-implementation-guide/at_download/fullReport  45 National Cyber Security Strategies; Practical Guide on Development and Execution, ENISA, 2012, p.36 -  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/national-cyber- security-strategies-an-implementation-guide/at_download/fullReport  https://www.ncsc.nl/english/current-topics/news/new-cyber-security-strategy-strengthens-cooperation-between-government-and-businesses.html https://www.ncsc.nl/english/current-topics/news/new-cyber-security-strategy-strengthens-cooperation-between-government-and-businesses.html https://www.ncsc.nl/english/current-topics/news/national-cyber-security-strategy-launched.html https://www.ncsc.nl/english/current-topics/news/national-cyber-security-strategy-launched.html http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/national-cyber-security-strategies-an-implementation-guide/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/national-cyber-security-strategies-an-implementation-guide/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/national-cyber-security-strategies-an-implementation-guide/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/national-cyber-security-strategies-an-implementation-guide/at_download/fullReport  Strategies for Incident Response and Cyber Crisis Cooperation  PUBLISHED  |  Version 1.1  |  AUGUST 2016  22  6. Ways of enhancing incident handling cooperation  6.1 Cyber crisis cooperation and management  By definition, a crisis is ‘an extraordinary event that differs from the normal and involves serious  disturbance or risk for disturbance of vital societal functions’.46 A ‘crisis’ can be defined respectively as an  abnormal and unstable situation that threatens an organisation’s strategic objectives, reputation or  viability. An event that strikes at the heart of the organization”47.  When it comes to defining a cyber crisis, the main difficulty lies in the fact that “the severity of a crisis  tends to be measured by the severity of its impacts”48. In this regard, a crisis triggered by a cybersecurity  incident in the energy sector, would become an energy crisis, not a cyber crisis. “Nevertheless, the  effective mitigation of any sectorial crisis induced by severe cyber incidents, will depend on the effective  mitigation of the causes of the incidents”49. It is therefore essential to further structure the field of cyber  crisis management.  Cyber crises may also transcend national and geographic boundaries50. A proposal for a strong procedural  triple-layered framework for cooperation51 between EU public organisations – supporting the Member  States’ needs – clearly describes a practical approach to the management of large-scale crisis. The  elements that are required for the management of a cyber crisis are broken down into three levels:  - The strategic level is automatically involved when an incident escalates into a crisis with potential  socio-economic impacts.  Possible actors at this level are the heads of departments, cyber security  councils, national defence councils, national crisis management boards, etc. In case several Member  States are impacted by a crisis, high-level EU crisis management mechanisms may be triggered, such  46 Report on Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Management, ENISA, 2014, p.26 -  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/nis-cooperation-plans/ccc- management/ccc-study/at_download/fullReport  47 Report on Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Management, ENISA, 2014, p.28 -  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/nis-cooperation-plans/ccc- management/ccc-study/at_download/fullReport.

Additionally, the European Commission announced  the development of a cyber crisis plan53, following a proposal made by ENISA54.  - The operational level focuses on threat analysis, situational assessment and mitigation action  measures. Actors at this level are cyber security agencies or authorities, governmental CSIRTs,  national communication authorities, and operational crisis management bodies. The recent pan-  European exercises showed that the operational EU cyber community is still in the capability-building  phase and need to increase their efforts in adopting the EU Cyber Standard Operating Procedures (EU-  CSOPs) in their daily work.  - The technical level involves incident handling by monitoring, detecting and handling the incidents,  and alerting and informing the operational level with the appropriate raw technical information.  Actors at this level include the CSIRTs and abuse teams operating at information systems. CSIRTs have  long-standing information exchange channels that work sufficiently on sharing actionable information,  especially in the case of large-scale cyber incidents.  Figure 2: Crisis escalation model based in the EU55  The key in effective cyber crisis coordination is the shared responsibility and comprehensive approach  among the stakeholders, which involves efficient national information exchange mechanisms and cross- border cooperation between the specific management levels. At the operational level, the EU-CSOPs need  52 More information on the EU integrated political crisis response arrangements -  http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/publications/2014/eu-ipcr/  53 Communication on strengthening Europe's cyber resilience system and fostering a competitive and innovative  cybersecurity Industry, European Commission, pp. 4-5 -  http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=16546  54 Common practices of EU-level crisis management and applicability to cyber crises, 2015, p.5 -  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-level-crisis-man/at_download/fullReport  55 Report on Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Management, ENISA, 2014, p.40 -  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/nis-cooperation-plans/ccc- management/ccc-study/at_download/fullReport  http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/publications/2014/eu-ipcr/ http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=16546 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-level-crisis-man/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/nis-cooperation-plans/ccc-management/ccc-study/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/nis-cooperation-plans/ccc-management/ccc-study/at_download/fullReport  Strategies for Incident Response and Cyber Crisis Cooperation  PUBLISHED  |  Version 1.1  |  AUGUST 2016  24  to be formally adopted to ensure the agreed set of roles and actions to be taken in cross-border cyber  crisis management. At the technical level, the future CSIRT Network set out by the NIS Directive, along with  cyber exercises developed by ENISA, will further structure cooperation activities.  Last but not least, ENISA is singularly positioned to provide a complete and consistent picture within  European borders and domains in addition to operating as a focal point for information-sharing. Indeed,  the role of the Agency in the CSIRT Network and the future cooperation platform financed by the  Connecting Europe Facility framework, but also in the development of the European Cyber Standard  Operating Procedures, places ENISA at the centre of the European cyber crisis coordination apparatus. The  ongoing discussions about the ENISA mandate should take these considerations into account, for it could  significantly improve the response of the Union to the next cyber crisis.  6.2 Mutual Aid to boost preparedness  Cyber crisis management is not limited to the mitigation of cyber-attacks only,  but also includes the  handling of low-probability/high-impact events (Black Swan56), which usually occur at the time of natural  disasters, cross-border power outages or failures in communication networks (due to technological or  human errors). This way, end-users, the ICT traffic capacity, or critical infrastructures may be impacted.  Any of these impacts assume a certain level of emergency, where both the physical world and the cyber  domain need to be handled with the appropriate level of contingency.  To improve the level of preparedness to deal with these Black Swan events, ENISA has carried out a series  of studies that deal with the concept of Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructures in Europe (MARIE).57 The  current observations show that Mutual Aid concepts can only be fully exploited if both the public and  private sectors are involved in the mutual aid agreements, and the previously mentioned strategic,  operational and technical areas have their role in the crisis management. Mutual Aid assumes an  efficiently functioning information exchange mechanism and the cross-border interoperability between ICT  systems. Five recommendations have been proposed in the MARIE report58, as listed below:   governments should be responsive in creating an environment that supports private sector initiatives  that seek to establish Mutual Aid assistance by reducing regulatory obstacles;   the private sector should develop and maintain a standard Mutual Aid agreement template;   the private sector entities with critical infrastructure functions should establish formal Mutual Aid  assistance with industry peers, cross-sector entities and governments;   the private sector, in consultation with government, should develop strategies to manage the scarcest  resources in order to provide relief for the affected public(s);   specific plans are needed for the communication of the temporary unavailability of critical  infrastructure functions.  56 http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Black_swan  57 Further information on the topic is available at https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical- infrastructure-and-services/mutual-aid-assistance  58 Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructures in Europe (MARIE): Phase II recommendations report, ENISA, 2013, pp.10- 20 - https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/mutual-aid- assistance/m-a-r-i-e-phase-ii-recommendations-report/at_download/fullReport  http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Black_swan https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/mutual-aid-assistance https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/mutual-aid-assistance https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/mutual-aid-assistance/m-a-r-i-e-phase-ii-recommendations-report/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/mutual-aid-assistance/m-a-r-i-e-phase-ii-recommendations-report/at_download/fullReport  Strategies for Incident Response and Cyber Crisis Cooperation  PUBLISHED  |  Version 1.1  |  AUGUST 2016  25  Figure 3: Incident Preparedness Improvement scheme59  6.3 Exercises to enhance incident handling cooperation  Cyber exercises are an important tool to assess the preparedness of a community against cyber crises,  technology failures and critical information infrastructure incidents. According to the EU Cyber Security  Strategy, exercises at EU level are essential to simulate cooperation among the Member States and the  private sector. The reason for multinational exercises is the fact that the threat of cyber incidents and  attacks is borderless, thus the cross-border crisis cooperation mechanisms need to be tested and validated  from time to time.  ENISA supports the stakeholders involved in EU cyber exercises60. The first exercise involving the Member  States was carried out in 2010 (‘Cyber Europe 201061’), the second exercise took place in October 2012  (‘Cyber Europe 201262’), and the third EU cyber exercise (‘Cyber Europe 201463’) was carried out in October  2014. The first joint EU-US table-top exercise was carried out in November 2011 (‘Cyber Atlantic 2011’).64  Further exercises are planned for the coming years, continuing the Cyber Europe roadmap.

To facilitate the work of Member States, ENISA has produced a training on how to plan cyber exercises65,  with a focus on crisis coordination exercises. Various elements of the cyber security plans can be tested  during an exercise, involving the technical, operational or strategic level, or even all of them, as was the  case in Cyber Europe 2014.  6.4 CSIRT training to enhance capabilities  Last, but not least, training plays an integral part in CSIRT capability enhancement. A number of courses  and modules are available to teach and train the staff at CSIRTs. The section above on ‘Key challenges in  incident response’ already touched upon the topic of staff preparedness in tools and techniques.  This section on training is far from being exhaustive, but it lists the main CSIRT training courses that are  widely available for the European CSIRT community. There are a number of professional organisations  offering training services that focus on incident response in general, or any of its special fields.  The most widely known CSIRT training course is the TRANSITS training, which takes place at least twice a  year.  ENISA facilitates and supports the TRANSITS courses. The TRANSITS programme consists of basic and  advanced (hands-on) courses. The course materials were developed by the former TERENA66 in  collaboration with members of its Task Force of Computer Security Incident Response Teams (TF-CSIRT)  and are regularly updated. The TRANSITS-I67 course is aimed at new or potential CSIRT personnel who wish  to gain a good grounding in the main aspects of working in an incident handling and response team. The  topics include: 1) organisational, 2) technical, 3) operational, and 4) legal issues. The TRANSITS-II68 course is  aimed at more experienced personnel working for established CSIRTs. It provides an in-depth study of key  areas in incident handling and response operations, training in how to improve communications with  constituents, along with practical exercises. The advanced topics of the course include: 1) netflow analysis,  2) forensics, 3) communication, and 4) CSIRT exercises.  ENISA also plays an important role in CSIRT training. It has developed a number of training resources that  form a module which can be used in organising successful training events or adding a hands-on component  to conferences. The ENISA CSIRT training material was introduced in 2008, and was complemented with  new exercise scenarios in 2012, 2013 and 2014. The material contains essential components for success in  the CSIRT community and in the field of information security. The ENISA website contains the ENISA CSIRT  training resources, including a handbook for teachers, a toolset for students and Virtual Image to support  hands-on training sessions. Most of the training can therefore be undertaken by using this material. ENISA  also offers on-site training. Requests for these training sessions must typically go through the national and  governmental CSIRT or another competent authority of an EU Member State. The training resources are  structured around: 1) technical, 2) operational, 3) setting up a CSIRT, and 4) legal and co-operational  issues. The materials vary from hands-on technical scenarios to handbooks and toolsets.

FIRST, as the largest global CSIRT community, places emphasis on technical CSIRT staff training that focuses  on current threats and trends.70 In the past, FIRST has provided its expertise to the TRANSITS courses and it  has also organised hands-on technical courses co-located with the TF-CSIRT TI events. FIRST, as a global  organisation, plans to develop an education programme for CSIRTs around the world with the help of the  global security community. The development of a curriculum based on ‘CSIRT Services Framework’ will be  a collaboration by the community and convened by FIRST.71  69 More information on ENISA’s training materials - http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/training  70 FIRST Symposia, Technical Colloquia, and Workshops - https://www.first.org/events  71 https://www.first.org/global/education  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/training https://www.first.org/events https://www.first.org/global/education  Strategies for Incident Response and Cyber Crisis Cooperation  PUBLISHED  |  Version 1.1  |  AUGUST 2016  28  7. Conclusions  WG2 of the NIS Platform is tasked with addressing the sharing of cyber threat information and incident  coordination in both the public and private segments of the EU. Incident response is among its objectives  to identify requirements and issue recommendations on sharing cyber threat information as well as  appropriate incident management processes in order to better prevent and best respond to cyber  incidents.  There is a wide range of mechanisms that cover the cyber security landscape of a Member State. Incident  response is just one of many. CSIRTs, as privileged players in incident response, fulfil their roles as defined  by the national plans in cyber security.  The aim of this document is to support and instigate discussion between WG2 members of the NIS  Platform on the topic of incident response and cyber crisis coordination and serve as input for the  compilation of a related deliverable by the WG.  This document set out to introduce the reader to the basics of incident response on a high level. Besides  the main definitions and stakeholders, the separate section was dedicated to the main CSIRT capabilities  regarded as ‘baseline’ which are a desired requirement in the EU Cyber Security Strategy. Some key  challenges were raised on the typical issues that slow the incident response mechanisms, and to address  these challenges, ways of enhancing incident handling cooperation were given.

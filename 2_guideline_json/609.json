However, practical  observations show that iteration is often neglected in risk management. There are always “good  reasons” to avoid iteration of existing assessments: shift of focus, budget cuts, planning cycles,  changing strategic priorities, reorganisations, to name but a few. This is unfortunate because  iteration is the only path to maturity improvement: it enhances available knowledge, leads to better  assessments, to corrective measures and improves the quality of subsequent assessments. All in all,  it helps in understanding reality and smoothly adapting mitigation strategies. In the dynamic cyber  security ecosystem this is THE key capability. Bertolt Brecht understood this long before information  technology, risk and threat analysis:  “Taught only by reality can reality be changed”  With this in mind, ENISA presents in this short paper a first “taste” of current developments related  to the Threat Landscape 2013. The objectives of this short report are the following:  - To get better: Improve our assessment capabilities with regard to emerging trends in cyber  security by validating 2012’s assessed threat trends1;  - To reflect the reality: Deliver a consolidated view of the current threat landscape while at the  same time providing the grounds for observed deviations;  - To flag new developments: Inform the public as early as possible about developments from our  on-going information collection. The collected information comes mainly from reports published  during 2013 and covers the 1st half of 2013.  The reality check of 2012’s assessment is depicted in Figure 1. The notation used for this reality  check is the following:  - The prioritization of threats has been taken “as is” from the 2012 assessment.  - Changes in trends  - indicated through the arrows - are commented on in the accompanying text.  - We then briefly comment on important issues identified in 2013 regarding the top threats along  with references to relevant sources.  An updated prioritization, detailed analysis of threats, trends, threat agents and attack vectors will  be delivered in the full ENISA Threat Landscape report to be published before the end of 2013.  1  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-  environment/ENISA_Threat_Landscape/at_download/fullReport, accessed 22 August 2013.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/ENISA_Threat_Landscape/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/ENISA_Threat_Landscape/at_download/fullReport  ENISA Threat Landscape, Mid-year 2013  Reality check of 2012’s assessment and more - September 2013  Page  2 of 5  Top Threats  Trends assessed  in 2012  Current trends  mid 2013  1.

An advantage of URLs as a distribution mechanism lies in the fact that URLs are  not such an easy target for law enforcement takedowns. It has been reported that there is an  increase in the rate of suspicious URLs compared with 20123. Concluding, one can say that browser- based attacks still remain the most repored threats, whereas Java remains the most exploited  software4,5 for the materialization of this threat.  Code Injection: A notable issue with regard to this threat is attacks against popular Content  Management Systems (CMSs). Due to their wide use, popular CMSs make up a considerable attack  surface that has drawn the attention of cyber-criminals6,7. Although no important changes have been  reported in 2013 regarding this threat, it is worth noting that cloud service provider networks are  used increasingly to host tools for automated attacks8, thus implementing an important step in code  injection attack vectors.  Botnets: Although there is a shift to URLs for malware infection (see Drive-by-exploits above), there  are further interesting developments with regard to this threat. Although not new, an interesting  aspect of botnet activity reported, is the use of botnet infrastructure to mine Bitcoins9. Another  important development is the increased use of P2P botnets10. Such botnets are difficult (yet not  impossible 11 ) to locate and take down. Moreover, in Internet Census 2012 12  it has been  demonstrated how easy is to create botnet infrastructures by misusing weaknesses in security of  massively deployed devices. The Browser-Based botnets is yet another example on how easy is to  create a very large botnet infrastructure13. Finally it is interesting to observe a rise in TOR-based  botnets14, while more “traditional” botnet operations seem to be in decline, reportedly due the low  interest in “traditional” botnet “business cases”15.  2  http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/reports/rp-quarterly-threat-q1-2013.pdf, accessed 22 August 2013.  3  http://www.securelist.com/en/analysis/204792292/IT_Threat_Evolution_Q1_2013, accessed 22 August 2013.  4 http://www.kaspersky.com/about/news/virus/2012/Oracle_Java_surpasses_Adobe_Reader_as_the_most_frequently_ex  ploited_software, accessed 22 August 2013.  5  http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2013/07/18/561078/10041006/en/Bit9-Research-Shows-Java-is-Most-  Targeted-Endpoint-Technology-for-Cyber-Attacks-Widely-Deployed-Older-Versions-Represent-Greatest-Risk.html,  accessed 22 August 2013.  6  http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/CMSs-mostly-vulnerable-through-addons-says-German-security-agency-  1894431.html, accessed 22 August 2013.  7  http://securitywatch.pcmag.com/security/310350-wordpress-joomla-sites-under-brute-force-password-attack, accessed  22 August 2013.  8  http://www.firehost.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/firehost-report-suggests-commodity-cloud-providers-are-  bolstering-botnet-agility, accessed 22 August 2013.  9  http://www.fortinet.com/press_releases/2013/fortiguard_threat_landscape_research_team_reports.html, accessed 22  August 2013.  10  http://www.csoonline.com/article/734485/malware-increasingly-uses-p2p-communications-researchers-say?page=1,  accessed 22 August 2013.  11  https://threatpost.com/peer-to-peer-botnets-resilient-to-takedown-attempts, accessed 22 August 2013.  12  http://internetcensus2012.bitbucket.org/paper.html, accessed 22 August 2013.  13  http://www.itworld.com/security/366872/black-hat-ad-networks-lay-path-million-strong-browser-botnet, accessed 22  August 2013.  14  http://www.welivesecurity.com/2013/07/24/the-rise-of-tor-based-botnets/, accessed 22 August 2013.  15  http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/reports/rp-quarterly-threat-q1-2013.pdf, accessed 22 August 2013.  http://www.securelist.com/en/analysis/204792292/IT_Threat_Evolution_Q1_2013 http://www.kaspersky.com/about/news/virus/2012/Oracle_Java_surpasses_Adobe_Reader_as_the_most_frequently_exploited_software http://www.kaspersky.com/about/news/virus/2012/Oracle_Java_surpasses_Adobe_Reader_as_the_most_frequently_exploited_software http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2013/07/18/561078/10041006/en/Bit9-Research-Shows-Java-is-Most-Targeted-Endpoint-Technology-for-Cyber-Attacks-Widely-Deployed-Older-Versions-Represent-Greatest-Risk.html http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2013/07/18/561078/10041006/en/Bit9-Research-Shows-Java-is-Most-Targeted-Endpoint-Technology-for-Cyber-Attacks-Widely-Deployed-Older-Versions-Represent-Greatest-Risk.html http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/CMSs-mostly-vulnerable-through-addons-says-German-security-agency-1894431.html http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/CMSs-mostly-vulnerable-through-addons-says-German-security-agency-1894431.html http://securitywatch.pcmag.com/security/310350-wordpress-joomla-sites-under-brute-force-password-attack http://www.firehost.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/firehost-report-suggests-commodity-cloud-providers-are-bolstering-botnet-agility http://www.firehost.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/firehost-report-suggests-commodity-cloud-providers-are-bolstering-botnet-agility http://www.fortinet.com/press_releases/2013/fortiguard_threat_landscape_research_team_reports.html http://www.csoonline.com/article/734485/malware-increasingly-uses-p2p-communications-researchers-say?page=1 https://threatpost.com/peer-to-peer-botnets-resilient-to-takedown-attempts http://internetcensus2012.bitbucket.org/paper.html http://www.itworld.com/security/366872/black-hat-ad-networks-lay-path-million-strong-browser-botnet http://www.welivesecurity.com/2013/07/24/the-rise-of-tor-based-botnets/ http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/reports/rp-quarterly-threat-q1-2013.pdf  ENISA Threat Landscape, Mid-year 2013  Reality check of 2012’s assessment and more - September 2013  Page  4 of 5  Denial of Service: After the Spamhaus16 attack, DNS reflection attacks have gained in popularity17,18.  Attackers seem to have adopted the DNS reflection technique to launch amplification attacks, an old  technique that has made a come-back. Moreover, attack bandwidths achieved have reached  impressive levels: the rate of 2-10Gbps attacks has doubled19 and the level of 300Gbps attack was  reached in 201320.  Rogueware/Scareware: In 2013 there was an increase in rogueware/scareware reported. Despite  recent law enforcement advances21, the reports analysed provide strong evidence that there is an  increase in ransomware threat. One reason for the growth is the expansion of ransomware and fake  Antivirus distribution to mobile platforms, such as Android22,23. In all cases, the availability of  anonymous payment services to channel illegal profits obtained from this threat is a key enabler for  this kind of fraud24.  Targeted Attacks: In first half of 2013, targeted attacks demonstrated  their effectivenes in achieving  their objectives. In particular, cyber espionage attacks reached a dimension that went far beyond  expectations25. Again, the proliferation of mobile devices delivers a wide exploitation surface for this  kind of threats26. It is worth mentioning that mobile spyware applications might become strong tools  for APTs targeting Bring Your Own Device environments27.  Identity Theft: This threat led to some of the most successful attacks by abusing SMS-forwarders to  achieve significant financial fraud28. These attacks were based on known financial trojans (e.g. Zeus,  SpyEye, Citadel 29 ) that have been implemented on mobile platforms and attack 2-factor  authentication30. A significant source for applying this threat remains social media31. It is worth  mentioning that an increase in malicious browser extensions has been registered, aimed at taking  over social network accounts32.  Search Engine Poisoning: In the first half of this year not many references to this threat have been  found. One reference about better defence levels against this threat stated that the relevant  defences of Google33 seemed to reduce this threat. As with many other threats, Search Engine  Poisoning has also gone mobile: some reports on malicious mobile apps performing Search Engine  16  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/flash-note-can-recent-attacks-really-threaten-internet- availability/at_download/fullReport, accessed 22 August 2013.  17  http://www.akamai.com/stateoftheinternet/, accessed 22 August 2013.  18  https://www.prolexic.com/knowledge-center-ddos-attack-report-2013-q2/pr.html, accessed 22 August 2013.  19  http://www.arbornetworks.com/corporate/blog/4922-q2-key-findings-from-atlas, accessed 22 August 2013.  20  http://www.arbornetworks.com/corporate/blog/4813-putting-the-spamhouse-ddos-attack-in-perspective, accessed 22  August 2013.  21  https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/police-dismantle-prolific-ransomware-cybercriminal-network, accessed 22  August 2013.  22  http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/fakeav-holds-android-phones-ransom, accessed 22 August 2013.  23  https://www.infoworld.com/t/mobile-security/ransomware-android-it-was-only-matter-of-time-221285, accessed 22  August 2013.  24  http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/reports/rp-quarterly-threat-q1-2013.pdf, accessed 22 August 2013.  25  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/cyber-attacks-2013-a-new-edge-for-old- weapons/at_download/fullReport, accessed 22 August 2013.  26  https://www.securelist.com/en/blog/208194186/, accessed 22 August 2013.  27  http://www.kindsight.net/sites/default/files/Kindsight-Q2-2013-Malware-Report.pdf, accessed 22 August 2013.  28  http://www.cs.stevens.edu/~spock/Eurograbber_White_Paper.pdf, accessed 22 August 2013.  29  http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-citadel-trojan.pdf, accessed 22 August 2013.  30  http://www.emc.com/collateral/fraud-report/current-state-cybercrime-2013.pdf, accessed 22 August 2013.  31  http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/03/malware-that-drains-your-bank-account-thriving-on-facebook/, accessed 22  August 2013.  32  https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/other_resources/b-intelligence_report_05-2013.en-us.pdf,  accessed 22 August 2013.  33  https://www.bluecoat.com/security-blog/2013-04-05/search-engine-poisoning-brief-update, accessed 22 August 2013.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/flash-note-can-recent-attacks-really-threaten-internet-availability/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/flash-note-can-recent-attacks-really-threaten-internet-availability/at_download/fullReport http://www.akamai.com/stateoftheinternet/ https://www.prolexic.com/knowledge-center-ddos-attack-report-2013-q2/pr.html http://www.arbornetworks.com/corporate/blog/4922-q2-key-findings-from-atlas http://www.arbornetworks.com/corporate/blog/4813-putting-the-spamhouse-ddos-attack-in-perspective https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/police-dismantle-prolific-ransomware-cybercriminal-network http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/fakeav-holds-android-phones-ransom https://www.infoworld.com/t/mobile-security/ransomware-android-it-was-only-matter-of-time-221285 http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/reports/rp-quarterly-threat-q1-2013.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/cyber-attacks-2013-a-new-edge-for-old-weapons/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/cyber-attacks-2013-a-new-edge-for-old-weapons/at_download/fullReport https://www.securelist.com/en/blog/208194186/ http://www.kindsight.net/sites/default/files/Kindsight-Q2-2013-Malware-Report.pdf http://www.cs.stevens.edu/~spock/Eurograbber_White_Paper.pdf http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-citadel-trojan.pdf http://www.emc.com/collateral/fraud-report/current-state-cybercrime-2013.pdf http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/03/malware-that-drains-your-bank-account-thriving-on-facebook/ https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/other_resources/b-intelligence_report_05-2013.en-us.pdf https://www.bluecoat.com/security-blog/2013-04-05/search-engine-poisoning-brief-update  ENISA Threat Landscape, Mid-year 2013  Reality check of 2012’s assessment and more - September 2013  Page  5 of 5  Optimization poisoning have been found34, 35. As ENISA sees this threat as an important part of  malicious code attack vectors, we will continue observing developments in this area.  Concluding remarks  When we look at 2013 and beyond, the following developments regarding the threat landscape can  be observed:   Cyber-criminals increasingly use advanced methods to implement attack vectors that are  non-traceable and difficult to take down. An important role in this play: anonymization  technologies and the use of distributed technologies for more “resilient” infrastructures,  such as P2P.   It is clear that mobile technology is, and will increasingly become, exploited by cyber- criminals. Threats of all kinds that were encountered in the more traditional arena of IT will  prevail on mobile devices and the services available on these platforms. The proliferation of  mobile devices will lead to an amplification of abuse based on knowledge/attack vectors  targeting to social media.   The consumerization of malware, cyber-hacking tools and services, together with the  availability of digital currencies and anonymous payment services, will open up new avenues  for cyber-fraud and criminal activity.   There is a real possibility of large impact events when attacks combining the above threats  are successfully launched. A characteristic impact from such attacks is described in the risk  of digital wildfires that was assessed in the beginning of 201336.   As reported by ENISA37, cyber-attacks are the 6th most important cause of outages in  telecommunication infrastructures, with an impact on considerable numbers of users in this  sector. Taking into account incidents16 of the first half of this year, and also developments in  the denial of service threat, we see an increase of infrastructure threats in 2013. When  additional sectors and assets are being considered, the impact of cyber-attacks will be better  analysed and understood.  34  https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/other_resources/b-istr_appendices_v18_2012_221284438.en- us.pdf, accessed 22 August 2013.  35  http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/reports/rp-mobile-security-consumer-trends.pdf, accessed 22 August 2013.  36  http://forumblog.org/2013/04/digital-wildfires-fast-flaring-easily-doused/, accessed 22 August 2013.  37  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports- 2012/at_download/fullReport, accessed 22 August 2013.  https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/other_resources/b-istr_appendices_v18_2012_221284438.en-us.pdf https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/other_resources/b-istr_appendices_v18_2012_221284438.en-us.pdf http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/reports/rp-mobile-security-consumer-trends.pdf http://forumblog.org/2013/04/digital-wildfires-fast-flaring-easily-doused/ http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2012/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2012/at_download/fullReport",

Finally it is interesting to observe a rise in TOR-based  botnets14, while more “traditional” botnet operations seem to be in decline, reportedly due the low  interest in “traditional” botnet “business cases”15.  2  http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/reports/rp-quarterly-threat-q1-2013.pdf, accessed 22 August 2013.  3  http://www.securelist.com/en/analysis/204792292/IT_Threat_Evolution_Q1_2013, accessed 22 August 2013.  4 http://www.kaspersky.com/about/news/virus/2012/Oracle_Java_surpasses_Adobe_Reader_as_the_most_frequently_ex  ploited_software, accessed 22 August 2013.  5  http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2013/07/18/561078/10041006/en/Bit9-Research-Shows-Java-is-Most-  Targeted-Endpoint-Technology-for-Cyber-Attacks-Widely-Deployed-Older-Versions-Represent-Greatest-Risk.html,  accessed 22 August 2013.  6  http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/CMSs-mostly-vulnerable-through-addons-says-German-security-agency-  1894431.html, accessed 22 August 2013.  7  http://securitywatch.pcmag.com/security/310350-wordpress-joomla-sites-under-brute-force-password-attack, accessed  22 August 2013.  8  http://www.firehost.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/firehost-report-suggests-commodity-cloud-providers-are-  bolstering-botnet-agility, accessed 22 August 2013.  9  http://www.fortinet.com/press_releases/2013/fortiguard_threat_landscape_research_team_reports.html, accessed 22  August 2013.  10  http://www.csoonline.com/article/734485/malware-increasingly-uses-p2p-communications-researchers-say?page=1,  accessed 22 August 2013.  11  https://threatpost.com/peer-to-peer-botnets-resilient-to-takedown-attempts, accessed 22 August 2013.  12  http://internetcensus2012.bitbucket.org/paper.html, accessed 22 August 2013.  13  http://www.itworld.com/security/366872/black-hat-ad-networks-lay-path-million-strong-browser-botnet, accessed 22  August 2013.  14  http://www.welivesecurity.com/2013/07/24/the-rise-of-tor-based-botnets/, accessed 22 August 2013.  15  http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/reports/rp-quarterly-threat-q1-2013.pdf, accessed 22 August 2013.  http://www.securelist.com/en/analysis/204792292/IT_Threat_Evolution_Q1_2013 http://www.kaspersky.com/about/news/virus/2012/Oracle_Java_surpasses_Adobe_Reader_as_the_most_frequently_exploited_software http://www.kaspersky.com/about/news/virus/2012/Oracle_Java_surpasses_Adobe_Reader_as_the_most_frequently_exploited_software http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2013/07/18/561078/10041006/en/Bit9-Research-Shows-Java-is-Most-Targeted-Endpoint-Technology-for-Cyber-Attacks-Widely-Deployed-Older-Versions-Represent-Greatest-Risk.html http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2013/07/18/561078/10041006/en/Bit9-Research-Shows-Java-is-Most-Targeted-Endpoint-Technology-for-Cyber-Attacks-Widely-Deployed-Older-Versions-Represent-Greatest-Risk.html http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/CMSs-mostly-vulnerable-through-addons-says-German-security-agency-1894431.html http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/CMSs-mostly-vulnerable-through-addons-says-German-security-agency-1894431.html http://securitywatch.pcmag.com/security/310350-wordpress-joomla-sites-under-brute-force-password-attack http://www.firehost.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/firehost-report-suggests-commodity-cloud-providers-are-bolstering-botnet-agility http://www.firehost.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/firehost-report-suggests-commodity-cloud-providers-are-bolstering-botnet-agility http://www.fortinet.com/press_releases/2013/fortiguard_threat_landscape_research_team_reports.html http://www.csoonline.com/article/734485/malware-increasingly-uses-p2p-communications-researchers-say?page=1 https://threatpost.com/peer-to-peer-botnets-resilient-to-takedown-attempts http://internetcensus2012.bitbucket.org/paper.html http://www.itworld.com/security/366872/black-hat-ad-networks-lay-path-million-strong-browser-botnet http://www.welivesecurity.com/2013/07/24/the-rise-of-tor-based-botnets/ http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/reports/rp-quarterly-threat-q1-2013.pdf  ENISA Threat Landscape, Mid-year 2013  Reality check of 2012’s assessment and more - September 2013  Page  4 of 5  Denial of Service: After the Spamhaus16 attack, DNS reflection attacks have gained in popularity17,18.  Attackers seem to have adopted the DNS reflection technique to launch amplification attacks, an old  technique that has made a come-back. Moreover, attack bandwidths achieved have reached  impressive levels: the rate of 2-10Gbps attacks has doubled19 and the level of 300Gbps attack was  reached in 201320.  Rogueware/Scareware: In 2013 there was an increase in rogueware/scareware reported. Despite  recent law enforcement advances21, the reports analysed provide strong evidence that there is an  increase in ransomware threat. One reason for the growth is the expansion of ransomware and fake  Antivirus distribution to mobile platforms, such as Android22,23. In all cases, the availability of  anonymous payment services to channel illegal profits obtained from this threat is a key enabler for  this kind of fraud24.  Targeted Attacks: In first half of 2013, targeted attacks demonstrated  their effectivenes in achieving  their objectives. In particular, cyber espionage attacks reached a dimension that went far beyond  expectations25. Again, the proliferation of mobile devices delivers a wide exploitation surface for this  kind of threats26. It is worth mentioning that mobile spyware applications might become strong tools  for APTs targeting Bring Your Own Device environments27.  Identity Theft: This threat led to some of the most successful attacks by abusing SMS-forwarders to  achieve significant financial fraud28. These attacks were based on known financial trojans (e.g. Zeus,  SpyEye, Citadel 29 ) that have been implemented on mobile platforms and attack 2-factor  authentication30. A significant source for applying this threat remains social media31. It is worth  mentioning that an increase in malicious browser extensions has been registered, aimed at taking  over social network accounts32.  Search Engine Poisoning: In the first half of this year not many references to this threat have been  found. One reference about better defence levels against this threat stated that the relevant  defences of Google33 seemed to reduce this threat. As with many other threats, Search Engine  Poisoning has also gone mobile: some reports on malicious mobile apps performing Search Engine  16  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/flash-note-can-recent-attacks-really-threaten-internet- availability/at_download/fullReport, accessed 22 August 2013.  17  http://www.akamai.com/stateoftheinternet/, accessed 22 August 2013.  18  https://www.prolexic.com/knowledge-center-ddos-attack-report-2013-q2/pr.html, accessed 22 August 2013.  19  http://www.arbornetworks.com/corporate/blog/4922-q2-key-findings-from-atlas, accessed 22 August 2013.  20  http://www.arbornetworks.com/corporate/blog/4813-putting-the-spamhouse-ddos-attack-in-perspective, accessed 22  August 2013.  21  https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/police-dismantle-prolific-ransomware-cybercriminal-network, accessed 22  August 2013.  22  http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/fakeav-holds-android-phones-ransom, accessed 22 August 2013.  23  https://www.infoworld.com/t/mobile-security/ransomware-android-it-was-only-matter-of-time-221285, accessed 22  August 2013.  24  http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/reports/rp-quarterly-threat-q1-2013.pdf, accessed 22 August 2013.  25  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/cyber-attacks-2013-a-new-edge-for-old- weapons/at_download/fullReport, accessed 22 August 2013.  26  https://www.securelist.com/en/blog/208194186/, accessed 22 August 2013.  27  http://www.kindsight.net/sites/default/files/Kindsight-Q2-2013-Malware-Report.pdf, accessed 22 August 2013.  28  http://www.cs.stevens.edu/~spock/Eurograbber_White_Paper.pdf, accessed 22 August 2013.  29  http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-citadel-trojan.pdf, accessed 22 August 2013.  30  http://www.emc.com/collateral/fraud-report/current-state-cybercrime-2013.pdf, accessed 22 August 2013.  31  http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/03/malware-that-drains-your-bank-account-thriving-on-facebook/, accessed 22  August 2013.  32  https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/other_resources/b-intelligence_report_05-2013.en-us.pdf,  accessed 22 August 2013.  33  https://www.bluecoat.com/security-blog/2013-04-05/search-engine-poisoning-brief-update, accessed 22 August 2013.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/flash-note-can-recent-attacks-really-threaten-internet-availability/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/flash-note-can-recent-attacks-really-threaten-internet-availability/at_download/fullReport http://www.akamai.com/stateoftheinternet/ https://www.prolexic.com/knowledge-center-ddos-attack-report-2013-q2/pr.html http://www.arbornetworks.com/corporate/blog/4922-q2-key-findings-from-atlas http://www.arbornetworks.com/corporate/blog/4813-putting-the-spamhouse-ddos-attack-in-perspective https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/police-dismantle-prolific-ransomware-cybercriminal-network http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/fakeav-holds-android-phones-ransom https://www.infoworld.com/t/mobile-security/ransomware-android-it-was-only-matter-of-time-221285 http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/reports/rp-quarterly-threat-q1-2013.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/cyber-attacks-2013-a-new-edge-for-old-weapons/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/cyber-attacks-2013-a-new-edge-for-old-weapons/at_download/fullReport https://www.securelist.com/en/blog/208194186/ http://www.kindsight.net/sites/default/files/Kindsight-Q2-2013-Malware-Report.pdf http://www.cs.stevens.edu/~spock/Eurograbber_White_Paper.pdf http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-citadel-trojan.pdf http://www.emc.com/collateral/fraud-report/current-state-cybercrime-2013.pdf http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/03/malware-that-drains-your-bank-account-thriving-on-facebook/ https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/other_resources/b-intelligence_report_05-2013.en-us.pdf https://www.bluecoat.com/security-blog/2013-04-05/search-engine-poisoning-brief-update  ENISA Threat Landscape, Mid-year 2013  Reality check of 2012’s assessment and more - September 2013  Page  5 of 5  Optimization poisoning have been found34, 35. As ENISA sees this threat as an important part of  malicious code attack vectors, we will continue observing developments in this area.  Concluding remarks  When we look at 2013 and beyond, the following developments regarding the threat landscape can  be observed:   Cyber-criminals increasingly use advanced methods to implement attack vectors that are  non-traceable and difficult to take down. An important role in this play: anonymization  technologies and the use of distributed technologies for more “resilient” infrastructures,  such as P2P.   It is clear that mobile technology is, and will increasingly become, exploited by cyber- criminals. Threats of all kinds that were encountered in the more traditional arena of IT will  prevail on mobile devices and the services available on these platforms. The proliferation of  mobile devices will lead to an amplification of abuse based on knowledge/attack vectors  targeting to social media.   The consumerization of malware, cyber-hacking tools and services, together with the  availability of digital currencies and anonymous payment services, will open up new avenues  for cyber-fraud and criminal activity.   There is a real possibility of large impact events when attacks combining the above threats  are successfully launched. A characteristic impact from such attacks is described in the risk  of digital wildfires that was assessed in the beginning of 201336.   As reported by ENISA37, cyber-attacks are the 6th most important cause of outages in  telecommunication infrastructures, with an impact on considerable numbers of users in this  sector. Taking into account incidents16 of the first half of this year, and also developments in  the denial of service threat, we see an increase of infrastructure threats in 2013. When  additional sectors and assets are being considered, the impact of cyber-attacks will be better  analysed and understood.  34  https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/other_resources/b-istr_appendices_v18_2012_221284438.en- us.pdf, accessed 22 August 2013.  35  http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/reports/rp-mobile-security-consumer-trends.pdf, accessed 22 August 2013.  36  http://forumblog.org/2013/04/digital-wildfires-fast-flaring-easily-doused/, accessed 22 August 2013.  37  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports- 2012/at_download/fullReport, accessed 22 August 2013.  https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/other_resources/b-istr_appendices_v18_2012_221284438.en-us.pdf https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/other_resources/b-istr_appendices_v18_2012_221284438.en-us.pdf http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/reports/rp-mobile-security-consumer-trends.pdf http://forumblog.org/2013/04/digital-wildfires-fast-flaring-easily-doused/ http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2012/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2012/at_download/fullReport",

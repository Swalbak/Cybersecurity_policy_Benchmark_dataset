This has been a year of changes, largely characterised  by two major events:  • Firstly, the EU’s cyber security strategy was  published. This pushed cyber security to  the political level, where three European  commissioners joined forces to conduct a  comprehensive analysis of the situation and  propose remedies for Europe as we move ahead.  • Secondly, in this new political landscape, the  successful final negotiation and consequent  adoption of our new mandate occurred on 18th  June 2013. One of its effects is that the “General  Report” will be called the “Annual Activity Report”  in the future.  In 2013, we also welcomed a new Chair of the  Management Board, Mr Jörgen Samuelsson of Sweden,  while at the same time thanking the outgoing Chair  from Finland, Mrs Mari Herranen for her excellent work.  The message underlying this report is that ENISA  continues to be a recognised player and trusted partner  for the Member States of the European Union and  globally. Our experience, insight, expertise and added  value have become increasingly acknowledged and  appreciated among all cyber security actors; Member  states, EU institutions, policy makers and practitioners  in industry, academia, as well as citizens. In all, 2013 has  probably been ENISA’s most challenging year and at the  same time its most successful year to date. Our Work  Programme tasks were completed on time and within  budget. The level of financial performance that ENISA  achieved was very high, especially given the challenges  that we faced. Not the least of these challenges was the  transfer of ENISA’s operational staff from Heraklion to  Athens, which happened without any disruption to our  planned activities.  For an agency in the field of cyber security, which faces  a constantly evolving threat environment, our success is  measured by the accuracy of our insight and the value  of our recommendations rather than by how well we  performed in the past. The borders between the virtual  and real worlds are dissolving, as new technologies,  services and business models push existing concepts  and regulation to their limits. The organisational  structures and physical barriers that ensured security  in the past are now largely obsolete, and in some  cases, have been breached by cyber threats that are  continually evolving. Taking positive, concrete steps to  manage these challenges requires that we acknowledge  the risks and costs of not addressing the challenges. It  requires increased cooperation between all actors at all  levels. Whilst cooperation will not happen overnight,  ENISA will continue to bring communities together and  to encourage information exchange that is based on  concrete goals. This will lay the foundation for a more  effective collaboration model in the years to come. As  part of this approach, ENISA signed a Memorandum  of Understanding with CEN/CENELEC and initiated  preparations to renew with Europol and ETSI in 2014.  2  Whilst the following are just a few of the highlights of  this year’s work, they perfectly illustrate the contribution  that the Agency is making to a more secure Europe:  • The ENISA Cloud Report.  • The ENISA annual Threat Landscape Report.  • In terms of the development of ENISA’s activities,  the Agency followed up on last year’s success as  the principal player in Europe’s Cyber Incident  Reporting framework, under Article 13a of the  EU’s Telecommunications Framework Regulation.  • In the area of Computer Emergency Response  Teams (CERTs), the Agency continued to  strengthen cooperation within the CERT  community.  • We hosted the 2nd cyber security crisis  cooperation conference as well as the ENISA  annual conference for stakeholders in Brussels at  the end of the year.  • The first fully fledged European Cyber Security  Month (ECSM) took place in October and involved  several Member States and other stakeholders.  In addition to the above planned activities, ENISA  responded swiftly and professionally to an increasing  number of requests for assistance (the so-called ‘Article  14 Requests’) from the Member States.  Looking to the future, it is clear that the new ENISA  Regulation, adopted by the European Parliament and  the Council of Ministers in 2013, will allow the Agency  to support the Member States more effectively in the  future. Although there is still a significant amount of  work to be done to achieve the vision of a harmonised  approach to cyber security across the EU, it is  encouraging to note that significant progress has been  made in collaborating across communities and across  national boundaries. ENISA is proud to have contributed  to these improvements.  Finally, I would like to say that I am grateful for the hard  work, dedication and support of all of the Agency’s staff,  the members of its Permanent Stakeholders Group,  as well as guidance received from the Management  Board. All of these actors enabled the Agency to meet  its commitments to Europe successfully, despite the  challenging new conditions and increased workload  throughout the year.

(ENISA) IN BRIEF  ENISA was established in 2004 by Regulation (EC)  No. 460/2004 of the European Parliament and the  Council. This regulation was subsequently amended  by Regulation (EC) No. 1007/2008 of the European  Parliament and the Council and Regulation (EC) No.  580/2011 of the European Parliament and the Council,  extending ENISA’s mandate until 13 September 2013.  Regulation (EU) No. 526/2013 of the European  Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013  concerning the European Union Agency for Network  and Information Security and repealing Regulation  (EC) No. 460/2004 (“Regulation (EU) No. 526/2013”)  further extended ENISA’s mandate until 19 June 2020.  The Agency is governed by a Management Board (MB)  composed of one representative from each EU Member  State and EEA country (Iceland, Liechtenstein, and  Norway), and two representatives from the European  Commission. On 17 October 2013, the MB established  the Executive Board to enhance the effectiveness and  efficiency of the operations of the Agency.  ENISA is managed by its Executive Director, who is  appointed by the Management Board from a list of  candidates proposed by the European Commission and  following a hearing in the European Parliament.  The  Agency’s headquarters is in Heraklion, Crete, Greece,  with a branch office in Athens, Greece.  The ENISA Management Board (MB) and the Permanent  Stakeholders Group (PSG), the latter consisting  of 30 leading experts in network and information  security acting independently of Member States and  companies, assists ENISA by providing advice to extend  the Agency’s networking and information gathering  capabilities.  In line with established practice, two Management  Board meetings and one Permanent Stakeholders’  group meeting were held as planned during the 2013.  ENISA Management Board meeting in Crete  European Cyber Security Month - ENISA ED Austrian  media briefing  In 2013, the MB adopted a number of administrative,  management and budgetary decisions to implement  Regulation (EU) No. 523/2013. The MB also adopted the  Work Programme for 2014. Minutes and decisions of the  Management Board are available on the ENISA website  (http://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure- organization/management-board).  7  INTRODUCTION  Furthermore, an informal joint meeting between the  Management Board and the Permanent Stakeholders  Group took place in February 2013 in Greece. The  meeting focused on setting the priorities and themes  of the Work Programme 2014. In addition, an informal  Management Board meeting on strategic guidance  for Work Programme 2015 was held in Brussels in  November 2013.  The network of National Liaison Officers (NLO) was  created as a partnership network of ENISA and its  member countries. Although not a formal body, this  network is of great value to ENISA, serving as the point  of contact with Member States. The NLO consists of  experts in national entities involved in network and  information security at the national level. As ENISA’s  contact points with Member States, throughout  2013 and before, the NLOs have been asked to  provide feedback and assistance in disseminating  information as well as in providing relevant contacts  to ENISA to support implementation of the ENISA  work programme.  In line with the operational and horizontal objectives  of the Agency, ENISA’s organisational structure (see  Figure 1) was reorganised by the Executive Director in  December 2013. The organisational structure shows  two departments divided in three units/sections each.  The Agency’s organisational structure is dictated by the  new challenges identified by its two locations and its  stakeholders and the consequent need to address the  rapidly changing operating environment with the limited  number of human resources at the Agency’s disposal.  As a knowledge-based organisation, ENISA relies on its  personnel to deliver its services to its stakeholders and  ensure compliance with the regulatory framework. As  an EU Agency, ENISA benefits from having a diverse,  multi-national workforce.  In 2013, there was an increased focus on communicating  ENISA’s work and concepts to the European Commission,  the Council and the European Parliament as well as  other EU agencies and regional organisations. Regular  meetings with various Commission services, and DG  CONNECT in particular, took place during the year.  Pict.1 ENISA organisational chart (as of December 2013.)

Two pivotal points marked 2013: the transfer of staff  to the Athens office and promulgation of the new  “ENISA II” Regulation. In 2013, the Agency successfully  supported the Greek government in selecting suitable  premises in Athens and then set up its new branch  office in record time. This involved transferring staff  without disrupting operations and with minimal impact  on their work. With end of the year establishment of  the new Athens office, ENISA also needed to work  hard to obtain a supplementary budget. The Agency  successfully achieved this with help from our partner  DG CONNECT. ENISA’s supplementary budget was  disbursed at the very end of 2013, a situation that  challenged our management and planning capabilities  to their maximum.  The second pivotal point was promulgation of the  new “ENISA II” Regulation, (EU) No. 526/2013.1 The  new Regulation provides the Agency with a new and  1 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the  Council Concerning the European Network and Information Security  Agency (ENISA), Brussels, 30.09.2010., COM(2010) 521 final  extended seven year mandate, and expands its scope  and tasks. Both the transfer of staff to the Athens office  and promulgation of the new Regulation represent  turning points in the history of the Agency.  With regards to the Work Programme 2013, the Agency  successfully delivered all 30 deliverables agreed with the  ENISA Management Board. Everything was delivered on  time and within budget, corresponding to a delivery rate  of 100%. “ANNEX 7: A list of ENISA’s Work Programme  publications” provides links to these deliverables.  Several “extra miles” reports were also delivered. As far  as operations, three major accomplishments standout.  The first was the ‘Second ENISA International Conference  on Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Exercises’, a high-level  event hosted by ENISA in Brussels at the end of 2013.  The conference aimed to directly support the EU’s new  cyber security strategy by bringing together more than  200 stakeholders to establish a more coherent cyber  security policy. The event helped to significantly raise  the Agency’s visibility with its stakeholders. Another  major accomplishment was ENISA’s annual report on  major incidents in the telecoms sector. The report was  highly appreciated and represented a milestone in that  it provided more material to analyse the trends and  patterns. A third major accomplishment was the release  of ENISA’s annual report on the threat landscape. The  report was released at the high-level event in Brussels  to our key stakeholders, and received wide acclaim.  As regards project planning and related calls for tender  (EU public procurement procedures), 10 calls for tender  for 2014 (including several Lots) were already launched  during the period November-December 2013, thereby  successfully committing 70.5% of the annual budget  for core operations for next year. Four tenders leading  to multiannual framework contracts with ‘Re-opening  of Competition’ have also been launched. They  have helped to streamline the procurement process  in thematic areas that are fundamental to ENISA’s  Regulation.

KPI2: improved n/g CERT operational capabilities  (continuation of 2012 work) should be adopted by a  minimum of four Member States in 2014.  Status KPI2: already adopted by 19 Member States  during the two ENISA CERT Workshops in 2013.  KPI3: at least 20 Member States should contribute  to the work facilitated by ENISA on implementing  and enforcing article 13a and should make use of the  outcomes of this work.  Status KPI3: all EU National Regulatory Authorities  (NRAs) now contribute to ENISA’s work on incident  reporting.  KPI4:  five NRAs and 10 Cloud Computing Providers  should support ENISA’s work in the area of cloud  computing.  Status KPI4: more than 20 different private stakeholders  and more than five NRAs contribute to ENISA’s work on  cloud computing (e.g. governmental cloud, incident  reporting, etc.).  KPI5: ENISA should support the European Commission  Directorate General for Communications Networks,  Content and Technology (DG CONNECT) regarding its  proposal for a Regulation on electronic identification  and trusted services for electronic transactions in the  internal market. In doing so, ENISA should involve at  least five relevant stakeholders from public and private  sectors.  Status KPI5: ENISA has supported DG CONNECT  by providing recommendations on maintaining an  acceptable level of security at trust service providers.  The study was written by five experts from different  sectors and involved 57 organisations from within  the EU. Nearly 80 stakeholders from various sectors  validated the studies at the Trust Service Provider  workshop in September 2013.  1.4 KEY CONCLUSIONS ON  RESOURCE MANAGEMENT  AND INTERNAL CONTROL  EFFECTIVENESS  1.4.1 Resource management  In 2013 the Agency committed its appropriations at a  rate of 99.99% (100% in 2012) in order to carry out the  operational activities specified in the Work Programme  2013, as well as administrative tasks that are necessary  to ensure compliance to the regulatory framework  and the provision of services by the Agency. Payments  reached the level of 86.46% of the total appropriations  received from the Union Budget 2013. The commitment  and payment rates demonstrate an increased efficiency  in utilisation of the Budget, reconfirmed in the last 4  years.  The outturn of contracts awarded as a result of  procurement procedures completed in 2013, is as  follows:  • 25 contracts were signed: including 18 service  contracts and 7 framework contracts.  • 162 purchase orders were signed: 78 were issued  under a framework contract.  • 25 procurement procedures were issued:  including 15 open procedures consisting of 19  separate tenders.  As regards project planning and related call for tenders  (EU public procurement procedures), ten calls for  tenders for 2014 (including several Lots) were already  launched during November-December 2013, thereby  committing 70.5%2 of the Core Operations Department’s  annual budget for 2014. This included the launch of four  tenders leading to multiannual framework contracts  with ‘Re-opening of Competition’. The issuance of  multiannual framework contracts has helped to  streamline the procurement process in thematic areas  that are fundamental to ENISA’s Regulation.  2 This is a continuous improvement compared to 34.8% in 2010,  46.5% in 2011, and 64.4% in 2012.  10  INTRODUCTION  The outturn of contracts awarded as a result of  procurement procedures completed in 2013, is as  follows:  • 25 contracts were signed: including 18 service  contracts and 7 framework contracts.  • 162 purchase orders were signed: 78 were issued  under a framework contract.  • 25 procurement procedures were issued:  including 15 open procedures consisting of 19  separate tenders.  1.4.2 Internal control effectiveness  In accordance with the governance statement of the  European Commission, staff of the Agency conducts  operations in compliance with all applicable laws  and regulations, working in an open and transparent  manner to meet the high level of professional and  ethical standards that is expected.  The Agency has adopted a set of internal control  standards, based on international good practice, that  aim to ensure the achievement of policy and operational  objectives. As required by the Financial Regulation,  the Executive Director of the Agency has put in place  the organisational structure and the internal control  systems suited to the achievement of the policy and  control objectives, in accordance with the standards  and having due regard to the risks associated with the  environment in which ENISA operates.  The Agency assessed the effectiveness of its key  internal control systems during the reporting year  and concluded that the internal control standards  have been effectively implemented. In addition, the  Agency systematically examined the available control  results and indicators, including those designed for  monitoring entities to which it has entrusted budget  implementation tasks (e.g. subcontractors). The  Agency also took into account the observations and  recommendations issued by internal auditors and the  European Court of Auditors. These have been assessed  to determine their impact on management regarding  the achievement of control objectives.  Please refer to  Part 2 for further details  In conclusion, management is confident that, overall,  suitable controls are in place and working as intended;  risks are being monitored and mitigated; and the  required improvements and reinforcements are being  implemented. The Executive Director, in his capacity  as Authorising Officer, has signed the Declaration of  Assurance.  11  POLICY  ACHIEVEMENTS  2  12  POLICY ACHIE VEMENTS  2.1 ACHIEVEMENT OF  GENERAL AND SPECIFIC  EFFORTS  2.1.1 Policy area Work Stream 1: Evolving  risk environment & opportunities  Evolving risk environment & opportunities focuses on  informing policy makers and private sector companies  on how risks are evolving and on deploying strategies  to mitigate these risks. The level of detail of the analysis  should be sufficient to support strategic and policy  decisions. In addition to informing policy makers, the  objective is to mobilise stakeholder communities so  that they can achieve common goals and align their  strategies and methods. This work stream focuses on  the areas of critical information infrastructure and trust  infrastructure.  2.1.1.1 General Objective - WPK 1.1: Identification  and mitigation of threats affecting Critical  Information Infrastructure (CIIP)  Impact Indicator 1: an independent source of  information for risks, threats and threat trends,  and corresponding mitigation measures should be  developed for use by private sector companies for  enhancing their security systems and controls.  Result achieved: as of this  writing, more than 20 different  organisations are using the  conclusions of ENISA’s Threat  Landscape report. ENISA Threat  Landscape 2013 has been listed in  the Authoritative Reports and  Resources on Cybersecurity  prepared for US Congress (http:// w w w. f a s . o r g /s g p /c r s /m i s c / R42507.pdf). Several hundred  references to ENISA Threat  Landscape 2013 have been made  via the main cybersecurity web  pages and blogs.  Impact Indicator 2: policy makers should be provided  with an independent and consistent approach to the  identification of threats and risks.  Result achieved: more than five EU Member States  and the European Commission have expressed interest  in using ENISA’s Threat Landscape report as a basis for  developing their policies.

Current situation: 57 organisations took part in  the survey on trust service providers. They were all  interested in using the conclusions of the analysis. The  material was validated at the Trust Service Providers  workshop in Brussels in September 2013 by nearly 80  participants from various sectors.  ENISA lists top cyber- threats in this years  Threat Landscape  Report  13  POLICY ACHIEVEMENTS  Impact indicator 2: at least five policy makers in cyber  security should use the produced information (Source:  Work Programme 2013).  Current situation: the papers (Trusted e-ID  infrastructures and services in the EU, Trusted  provision of e-government services in the EU and eID  Authentication methods in e-Finance and e-Payment  services) were broadly distributed. The recipients  declared interest in using the information. Further  results are to be observed.  ENISA conducted a survey3 that addressed several  issues of the services that are being offered: security  practices, standards implemented and risk analysis.  The survey was complemented by a study about the  security mechanisms and interoperability issues specific  to the new regulated trust services. Several specific  recommendations to e-Government service providers  were made. These encourage the use of Trusted Third  Party service providers to implement trust services.  Such services are required to give citizens confidence in  the trustworthiness of services.  Apart from this, in 2013 ENISA launched a survey to  collect information about the electronic IDentity and  Authentication Systems (eIDAS) used in e-Finance and  e-Payment systems and to analyse the risks associated  with each eIDAS mechanism. A report documenting  best practices was created for the main actors in this  sector: financial institutions, merchants and payment  service providers.  3 The survey came under the scope of the proposed new Regulation on  electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions  in the internal market, which will supersede the current Directive  1999/93/EC on a Community framework for electronic signatures.

The results of this work stream address the managers  of the ICT systems using those infrastructures.    The  beneficiaries of the work achieved in this work stream  will be the providers of the services critical for society.  2.1.2.1 General Objective Work Package 2.1: Cyber  crisis cooperation  Impact indicator 1: at least 15 Member States should  take part in the study on National Risk Management by  2013 (Source: Work Programme 2013).  Result achieved: 22 Member States participated in the  study.  Impact indicator 2: at least 15 Member States should  request training on ENISA’s NCP Good Practice Guide  and Cyber Exercises Methodologies by 2014 (Source:  Work Programme 2013).  Result achieved: 20 Member States already requested  the training in 2013.  Impact indicator 3: at least 90% of EU Member States  and EFTA countries should confirm their support for  Cyber Europe 2014  (Source: Work Programme 2013)  Result achieved: already in 2013 over 90% of EU  Member States and EFTA countries confirmed their  support and willingness to participate in Cyber Europe  2014.  Impact indicator 4: at least 80% of Member States  should have established or be in the process of  establishing National Contingency Plans by 2016  (Source: Work Programme 2013).  Result achieved: ENISA doesn’t yet have clear signals  from the Member States. Situation is to be observed.  Impact Indicator 5: at least 80% of Member States  should have established or be in the process of  establishing National Cyber Exercises by 2016 (Source:  Work Programme 2013).  Result achieved: over 80% of Member States were in  the process of establishing National Cyber Exercises in  2013.4  In 2011 ENISA studied the National Cyber Contingency  Plans (NCPs) in several countries and prepared the  good practice guide on this subject. In 2013, the  Agency deepened its understanding of the lifecycle of  National Network Information Security Contingency  Plans (NCP) by focusing on  the National-level Cyber  Risk Assessment. ENISA aimed to develop a relevant  methodology with an emphasis on ‘how-to’. This would  help Member States to further improve their national- level contingency planning and their national-level risk  assessments for ICT services and infrastructures.  ENISA hosted the “Second ENISA International  Conference on Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Exercises”  on 23–24 September 2013 in Athens, Greece. The  conference was a unique, high-profile international  event that directly supported the EU’s new cyber  security strategy by helping stakeholders to establish  more coherent cyber security policies. In addition, the  conference was a key knowledge-sharing platform for  national and regional cyber security practitioners, both  technical experts and executives.  Cyber exercises are recognised as an essential part  of the EU’s cyber crisis cooperation and response  improvement lifecycle. ENISA is a key facilitator of these  exercises and is organising the fourth exercise of its kind,  Cyber Europe 2014. Cyber Europe 2014 is a multi-level  pan European exercise that will take place throughout  2014. Twenty-nine countries from the EU and EFTA will  participate in Cyber Europe 2014.

Result achieved: all of these impact indicators  were achieved despite the closure of EP3R and the  establishment of the NIS Platform.  Impact Indicator 2: five National Regulatory Authorities  (NRAs) and 10 Cloud Computing Providers should  support ENISA’s work in the area of cloud computing  Result achieved: more than 20 different private  stakeholders and more than five NRAs contribute to  ENISA’s work on cloud computing (e.g. governmental  cloud, incident reporting, etc.)  ENISA supported the implementation of the EU Cloud  Strategy and more specifically participated in the Cloud  Certification and Cloud Standards working group. The  result was to create a list of cloud computing certification  schemes, currently including 5 schemes, which will be  updated regularly to guide the customers through the  security requirements each certified provider offers.  Impact Indicator 3: seven Member States and 10 Private  stakeholders should take part in the development of  the “cyber security strategy” constituency.  Result achieved: more than 12 different Member  States and more than 12 private sector companies  actively contribute to ENISA’s work on cyber security  strategy and are members of this constituency creating  the ENISA NCSS experts group.  Impact Indicator 4: to cover as many of the Member  States as possible and surpass the number of Member  States (8) involved in 2012 (Source: agreements at the  beginning of 2013, no KPI in the Work Programme).  Result achieved: 60 stakeholders from 27 European  countries in total (including some non-EU countries)  participated in the European Cyber Security Month  activities.  The European Cyber Security  Month (ECSM) is an EU advocacy  campaign that takes place in  October. The main objective is  to promote cyber security  awareness among citizens, to  modify their perception of cyber  threats and to provide updated  security information through  education, the promotion of  good practices and  competitions. ECSM 2013 took  place in October in 27 countries. The event was  coordinated by the European Commission (DG  CONNECT) and ENISA. A large number of NIS  stakeholders participated in it.

In 2013 ENISA  organised 3 meetings for the Article 13a Expert  group. In spring 2013 ENISA also set up a reference  group consisting of experts from the electronic  communications industry. ENISA uses this group to  get direct feedback on its work.  Result achieved: all EU NRAs now contribute to  ENISA’s work on incident reporting. ENISA also makes  recommendations on national roaming for resilience, for  example to discuss possible national roaming schemes  with providers and to support the establishment of  mutual aid agreements between  providers in case of severe  incidents. In parallel, a study on  power supply dependencies for  the communication sector was  conducted.  Impact indicator 2: 10 NRAs  and/or Member State competent  authorities and 10 Cloud  Computing Providers should  take part in the study on incident  reporting for cloud providers.  ENISA has setup an expert group with representatives  from the private and public sector, to exchange  knowledge and information on the several studies on  Cloud Security.  Result achieved: more than 20 different private  stakeholders contribute to ENISA’s work on incident  reporting for cloud computing. They are active  members of our expert group.  Impact indicator 3: 10 NRAs and/or Member State  competent authorities and 10 Internet Service Providers  (ISPs) should take part in the consultation process about  both Article 13a and Article 4.  Result achieved: more than 20 NRAs and more than 15  ISPs took part in ENISA’s work on Article 13a and Article  4 harmonisation. The dialogue has identified a number  of important issues. ENISA is now working with both  constituencies to address them.

Result achieved: more than 20 different  private stakeholders contribute to  ENISA’s work on governmental  clouds. It presents information from  a total of 23 European countries  (20 EU countries). The result is a  set of recommendations on how  to securely deploy cloud services in  the public sector. The stakeholders are  active members of our expert group.  Impact indicator 2: seven Member State  NRAs and 10 Smart Grid providers should take part in  the development of the Smart Grid community.  Result achieved: more than five NRAs and 30 different  private stakeholders contribute to ENISA’s work on  minimum security measures for Smart Grids. The  European Commission has recognised that smart  grids – the blending of the energy (power) and  telecommunication critical infrastructures – should  operate securely and respect end-users’ privacy.  In order for European smart grid service providers  to improve the security and the resilience of their  infrastructures and services, they first have to assess  risks and then take appropriate measures to mitigate  these risks. In this light, EG25 has decided to organise  consultations with industry and national cyber security  authorities regarding minimum security requirements.  Impact indicator 3: 10 NRAs and 10 ISPs and Internet  Exchange Points (IXPs) should take part in the study on  priority data communications.  Result achieved: more than 20 NRAs and 15 different  private stakeholders (IXP providers, ISPs, Telcos,  etc.) have contributed to ENISA’s work on internet  interconnection.  5 Expert Group 2 formed by European Commission’s Smart Grid Task  Force and it aims at making regulatory recommendations for data  safety, data handling and data protection.

Based on this  work, in 2013 the Data Protection Authorities of Greece  and Germany, in collaboration with ENISA, developed  an updated methodology for data breach severity  assessment. The methodology can be used both by  Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) as well as by data  controllers. A working document is a first result of the  co-operation between experts of the DPAs and ENISA.  The methodology will ultimately be developed into a  practical tool for data breach severity assessment.  Studies and reports:  Recommendations for a methodology of the  assessment of severity of personal data breaches  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and- trust/library/deliverables/dbn-severity  2.1.2.5.2 Brokerage model of NIS in Education  With publication of the Brokerage model for Network  & Information Security (NIS) in education report, ENISA  aimed to provide content and promote digital education  on network and information security at all levels. The  target group is composed of educators such as trainers,  teachers and peers involved in formal education and  non-formal education, including lifelong learning.  ENISA tries to connect the stakeholders in the best way  possible by presenting different countries’ perspectives  via three case studies: the Czech Safer Internet Centre  (NCBI)’s Strategy of community education in project  — Prague safe online, the German Federal Office for  Information Security (BSI)’s 10th anniversary of the  Safer Internet Day provides an opportunity to increase  awareness, and Norwegian partners’ Norwegian Centre  for Information Security.

It does so not from the viewpoint of  service providers, but from the viewpoint of the users of  the internet services. The results of this work stream will  be provided to network and internet security managers,  as well as other communities that are responsible for  implementing or validating security mechanisms.  Results take the point of view of the “implementer”. The  beneficiaries of these activities are Information Security  Officers in organisations, i.e. the “internal” security  service providers.  2.1.3.1 General Objective Work Package 3.1:  Application of good practice for CERTs  Impact Indicator 1: ENISA should improve the level  of communication, response (appropriate to the  threat level) and information exchange between  European national/governmental (n/g) Computer  Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) and other bodies  (governmental organisations, industry and academia).  Its recommendations should be adopted by a minimum  of four Member States in 2014 (Source: Work Programme  2013).  Result achieved: improved levels of communication,  response and information exchange were already  adopted by 19 Member States during the two ENISA  CERT Workshops in 2013.  Impact Indicator 2: ENISA should provide training to  improve the operational practices of CERTs (on-going  support with best practice development) to a minimum  of 20 participants from different organisations (Source:  Work Programme 2013).  Result achieved: ENISA CERT training was rolled out on  request and on the Agency’s initiative at more than 10  events, each attended by more than 20 participants, for  a total participation of 200 people.  Impact Indicator 3: the improved collaboration  capabilities of n/g CERTs (continuation of 2012 work)  should be adopted by a minimum of four Member  States in 2014 (Source: Work Programme 2013).  Result achieved: already adopted by 19 Member States  during the two ENISA CERT Workshops in 2013.  20  POLICY ACHIE VEMENTS  Studies and reports:  D1 Secure communication’s  platform for European n/g CERTs  (Requirements & stocktaking)  Detect, SHARE, Protect - Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange  among CERTs https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/data-sharing/ detect-share-protect-solutions-for-improving-threat-data-exchange- among-certs  D2 EISAS – deployment in Europe (a  feasibility study)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/other-work/eisas_folder/ eisas-deployment-feasibility-study  D3 Good practice guide on Alerts,  Warnings and Announcements  (including an inventory  of Incident Response  Methodologies)  Best practice guide on Alerts, Warnings & Announcements https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/awa  D4 CERT Inventory; an extended  overview (inventory and  interactive map)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/background/inv  D1 (Detect, SHARE, Protect): the focus of the report  is on the threat and incident information exchange  and sharing practices used among CERTs. It examines  existing communication solutions and practices  among European CERTs, identifying the functional  and technical gaps that limit the exchange of threat  intelligence between n/g CERTs and their counterparts  in Europe, as well as other CERTs within their respective  countries. The report also defines basic requirements  for improved communications that are interoperable  with existing solutions.  D2 (EISAS): the final report that concludes ENISA’s  activities in the area of European Information Sharing  and Alerting System (EISAS).  D3 (Alerts, Warnings, Announcements): the guide  describes good practices and provides practical  information and guidelines on the process of preparing  and issuing alerts, warnings and announcements to a  CERT’s constituencies (customers). Informing CERTs and  their constituencies about threats and ways to contain  threats typically involves the use of a reliable set of  indicators and a well-structured process for assessing  and processing the incoming information. This enables  the CERT to get the right information to the right places  in a timely fashion.  D4 (CERT Inventory): the inventory aims to provide  an overview of the actual situation concerning CERTs  in Europe. It provides a list and an interactive map of  CERT teams and similar facilities by country, and also  contains a catalogue of co-operation, support and  standardisation activities related to them.  Example of value added:  In 2013, ENISA extended its good practice material  for CERTs with a special emphasis on obstacles to  information sharing. Currently, CERTs face not so much  a lack of information (about incidents, vulnerabilities,  threats, etc.) as difficulty in extracting useful, actionable  pieces of information out of the abundance of available  information (Netflow data, logfiles, etc.). At the end  of 2013 (and continuing in 2014), ENISA actively  participated in a project, led by governmental CERTs  from Austria, Portugal and Belgium, designed to tackle  this problem. A tool, “Abusehelper”, was developed  to help CERTs to extract actionable information from  their data sources. The tool will be made available to all  CERTs.  2.1.3.2 General Objective Work Package 3.2: Enabling  collaborative communities  Impact Indicator 1: improved operational capabilities  of n/g CERTs (continuation of 2012 work) should be  adopted by a minimum of four Member States in 2014.  Result achieved: improved operational capabilities  already adopted by 19 Member States during the two  ENISA CERT Workshops in 2013.  21  POLICY ACHIE VEMENTS  Impact Indicator 2: ENISA will identify at least  20 key actors who can act as intermediaries in the  dissemination of the outcomes of the work package.  Together they should cover at least 12 Member States  by the end of 2013.  Result achieved: 19 national/governmental CERTs in  the EU acted as multipliers or intermediaries for the  dissemination of work page results, including two  n/g CERTS from EEA countries. The Forum of Incident  Response and Security Teams (FIRST) and the Task  Force for Computer Security and Incident Response  Teams (TF-CSIRT) acted as additional multipliers, with  24 key actors disseminating results to at least 500 CERTs  worldwide (members of FIRST, members of TF-CSIRT,  teams on the national level, and teams in the start-up  phase not yet registered anywhere).  Impact Indicator 3: pan-European cooperation shall  be improved between CERTs and Law Enforcement  Agencies (LEA) in the area of fighting cybercrime, with  the commitment of a minimum of four Member States  in 2013.  Result achieved: cooperation agreed upon by 19  Member States during the two ENISA CERT Workshops  in 2013. The workshop series will be continued in 2014.

Firstly, it aims to provide an analysis of the legal  framework created by the Directive, coupled with a  stock taking of existing national activities and good  practices which may be relevant. Secondly, it aims to  identify key areas and, when appropriate, guidelines  and recommendations for CERTs derived from good  practices. The document provides background  information mainly for members of CERTs in the EU  Member States. It explains the potential outcomes and  implications raised by the new Directive. While it stops  short of giving direct guidance for the implementation  process, it will hopefully enable key players to take  sound decisions.  D2 (Workshop report): the document is a brief  ENISA report on the annual workshop for Computer  Emergency Response Teams in Europe: CERTs in Europe.  The first part of the workshop focused on hands-on  technical training for n/g CERTs in Europe. The second  part of the workshop, the ENISA/EC3 workshop, was a  follow up event to last year’s workshop with Europol. It  had the same focus on enhancing cooperation between  n/g CERTs in Europe and their national law enforcement  counterparts.  D3: (CERT exercise material): ENISA CERT exercises and  training material were introduced in 2008, and in 2012  and 2013 these were complemented with new exercise  scenarios containing essential material for success in  the CERT community and in the field of information  security. The ENISA CERT training material contains  a handbook for teachers, a toolset for students and  virtual images to facilitate hands on training sessions.  6 European Commission. 2010. Proposal for a Directive of the European  Parliament and of the Council on attacks against information  systems and repealing Council Framework Decision 2005/222/JHA.  COM(2010) 517: http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/policies/ crime/1_en_act_part1_v101.pdf [Last accessed 0ctober 14, 2013]  D4: (Harmonisation and ICS CERT capabilities):  the “harmonisation” document provides an overview  of existing mechanisms that help CERTs to deploy  capabilities necessary for their operations and  appropriate to their level of maturity. It introduces each  mechanism according to the CERT maturity level that  it addresses, based on eight predefined criteria. The  criteria include mandatory requirements for CERTs, their  focus, the type of CERT or its region of operation, and  the definitions and terminology used.  The Industrial Control System Computer Emergency  Response Capabilities (ICS-CERC) guide builds upon  the current practice of CERTs responsible for industrial  control system (ICS) networks, as well as on earlier work  by ENISA regarding baseline capabilities for n/g CERTs.  The document is an initial attempt to provide a good  practice guide for the entities that have been tasked  to provide ICS-CERC. The guide does not, however,  attempt to prescribe to the EU Member States which  entities should be entrusted with provision of ICS-CERC  services.  D5 (CERT training support): ENISA continues to  support the successful TRANSITs7 training programme  for CERT staff members, which usually takes place twice  a year in Europe. TRANSITs training programmes for  CERTs evolved out of a European Commission funded  project (IST-2001-39118, 1 July 2002-30 September 2005)  to promote the establishment of CERTs by addressing  the shortage of skilled staff. To complement this effort,  in 2013 ENISA started to provide in-house technical  training for CERTs and other operational communities  (i.e. ICS administrators) based on requests from EU  Member States. Tailored training programmes are based  on ENISA exercises and training materials that have  been developed by ENISA since 2008. ENISA’s training  portfolio complements our effort to strengthen CERT  capabilities and to foster cooperation amongst teams  throughout Europe.  7 http://www.terena.org/activities/transits/transits-i/  23  POLICY ACHIE VEMENTS  Example of value added:  In 2008, ENISA decided to develop CERT training  programmes as a more direct way of disseminating its  CERT good practice material. Since then the number  of available training scenarios has reached 23, and  the programmes are highly regarded. In 2013, we  received several requests from Member States for  specialised training for their CERT teams, and this trend  has continued in 2014. This is a strong contribution  to the state of NIS in Europe that builds upon our  work in defining baseline capabilities for national  and governmental CERTs. The quality of our training  programmes is high: participants typically give our  programmes ratings of 4.5 out of 5 points. The real  impact of the training, however, must be evaluated over  the long-term.  2.1.3.3 General Objective Work Package 3.3: Enabling  the information society  Impact indicator 1: ENISA should survey security  certification practice in at least five Member States to  identify best practices that could be applied for privacy  certification/trustmarks (Source: Work Programme  2013).  Result achieved: the survey was conducted among 11  Member States, covering over 50% of the EU population.  ENISA has supported EU activities in the implementation  of trustmarks by identifying best practice from  security certification that can be deployed for privacy  certification and trustmarks. Input was provided for  the adoption of a framework on privacy certification,  as well as for eGovernment certification in Europe. The  conditions under which online security and privacy  seals (OSPS) can be deployed to support users in  making informed decisions about Web services and  their providers with respect to the security and privacy  provided were also analysed.  Studies and reports:  Security certification practice in the EU - Information  Security Management Systems: A case study  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity- and-trust/library/deliverables/security-certification- practice-in-the-eu-information-security-management- systems-a-case-study  On the security, privacy and usability of online seals  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and- trust/library/deliverables/on-the-security-privacy-and- usability-of-online-seals/  Impact Indicator 2: ENISA should provide  recommendations on best practice regarding the  security of personal data and the use of cryptographic  techniques for eGov services in Europe, based on  inputs from at least five Member States (Source: Work  Programme 2013).  Result achieved: input was gathered from five Member  States, the US and other international stakeholders, and  information was also provided by other Member States.  ENISA studied cryptographic techniques used in Europe,  focusing on areas where data security is needed to  protect the personal data of the citizens or on the new  techniques required by new applications. The study  addressed measures applied to safeguard sensitive  and/or personal data, and discussed how information  technology users with a basic knowledge of information  security can employ cryptographic techniques to  protect their personal data. It also addressed the need  for a minimum level of cryptographic functionality  across EU Member States, as part of their efforts to  protect personal and/or sensitive data.  Studies and reports:  Recommended cryptographic measures – Securing  personal data  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity- and -trust / l ibrar y/del iverables/re commende d - cryptographic-measures-securing-personal-data  Algorithms, Key Sizes and Parameters Report  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and- trust/library/deliverables/algorithms-key-sizes-and- parameters-report  24  POLICY ACHIE VEMENTS  Impact indicator 3: ENISA should support the proposal  by DG CONNECT of the European Commission for a  Regulation on electronic identification and trusted  services for electronic transactions in the internal  market, and involve at least five relevant stakeholders  from public and private sectors (Source: Work  Programme 2013)  Current situation (as achieved): ENISA has supported  DG CONNECT by providing recommendations for  maintaining acceptable levels of security at trust service  providers (as agreed with the eIDAS Task Force). The  study was written by five experts from different sectors  and involved 57 organisations from within the EU.  Nearly 80 stakeholders from various sectors validated  the studies at the Trust Service Provider workshop in  September 2013.  In 2013, ENISA developed guidelines for trust services  providers, identifying the minimal security levels to be  maintained by them. The study is divided into several  sections. One section describes the framework for trust  service providers (TPSs), drawing upon EU and other  standards when relevant. A second section discusses  the principles and concepts for defining and controlling  the threats and vulnerabilities faced by TSPs. A final  section recommends technical and organisational  measures for mitigating the impact of security incidents  on TSPs.  Studies and reports:  Guidelines for trust service providers - Part 1: Security  framework  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and- trust/library/deliverables/tsp1-framework  Guidelines for trust service providers - Part 2: Risk  assessment  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and- trust/library/deliverables/tsp2-risk  Guidelines for trust service providers - Part 3: Mitigating the  impact of security incidents  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and- trust/library/deliverables/tsp3-incidents  2.1.3.4 Other Work Stream 3 actions  In addition to the activities planned in the Work  Programme, ENISA performed actions in the framework  of Work Stream 3.  2.1.3.4.1 Data retention  Data retention legislation has been adopted to address  concerns related to national security and serious  criminal activity. The legislation provides access to  communication data for law enforcement purposes.  However, the Data Retention Directive (DRD) requires  that personal data collected, stored or in any way  processed in most EU Member States be securely  protected. In 2013, ENISA conducted a survey on the  national implementation of the DRD in six selected  Member States. The survey focused on technical  and organisational security requirements and the  implementation of the data security principles that are  provided for in the Directive. It also provided a state-of- the-art analysis of the security measures proposed for  the protection of personal data.  Studies and reports:  Securing personal data in the context of data retention  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and- trust/library/deliverables/securing-personal-data-in- the-context-of-data-retention/  25  POLICY ACHIEVEMENTS  2.2 SPECIFIC EFFORTS TO  IMPROVE THE ‘ECONOMY’  AND ‘EFFICIENCY’  OF SPENDING AND  NON-SPENDING ACTIVITIES.  According to the financial regulation (art 30), the  principle of economy requires that the resources used  by the institution in the pursuit of its activities shall be  made available in due time, in the appropriate quantity  and quality and at the best price. The principle of  efficiency entails finding the optimal balance between  the resources employed and the results achieved.  These principles are upheld through the implementation  of internal procedures and predefined practices. These  procedures ensure that activities are executed in an  efficient manner (e.g. different workflows contribute to  efficient cooperation between staff, units, departments  etc.) and according to the principle of economy (e.g.  procurement rules ensure procurement on optimal terms).  The Agency continuously fine-tunes its internal  arrangements in order to improve the efficiency and  economy of its operations. The following two initiatives  are examples that show how these principles are  implemented at ENISA.  2.2.1 Example 1  To operate efficiently at two different locations,  electronic workflows had to be designed and  implemented. These workflows are more economical  than sending large packages by post and more  efficient because delays have been eliminated. The  idea is to establish a fully digital organisation with lean  procedures and optimal functionality.  2.2.2 Example 2  To operate efficiently at two different locations, IT tools  such as videoconferencing were implemented. These  types of tools are more economical than spending  budget on travel and more efficient because issues  can be resolved more quickly. This applies to several  different core processes (management team meetings,  tender procedures, etc.).  Other IT tools such as the Agency’s intranet enable  different actors to work simultaneously on the same  document while storing all versions in a single location.  2.3 CORPORATE  COMMUNICATIONS  2.3.1 Corporate Communications, media,  outreach and impact  ENISA’s impact, outreach and media programme gives  the Agency the opportunity to reach many more of  its stakeholders than it can through direct means.  Corporate communication activities in 2013 focused  on five areas:  1. Expanding and increasing media impact and  coverage across Europe  2. Strengthening stakeholder relations 3. Strengthening digital communications 4. Ensuring coherence and consistency, i.e.  communication planning 5. Strengthening the ENISA brand  Thus, in 2013, the Agency’s corporate communications  section continued to focus on communicating the  Agency’s results in its studies and reports, its core  operations results. At the same time, in 2013, ENISA was  reorganised so that the Public Affairs Unit (PAU) become  a Corporate Communications team. The objective was  to streamline activities and adapt to a new context,  in view of other organisational developments, most  notably the transfer of some Agency staff to Athens.  Major achievements included the transition to and  implementation of the new ENISA logo and new Agency  name, in line with the new Regulation governing the  Agency. In addition, the Agency web site and social  media activities were further developed as the Agency’s  main communications channels. This year we also  cooperated more closely with local and national media  across Europe, resulting in TV coverage, editorials in the  press and articles published in numerous media outlets.  Corporate communications in particular gained Europe  wide coverage for the ENISA Threat Landscape report,  and the art13a annual incidents in the telecoms sector  report.  As the focal point for Europe’s cyber security  information, corporate communications focus on  communicating the results of ENISA’s operational  work. The communication objective is to reach diverse  stakeholders and audiences, using the appropriate  channels and with consistent messages that are  tailored to each target audience. This approach is a key  element of ENISA’s mission to support a cyber-security  culture, in order to promote a dynamic digital society  and, ultimately, for the economy of Europe. ENISA’s  26  POLICY ACHIE VEMENTS  corporate communication outreach channels include  public relations campaigns, digital communications,  external communications, and media activity and  events across the EU.  ENISA  High Level Event  Expanding and increasing communication and external  relations by working with various audiences was,  therefore, a pivotal point for corporate communications  in 2013. To do so, the Agency co-organised or  participated in joint events with other EU bodies and  other organisations. The most outstanding example  at corporate level was the annual High-Level Event in  Brussels, which was organised in cooperation with an  industry actor the European Security Round Table (ESRT),  and a regional actor, the Hessen Representation. At  this occasion, ENISA brought together representatives  of the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS),  the European Commission and industry. Under the  umbrella of “Securing our cyber-future: risks, threats,  challenges & opportunities for coordinating Europe’s  cyber security”, topics discussed included:  • The new ENISA Regulation (http://eur-lex.europa. eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:165 :0041:0058:EN:PDF) - what it actually means for  improving Europe’s cyber security  • The Cyber Security Strategy and NIS Directive  (http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu- cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and- online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security)  - the practicalities of implementation  • The implications of state surveillance revelations  for IT security - what should be the technical  response and what are the future needs?”  This generated unprecedented interest in the event,  which was therefore a great success for the Agency  stakeholder relations, in providing a platform for our  stakeholders to meet.  Strengthening our external relations through  communication with various audiences was a major  part of the Agency’s corporate communications work  in 2013. To do so, the unit organised or participated in  joint events with other EU bodies, such as the high- level cyber event in Brussels. This ENISA event brought  together representatives of the European Parliament,  the European Commission and industry. The Agency  also engaged in outreach work, particularly with the  local community, such as organising a Europe Day on 9  May, a celebration on Crete to highlight the benefits of  information and communication technology for all of  Europe’s children. The corporate communications team  has also worked to further strengthen ties with Greece’s  government, which hosts the Agency in Heraklion  and Athens. Moreover, in 2013, ENISA engaged in  strengthend relations with the Regional Governor of  Crete and the Heraklion local authorities.  ENISA celebrated Europe Day  27  POLICY ACHIEVEMENTS  Media relations is the superior way to reach all Agency  stakeholders. It articulates our results, and augments  the cyber security debate. ENISA’s impact, outreach and  media programme enables the Agency to reach all its  stakeholders, and influential policy makers, who follow  the media. Through media relations ENISA can reach  many more persons than, for example, at a conference.  Today, in media relations there has been a blending  between traditional, social media and digital relations  with our stakeholders. All these channels are crucial  to reach the media, who can act as multipliers of our  message, as well as contribute to the open debate on  cyber security in a democratic society.  In 2013, the Agency continued its outreach distribution  and media monitoring process to assess the  targeting, impact and reach of its media work. Major  accomplishments include:  • Produced and issued 20 media releases • Posted more than 115 individual news items on  the ENISA web site • All media releases and news items are  simultaneously published in the Agency’s social  media channels and also generated hundreds of  interviews throughout the year. Overall, the media  coverage figures were around 2,500, which was an  increase of about 25% in relation to 2012’s figure.  2.3.2 Multilingual approach  An essential part of ENISA’s work is to make its messages  accessible to stakeholders across Europe and to  overcome the “Tower of Babel”, which is simultaneously  a blessing of cultural diversity, but also a challenge. To  tackle this challenge, the Agency issues media releases  in five EU languages – English, German, French, Spanish  and Greek – to press, radio, television and web-based  news organisations. It also maintains online “landing  pages” in German, French and Greek. ENISA media  releases are distributed via general, financial, EU and  social media outlets, as well as specialised ICT/Network  and Information Security publications and web sites. In  2013, ENISA further developed and enhanced the three  “landing pages” in Greek, German and French. More  mini sites are planned for launch in 2014.  2.3.3 Cross media impact  Media monitoring analysis and in depth-evaluation of  the Agency’s media output shows that overall in 2013  the media work and translations generated more than  2,500 stories in European news media, and that stories  appeared in all 24 EU languages. Statistics continue  to display a clear correlation between peaks in web  visitors, social media and the distribution of media  releases in multiple channels. This demonstrates  the beneficial effect of multiple media channels in  spreading the results of the Agency. Overall, ENISA  reached a combined potential audience of several  million readers, listeners and viewers. Directly, media  releases on the ENISA web site received more than  223,000 unique page views in 2013, a clear increase  over the 171,000 unique page views received in 2012.  Individual news stories on the ENISA website received  more than 84,500 direct hits in 2013.  2.3.4 Additional media & outreach  activities  Other dedicated topical press  conferences and briefings  targeted media in specific  countries or around particular  interest areas in network  information security. As part  of its media activities, the  Agency also commenced the regular update of the  Crisis Communication Strategy. In addition, the agency  maintained and further developed its relations with  other EU agencies, in the official Heads of  Communications and Information Network (HCIN) of  the EU agencies. The HCIN gives EU agencies the  possibility of pooling their knowledge, benchmarking,  learning and sharing best practices. This is a cost- effective way to continuously develop standards and  learn for greater impact.  28  POLICY ACHIE VEMENTS  2.3.5 Digital communications and digital  relations  ENISA’s website continues to be the Agency’s principal  communications channel. In 2013, continuous  development work was carried out to maintain and  further improve the website for its users. The Agency  social media channels – Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter  and YouTube – were expanded to include Slideshare  and Pinterest in order to reach more stakeholders.  Moreover, after analysis, a survey of the literature, and  practical “lessons learned”, we modified our tactics  to increase our social media outreach further. These  steps have enabled ENISA to better reach targeted NIS  communities and the media, to increase our outreach,  and to foster better digital stakeholder relations. This  was a dedicated effort and new initiative in 2013 that  helped us to better connect with new communities and  to develop our ties with existing digital relations with  our stakeholders and supporters.  Website development  Enhancing the website for users and helping visitors to  navigate and find information with greater ease is an  on-going process. To this end, the agency continued  to improve the usability and design of the ENISA  website. Further enhancements and improvements  will be carried out on the website in 2014, including an  improved content structure, and further development  of the German and Greek mini-sites, and a new Spanish  one.  Technical improvements in 2013 included the  development of web tools for the Agency’s website  and portals (used by specialist expert communities) and  the application of all the security patches to the Zope  application and PLONE content management system  used by the ENISA site.  A dedicated portal for the European Cyber Security  Month (ECSM) was also launched during 2013, to better  support the ECSM initiative and its constantly growing  community.  2.3.6 Social Media  ENISA’s social media channels (Facebook, Twitter,  YouTube, LinkedIn) were launched in September  2012. The objective was to connect the Agency with  new communities, deepen its ties with existing ones  and generate traffic to ENISA’s main site for increased  visibility, impact and influence. The channels are  accessible through the Agency’s website (home page)  and links to them were also added to all the Agency’s  communication channels (publications, presentations,  e-mails, brand material, etc.)  During 2013, ENISA’s social media presence was  enhanced with two new channels - Pinterest and  Slideshare – while new tools and methods were  introduced to help ENISA to better distribute its work.  Social media monitoring reports have shown  an increased reach for ENISA’s channels. Main  accomplishments include:  • More than 3,250 followers of the ENISA Twitter  channel  • More than 1,260 tweets • 2,400 followers of the ENISA LinkedIn page • More than 600 Facebook fans • 7,700 YouTube video views • Hundreds of thousands of users reached by  messages posted by ENISA  2.3.7 Video  In 2013, the Agency produced videos covering key areas  of agency activity. For 2014, ENISA envisages further  production of shorter video clips to promote the  Agency’s achievements and activities.  29  POLICY ACHIE VEMENTS  2.3.8 Quality, coherence and consistency  In 2013, the corporate communications team ensured  that ENISA’s corporate communications activity was  fully aligned with ENISA’s operational and policy  development goals. Amongst other actions, this  entailed maintaining and developing close links with the  Management Board, the PSG, the European Parliament,  the European Commission, the Council and Member  States. All communications activity falls within the  scope of five planned corporate communications areas  of activity. This ensures that information forms part of a  coherent and consistent narrative on the Agency’s work.  In addition, the continuing provision of high quality  editorial, graphic design and printing services through  contracts managed by corporate communications, has  helped to ensure quality, coherence and consistency in  ENISA’s communications.  2.3.9 Brand and trust  Given the inherent nature of ENISA’s mission, branding  is an important aspect of Corporate Communication’s  work. A strong ENISA brand increases trust. Trust  helps the Agency to achieve consistent and coherent  results in all its communications, and is a precondition  for its stakeholder relations. The ENISA brand was  strengthened in 2013 through several means:  • Visual identity: the ENISA brand’s visual identity  was updated and implemented to reflect the new  Agency name and logo.  • Events: to increase awareness and recognition of  the ENISA brand, events were conducted across  Europe.  • Promotional material: promotional material  was produced for particular corporate and expert  occasions and distributed at the High Level event  and to visitors to ENISA’s offices.  An effective brand strategy is key to connecting  effectively with our audiences and stakeholders.  Therefore, continuously updating the look and feel of  ENISA material is paramount in the way the Agency  communicates and to how it is perceived.  2.3.10 Publications  Publications are the ‘face’ of the ENISA brand and an  important communication tool given ENISA’s mission.  Throughout 2013, the Agency published around 30  publications as work programme deliverables. In  addition, ENISA went beyond by producing additional  reports, papers and studies. Along with the writing  and design of the Agency’s General Report, in 2013, the  Corporate Communications team produced a special  corporate report for the ENISA high-level event in  Brussels, EU Cybersecurity cooperation - Defending the  digital frontline (http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/ key-documents/cybersecurity-cooperation-defending- the-digital-frontline). The report presented an updated  and comprehensive overview of Europe’s cyber security  status, and examined areas where further cooperation  can better secure digital economy of Europe.  In 2013, the Corporate Communications team worked  with the Agency’s NIS experts to step up the frequency  of the Agency’s Flash Notes – short expert reports  published to provide an analysis or comment on a  current cyber security topic not foreseen in the Work  Programme. Notes included the topics of “Cyber- attacks – a new edge for old weapons”, “Urgent action  is needed to combat emerging cyber-attack trends”, the  Flash Note Can Recent Attacks Really Threaten Internet  Availability? (http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ f lash-notes/f lash-note-can-recent-attacks-really- threaten-internet-availability) and “Internet Service  Providers fail to apply filters against big cyber attacks”.  Theses Flash Notes were extremely well received  because of their timeliness. Thus, the Agency will  continue this practice in 2014.  2.3.11  Conferences and events  Throughout the year, ENISA organised several  conferences and events. In addition, the Agency  took part in numerous external events and high-level  European conferences. In addition to these activities,  the Corporate Communications team provided support  to the Executive Director for his participation in events  across Europe.  30  POLICY ACHIE VEMENTS  MANAGEMENT  OF RESOURCES  2.3.12 ENISA Stakeholder relations,  media and corporate  communications  ENISA’s stakeholder relations are a key factor in the  success of its overall mission of contributing to the  security of the EU internal market. The Management  Board (composed of the Commission, Member State  and private sector representatives) and Permanent  Stakeholders Group (composed of multiple  stakeholders), as well as the Agency’s informal  networks and expert working parties, give ENISA  unparalleled insights and access to public and private  sector Network and Information Security (NIS) experts.  This expertise and “checking point” also gives ENISA  the opportunity to better and more rapidly identify  emerging risks and gain new insights. This helps the  Member States and private sector organisations to  better prepare themselves for challenges in a proactive  and professional manner, as well as to build novel public  and private sector partnerships. Excellent relations  with our stakeholders is also the flip side of the coin in  relation to media, outreach and impact; good quality  in our stakeholder relations depends on a genuine  two way dialogue, attentiveness to and interest in our  stakeholders’ needs and priorities.  2.4 IT AND FACILITIES  MANAGEMENT  New Branch Office in Athens  In March 2013, ENISA opened its new branch office in  Athens. The new office was made operational in about  five weeks using limited resources while waiting for  additional budget approval. The move of all operational  staff from Heraklion to Athens was completed without  any interruption in functioning or any impact on  productivity. In the meantime, planning went ahead  regarding the refurbishment and furnishing of the  office, including IT and facilities equipment and services.  A restricted call for tenders was launched in late 2013 for  refurbishment work.  IP Telephony and Unified Communications  In early 2013, ENISA’s telephony was integrated into the  Lync system, which was already used for collaboration  and online meetings. Thanks to this development,  calling costs have decreased while additional  functionality and flexibility have become available.  For example, staff can make business calls from their  desktop, even while travelling, as long as they have an  Internet connection.  Align IT organisational structure and processes to  ITIL standards  Changes to the structure of the IT budget were  introduced in 2013 to better align it with IT service  lifecycle stages. This approach will be finalised in 2014  and should provide better visibility on the maturity  level of our IT organisation by comparing the time  spent by the IT staff for development, evolution and  business alignment versus the time spent for operating,  supporting and recovering from failures.  Cyber Exercise Platform (CEP)  In 2013, IT contributed to ENISA’s European Cyber  Exercise. IT designed and delivered a complete  infrastructure to run the Cyber Exercise campaigns.  The pilot exercises were successfully conducted on this  infrastructure. IT supports and continues to enhance  this important platform in order to host future exercises.  In 2014, about 500 users are expected to connect and  use the platform during exercise sessions.  ENISA Management Board Meeting in Vilnius  MANAGEMENT  OF RESOURCES  3  32  MANAGEMENT OF RESOURCES  Assurance entails assessing the effectiveness of risk  management, control and governance processes.  This assessment is carried out by management, which  monitors the functioning of internal control systems  on a continuous basis, and by internal and external  auditors. Results of the examination are documented  and reported to the Executive Director. The reports  produced are:  • Budget Execution Reports • Observations and recommendations made by the  Internal Audit Service (IAS) of the Commission • Observations and recommendations made by the  European Court of Auditors (ECA)  This section reports the control results and other  relevant information that supports management’s  assessment regarding the achievement of internal  control objectives.8 It is structured in three separate  sections: (1) the Agency’s assessment of its own activities  for the management of its resources; (2) the assessment  of activities carried out by other entities to which the  Agency has entrusted tasks; and (3) the assessment of  the results of internal and external audits, including the  implementation of audit recommendations.  The entire budget of the Agency is fully implemented  under direct management.  8 Effectiveness, efficiency and economy of operations; reliability of  reporting; safeguarding of assets and information; prevention,  detection, correction and follow-up of fraud and irregularities;  and adequate management of the risks relating to the legality and  regularity of the underlying transactions, taking into account the  multiannual character of programmes as well as the nature of the  payments (FR Art 32).  33  MANAGEMENT OF RESOURCES  3.1 MANAGEMENT OF  HUMAN AND FINANCIAL  RESOURCES BY ENISA  3.1.1 Control effectiveness as regards  legality and regularity  The Agency has set up internal control processes to  ensure the management of risks related to the legality  and regularity of underlying transactions. These control  processes take into account the multi-annual character  of programmes as well as the nature of the payments  concerned. In order to achieve the best control possible,  the Agency has focused exclusively on the verification  of results before transactions are initiated (“ex-ante  verification”).  The European Court of Auditors (ECA) is responsible  for implementing a second layer of controls. The ECA  audits a sampling of all the transactions that have been  conducted (“ex-post audit”). They then issue a report  with their findings. For several consecutive years, the  ECA has not found any issues that required it to issue  findings on the Agency’s transactions. This suggests  that ENISA’s 100% ex-ante verification strategy is very  effective. Nevertheless, as soon as the Agency has more  human resources available, bi-annual ex-post controls  exercises will be instituted in order to strengthen  controls regarding legality and regularity.  3.1.2 Fraud prevention and detection  The Agency is developing its anti-fraud strategy  as foreseen in the Commission’s overall anti-fraud  strategy9. The strategy will be implemented before the  end of 2014.  9 COM(2011) 376 24.06.2011.  3.2 ASSESSMENT OF  AUDIT RESULTS AND  FOLLOW UP OF AUDIT  RECOMMENDATIONS  3.2.1 Internal Audit Service (IAS)  In 2013, the Internal Audit Service (IAS) visited ENISA.  The IAS carried out an audit on project management  in ENISA’s operations. At the end of the IAS visit, five  recommendations were issued. The Agency took  prompt action on these five recommendations. In fact,  as of the first quarter of 2014, the IAS had already advised  closure of four of the recommendations, while the last  recommendation only requires further validation at the  Agency’s premises.  The Internal Control Coordinator role (ICC) was fully  deployed by September 2013. Due to a lack of staff,  the Agency uses resources shared across the Agency  to ensure that all procedures are addressed. The  implementation and subsequent closure of open  recommendations was the first priority for the ICC, and  the Agency was able to close several recommendations.  Some of the recommendations require validation at  ENISA. The Agency and the IAS agreed that all of these  recommendations were properly addressed and that  they will be verified during the third quarter of 2014.  A schedule was agreed upon to assure that all  recommendations are closed by the third quarter of  2014.  3.2.2 European Court of Auditors (ECA)  The European Court of Auditors (ECA) issued two  important recommendations regarding ENISA in 2012.  One recommendation concerned the need to improve  the transparency of recruitment at ENISA’s new office in  Athens, while the other concerned the need to improve  the management of fixed assets. After the first visit by  the ECA in March 2013, the Agency took all necessary  measures to assure completely transparent recruitment  procedures, and the recommendation concerning the  transparency of recruitment was closed by the ECA.  34  MANAGEMENT OF RESOURCES  The last recommendation concerning the management  of fixed assets will be evaluated during the ECA’s visit  in April 2014. A full physical inventory was conducted,  in line with the rules in practice, across both Agency  premises in Heraklion and Athens. The retirement  exercise, which included the reconciliation of fixed  assets with the accounts, was successfully realised.  The ECA’s visit of April 2014 will include the audit of the  2013 accounts. The ECA is expected to issue its final  report in the third quarter of 2014. The Agency expects  that the Court’s opinion on the true and fair presentation  of the accounts as well as on the legality and regularity  of the transactions underlying the accounts will be  unqualified as it has been for the last seven years.  ASSESSMENT OF  THE EFFECTIVENESS  OF THE INTERNAL  CONTROL SYSTEMS  4  36  ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS  ENISA has adopted a set of internal control standards,  based on international good practice, that aim to ensure  the achievement of policy and operational objectives.  As regards financial management, compliance with  these standards is compulsory.  The Agency has also put in place the organisational  structure and the internal control systems suited to  the achievement of policy and control objectives, in  accordance with the standards and having due regard  to the risks associated with the environment in which  it operates.  In 2010, the Management Board of the Agency adopted  a set of 16 internal control standards laying down the  minimum requirements with which its internal control  systems need to comply. Previously developed internal  procedures were grouped together, prioritised and  implemented in the daily workflows of the Agency, as  deemed appropriate.  In 2013, the Agency focused on compliance with the  standards that were identified as areas of concern  during the risk assessment exercise, as well as on the  recommendations raised by the auditing bodies (ECA  and IAS). During 2013, the Agency achieved compliance  with the internal control standards listed below.  Mission (ICS 1)  The Agency’s mission and scope is described in the  ENISA Regulation. Mission statements for departments  and units were established based on the evolution of  the organisation in 2013. The roles and tasks of each  department and unit are clearly defined.  Ethical and organisational values (ICS 2)  The Agency has procedures in place – including  updates and yearly reminders – to ensure that all staff is  aware of relevant ethical and organisational values (e.g.  ethical conduct, avoidance of conflicts of interest, fraud  prevention, reporting of irregularities). Specific training  is organised by the Agency for its staff every year in  order to reinforce professional behaviour, compliance  with the expected behaviour, ethics and integrity, and  in order to prevent workplace harassment.  Staff Allocation and Mobility (ICS 3)  Whenever necessary – at least once per year –  management aligns organisational structures and staff  allocations with priorities and workload.  Staff evaluation and development (ICS 4)  In the context of the Career Development Report (CDR)  process, discussions are held individually with all staff  to establish their annual objectives. Staff performance  is evaluated according to standards set by the Agency.  An annual training plan is developed at Agency level  based on needs deriving from the policy of the Agency.  As part of the Career Development Plan (CDP) process,  every year each staff member completes an individual  training plan.  Management ensures that at a minimum every staff  member attends the compulsory training courses  defined in the annual training plan.  37  ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS  Objectives and Performance Indicators (ICS 5)  Work Programme and budget preparation procedures  were developed in 2009 and will be revised in 2014.  The Annual Work Programme (WP) of the Agency is  developed by the Agency services, with continuous  input and guidance from its two governing bodies, the  Management Board and the Permanent Stakeholders  Group. The WP clearly sets out how the planned  activities at each management level contribute to  the achievement of objectives, taking into account  the resources allocated and the risks identified. The  WP objectives are established on SMART (Specific,  Measureable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)  criteria and updated or changed during the year in  order to address significant changes in priorities and  activities.  The Agency has based the measurement of its  performance on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  that are applied to all areas of activity. KPIs are  more qualitative for the Agency’s operational goals,  whereas they are more quantitative for the Agency’s  administrative goals. The effectiveness of key controls is  assessed using relevant KPIs, including self-assessments  that have been carried out in the form of progress  reports and follow up actions that seek to re-align  divergences from the Work Programme.  The Agency’s Work Programmes are annual. The MB  and the PSG give orientation and input on a regular  basis throughout the WP development process as well  as during the year of implementation.  ENISA installed the project management tool MATRIX,  which has streamlined and consolidated the planning,  monitoring and reporting functions in a uniform and  comprehensive way.  Finally, the Agency managed to rectify the budget  under-spending highlighted by the IAS in 2009,  by optimising budget execution in four following  consecutive years. The commitment rate of budget  appropriations available for the year 2013 (C1) reached  99.99%, another consecutive year in which the total  Agency budget was consumed.  Risk management process (ICS 6)  The IAS performed a risk assessment of the Agency in  2012.  Risks identified as very important during the previous  audits were addressed by the Agency and actions were  planned and communicated to the IAS accordingly. In  2013, effort and resources were devoted to addressing  and mitigating the risks that had been identified. This  satisfactorily addressed the recommendations of both  the ECA and IAS, as noted in their annual reports.  Operational structure (ICS 7)  Delegation of authority is clearly defined, assigned and  communicated by means of the Executive Director’s  Decisions (EDD). It conforms to regulatory requirements  and is appropriate to the level of importance of the  decisions to be taken as well as the risks involved. All  delegated, authorising officers have received and  acknowledged the Charter of the role and responsibility  of the Authorising Officer (by Delegation) as well as the  individual delegation EDD.  The Agency’s sensitive functions are clearly defined,  recorded and kept up to date.  The Agency records derogations granted to allow staff  to remain in sensitive functions beyond five years along  with documentation of the risk analysis and the controls  for mitigation.  As regards sensitive functions, due care has been taken  in order to avoid potential conflict of interest situations.  However, due to the small size of the Agency, the  mobility of staff in sensitive functions is very limited  and takes into account service needs and available  resources. Proper back-ups are designated in order to  ensure business continuity.  38  ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS  Processes and Procedures (ICS 8)  Several policies were developed to strength the  Processes and Procedures Internal Control Standard.  The Agency created a policy on financial circuits.  The roles and responsibilities of financial actors are  described in this policy as well as existing workflows.  A Code of Professional Conduct for ex-ante financial  verification was developed. This document emphasises  the role and responsibilities of the Financial Verifying  Agent.  The Executive Director’s decision on the Register of  Exceptions Procedure was updated.  As the Agency lacks the resources to execute ex-post  control, a strategy of 100% ex-ante controls was decided  upon and applied.  Management supervision (ICS 9)  Management at all levels supervises the activities for  which they are responsible and tracks the main issues  identified. The Management Team, which comprises  the Executive Director and the heads of departments  and units, meets weekly and sets priorities for the  actions to be taken in order to achieve the short- and  medium-term objectives of the Agency. A list of action  items is compiled. It contains all agreed actions as  allocated to specific departments or units. The list is  published on a dedicated Intranet page and regularly  reviewed by the Management Team. Management  supervision covers both legality and regularity aspects  (i.e. set up and compliance with applicable rules) and  operational performance (i.e. achievement of Annual  WP objectives).  Management also establishes action plans in order to  address accepted ECA and IAS audit recommendations  and monitors the implementation of these action plans  throughout the year.  The implementation of the project management tool  MATRIX, has enhanced the planning, implementation,  monitoring and reporting of operational projects, and  has enabled the establishment of a common project  management framework across different organisational  units of the Agency.  Business continuity (ICS 10)  Adequate measures – including handover files and  deputising arrangements for relevant operational  activities and financial transactions – are in place to  ensure the continuity of all services during “business- as-usual” interruptions (such as sick leave, staff mobility,  migration to new IT systems, incidents, etc.).  An IT Business Continuity Plan (BCP) has been developed  and implemented. An Agency-wide BCP, designed to  cover crisis response and recovery arrangements with  respect to major disruptions, has been developed  and fully implemented. The latter BCP identifies the  functions, services and infrastructure that need to be  restored within certain time limits and the resources  necessary for this purpose.  Electronic and hardcopy versions of both BCPs are  stored in secure and easily accessible locations, which  are known to relevant staff.  39  ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS  Document management (ICS 11)  Document management systems and their related  procedures comply with: 1) relevant compulsory security  measures; 2) provisions on document management; and  3) rules on the protection of personal data. Information  security policy specific to data categorisation and  labelling is in place. As regards the exchange of  information classified at the level RESTREINT UE/EU  RESTRICTED, an administrative arrangement between  the Security Directorate of the European Commission  and the Agency was signed on 27 May 2011.  An internal document management guide sets out  the conditions according to which documents need  to be registered, filed and saved using the Agency’s  registration and filing systems. A special, intranet-based  tool was developed to capture the information needed  to register and retrieve documents. In addition, an  incoming and outgoing mail procedure was developed.  Information and communication (ICS 12)  Internal communication measures and practices are in  place for sharing information and monitoring activities.  These include regular Management Team meetings  during which issues relevant to performance, audit  results and financial information are discussed, and  actions are decided upon and assigned. Regular financial  reporting is available to all staff on ENISA’s intranet. All  engagements in new projects are discussed during  the implementation of the Annual Work Programme  and decisions are documented and communicated.  An External Communication Strategy is in place. ICT  security policies are in place for main systems and  sub-systems, and described in procedures and policies.  Internal communication is also supported through  use of the intranet and through weekly staff meetings  within units.  External communication and dissemination procedures  must be further developed and communicated to staff  accordingly.  Accounting and Financial Reporting (ICS 13)  All finance and accounting procedures are documented  in the Internal Control Manual of the Agency. The  preparation, implementation, monitoring and reporting  on budget implementation is centralised in the Finance,  Accounting and Procurement Section, within the  Administration and Support Department.  The European Commission’s budget and accounting  management system, ABAC, is the main tool used for  financial management. It is compliant with applicable  financial regulatory frameworks. The ABAC Assets  module has been used since 2011 for the management  of ENISA’s inventory.  Financial management information produced by the  Agency, including financial information provided in  the Annual Activity Report, complies with applicable  financial and accounting rules.  Evaluation of activities (ICS 14)  Key performance indicators are used in order to measure  the performance and assess the impact of the Agency’s  projects as provided for in its Annual Work Programmes.  The General Report and the Annual Activity Report are  the tools used by the Agency to report on performance  and impact. The feedback of relevant stakeholders is  taken into account.  Assessment of internal control systems (ICS 15)  Each year, ENISA’s management assesses the compliance  of annual activities and performance with the internal  control systems in place, as part of preparation of the  Annual Activity Report.  40  ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS  Internal Audit Capability (ICS 16)  The Head of the Administration and Support  Department assumes the Internal Control Coordination  (ICC) function. He is responsible for implementing  internal control systems in the Agency and liaising  with the IAS of the European Commission. As the  Agency lacks human resources, the role of Internal  Audit Capability (IAC) cannot be performed. Since 2005,  the Agency has relied on the IAS to carry out internal  audits. The IAS plays a key role in auditing bodies of the  European Union.  Internal Control tasks performed in ENISA include  100% of ex ante verifications, hierarchical controls and  outsourced engagements, coordinated by the ICC.  In line with the Strategic Audit Plan 2013-2015, the  Internal Audit Service (IAS) carried out an audit on  Project Management in Operations at ENISA.  The role of ICC was reinforced in order to comply with all  the recommendations issued by the IAS and ECA.  Concerning the overall state of the internal control  system, generally the Agency complies with the three  assessment criteria for effectiveness: (1) staff that  have the requisite knowledge and skills; (2) systems  and procedures designed and implemented to  manage the key risks effectively; and (3) no instances  of ineffective controls that have exposed the Agency  to substantial risk.  Enhancing the effectiveness of the Agency’s control  arrangements is an on-going effort, as part of the  continuous improvement of management procedures.  It includes taking into account any control weaknesses  reported and exceptions recorded.  MANAGEMENT  ASSURANCE  5  42  MANAGEMENT ASSUR ANCE  5.1 REVIEW OF THE ELEMENTS SUPPORTING ASSURANCE  Assessment by management:  The Agency’s operations are channelled through the  following activity areas that belong to administrative  functions:  • Own resources (staff) that carry out tasks in line  with the annual work programme in terms of  operational and administrative activities.  • Contractors that support operational activities  and other support activities that cannot be  in-sourced by the Agency. External agents  are appointed either through a procurement  procedure or through a call for expressions of  interest for funding related to the co-organisation  of events. Alternatively, in the case of working  group members, they may be chosen by means of  a selection procedure.  The risk framework is used as a common means of  classifying and communicating risk across the agency.  It provides a common understanding and language  regarding “risk”, as well a structure for the assessment,  reporting and monitoring of risk. The risk framework  defines the categories, sub-categories and business  risks applicable at the organisational level, for ENISA as  a whole. It includes:  • Risk categories and sub-categories • Risks specific to each category (business risks) • Risk definitions  43  M ANAGEMENT ASSUR ANCE  To mitigate compliance risks with regard to its administrative activities, the Agency has carried out the activities  presented in the table below:  Systemic process Activity Performance indicator  1 Follow up on auditor’s  comments and  recommendations regarding  ADM practices and procedures  as they are implemented in line  with Financial Regulation (FR),  Implementing Rules (IR) and  Staff Regulations (SR).  Update of documents and  activities reporting.  Feedback by auditors in the next  application period and overall  improvement of performance.  2 Opening and closing of the  annual budget and preparation  of budgetary statements.  Approved budget tree  opened, appropriations  posted properly.  Annual budget lines open and running by  the end of the year with the anticipated  budget, economic outturn account and  supporting operations completed in time.  3 Implementation and  consolidation of internal  controls, as appropriate.  Annual review of internal  controls.  Guidelines and checklists reviewed, annual  risk assessment done.  Controls updated  accordingly. Staff participation and  information.  4 Performance evaluation Organise annual  performance evaluation.  Administer appeals  Number of evaluations carried out.  5 Annual training programme Draft the generic training  plan of the Agency.  Document presentation and  implementation of programme.  6 Recruitment plan Execute the Agency  recruitment plan in line  with the Establishment  Plan.  Number of staff hired to cover new posts or  make up for resignations.  7 Internal ICT networks and  systems  Secure ICT networks and  systems in place.  Results of external security assessment/ audit.  8 Public procurement Regular, consistent  observation of public  procurement practices  and appropriate  assistance provided to all  departments.  Clear mandate of the procurement  function established, staff informed,  forms available, number and type of  procurement processes handled, files of  procurement processes organized, files for  audit available. List of number of purchase  orders per supplier, number of complaints  processed.  9 Contract management General support on  contract management.  Number of contracts prepared and signed  by the Agency, number of requests for  support received from departments,  number of claims processed.  10 Ex-ante controls Well developed at  procedural, operational and  financial level.  Number of transactions as compared to  number of erroneous transactions.  11 Ex-post controls Developed with the  assistance of the  professional service  provider.  Number of transactions as compared to  number of erroneous transactions.  44  MANAGEMENT ASSUR ANCE  Exceptions  In 2013, the Agency faced three main categories of  deviation that led to exceptions reported in the Register  of Exceptions:  • A posteriori commitments • Procedural errors • Missions guideline interpretation  The main reasons associated with the a posteriori  commitments were limitations in planning.  The information reported in Parts 2 and 3 stems from  the results of auditing by management and auditors.  The results are contained in the reports listed. These  reports result from a systematic analysis of the evidence  available. This approach provides sufficient guarantees  as to the completeness and reliability of the information  reported, and results in complete coverage of the  budget delegated to the Executive Director of ENISA.  45  DECL AR ATION OF ASSUR ANCE  DECLARATION OF ASSURANCE  I, the undersigned,  Udo Helmbrecht  Executive Director of the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  In my capacity as authorising officer  Declare that the information contained in this report gives a true and fair view10.  State that I have reasonable assurance that the resources assigned to the activities described in this  report have been used for their intended purpose and in accordance with the principles of sound  financial management, and that the control procedures put in place give the necessary guarantees  concerning the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.  This reasonable assurance is based on my own judgement and on the information at my disposal,  such as the results of the self-assessment, ex-post controls, the work of the internal audit capability,  the observations of the Internal Audit Service and the lessons learnt from the reports of the Court of  Auditors for years prior to the year of this declaration.  Confirm that I am not aware of anything not reported here which could harm the interests of the  institution .  Heraklion, 17/06/2014  [signed]  Udo Helmbrecht  Executive Director  10  True and fair in this context means a reliable, complete and correct view on the state of affairs in the service.  46  47  ANNEXES  48  ANNE XES  ANNEX 1: HUMAN AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES  Code ABB Activity ABB Activity Full Time Equivalents (FTE)  Work Stream 1 Evolving Risk Environment & Opportunities 3.1  Work Stream 2 Improving Pan-European CIIP & Resilience 11.9  Work Stream 3 Enabling Communities to improve NIS 10.0  SR Stakeholder Relations 2.5  PS Project Support Activities 0.6  PAU Public Affairs Activities 3.9  None Management & support activities 8.0  Total 40.0*  * Staff directly involved in the implementation of the Annual Work Programme  Financial resources  In 2013, the Agency allocated its appropriations at a rate of 99.99% (considering the non-automatic carry overs as  committed on 31/12/2013), repeating the performances of 2012, 2011 and 2010. The efficient planning of Work  Programme projects and relevant procurement procedures, allowed the Agency to carry out its operational activities  as specified in the Work Programme 2013 within the year 2013, and to make the investments needed to ensure an  appropriate operating environment, compliance with the regulatory framework and the continued provision of  services by the Agency.  ANNE XES  49  Payments reached the level of 91.6% of the total committed appropriation and 86% of the total appropriations for  2013. In addition, the payment rate of the appropriations carried forward from 2012 reached the level of 92%. These  figures demonstrate the strong effort made to finalise administrative and operational activities and deliverables within  the financial year. Both commitment and payment rates confirm the sustained capacity of the Agency to efficiently  utilise its annual budget, given that the appropriations of the Agency are non-differentiated. An overview of the year’s  performance follows below:  Total EU Subsidy – C1  Budget  Title  Description Budget (‘000 EUR)  Committed (‘000 EUR)  % Paid (‘000 EUR)  %  Title 1 Staff expenditure 5,743 5,743 100% 5,545 97%  Title 2 Administrative expenditure 1,389 884 64% 568 41%  Title 3 Operational expenditure 1,898 1,898 100% 1,695 89%  Total 9,030 8,525 94% 7,807 86%  External Assigned revenue (rent subsidy from Hellenic Republic) – R0  Budget  Title  Description Budget (‘000 EUR)  Committed (‘000 EUR)  % Paid (‘000 EUR)  %  Title 2 Administrative expenditure 640 640 100% 340 53%  Total Budget 640 640 100% 340 53%  Carry forward (N+1) – C8 or C3  Type Budget %  Automatic Carry Forwards to year N+1 (C8) 718 7.95%  Non-automatic Carry Overs to year N+1 – on MB decision1 (C3) 505 5.59%  Adjusted Commitments’ rate2 100%  Adjusted Payments’ rate3 100%  1 This amount corresponds to two calls for tenders launched in 2013 for works necessary for Athens office refurbishment (tentative cost 480,000 EUR)  and for the lease of optical fibre line for Athens office (tentative cost 24,934 EUR); both contracts will be awarded in 2014. The amount was carried  over to 2014 with the approval of the Management Board, and committed in March 2014.  2 The adjusted commitments’ rate corresponds to rate of the sum of actual commitments made plus the non-automatic carry overs over total C1  appropriations (EU subsidy received in 2013). The rent subsidy received by the Hellenic Republic is excluded as it is a separate source of revenue.  3 The adjusted payments’ rate corresponds to rate of the actual payments made over the actual commitments made on C1 appropriations (EU subsidy  received in 2013). It excludes the amount of the non-automatic carry over (504,934 EUR) as it was not available for payment. The rent subsidy  received by the Hellenic Republic is excluded as it is a separate source of revenue.  ANNE XES  50  The initial Budget of ENISA was amended twice in 2013 in order to include:  • The amount of 480,632 EUR requested to the Budgetary Authority for the estimated refurbishment works and  other investments needed for the new Athens office.  • The amount of 640,000 EUR granted as a rent subsidy by the Hellenic Republic by a Greek Law and a subsequent  ministerial decision of the Minister of Infrastructure, Transport and Networks signed in September 2013.  Statistics on ENISA staff As of 31/12/2013, ENISA counts 59 Staff members: 43 TA’s (27 AD’s and 16 AST’s), 13 CA’s and 3 SNE’s.

Main risks It may happen  (again) that…  Mitigating controls How to determine  coverage frequen- cy and depth  How to estimate  the costs and ben- efits of controls  Possible control  indicators  The needs of  the Agency are  not well defined  (operationally and  economically) so  that the decision  to procure was  inappropriate to  meet the operational  objectives.  Interruption or  delay of the services  provided due to  late contracting  (poor planning and  organisation of  the procurement  process).  Publication  of intended  procurement/work  programme  100% of the forecast  procurements  (open procedures  published in the  Official Journal of the  European Union and  on ENISA’s website)  are justified in a note  addressed to the  AO(D).  Costs: estimation of  cost of staff involved  and the related  contract values (if  external expertise is  used).  Benefits: number of  purchases rejected  as unjustified.  Estimation of  litigation avoided  and eventual  discontinuation of  the service provided.  Effectiveness:  number of projected  tenders cancelled;  number of contracts  discontinued or  under-utilised due to  poor planning.  Efficiency: for  consultancy  based tenders for  operations; average  person day cost per  tender.  Validation by  Authorising  Officer Sub  Delegated (AO[S] D) of justification  (economic,  operation) for  launching a  procurement  process.  100% of the forecast  procurements.  Decisions  discussed/taken at  management team  meeting.  All key procurement  procedures (>  amounts and/or  having significant  impact on the  objectives of  the Agency) are  discussed at  management team  meeting.  ANNE XES  57  B - Needs assessment & definition of needs  Main control objectives: Effectiveness, efficiency and economy.  Compliance (legality and regularity).  Main risks It may happen  (again) that…  Mitigating controls How to determine  coverage frequen- cy and depth  How to estimate  the costs and ben- efits of controls  Possible control  indicators  The best offer/s  are not accepted if  they are incorrectly  submitted due  to poorly defined  tender specifications.  AOSD supervision  and approval of  specifications.  100% of the  specifications are  scrutinised. Depth  may be determined  by the amount and/ or the impact on  the objectives of the  Agency.  Costs: estimation of  cost of staff involved  and the related  contract values (if  external expertise is  used).  Benefits: limit the  risk of litigation,  limit the risk of  cancellation of a  tender. Amount of  contracts for which  the approval and  supervisory control  detected material  error.  Effectiveness: N° of  ‘open’ or procedures  where only one or no  offers were received. N° of requests  for clarification  regarding the tender.  Efficiency: Estimated  average cost of  a procurement  procedure.  Additional  supervisory  verification by  specialised expert  actor or entity.  100% of the  tenders above a  financial threshold  (e.g.>60.000 €) are  reviewed. Depth risk  based, depends on  the sensitivity.  ANNE XES  58  C – Selection of the offer & evaluation  Main control objectives: Effectiveness, efficiency and economy. Compliance (legality and  regularity). Fraud prevention and detection.  Main risks It may happen  (again) that…  Mitigating controls How to determine  coverage frequen- cy and depth  How to estimate  the costs and ben- efits of controls  Possible control  indicators  The most  economically  advantageous offer  not being selected  due to a biased,  inaccurate or ‘unfair’  evaluation process.  Formal evaluation  process: Opening committee  and Evaluation  committee.  100% of the offers  analysed. Depth: all  documents  transmitted.  Costs: estimation of  costs Involved. Benefits:  Compliance with FR.  Difference between  the most onerous  offer and the  selected one.  Effectiveness:  Numbers of ‘valid’  complaints or  litigation cases filed.  Efficiency: Cost of  successful tender  minus cost of the  most onerous one  (or average cost). Average cost of a  tendering procedure.  Opening and  Evaluation Committees’  declaration of  absence of conflicts  of interest.  100% of the  members of the  opening committee  and the evaluation  committee.  Costs: estimation of  cost of staff involved. Benefits: Amount  of contracts for  which the control  prevented the risk of  litigation or fraud.  Exclusion criteria  documented.  100% checked.  Depth: required  documents provided  are consistent.  Costs: estimation of  cost of staff involved. Benefits: Avoid  contracting with  excluded economic  operators.  Standstill period,  opportunity for  unsuccessful  tenderers to put  forward their  concerns on the  decision.  100% when  conditions are  fulfilled.  Costs: estimation of  cost of staff involved. Benefits: Number  of procurements  successfully  challenged during  standstill period.  ANNE XES  59  Stage 2 – Financial transactions  Main control objectives: Ensuring that the implementation of the contract is in compliance  with the signed contract  Main risks It may happen  (again) that…  Mitigating controls How to determine  coverage frequen- cy and depth  How to estimate  the costs and ben- efits of controls  Possible control  indicators  The planned  products/services/ works are not, totally  or partially, provided  in accordance  with the technical  description and  requirements  foreseen in the  contract and/or  the amounts paid  exceed those due  in accordance with  the applicable  contractual  and regulatory  provisions. Business  discontinues  because contractor  fails to deliver.  Operational and  financial checks in  accordance with the  financial circuits.  Operation  authorisation by the  AO.  For riskier  operations, ex-ante  in-depth verification.  100% of the  contracts are  controlled, including  only value-adding  checks.  Riskier operations  subject to in-depth  controls.  The depth depends  on risk criteria.  Costs: estimation of  cost of staff involved.  Benefits: Amount of  irregularities, errors  and overpayments  prevented by the  controls.  Effectiveness:  % error rate  prevented  (amount of errors/ irregularities averted  over total payments);  Number of control  failures; Number/ amount of liquidated  damages.  Efficiency: Average cost per  open project; % cost  over annual amount  disbursed; Time- to-payment; Late  interest payment  and damages paid  (by the Agency).  For high-risk  operations,  reinforced  monitoring on  deliverables timing.  Management of  sensitive functions.  High-risk operations  identified by risk  criteria. Amount and  potential impact  on the Agency  operations of late or  no delivery.  ANNE XES  60  Stage 3 – Supervisory measures  Main control objectives: Ensuring that any weakness in the procedures (tender and financial  transactions) is detected and corrected  Main risks It may happen  (again) that…  Mitigating controls How to determine  coverage frequency  and depth  How to estimate the  costs and benefits  of controls  Possible control  indicators  An error or non- compliance  with regulatory  and contractual  provisions,  including technical  specifications,  or a fraud is not  prevented, detected  or corrected by ex- ante control, prior to  payment.  Supervisory  desk review of  procurement and  financial transactions.  Representative  sample.  Depth: review of  the procedures  implemented  (procurement  and financial  transactions).  Costs: estimation of  cost of staff involved.  Benefits: Amounts  detected associated  with fraud & error. Deterrents  & systematic  weaknesses  corrected.  Effectiveness:  Amounts associated  with errors detected  (related to fraud,  irregularities and  error). In % over total checked. N° system  improvements made.  Efficiency: Costs of  the ex post controls  and supervisory  measures with  respect to the  ‘benefits’. Average cost of an  ex-post control.  Ex-post publication  (possible reaction  from tenderer /  potential tenderer  such as whistle  blowing).  Potentially 100%  Review of ex post  results.  100% at least once a  year. Depth: look for  any systemic problem  in the procurement  procedure and in the  financial transaction  procedure and any  weakness in the  selection process of  the ex post controls.  Review of exceptions  reported.  100% at least once  a year. Depth: look  for any weakness  in the procedures  (procurement  and financial  transactions).  Review of the process  after each procedure.  100%.  Depth: review any  significant problem  that occurred.  ANNE XES  61  ANNEX 4: PERFORMANCE INFORMATION  INCLUDED IN EVALUATIONS As this is a new requirement for ENISA’s Annual Activity Report, the Agency will change its approach. Until 2014, ENISA  approached the topic of “impact assessment” in a more global way, by commissioning an impact assessment of the  Agency as a whole. ENISA is now looking into making the assessment of the direct impact of its products, deliverables  and services an inherent part of its project management. This approach has already been applied in selected projects  in 2014. For example, by issuing evaluation sheets to participants of training programmes or workshops, by issuing  surveys in order to assess the quality of products or by assessing an entire thematic area (impact assessment in the  area of CERT support).

This has been a year of changes, largely characterised  by two major events:  • Firstly, the EU’s cyber security strategy was  published. This pushed cyber security to  the political level, where three European  commissioners joined forces to conduct a  comprehensive analysis of the situation and  propose remedies for Europe as we move ahead.  • Secondly, in this new political landscape, the  successful final negotiation and consequent  adoption of our new mandate occurred on 18th  June 2013. One of its effects is that the “General  Report” will be called the “Annual Activity Report”  in the future.  In 2013, we also welcomed a new Chair of the  Management Board, Mr Jörgen Samuelsson of Sweden,  while at the same time thanking the outgoing Chair  from Finland, Mrs Mari Herranen for her excellent work.  The message underlying this report is that ENISA  continues to be a recognised player and trusted partner  for the Member States of the European Union and  globally. Our experience, insight, expertise and added  value have become increasingly acknowledged and  appreciated among all cyber security actors; Member  states, EU institutions, policy makers and practitioners  in industry, academia, as well as citizens. In all, 2013 has  probably been ENISA’s most challenging year and at the  same time its most successful year to date. Our Work  Programme tasks were completed on time and within  budget. The level of financial performance that ENISA  achieved was very high, especially given the challenges  that we faced. Not the least of these challenges was the  transfer of ENISA’s operational staff from Heraklion to  Athens, which happened without any disruption to our  planned activities.  For an agency in the field of cyber security, which faces  a constantly evolving threat environment, our success is  measured by the accuracy of our insight and the value  of our recommendations rather than by how well we  performed in the past. The borders between the virtual  and real worlds are dissolving, as new technologies,  services and business models push existing concepts  and regulation to their limits. The organisational  structures and physical barriers that ensured security  in the past are now largely obsolete, and in some  cases, have been breached by cyber threats that are  continually evolving. Taking positive, concrete steps to  manage these challenges requires that we acknowledge  the risks and costs of not addressing the challenges. It  requires increased cooperation between all actors at all  levels. Whilst cooperation will not happen overnight,  ENISA will continue to bring communities together and  to encourage information exchange that is based on  concrete goals. This will lay the foundation for a more  effective collaboration model in the years to come. As  part of this approach, ENISA signed a Memorandum  of Understanding with CEN/CENELEC and initiated  preparations to renew with Europol and ETSI in 2014.  2  Whilst the following are just a few of the highlights of  this year’s work, they perfectly illustrate the contribution  that the Agency is making to a more secure Europe:  • The ENISA Cloud Report.  • The ENISA annual Threat Landscape Report.  • In terms of the development of ENISA’s activities,  the Agency followed up on last year’s success as  the principal player in Europe’s Cyber Incident  Reporting framework, under Article 13a of the  EU’s Telecommunications Framework Regulation.  • In the area of Computer Emergency Response  Teams (CERTs), the Agency continued to  strengthen cooperation within the CERT  community.  • We hosted the 2nd cyber security crisis  cooperation conference as well as the ENISA  annual conference for stakeholders in Brussels at  the end of the year.  • The first fully fledged European Cyber Security  Month (ECSM) took place in October and involved  several Member States and other stakeholders.  In addition to the above planned activities, ENISA  responded swiftly and professionally to an increasing  number of requests for assistance (the so-called ‘Article  14 Requests’) from the Member States.  Looking to the future, it is clear that the new ENISA  Regulation, adopted by the European Parliament and  the Council of Ministers in 2013, will allow the Agency  to support the Member States more effectively in the  future. Although there is still a significant amount of  work to be done to achieve the vision of a harmonised  approach to cyber security across the EU, it is  encouraging to note that significant progress has been  made in collaborating across communities and across  national boundaries. ENISA is proud to have contributed  to these improvements.  Finally, I would like to say that I am grateful for the hard  work, dedication and support of all of the Agency’s staff,  the members of its Permanent Stakeholders Group,  as well as guidance received from the Management  Board. All of these actors enabled the Agency to meet  its commitments to Europe successfully, despite the  challenging new conditions and increased workload  throughout the year.

(ENISA) IN BRIEF  ENISA was established in 2004 by Regulation (EC)  No. 460/2004 of the European Parliament and the  Council. This regulation was subsequently amended  by Regulation (EC) No. 1007/2008 of the European  Parliament and the Council and Regulation (EC) No.  580/2011 of the European Parliament and the Council,  extending ENISA’s mandate until 13 September 2013.  Regulation (EU) No. 526/2013 of the European  Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013  concerning the European Union Agency for Network  and Information Security and repealing Regulation  (EC) No. 460/2004 (“Regulation (EU) No. 526/2013”)  further extended ENISA’s mandate until 19 June 2020.  The Agency is governed by a Management Board (MB)  composed of one representative from each EU Member  State and EEA country (Iceland, Liechtenstein, and  Norway), and two representatives from the European  Commission. On 17 October 2013, the MB established  the Executive Board to enhance the effectiveness and  efficiency of the operations of the Agency.  ENISA is managed by its Executive Director, who is  appointed by the Management Board from a list of  candidates proposed by the European Commission and  following a hearing in the European Parliament.  The  Agency’s headquarters is in Heraklion, Crete, Greece,  with a branch office in Athens, Greece.  The ENISA Management Board (MB) and the Permanent  Stakeholders Group (PSG), the latter consisting  of 30 leading experts in network and information  security acting independently of Member States and  companies, assists ENISA by providing advice to extend  the Agency’s networking and information gathering  capabilities.  In line with established practice, two Management  Board meetings and one Permanent Stakeholders’  group meeting were held as planned during the 2013.  ENISA Management Board meeting in Crete  European Cyber Security Month - ENISA ED Austrian  media briefing  In 2013, the MB adopted a number of administrative,  management and budgetary decisions to implement  Regulation (EU) No. 523/2013. The MB also adopted the  Work Programme for 2014. Minutes and decisions of the  Management Board are available on the ENISA website  (http://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure- organization/management-board).  7  INTRODUCTION  Furthermore, an informal joint meeting between the  Management Board and the Permanent Stakeholders  Group took place in February 2013 in Greece. The  meeting focused on setting the priorities and themes  of the Work Programme 2014. In addition, an informal  Management Board meeting on strategic guidance  for Work Programme 2015 was held in Brussels in  November 2013.  The network of National Liaison Officers (NLO) was  created as a partnership network of ENISA and its  member countries. Although not a formal body, this  network is of great value to ENISA, serving as the point  of contact with Member States. The NLO consists of  experts in national entities involved in network and  information security at the national level. As ENISA’s  contact points with Member States, throughout  2013 and before, the NLOs have been asked to  provide feedback and assistance in disseminating  information as well as in providing relevant contacts  to ENISA to support implementation of the ENISA  work programme.  In line with the operational and horizontal objectives  of the Agency, ENISA’s organisational structure (see  Figure 1) was reorganised by the Executive Director in  December 2013. The organisational structure shows  two departments divided in three units/sections each.  The Agency’s organisational structure is dictated by the  new challenges identified by its two locations and its  stakeholders and the consequent need to address the  rapidly changing operating environment with the limited  number of human resources at the Agency’s disposal.  As a knowledge-based organisation, ENISA relies on its  personnel to deliver its services to its stakeholders and  ensure compliance with the regulatory framework. As  an EU Agency, ENISA benefits from having a diverse,  multi-national workforce.  In 2013, there was an increased focus on communicating  ENISA’s work and concepts to the European Commission,  the Council and the European Parliament as well as  other EU agencies and regional organisations. Regular  meetings with various Commission services, and DG  CONNECT in particular, took place during the year.  Pict.1 ENISA organisational chart (as of December 2013.)

Two pivotal points marked 2013: the transfer of staff  to the Athens office and promulgation of the new  “ENISA II” Regulation. In 2013, the Agency successfully  supported the Greek government in selecting suitable  premises in Athens and then set up its new branch  office in record time. This involved transferring staff  without disrupting operations and with minimal impact  on their work. With end of the year establishment of  the new Athens office, ENISA also needed to work  hard to obtain a supplementary budget. The Agency  successfully achieved this with help from our partner  DG CONNECT. ENISA’s supplementary budget was  disbursed at the very end of 2013, a situation that  challenged our management and planning capabilities  to their maximum.  The second pivotal point was promulgation of the  new “ENISA II” Regulation, (EU) No. 526/2013.1 The  new Regulation provides the Agency with a new and  1 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the  Council Concerning the European Network and Information Security  Agency (ENISA), Brussels, 30.09.2010., COM(2010) 521 final  extended seven year mandate, and expands its scope  and tasks. Both the transfer of staff to the Athens office  and promulgation of the new Regulation represent  turning points in the history of the Agency.  With regards to the Work Programme 2013, the Agency  successfully delivered all 30 deliverables agreed with the  ENISA Management Board. Everything was delivered on  time and within budget, corresponding to a delivery rate  of 100%. “ANNEX 7: A list of ENISA’s Work Programme  publications” provides links to these deliverables.  Several “extra miles” reports were also delivered. As far  as operations, three major accomplishments standout.  The first was the ‘Second ENISA International Conference  on Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Exercises’, a high-level  event hosted by ENISA in Brussels at the end of 2013.  The conference aimed to directly support the EU’s new  cyber security strategy by bringing together more than  200 stakeholders to establish a more coherent cyber  security policy. The event helped to significantly raise  the Agency’s visibility with its stakeholders. Another  major accomplishment was ENISA’s annual report on  major incidents in the telecoms sector. The report was  highly appreciated and represented a milestone in that  it provided more material to analyse the trends and  patterns. A third major accomplishment was the release  of ENISA’s annual report on the threat landscape. The  report was released at the high-level event in Brussels  to our key stakeholders, and received wide acclaim.  As regards project planning and related calls for tender  (EU public procurement procedures), 10 calls for tender  for 2014 (including several Lots) were already launched  during the period November-December 2013, thereby  successfully committing 70.5% of the annual budget  for core operations for next year. Four tenders leading  to multiannual framework contracts with ‘Re-opening  of Competition’ have also been launched. They  have helped to streamline the procurement process  in thematic areas that are fundamental to ENISA’s  Regulation.  Green light for new regulation for EU Cyber Security Agency  ENISA given by the European Parliament  9  INTRODUCTION  1.3 KEY PERFORMANCE  INDICATORS  KPI1: improved non-governmental Computer  Emergency Response Teams (n/g CERTs) collaboration  capabilities (continuation of 2012 work) should be  adopted by a minimum of four Member States in 2014.  Status KPI1: already adopted by 19 Member States  during the two ENISA CERT Workshops in 2013.  KPI2: improved n/g CERT operational capabilities  (continuation of 2012 work) should be adopted by a  minimum of four Member States in 2014.  Status KPI2: already adopted by 19 Member States  during the two ENISA CERT Workshops in 2013.  KPI3: at least 20 Member States should contribute  to the work facilitated by ENISA on implementing  and enforcing article 13a and should make use of the  outcomes of this work.  Status KPI3: all EU National Regulatory Authorities  (NRAs) now contribute to ENISA’s work on incident  reporting.  KPI4:  five NRAs and 10 Cloud Computing Providers  should support ENISA’s work in the area of cloud  computing.  Status KPI4: more than 20 different private stakeholders  and more than five NRAs contribute to ENISA’s work on  cloud computing (e.g. governmental cloud, incident  reporting, etc.).  KPI5: ENISA should support the European Commission  Directorate General for Communications Networks,  Content and Technology (DG CONNECT) regarding its  proposal for a Regulation on electronic identification  and trusted services for electronic transactions in the  internal market. In doing so, ENISA should involve at  least five relevant stakeholders from public and private  sectors.  Status KPI5: ENISA has supported DG CONNECT  by providing recommendations on maintaining an  acceptable level of security at trust service providers.  The study was written by five experts from different  sectors and involved 57 organisations from within  the EU. Nearly 80 stakeholders from various sectors  validated the studies at the Trust Service Provider  workshop in September 2013.  1.4 KEY CONCLUSIONS ON  RESOURCE MANAGEMENT  AND INTERNAL CONTROL  EFFECTIVENESS  1.4.1 Resource management  In 2013 the Agency committed its appropriations at a  rate of 99.99% (100% in 2012) in order to carry out the  operational activities specified in the Work Programme  2013, as well as administrative tasks that are necessary  to ensure compliance to the regulatory framework  and the provision of services by the Agency. Payments  reached the level of 86.46% of the total appropriations  received from the Union Budget 2013. The commitment  and payment rates demonstrate an increased efficiency  in utilisation of the Budget, reconfirmed in the last 4  years.  The outturn of contracts awarded as a result of  procurement procedures completed in 2013, is as  follows:  • 25 contracts were signed: including 18 service  contracts and 7 framework contracts.  • 162 purchase orders were signed: 78 were issued  under a framework contract.  • 25 procurement procedures were issued:  including 15 open procedures consisting of 19  separate tenders.  As regards project planning and related call for tenders  (EU public procurement procedures), ten calls for  tenders for 2014 (including several Lots) were already  launched during November-December 2013, thereby  committing 70.5%2 of the Core Operations Department’s  annual budget for 2014. This included the launch of four  tenders leading to multiannual framework contracts  with ‘Re-opening of Competition’. The issuance of  multiannual framework contracts has helped to  streamline the procurement process in thematic areas  that are fundamental to ENISA’s Regulation.  2 This is a continuous improvement compared to 34.8% in 2010,  46.5% in 2011, and 64.4% in 2012.  10  INTRODUCTION  The outturn of contracts awarded as a result of  procurement procedures completed in 2013, is as  follows:  • 25 contracts were signed: including 18 service  contracts and 7 framework contracts.  • 162 purchase orders were signed: 78 were issued  under a framework contract.  • 25 procurement procedures were issued:  including 15 open procedures consisting of 19  separate tenders.  1.4.2 Internal control effectiveness  In accordance with the governance statement of the  European Commission, staff of the Agency conducts  operations in compliance with all applicable laws  and regulations, working in an open and transparent  manner to meet the high level of professional and  ethical standards that is expected.  The Agency has adopted a set of internal control  standards, based on international good practice, that  aim to ensure the achievement of policy and operational  objectives. As required by the Financial Regulation,  the Executive Director of the Agency has put in place  the organisational structure and the internal control  systems suited to the achievement of the policy and  control objectives, in accordance with the standards  and having due regard to the risks associated with the  environment in which ENISA operates.  The Agency assessed the effectiveness of its key  internal control systems during the reporting year  and concluded that the internal control standards  have been effectively implemented. In addition, the  Agency systematically examined the available control  results and indicators, including those designed for  monitoring entities to which it has entrusted budget  implementation tasks (e.g. subcontractors). The  Agency also took into account the observations and  recommendations issued by internal auditors and the  European Court of Auditors. These have been assessed  to determine their impact on management regarding  the achievement of control objectives.  Please refer to  Part 2 for further details  In conclusion, management is confident that, overall,  suitable controls are in place and working as intended;  risks are being monitored and mitigated; and the  required improvements and reinforcements are being  implemented. The Executive Director, in his capacity  as Authorising Officer, has signed the Declaration of  Assurance.  11  POLICY  ACHIEVEMENTS  2  12  POLICY ACHIE VEMENTS  2.1 ACHIEVEMENT OF  GENERAL AND SPECIFIC  EFFORTS  2.1.1 Policy area Work Stream 1: Evolving  risk environment & opportunities  Evolving risk environment & opportunities focuses on  informing policy makers and private sector companies  on how risks are evolving and on deploying strategies  to mitigate these risks. The level of detail of the analysis  should be sufficient to support strategic and policy  decisions. In addition to informing policy makers, the  objective is to mobilise stakeholder communities so  that they can achieve common goals and align their  strategies and methods. This work stream focuses on  the areas of critical information infrastructure and trust  infrastructure.  2.1.1.1 General Objective - WPK 1.1: Identification  and mitigation of threats affecting Critical  Information Infrastructure (CIIP)  Impact Indicator 1: an independent source of  information for risks, threats and threat trends,  and corresponding mitigation measures should be  developed for use by private sector companies for  enhancing their security systems and controls.  Result achieved: as of this  writing, more than 20 different  organisations are using the  conclusions of ENISA’s Threat  Landscape report. ENISA Threat  Landscape 2013 has been listed in  the Authoritative Reports and  Resources on Cybersecurity  prepared for US Congress (http:// w w w. f a s . o r g /s g p /c r s /m i s c / R42507.pdf). Several hundred  references to ENISA Threat  Landscape 2013 have been made  via the main cybersecurity web  pages and blogs.  Impact Indicator 2: policy makers should be provided  with an independent and consistent approach to the  identification of threats and risks.  Result achieved: more than five EU Member States  and the European Commission have expressed interest  in using ENISA’s Threat Landscape report as a basis for  developing their policies.

Current situation: 57 organisations took part in  the survey on trust service providers. They were all  interested in using the conclusions of the analysis. The  material was validated at the Trust Service Providers  workshop in Brussels in September 2013 by nearly 80  participants from various sectors.  ENISA lists top cyber- threats in this years  Threat Landscape  Report  13  POLICY ACHIEVEMENTS  Impact indicator 2: at least five policy makers in cyber  security should use the produced information (Source:  Work Programme 2013).  Current situation: the papers (Trusted e-ID  infrastructures and services in the EU, Trusted  provision of e-government services in the EU and eID  Authentication methods in e-Finance and e-Payment  services) were broadly distributed. The recipients  declared interest in using the information. Further  results are to be observed.  ENISA conducted a survey3 that addressed several  issues of the services that are being offered: security  practices, standards implemented and risk analysis.  The survey was complemented by a study about the  security mechanisms and interoperability issues specific  to the new regulated trust services. Several specific  recommendations to e-Government service providers  were made. These encourage the use of Trusted Third  Party service providers to implement trust services.  Such services are required to give citizens confidence in  the trustworthiness of services.  Apart from this, in 2013 ENISA launched a survey to  collect information about the electronic IDentity and  Authentication Systems (eIDAS) used in e-Finance and  e-Payment systems and to analyse the risks associated  with each eIDAS mechanism. A report documenting  best practices was created for the main actors in this  sector: financial institutions, merchants and payment  service providers.  3 The survey came under the scope of the proposed new Regulation on  electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions  in the internal market, which will supersede the current Directive  1999/93/EC on a Community framework for electronic signatures.

The results of this work stream address the managers  of the ICT systems using those infrastructures.    The  beneficiaries of the work achieved in this work stream  will be the providers of the services critical for society.  2.1.2.1 General Objective Work Package 2.1: Cyber  crisis cooperation  Impact indicator 1: at least 15 Member States should  take part in the study on National Risk Management by  2013 (Source: Work Programme 2013).  Result achieved: 22 Member States participated in the  study.  Impact indicator 2: at least 15 Member States should  request training on ENISA’s NCP Good Practice Guide  and Cyber Exercises Methodologies by 2014 (Source:  Work Programme 2013).  Result achieved: 20 Member States already requested  the training in 2013.  Impact indicator 3: at least 90% of EU Member States  and EFTA countries should confirm their support for  Cyber Europe 2014  (Source: Work Programme 2013)  Result achieved: already in 2013 over 90% of EU  Member States and EFTA countries confirmed their  support and willingness to participate in Cyber Europe  2014.  Impact indicator 4: at least 80% of Member States  should have established or be in the process of  establishing National Contingency Plans by 2016  (Source: Work Programme 2013).  Result achieved: ENISA doesn’t yet have clear signals  from the Member States. Situation is to be observed.  Impact Indicator 5: at least 80% of Member States  should have established or be in the process of  establishing National Cyber Exercises by 2016 (Source:  Work Programme 2013).  Result achieved: over 80% of Member States were in  the process of establishing National Cyber Exercises in  2013.4  In 2011 ENISA studied the National Cyber Contingency  Plans (NCPs) in several countries and prepared the  good practice guide on this subject. In 2013, the  Agency deepened its understanding of the lifecycle of  National Network Information Security Contingency  Plans (NCP) by focusing on  the National-level Cyber  Risk Assessment. ENISA aimed to develop a relevant  methodology with an emphasis on ‘how-to’. This would  help Member States to further improve their national- level contingency planning and their national-level risk  assessments for ICT services and infrastructures.  ENISA hosted the “Second ENISA International  Conference on Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Exercises”  on 23–24 September 2013 in Athens, Greece. The  conference was a unique, high-profile international  event that directly supported the EU’s new cyber  security strategy by helping stakeholders to establish  more coherent cyber security policies. In addition, the  conference was a key knowledge-sharing platform for  national and regional cyber security practitioners, both  technical experts and executives.  Cyber exercises are recognised as an essential part  of the EU’s cyber crisis cooperation and response  improvement lifecycle. ENISA is a key facilitator of these  exercises and is organising the fourth exercise of its kind,  Cyber Europe 2014. Cyber Europe 2014 is a multi-level  pan European exercise that will take place throughout  2014. Twenty-nine countries from the EU and EFTA will  participate in Cyber Europe 2014.

Result achieved: all of these impact indicators  were achieved despite the closure of EP3R and the  establishment of the NIS Platform.  Impact Indicator 2: five National Regulatory Authorities  (NRAs) and 10 Cloud Computing Providers should  support ENISA’s work in the area of cloud computing  Result achieved: more than 20 different private  stakeholders and more than five NRAs contribute to  ENISA’s work on cloud computing (e.g. governmental  cloud, incident reporting, etc.)  ENISA supported the implementation of the EU Cloud  Strategy and more specifically participated in the Cloud  Certification and Cloud Standards working group. The  result was to create a list of cloud computing certification  schemes, currently including 5 schemes, which will be  updated regularly to guide the customers through the  security requirements each certified provider offers.  Impact Indicator 3: seven Member States and 10 Private  stakeholders should take part in the development of  the “cyber security strategy” constituency.  Result achieved: more than 12 different Member  States and more than 12 private sector companies  actively contribute to ENISA’s work on cyber security  strategy and are members of this constituency creating  the ENISA NCSS experts group.  Impact Indicator 4: to cover as many of the Member  States as possible and surpass the number of Member  States (8) involved in 2012 (Source: agreements at the  beginning of 2013, no KPI in the Work Programme).  Result achieved: 60 stakeholders from 27 European  countries in total (including some non-EU countries)  participated in the European Cyber Security Month  activities.  The European Cyber Security  Month (ECSM) is an EU advocacy  campaign that takes place in  October. The main objective is  to promote cyber security  awareness among citizens, to  modify their perception of cyber  threats and to provide updated  security information through  education, the promotion of  good practices and  competitions. ECSM 2013 took  place in October in 27 countries. The event was  coordinated by the European Commission (DG  CONNECT) and ENISA. A large number of NIS  stakeholders participated in it.

In 2013 ENISA  organised 3 meetings for the Article 13a Expert  group. In spring 2013 ENISA also set up a reference  group consisting of experts from the electronic  communications industry. ENISA uses this group to  get direct feedback on its work.  Result achieved: all EU NRAs now contribute to  ENISA’s work on incident reporting. ENISA also makes  recommendations on national roaming for resilience, for  example to discuss possible national roaming schemes  with providers and to support the establishment of  mutual aid agreements between  providers in case of severe  incidents. In parallel, a study on  power supply dependencies for  the communication sector was  conducted.  Impact indicator 2: 10 NRAs  and/or Member State competent  authorities and 10 Cloud  Computing Providers should  take part in the study on incident  reporting for cloud providers.  ENISA has setup an expert group with representatives  from the private and public sector, to exchange  knowledge and information on the several studies on  Cloud Security.  Result achieved: more than 20 different private  stakeholders contribute to ENISA’s work on incident  reporting for cloud computing. They are active  members of our expert group.  Impact indicator 3: 10 NRAs and/or Member State  competent authorities and 10 Internet Service Providers  (ISPs) should take part in the consultation process about  both Article 13a and Article 4.  Result achieved: more than 20 NRAs and more than 15  ISPs took part in ENISA’s work on Article 13a and Article  4 harmonisation. The dialogue has identified a number  of important issues. ENISA is now working with both  constituencies to address them.

Result achieved: more than 20 different  private stakeholders contribute to  ENISA’s work on governmental  clouds. It presents information from  a total of 23 European countries  (20 EU countries). The result is a  set of recommendations on how  to securely deploy cloud services in  the public sector. The stakeholders are  active members of our expert group.  Impact indicator 2: seven Member State  NRAs and 10 Smart Grid providers should take part in  the development of the Smart Grid community.  Result achieved: more than five NRAs and 30 different  private stakeholders contribute to ENISA’s work on  minimum security measures for Smart Grids. The  European Commission has recognised that smart  grids – the blending of the energy (power) and  telecommunication critical infrastructures – should  operate securely and respect end-users’ privacy.  In order for European smart grid service providers  to improve the security and the resilience of their  infrastructures and services, they first have to assess  risks and then take appropriate measures to mitigate  these risks. In this light, EG25 has decided to organise  consultations with industry and national cyber security  authorities regarding minimum security requirements.  Impact indicator 3: 10 NRAs and 10 ISPs and Internet  Exchange Points (IXPs) should take part in the study on  priority data communications.  Result achieved: more than 20 NRAs and 15 different  private stakeholders (IXP providers, ISPs, Telcos,  etc.) have contributed to ENISA’s work on internet  interconnection.  5 Expert Group 2 formed by European Commission’s Smart Grid Task  Force and it aims at making regulatory recommendations for data  safety, data handling and data protection.

Based on this  work, in 2013 the Data Protection Authorities of Greece  and Germany, in collaboration with ENISA, developed  an updated methodology for data breach severity  assessment. The methodology can be used both by  Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) as well as by data  controllers. A working document is a first result of the  co-operation between experts of the DPAs and ENISA.  The methodology will ultimately be developed into a  practical tool for data breach severity assessment.  Studies and reports:  Recommendations for a methodology of the  assessment of severity of personal data breaches  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and- trust/library/deliverables/dbn-severity  2.1.2.5.2 Brokerage model of NIS in Education  With publication of the Brokerage model for Network  & Information Security (NIS) in education report, ENISA  aimed to provide content and promote digital education  on network and information security at all levels. The  target group is composed of educators such as trainers,  teachers and peers involved in formal education and  non-formal education, including lifelong learning.  ENISA tries to connect the stakeholders in the best way  possible by presenting different countries’ perspectives  via three case studies: the Czech Safer Internet Centre  (NCBI)’s Strategy of community education in project  — Prague safe online, the German Federal Office for  Information Security (BSI)’s 10th anniversary of the  Safer Internet Day provides an opportunity to increase  awareness, and Norwegian partners’ Norwegian Centre  for Information Security.

In this light ENISA has been  supporting the Certification Special Interest Group (SIG)  and in detail: ENISA published a paper summarising  all activities of the SIG since its establishment, putting  forward all the reasoning in favour of a common  certification scheme for Europe.  In parallel ENISA has  been asked to support other activities of the strategy  (e.g., the ETSI Standardization working group, the SLA  SIG).

ENISA identified several  key activities that can contribute to this goal. They  include facilitating the integration of cyber and physical  response processes with a greater understanding of  where digital evidence may be found and what would  be the appropriate actions to preserve it; designing  and configuring systems in a way that enables  digital evidence retention; and complementing the  existing skills base with ex post analysis expertise and  understanding overlaps between cyber and physical  critical incident response teams.

It does so not from the viewpoint of  service providers, but from the viewpoint of the users of  the internet services. The results of this work stream will  be provided to network and internet security managers,  as well as other communities that are responsible for  implementing or validating security mechanisms.  Results take the point of view of the “implementer”. The  beneficiaries of these activities are Information Security  Officers in organisations, i.e. the “internal” security  service providers.  2.1.3.1 General Objective Work Package 3.1:  Application of good practice for CERTs  Impact Indicator 1: ENISA should improve the level  of communication, response (appropriate to the  threat level) and information exchange between  European national/governmental (n/g) Computer  Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) and other bodies  (governmental organisations, industry and academia).  Its recommendations should be adopted by a minimum  of four Member States in 2014 (Source: Work Programme  2013).  Result achieved: improved levels of communication,  response and information exchange were already  adopted by 19 Member States during the two ENISA  CERT Workshops in 2013.  Impact Indicator 2: ENISA should provide training to  improve the operational practices of CERTs (on-going  support with best practice development) to a minimum  of 20 participants from different organisations (Source:  Work Programme 2013).  Result achieved: ENISA CERT training was rolled out on  request and on the Agency’s initiative at more than 10  events, each attended by more than 20 participants, for  a total participation of 200 people.  Impact Indicator 3: the improved collaboration  capabilities of n/g CERTs (continuation of 2012 work)  should be adopted by a minimum of four Member  States in 2014 (Source: Work Programme 2013).  Result achieved: already adopted by 19 Member States  during the two ENISA CERT Workshops in 2013.  20  POLICY ACHIE VEMENTS  Studies and reports:  D1 Secure communication’s  platform for European n/g CERTs  (Requirements & stocktaking)  Detect, SHARE, Protect - Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange  among CERTs https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/data-sharing/ detect-share-protect-solutions-for-improving-threat-data-exchange- among-certs  D2 EISAS – deployment in Europe (a  feasibility study)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/other-work/eisas_folder/ eisas-deployment-feasibility-study  D3 Good practice guide on Alerts,  Warnings and Announcements  (including an inventory  of Incident Response  Methodologies)  Best practice guide on Alerts, Warnings & Announcements https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/awa  D4 CERT Inventory; an extended  overview (inventory and  interactive map)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/background/inv  D1 (Detect, SHARE, Protect): the focus of the report  is on the threat and incident information exchange  and sharing practices used among CERTs. It examines  existing communication solutions and practices  among European CERTs, identifying the functional  and technical gaps that limit the exchange of threat  intelligence between n/g CERTs and their counterparts  in Europe, as well as other CERTs within their respective  countries. The report also defines basic requirements  for improved communications that are interoperable  with existing solutions.  D2 (EISAS): the final report that concludes ENISA’s  activities in the area of European Information Sharing  and Alerting System (EISAS).  D3 (Alerts, Warnings, Announcements): the guide  describes good practices and provides practical  information and guidelines on the process of preparing  and issuing alerts, warnings and announcements to a  CERT’s constituencies (customers). Informing CERTs and  their constituencies about threats and ways to contain  threats typically involves the use of a reliable set of  indicators and a well-structured process for assessing  and processing the incoming information. This enables  the CERT to get the right information to the right places  in a timely fashion.  D4 (CERT Inventory): the inventory aims to provide  an overview of the actual situation concerning CERTs  in Europe. It provides a list and an interactive map of  CERT teams and similar facilities by country, and also  contains a catalogue of co-operation, support and  standardisation activities related to them.  Example of value added:  In 2013, ENISA extended its good practice material  for CERTs with a special emphasis on obstacles to  information sharing. Currently, CERTs face not so much  a lack of information (about incidents, vulnerabilities,  threats, etc.) as difficulty in extracting useful, actionable  pieces of information out of the abundance of available  information (Netflow data, logfiles, etc.). At the end  of 2013 (and continuing in 2014), ENISA actively  participated in a project, led by governmental CERTs  from Austria, Portugal and Belgium, designed to tackle  this problem. A tool, “Abusehelper”, was developed  to help CERTs to extract actionable information from  their data sources. The tool will be made available to all  CERTs.  2.1.3.2 General Objective Work Package 3.2: Enabling  collaborative communities  Impact Indicator 1: improved operational capabilities  of n/g CERTs (continuation of 2012 work) should be  adopted by a minimum of four Member States in 2014.  Result achieved: improved operational capabilities  already adopted by 19 Member States during the two  ENISA CERT Workshops in 2013.  21  POLICY ACHIE VEMENTS  Impact Indicator 2: ENISA will identify at least  20 key actors who can act as intermediaries in the  dissemination of the outcomes of the work package.  Together they should cover at least 12 Member States  by the end of 2013.  Result achieved: 19 national/governmental CERTs in  the EU acted as multipliers or intermediaries for the  dissemination of work page results, including two  n/g CERTS from EEA countries. The Forum of Incident  Response and Security Teams (FIRST) and the Task  Force for Computer Security and Incident Response  Teams (TF-CSIRT) acted as additional multipliers, with  24 key actors disseminating results to at least 500 CERTs  worldwide (members of FIRST, members of TF-CSIRT,  teams on the national level, and teams in the start-up  phase not yet registered anywhere).  Impact Indicator 3: pan-European cooperation shall  be improved between CERTs and Law Enforcement  Agencies (LEA) in the area of fighting cybercrime, with  the commitment of a minimum of four Member States  in 2013.  Result achieved: cooperation agreed upon by 19  Member States during the two ENISA CERT Workshops  in 2013. The workshop series will be continued in 2014.

Firstly, it aims to provide an analysis of the legal  framework created by the Directive, coupled with a  stock taking of existing national activities and good  practices which may be relevant. Secondly, it aims to  identify key areas and, when appropriate, guidelines  and recommendations for CERTs derived from good  practices. The document provides background  information mainly for members of CERTs in the EU  Member States. It explains the potential outcomes and  implications raised by the new Directive. While it stops  short of giving direct guidance for the implementation  process, it will hopefully enable key players to take  sound decisions.  D2 (Workshop report): the document is a brief  ENISA report on the annual workshop for Computer  Emergency Response Teams in Europe: CERTs in Europe.  The first part of the workshop focused on hands-on  technical training for n/g CERTs in Europe. The second  part of the workshop, the ENISA/EC3 workshop, was a  follow up event to last year’s workshop with Europol. It  had the same focus on enhancing cooperation between  n/g CERTs in Europe and their national law enforcement  counterparts.  D3: (CERT exercise material): ENISA CERT exercises and  training material were introduced in 2008, and in 2012  and 2013 these were complemented with new exercise  scenarios containing essential material for success in  the CERT community and in the field of information  security. The ENISA CERT training material contains  a handbook for teachers, a toolset for students and  virtual images to facilitate hands on training sessions.  6 European Commission. 2010. Proposal for a Directive of the European  Parliament and of the Council on attacks against information  systems and repealing Council Framework Decision 2005/222/JHA.  COM(2010) 517: http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/policies/ crime/1_en_act_part1_v101.pdf [Last accessed 0ctober 14, 2013]  D4: (Harmonisation and ICS CERT capabilities):  the “harmonisation” document provides an overview  of existing mechanisms that help CERTs to deploy  capabilities necessary for their operations and  appropriate to their level of maturity. It introduces each  mechanism according to the CERT maturity level that  it addresses, based on eight predefined criteria. The  criteria include mandatory requirements for CERTs, their  focus, the type of CERT or its region of operation, and  the definitions and terminology used.  The Industrial Control System Computer Emergency  Response Capabilities (ICS-CERC) guide builds upon  the current practice of CERTs responsible for industrial  control system (ICS) networks, as well as on earlier work  by ENISA regarding baseline capabilities for n/g CERTs.  The document is an initial attempt to provide a good  practice guide for the entities that have been tasked  to provide ICS-CERC. The guide does not, however,  attempt to prescribe to the EU Member States which  entities should be entrusted with provision of ICS-CERC  services.  D5 (CERT training support): ENISA continues to  support the successful TRANSITs7 training programme  for CERT staff members, which usually takes place twice  a year in Europe. TRANSITs training programmes for  CERTs evolved out of a European Commission funded  project (IST-2001-39118, 1 July 2002-30 September 2005)  to promote the establishment of CERTs by addressing  the shortage of skilled staff. To complement this effort,  in 2013 ENISA started to provide in-house technical  training for CERTs and other operational communities  (i.e. ICS administrators) based on requests from EU  Member States. Tailored training programmes are based  on ENISA exercises and training materials that have  been developed by ENISA since 2008. ENISA’s training  portfolio complements our effort to strengthen CERT  capabilities and to foster cooperation amongst teams  throughout Europe.  7 http://www.terena.org/activities/transits/transits-i/  23  POLICY ACHIE VEMENTS  Example of value added:  In 2008, ENISA decided to develop CERT training  programmes as a more direct way of disseminating its  CERT good practice material. Since then the number  of available training scenarios has reached 23, and  the programmes are highly regarded. In 2013, we  received several requests from Member States for  specialised training for their CERT teams, and this trend  has continued in 2014. This is a strong contribution  to the state of NIS in Europe that builds upon our  work in defining baseline capabilities for national  and governmental CERTs. The quality of our training  programmes is high: participants typically give our  programmes ratings of 4.5 out of 5 points. The real  impact of the training, however, must be evaluated over  the long-term.  2.1.3.3 General Objective Work Package 3.3: Enabling  the information society  Impact indicator 1: ENISA should survey security  certification practice in at least five Member States to  identify best practices that could be applied for privacy  certification/trustmarks (Source: Work Programme  2013).  Result achieved: the survey was conducted among 11  Member States, covering over 50% of the EU population.  ENISA has supported EU activities in the implementation  of trustmarks by identifying best practice from  security certification that can be deployed for privacy  certification and trustmarks. Input was provided for  the adoption of a framework on privacy certification,  as well as for eGovernment certification in Europe. The  conditions under which online security and privacy  seals (OSPS) can be deployed to support users in  making informed decisions about Web services and  their providers with respect to the security and privacy  provided were also analysed.  Studies and reports:  Security certification practice in the EU - Information  Security Management Systems: A case study  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity- and-trust/library/deliverables/security-certification- practice-in-the-eu-information-security-management- systems-a-case-study  On the security, privacy and usability of online seals  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and- trust/library/deliverables/on-the-security-privacy-and- usability-of-online-seals/  Impact Indicator 2: ENISA should provide  recommendations on best practice regarding the  security of personal data and the use of cryptographic  techniques for eGov services in Europe, based on  inputs from at least five Member States (Source: Work  Programme 2013).  Result achieved: input was gathered from five Member  States, the US and other international stakeholders, and  information was also provided by other Member States.  ENISA studied cryptographic techniques used in Europe,  focusing on areas where data security is needed to  protect the personal data of the citizens or on the new  techniques required by new applications. The study  addressed measures applied to safeguard sensitive  and/or personal data, and discussed how information  technology users with a basic knowledge of information  security can employ cryptographic techniques to  protect their personal data. It also addressed the need  for a minimum level of cryptographic functionality  across EU Member States, as part of their efforts to  protect personal and/or sensitive data.

The  study was written by five experts from different sectors  and involved 57 organisations from within the EU.  Nearly 80 stakeholders from various sectors validated  the studies at the Trust Service Provider workshop in  September 2013.  In 2013, ENISA developed guidelines for trust services  providers, identifying the minimal security levels to be  maintained by them. The study is divided into several  sections. One section describes the framework for trust  service providers (TPSs), drawing upon EU and other  standards when relevant. A second section discusses  the principles and concepts for defining and controlling  the threats and vulnerabilities faced by TSPs. A final  section recommends technical and organisational  measures for mitigating the impact of security incidents  on TSPs.

The legislation provides access to  communication data for law enforcement purposes.  However, the Data Retention Directive (DRD) requires  that personal data collected, stored or in any way  processed in most EU Member States be securely  protected. In 2013, ENISA conducted a survey on the  national implementation of the DRD in six selected  Member States. The survey focused on technical  and organisational security requirements and the  implementation of the data security principles that are  provided for in the Directive. It also provided a state-of- the-art analysis of the security measures proposed for  the protection of personal data.

According to the financial regulation (art 30), the  principle of economy requires that the resources used  by the institution in the pursuit of its activities shall be  made available in due time, in the appropriate quantity  and quality and at the best price. The principle of  efficiency entails finding the optimal balance between  the resources employed and the results achieved.  These principles are upheld through the implementation  of internal procedures and predefined practices. These  procedures ensure that activities are executed in an  efficient manner (e.g. different workflows contribute to  efficient cooperation between staff, units, departments  etc.) and according to the principle of economy (e.g.  procurement rules ensure procurement on optimal terms).  The Agency continuously fine-tunes its internal  arrangements in order to improve the efficiency and  economy of its operations. The following two initiatives  are examples that show how these principles are  implemented at ENISA.  2.2.1 Example 1  To operate efficiently at two different locations,  electronic workflows had to be designed and  implemented. These workflows are more economical  than sending large packages by post and more  efficient because delays have been eliminated. The  idea is to establish a fully digital organisation with lean  procedures and optimal functionality.  2.2.2 Example 2  To operate efficiently at two different locations, IT tools  such as videoconferencing were implemented. These  types of tools are more economical than spending  budget on travel and more efficient because issues  can be resolved more quickly. This applies to several  different core processes (management team meetings,  tender procedures, etc.).  Other IT tools such as the Agency’s intranet enable  different actors to work simultaneously on the same  document while storing all versions in a single location.  2.3 CORPORATE  COMMUNICATIONS  2.3.1 Corporate Communications, media,  outreach and impact  ENISA’s impact, outreach and media programme gives  the Agency the opportunity to reach many more of  its stakeholders than it can through direct means.  Corporate communication activities in 2013 focused  on five areas:  1. Expanding and increasing media impact and  coverage across Europe  2. Strengthening stakeholder relations 3. Strengthening digital communications 4. Ensuring coherence and consistency, i.e.  communication planning 5. Strengthening the ENISA brand  Thus, in 2013, the Agency’s corporate communications  section continued to focus on communicating the  Agency’s results in its studies and reports, its core  operations results. At the same time, in 2013, ENISA was  reorganised so that the Public Affairs Unit (PAU) become  a Corporate Communications team. The objective was  to streamline activities and adapt to a new context,  in view of other organisational developments, most  notably the transfer of some Agency staff to Athens.  Major achievements included the transition to and  implementation of the new ENISA logo and new Agency  name, in line with the new Regulation governing the  Agency. In addition, the Agency web site and social  media activities were further developed as the Agency’s  main communications channels. This year we also  cooperated more closely with local and national media  across Europe, resulting in TV coverage, editorials in the  press and articles published in numerous media outlets.  Corporate communications in particular gained Europe  wide coverage for the ENISA Threat Landscape report,  and the art13a annual incidents in the telecoms sector  report.  As the focal point for Europe’s cyber security  information, corporate communications focus on  communicating the results of ENISA’s operational  work. The communication objective is to reach diverse  stakeholders and audiences, using the appropriate  channels and with consistent messages that are  tailored to each target audience. This approach is a key  element of ENISA’s mission to support a cyber-security  culture, in order to promote a dynamic digital society  and, ultimately, for the economy of Europe. ENISA’s  26  POLICY ACHIE VEMENTS  corporate communication outreach channels include  public relations campaigns, digital communications,  external communications, and media activity and  events across the EU.  ENISA  High Level Event  Expanding and increasing communication and external  relations by working with various audiences was,  therefore, a pivotal point for corporate communications  in 2013. To do so, the Agency co-organised or  participated in joint events with other EU bodies and  other organisations. The most outstanding example  at corporate level was the annual High-Level Event in  Brussels, which was organised in cooperation with an  industry actor the European Security Round Table (ESRT),  and a regional actor, the Hessen Representation. At  this occasion, ENISA brought together representatives  of the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS),  the European Commission and industry. Under the  umbrella of “Securing our cyber-future: risks, threats,  challenges & opportunities for coordinating Europe’s  cyber security”, topics discussed included:  • The new ENISA Regulation (http://eur-lex.europa. eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:165 :0041:0058:EN:PDF) - what it actually means for  improving Europe’s cyber security  • The Cyber Security Strategy and NIS Directive  (http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu- cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and- online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security)  - the practicalities of implementation  • The implications of state surveillance revelations  for IT security - what should be the technical  response and what are the future needs?”  This generated unprecedented interest in the event,  which was therefore a great success for the Agency  stakeholder relations, in providing a platform for our  stakeholders to meet.  Strengthening our external relations through  communication with various audiences was a major  part of the Agency’s corporate communications work  in 2013. To do so, the unit organised or participated in  joint events with other EU bodies, such as the high- level cyber event in Brussels. This ENISA event brought  together representatives of the European Parliament,  the European Commission and industry. The Agency  also engaged in outreach work, particularly with the  local community, such as organising a Europe Day on 9  May, a celebration on Crete to highlight the benefits of  information and communication technology for all of  Europe’s children. The corporate communications team  has also worked to further strengthen ties with Greece’s  government, which hosts the Agency in Heraklion  and Athens. Moreover, in 2013, ENISA engaged in  strengthend relations with the Regional Governor of  Crete and the Heraklion local authorities.  ENISA celebrated Europe Day  27  POLICY ACHIEVEMENTS  Media relations is the superior way to reach all Agency  stakeholders. It articulates our results, and augments  the cyber security debate. ENISA’s impact, outreach and  media programme enables the Agency to reach all its  stakeholders, and influential policy makers, who follow  the media. Through media relations ENISA can reach  many more persons than, for example, at a conference.  Today, in media relations there has been a blending  between traditional, social media and digital relations  with our stakeholders. All these channels are crucial  to reach the media, who can act as multipliers of our  message, as well as contribute to the open debate on  cyber security in a democratic society.  In 2013, the Agency continued its outreach distribution  and media monitoring process to assess the  targeting, impact and reach of its media work. Major  accomplishments include:  • Produced and issued 20 media releases • Posted more than 115 individual news items on  the ENISA web site • All media releases and news items are  simultaneously published in the Agency’s social  media channels and also generated hundreds of  interviews throughout the year. Overall, the media  coverage figures were around 2,500, which was an  increase of about 25% in relation to 2012’s figure.  2.3.2 Multilingual approach  An essential part of ENISA’s work is to make its messages  accessible to stakeholders across Europe and to  overcome the “Tower of Babel”, which is simultaneously  a blessing of cultural diversity, but also a challenge. To  tackle this challenge, the Agency issues media releases  in five EU languages – English, German, French, Spanish  and Greek – to press, radio, television and web-based  news organisations. It also maintains online “landing  pages” in German, French and Greek. ENISA media  releases are distributed via general, financial, EU and  social media outlets, as well as specialised ICT/Network  and Information Security publications and web sites. In  2013, ENISA further developed and enhanced the three  “landing pages” in Greek, German and French. More  mini sites are planned for launch in 2014.  2.3.3 Cross media impact  Media monitoring analysis and in depth-evaluation of  the Agency’s media output shows that overall in 2013  the media work and translations generated more than  2,500 stories in European news media, and that stories  appeared in all 24 EU languages. Statistics continue  to display a clear correlation between peaks in web  visitors, social media and the distribution of media  releases in multiple channels. This demonstrates  the beneficial effect of multiple media channels in  spreading the results of the Agency. Overall, ENISA  reached a combined potential audience of several  million readers, listeners and viewers. Directly, media  releases on the ENISA web site received more than  223,000 unique page views in 2013, a clear increase  over the 171,000 unique page views received in 2012.  Individual news stories on the ENISA website received  more than 84,500 direct hits in 2013.  2.3.4 Additional media & outreach  activities  Other dedicated topical press  conferences and briefings  targeted media in specific  countries or around particular  interest areas in network  information security. As part  of its media activities, the  Agency also commenced the regular update of the  Crisis Communication Strategy. In addition, the agency  maintained and further developed its relations with  other EU agencies, in the official Heads of  Communications and Information Network (HCIN) of  the EU agencies. The HCIN gives EU agencies the  possibility of pooling their knowledge, benchmarking,  learning and sharing best practices. This is a cost- effective way to continuously develop standards and  learn for greater impact.  28  POLICY ACHIE VEMENTS  2.3.5 Digital communications and digital  relations  ENISA’s website continues to be the Agency’s principal  communications channel. In 2013, continuous  development work was carried out to maintain and  further improve the website for its users. The Agency  social media channels – Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter  and YouTube – were expanded to include Slideshare  and Pinterest in order to reach more stakeholders.  Moreover, after analysis, a survey of the literature, and  practical “lessons learned”, we modified our tactics  to increase our social media outreach further. These  steps have enabled ENISA to better reach targeted NIS  communities and the media, to increase our outreach,  and to foster better digital stakeholder relations. This  was a dedicated effort and new initiative in 2013 that  helped us to better connect with new communities and  to develop our ties with existing digital relations with  our stakeholders and supporters.  Website development  Enhancing the website for users and helping visitors to  navigate and find information with greater ease is an  on-going process. To this end, the agency continued  to improve the usability and design of the ENISA  website. Further enhancements and improvements  will be carried out on the website in 2014, including an  improved content structure, and further development  of the German and Greek mini-sites, and a new Spanish  one.  Technical improvements in 2013 included the  development of web tools for the Agency’s website  and portals (used by specialist expert communities) and  the application of all the security patches to the Zope  application and PLONE content management system  used by the ENISA site.  A dedicated portal for the European Cyber Security  Month (ECSM) was also launched during 2013, to better  support the ECSM initiative and its constantly growing  community.  2.3.6 Social Media  ENISA’s social media channels (Facebook, Twitter,  YouTube, LinkedIn) were launched in September  2012. The objective was to connect the Agency with  new communities, deepen its ties with existing ones  and generate traffic to ENISA’s main site for increased  visibility, impact and influence. The channels are  accessible through the Agency’s website (home page)  and links to them were also added to all the Agency’s  communication channels (publications, presentations,  e-mails, brand material, etc.)  During 2013, ENISA’s social media presence was  enhanced with two new channels - Pinterest and  Slideshare – while new tools and methods were  introduced to help ENISA to better distribute its work.  Social media monitoring reports have shown  an increased reach for ENISA’s channels. Main  accomplishments include:  • More than 3,250 followers of the ENISA Twitter  channel  • More than 1,260 tweets • 2,400 followers of the ENISA LinkedIn page • More than 600 Facebook fans • 7,700 YouTube video views • Hundreds of thousands of users reached by  messages posted by ENISA  2.3.7 Video  In 2013, the Agency produced videos covering key areas  of agency activity. For 2014, ENISA envisages further  production of shorter video clips to promote the  Agency’s achievements and activities.  29  POLICY ACHIE VEMENTS  2.3.8 Quality, coherence and consistency  In 2013, the corporate communications team ensured  that ENISA’s corporate communications activity was  fully aligned with ENISA’s operational and policy  development goals. Amongst other actions, this  entailed maintaining and developing close links with the  Management Board, the PSG, the European Parliament,  the European Commission, the Council and Member  States. All communications activity falls within the  scope of five planned corporate communications areas  of activity. This ensures that information forms part of a  coherent and consistent narrative on the Agency’s work.  In addition, the continuing provision of high quality  editorial, graphic design and printing services through  contracts managed by corporate communications, has  helped to ensure quality, coherence and consistency in  ENISA’s communications.  2.3.9 Brand and trust  Given the inherent nature of ENISA’s mission, branding  is an important aspect of Corporate Communication’s  work. A strong ENISA brand increases trust. Trust  helps the Agency to achieve consistent and coherent  results in all its communications, and is a precondition  for its stakeholder relations. The ENISA brand was  strengthened in 2013 through several means:  • Visual identity: the ENISA brand’s visual identity  was updated and implemented to reflect the new  Agency name and logo.  • Events: to increase awareness and recognition of  the ENISA brand, events were conducted across  Europe.  • Promotional material: promotional material  was produced for particular corporate and expert  occasions and distributed at the High Level event  and to visitors to ENISA’s offices.  An effective brand strategy is key to connecting  effectively with our audiences and stakeholders.  Therefore, continuously updating the look and feel of  ENISA material is paramount in the way the Agency  communicates and to how it is perceived.  2.3.10 Publications  Publications are the ‘face’ of the ENISA brand and an  important communication tool given ENISA’s mission.  Throughout 2013, the Agency published around 30  publications as work programme deliverables. In  addition, ENISA went beyond by producing additional  reports, papers and studies. Along with the writing  and design of the Agency’s General Report, in 2013, the  Corporate Communications team produced a special  corporate report for the ENISA high-level event in  Brussels, EU Cybersecurity cooperation - Defending the  digital frontline (http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/ key-documents/cybersecurity-cooperation-defending- the-digital-frontline). The report presented an updated  and comprehensive overview of Europe’s cyber security  status, and examined areas where further cooperation  can better secure digital economy of Europe.  In 2013, the Corporate Communications team worked  with the Agency’s NIS experts to step up the frequency  of the Agency’s Flash Notes – short expert reports  published to provide an analysis or comment on a  current cyber security topic not foreseen in the Work  Programme. Notes included the topics of “Cyber- attacks – a new edge for old weapons”, “Urgent action  is needed to combat emerging cyber-attack trends”, the  Flash Note Can Recent Attacks Really Threaten Internet  Availability? (http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ f lash-notes/f lash-note-can-recent-attacks-really- threaten-internet-availability) and “Internet Service  Providers fail to apply filters against big cyber attacks”.  Theses Flash Notes were extremely well received  because of their timeliness. Thus, the Agency will  continue this practice in 2014.  2.3.11  Conferences and events  Throughout the year, ENISA organised several  conferences and events. In addition, the Agency  took part in numerous external events and high-level  European conferences. In addition to these activities,  the Corporate Communications team provided support  to the Executive Director for his participation in events  across Europe.  30  POLICY ACHIE VEMENTS  MANAGEMENT  OF RESOURCES  2.3.12 ENISA Stakeholder relations,  media and corporate  communications  ENISA’s stakeholder relations are a key factor in the  success of its overall mission of contributing to the  security of the EU internal market. The Management  Board (composed of the Commission, Member State  and private sector representatives) and Permanent  Stakeholders Group (composed of multiple  stakeholders), as well as the Agency’s informal  networks and expert working parties, give ENISA  unparalleled insights and access to public and private  sector Network and Information Security (NIS) experts.  This expertise and “checking point” also gives ENISA  the opportunity to better and more rapidly identify  emerging risks and gain new insights. This helps the  Member States and private sector organisations to  better prepare themselves for challenges in a proactive  and professional manner, as well as to build novel public  and private sector partnerships. Excellent relations  with our stakeholders is also the flip side of the coin in  relation to media, outreach and impact; good quality  in our stakeholder relations depends on a genuine  two way dialogue, attentiveness to and interest in our  stakeholders’ needs and priorities.  2.4 IT AND FACILITIES  MANAGEMENT  New Branch Office in Athens  In March 2013, ENISA opened its new branch office in  Athens. The new office was made operational in about  five weeks using limited resources while waiting for  additional budget approval. The move of all operational  staff from Heraklion to Athens was completed without  any interruption in functioning or any impact on  productivity. In the meantime, planning went ahead  regarding the refurbishment and furnishing of the  office, including IT and facilities equipment and services.  A restricted call for tenders was launched in late 2013 for  refurbishment work.  IP Telephony and Unified Communications  In early 2013, ENISA’s telephony was integrated into the  Lync system, which was already used for collaboration  and online meetings. Thanks to this development,  calling costs have decreased while additional  functionality and flexibility have become available.  For example, staff can make business calls from their  desktop, even while travelling, as long as they have an  Internet connection.  Align IT organisational structure and processes to  ITIL standards  Changes to the structure of the IT budget were  introduced in 2013 to better align it with IT service  lifecycle stages. This approach will be finalised in 2014  and should provide better visibility on the maturity  level of our IT organisation by comparing the time  spent by the IT staff for development, evolution and  business alignment versus the time spent for operating,  supporting and recovering from failures.  Cyber Exercise Platform (CEP)  In 2013, IT contributed to ENISA’s European Cyber  Exercise. IT designed and delivered a complete  infrastructure to run the Cyber Exercise campaigns.  The pilot exercises were successfully conducted on this  infrastructure. IT supports and continues to enhance  this important platform in order to host future exercises.  In 2014, about 500 users are expected to connect and  use the platform during exercise sessions.  ENISA Management Board Meeting in Vilnius  MANAGEMENT  OF RESOURCES  3  32  MANAGEMENT OF RESOURCES  Assurance entails assessing the effectiveness of risk  management, control and governance processes.  This assessment is carried out by management, which  monitors the functioning of internal control systems  on a continuous basis, and by internal and external  auditors. Results of the examination are documented  and reported to the Executive Director. The reports  produced are:  • Budget Execution Reports • Observations and recommendations made by the  Internal Audit Service (IAS) of the Commission • Observations and recommendations made by the  European Court of Auditors (ECA)  This section reports the control results and other  relevant information that supports management’s  assessment regarding the achievement of internal  control objectives.8 It is structured in three separate  sections: (1) the Agency’s assessment of its own activities  for the management of its resources; (2) the assessment  of activities carried out by other entities to which the  Agency has entrusted tasks; and (3) the assessment of  the results of internal and external audits, including the  implementation of audit recommendations.  The entire budget of the Agency is fully implemented  under direct management.  8 Effectiveness, efficiency and economy of operations; reliability of  reporting; safeguarding of assets and information; prevention,  detection, correction and follow-up of fraud and irregularities;  and adequate management of the risks relating to the legality and  regularity of the underlying transactions, taking into account the  multiannual character of programmes as well as the nature of the  payments (FR Art 32).  33  MANAGEMENT OF RESOURCES  3.1 MANAGEMENT OF  HUMAN AND FINANCIAL  RESOURCES BY ENISA  3.1.1 Control effectiveness as regards  legality and regularity  The Agency has set up internal control processes to  ensure the management of risks related to the legality  and regularity of underlying transactions. These control  processes take into account the multi-annual character  of programmes as well as the nature of the payments  concerned. In order to achieve the best control possible,  the Agency has focused exclusively on the verification  of results before transactions are initiated (“ex-ante  verification”).  The European Court of Auditors (ECA) is responsible  for implementing a second layer of controls. The ECA  audits a sampling of all the transactions that have been  conducted (“ex-post audit”). They then issue a report  with their findings. For several consecutive years, the  ECA has not found any issues that required it to issue  findings on the Agency’s transactions. This suggests  that ENISA’s 100% ex-ante verification strategy is very  effective. Nevertheless, as soon as the Agency has more  human resources available, bi-annual ex-post controls  exercises will be instituted in order to strengthen  controls regarding legality and regularity.  3.1.2 Fraud prevention and detection  The Agency is developing its anti-fraud strategy  as foreseen in the Commission’s overall anti-fraud  strategy9. The strategy will be implemented before the  end of 2014.  9 COM(2011) 376 24.06.2011.  3.2 ASSESSMENT OF  AUDIT RESULTS AND  FOLLOW UP OF AUDIT  RECOMMENDATIONS  3.2.1 Internal Audit Service (IAS)  In 2013, the Internal Audit Service (IAS) visited ENISA.  The IAS carried out an audit on project management  in ENISA’s operations. At the end of the IAS visit, five  recommendations were issued. The Agency took  prompt action on these five recommendations. In fact,  as of the first quarter of 2014, the IAS had already advised  closure of four of the recommendations, while the last  recommendation only requires further validation at the  Agency’s premises.  The Internal Control Coordinator role (ICC) was fully  deployed by September 2013. Due to a lack of staff,  the Agency uses resources shared across the Agency  to ensure that all procedures are addressed. The  implementation and subsequent closure of open  recommendations was the first priority for the ICC, and  the Agency was able to close several recommendations.  Some of the recommendations require validation at  ENISA. The Agency and the IAS agreed that all of these  recommendations were properly addressed and that  they will be verified during the third quarter of 2014.  A schedule was agreed upon to assure that all  recommendations are closed by the third quarter of  2014.  3.2.2 European Court of Auditors (ECA)  The European Court of Auditors (ECA) issued two  important recommendations regarding ENISA in 2012.  One recommendation concerned the need to improve  the transparency of recruitment at ENISA’s new office in  Athens, while the other concerned the need to improve  the management of fixed assets. After the first visit by  the ECA in March 2013, the Agency took all necessary  measures to assure completely transparent recruitment  procedures, and the recommendation concerning the  transparency of recruitment was closed by the ECA.  34  MANAGEMENT OF RESOURCES  The last recommendation concerning the management  of fixed assets will be evaluated during the ECA’s visit  in April 2014. A full physical inventory was conducted,  in line with the rules in practice, across both Agency  premises in Heraklion and Athens. The retirement  exercise, which included the reconciliation of fixed  assets with the accounts, was successfully realised.  The ECA’s visit of April 2014 will include the audit of the  2013 accounts. The ECA is expected to issue its final  report in the third quarter of 2014. The Agency expects  that the Court’s opinion on the true and fair presentation  of the accounts as well as on the legality and regularity  of the transactions underlying the accounts will be  unqualified as it has been for the last seven years.  ASSESSMENT OF  THE EFFECTIVENESS  OF THE INTERNAL  CONTROL SYSTEMS  4  36  ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS  ENISA has adopted a set of internal control standards,  based on international good practice, that aim to ensure  the achievement of policy and operational objectives.  As regards financial management, compliance with  these standards is compulsory.  The Agency has also put in place the organisational  structure and the internal control systems suited to  the achievement of policy and control objectives, in  accordance with the standards and having due regard  to the risks associated with the environment in which  it operates.  In 2010, the Management Board of the Agency adopted  a set of 16 internal control standards laying down the  minimum requirements with which its internal control  systems need to comply. Previously developed internal  procedures were grouped together, prioritised and  implemented in the daily workflows of the Agency, as  deemed appropriate.  In 2013, the Agency focused on compliance with the  standards that were identified as areas of concern  during the risk assessment exercise, as well as on the  recommendations raised by the auditing bodies (ECA  and IAS). During 2013, the Agency achieved compliance  with the internal control standards listed below.  Mission (ICS 1)  The Agency’s mission and scope is described in the  ENISA Regulation. Mission statements for departments  and units were established based on the evolution of  the organisation in 2013. The roles and tasks of each  department and unit are clearly defined.  Ethical and organisational values (ICS 2)  The Agency has procedures in place – including  updates and yearly reminders – to ensure that all staff is  aware of relevant ethical and organisational values (e.g.  ethical conduct, avoidance of conflicts of interest, fraud  prevention, reporting of irregularities). Specific training  is organised by the Agency for its staff every year in  order to reinforce professional behaviour, compliance  with the expected behaviour, ethics and integrity, and  in order to prevent workplace harassment.  Staff Allocation and Mobility (ICS 3)  Whenever necessary – at least once per year –  management aligns organisational structures and staff  allocations with priorities and workload.  Staff evaluation and development (ICS 4)  In the context of the Career Development Report (CDR)  process, discussions are held individually with all staff  to establish their annual objectives. Staff performance  is evaluated according to standards set by the Agency.  An annual training plan is developed at Agency level  based on needs deriving from the policy of the Agency.  As part of the Career Development Plan (CDP) process,  every year each staff member completes an individual  training plan.  Management ensures that at a minimum every staff  member attends the compulsory training courses  defined in the annual training plan.  37  ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS  Objectives and Performance Indicators (ICS 5)  Work Programme and budget preparation procedures  were developed in 2009 and will be revised in 2014.  The Annual Work Programme (WP) of the Agency is  developed by the Agency services, with continuous  input and guidance from its two governing bodies, the  Management Board and the Permanent Stakeholders  Group. The WP clearly sets out how the planned  activities at each management level contribute to  the achievement of objectives, taking into account  the resources allocated and the risks identified. The  WP objectives are established on SMART (Specific,  Measureable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)  criteria and updated or changed during the year in  order to address significant changes in priorities and  activities.  The Agency has based the measurement of its  performance on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  that are applied to all areas of activity. KPIs are  more qualitative for the Agency’s operational goals,  whereas they are more quantitative for the Agency’s  administrative goals. The effectiveness of key controls is  assessed using relevant KPIs, including self-assessments  that have been carried out in the form of progress  reports and follow up actions that seek to re-align  divergences from the Work Programme.  The Agency’s Work Programmes are annual. The MB  and the PSG give orientation and input on a regular  basis throughout the WP development process as well  as during the year of implementation.  ENISA installed the project management tool MATRIX,  which has streamlined and consolidated the planning,  monitoring and reporting functions in a uniform and  comprehensive way.  Finally, the Agency managed to rectify the budget  under-spending highlighted by the IAS in 2009,  by optimising budget execution in four following  consecutive years. The commitment rate of budget  appropriations available for the year 2013 (C1) reached  99.99%, another consecutive year in which the total  Agency budget was consumed.  Risk management process (ICS 6)  The IAS performed a risk assessment of the Agency in  2012.  Risks identified as very important during the previous  audits were addressed by the Agency and actions were  planned and communicated to the IAS accordingly. In  2013, effort and resources were devoted to addressing  and mitigating the risks that had been identified. This  satisfactorily addressed the recommendations of both  the ECA and IAS, as noted in their annual reports.  Operational structure (ICS 7)  Delegation of authority is clearly defined, assigned and  communicated by means of the Executive Director’s  Decisions (EDD). It conforms to regulatory requirements  and is appropriate to the level of importance of the  decisions to be taken as well as the risks involved. All  delegated, authorising officers have received and  acknowledged the Charter of the role and responsibility  of the Authorising Officer (by Delegation) as well as the  individual delegation EDD.  The Agency’s sensitive functions are clearly defined,  recorded and kept up to date.  The Agency records derogations granted to allow staff  to remain in sensitive functions beyond five years along  with documentation of the risk analysis and the controls  for mitigation.  As regards sensitive functions, due care has been taken  in order to avoid potential conflict of interest situations.  However, due to the small size of the Agency, the  mobility of staff in sensitive functions is very limited  and takes into account service needs and available  resources. Proper back-ups are designated in order to  ensure business continuity.  38  ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS  Processes and Procedures (ICS 8)  Several policies were developed to strength the  Processes and Procedures Internal Control Standard.  The Agency created a policy on financial circuits.  The roles and responsibilities of financial actors are  described in this policy as well as existing workflows.  A Code of Professional Conduct for ex-ante financial  verification was developed. This document emphasises  the role and responsibilities of the Financial Verifying  Agent.  The Executive Director’s decision on the Register of  Exceptions Procedure was updated.  As the Agency lacks the resources to execute ex-post  control, a strategy of 100% ex-ante controls was decided  upon and applied.  Management supervision (ICS 9)  Management at all levels supervises the activities for  which they are responsible and tracks the main issues  identified. The Management Team, which comprises  the Executive Director and the heads of departments  and units, meets weekly and sets priorities for the  actions to be taken in order to achieve the short- and  medium-term objectives of the Agency. A list of action  items is compiled. It contains all agreed actions as  allocated to specific departments or units. The list is  published on a dedicated Intranet page and regularly  reviewed by the Management Team. Management  supervision covers both legality and regularity aspects  (i.e. set up and compliance with applicable rules) and  operational performance (i.e. achievement of Annual  WP objectives).  Management also establishes action plans in order to  address accepted ECA and IAS audit recommendations  and monitors the implementation of these action plans  throughout the year.  The implementation of the project management tool  MATRIX, has enhanced the planning, implementation,  monitoring and reporting of operational projects, and  has enabled the establishment of a common project  management framework across different organisational  units of the Agency.  Business continuity (ICS 10)  Adequate measures – including handover files and  deputising arrangements for relevant operational  activities and financial transactions – are in place to  ensure the continuity of all services during “business- as-usual” interruptions (such as sick leave, staff mobility,  migration to new IT systems, incidents, etc.).  An IT Business Continuity Plan (BCP) has been developed  and implemented. An Agency-wide BCP, designed to  cover crisis response and recovery arrangements with  respect to major disruptions, has been developed  and fully implemented. The latter BCP identifies the  functions, services and infrastructure that need to be  restored within certain time limits and the resources  necessary for this purpose.  Electronic and hardcopy versions of both BCPs are  stored in secure and easily accessible locations, which  are known to relevant staff.  39  ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS  Document management (ICS 11)  Document management systems and their related  procedures comply with: 1) relevant compulsory security  measures; 2) provisions on document management; and  3) rules on the protection of personal data. Information  security policy specific to data categorisation and  labelling is in place. As regards the exchange of  information classified at the level RESTREINT UE/EU  RESTRICTED, an administrative arrangement between  the Security Directorate of the European Commission  and the Agency was signed on 27 May 2011.  An internal document management guide sets out  the conditions according to which documents need  to be registered, filed and saved using the Agency’s  registration and filing systems. A special, intranet-based  tool was developed to capture the information needed  to register and retrieve documents. In addition, an  incoming and outgoing mail procedure was developed.  Information and communication (ICS 12)  Internal communication measures and practices are in  place for sharing information and monitoring activities.  These include regular Management Team meetings  during which issues relevant to performance, audit  results and financial information are discussed, and  actions are decided upon and assigned. Regular financial  reporting is available to all staff on ENISA’s intranet. All  engagements in new projects are discussed during  the implementation of the Annual Work Programme  and decisions are documented and communicated.  An External Communication Strategy is in place. ICT  security policies are in place for main systems and  sub-systems, and described in procedures and policies.  Internal communication is also supported through  use of the intranet and through weekly staff meetings  within units.  External communication and dissemination procedures  must be further developed and communicated to staff  accordingly.  Accounting and Financial Reporting (ICS 13)  All finance and accounting procedures are documented  in the Internal Control Manual of the Agency. The  preparation, implementation, monitoring and reporting  on budget implementation is centralised in the Finance,  Accounting and Procurement Section, within the  Administration and Support Department.  The European Commission’s budget and accounting  management system, ABAC, is the main tool used for  financial management. It is compliant with applicable  financial regulatory frameworks. The ABAC Assets  module has been used since 2011 for the management  of ENISA’s inventory.  Financial management information produced by the  Agency, including financial information provided in  the Annual Activity Report, complies with applicable  financial and accounting rules.  Evaluation of activities (ICS 14)  Key performance indicators are used in order to measure  the performance and assess the impact of the Agency’s  projects as provided for in its Annual Work Programmes.  The General Report and the Annual Activity Report are  the tools used by the Agency to report on performance  and impact. The feedback of relevant stakeholders is  taken into account.  Assessment of internal control systems (ICS 15)  Each year, ENISA’s management assesses the compliance  of annual activities and performance with the internal  control systems in place, as part of preparation of the  Annual Activity Report.  40  ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS  Internal Audit Capability (ICS 16)  The Head of the Administration and Support  Department assumes the Internal Control Coordination  (ICC) function. He is responsible for implementing  internal control systems in the Agency and liaising  with the IAS of the European Commission. As the  Agency lacks human resources, the role of Internal  Audit Capability (IAC) cannot be performed. Since 2005,  the Agency has relied on the IAS to carry out internal  audits. The IAS plays a key role in auditing bodies of the  European Union.  Internal Control tasks performed in ENISA include  100% of ex ante verifications, hierarchical controls and  outsourced engagements, coordinated by the ICC.  In line with the Strategic Audit Plan 2013-2015, the  Internal Audit Service (IAS) carried out an audit on  Project Management in Operations at ENISA.  The role of ICC was reinforced in order to comply with all  the recommendations issued by the IAS and ECA.  Concerning the overall state of the internal control  system, generally the Agency complies with the three  assessment criteria for effectiveness: (1) staff that  have the requisite knowledge and skills; (2) systems  and procedures designed and implemented to  manage the key risks effectively; and (3) no instances  of ineffective controls that have exposed the Agency  to substantial risk.  Enhancing the effectiveness of the Agency’s control  arrangements is an on-going effort, as part of the  continuous improvement of management procedures.  It includes taking into account any control weaknesses  reported and exceptions recorded.  MANAGEMENT  ASSURANCE  5  42  MANAGEMENT ASSUR ANCE  5.1 REVIEW OF THE ELEMENTS SUPPORTING ASSURANCE  Assessment by management:  The Agency’s operations are channelled through the  following activity areas that belong to administrative  functions:  • Own resources (staff) that carry out tasks in line  with the annual work programme in terms of  operational and administrative activities.  • Contractors that support operational activities  and other support activities that cannot be  in-sourced by the Agency. External agents  are appointed either through a procurement  procedure or through a call for expressions of  interest for funding related to the co-organisation  of events. Alternatively, in the case of working  group members, they may be chosen by means of  a selection procedure.  The risk framework is used as a common means of  classifying and communicating risk across the agency.  It provides a common understanding and language  regarding “risk”, as well a structure for the assessment,  reporting and monitoring of risk. The risk framework  defines the categories, sub-categories and business  risks applicable at the organisational level, for ENISA as  a whole. It includes:  • Risk categories and sub-categories • Risks specific to each category (business risks) • Risk definitions  43  M ANAGEMENT ASSUR ANCE  To mitigate compliance risks with regard to its administrative activities, the Agency has carried out the activities  presented in the table below:  Systemic process Activity Performance indicator  1 Follow up on auditor’s  comments and  recommendations regarding  ADM practices and procedures  as they are implemented in line  with Financial Regulation (FR),  Implementing Rules (IR) and  Staff Regulations (SR).  Update of documents and  activities reporting.  Feedback by auditors in the next  application period and overall  improvement of performance.  2 Opening and closing of the  annual budget and preparation  of budgetary statements.  Approved budget tree  opened, appropriations  posted properly.  Annual budget lines open and running by  the end of the year with the anticipated  budget, economic outturn account and  supporting operations completed in time.  3 Implementation and  consolidation of internal  controls, as appropriate.  Annual review of internal  controls.  Guidelines and checklists reviewed, annual  risk assessment done.  Controls updated  accordingly. Staff participation and  information.  4 Performance evaluation Organise annual  performance evaluation.  Administer appeals  Number of evaluations carried out.  5 Annual training programme Draft the generic training  plan of the Agency.  Document presentation and  implementation of programme.  6 Recruitment plan Execute the Agency  recruitment plan in line  with the Establishment  Plan.  Number of staff hired to cover new posts or  make up for resignations.  7 Internal ICT networks and  systems  Secure ICT networks and  systems in place.  Results of external security assessment/ audit.  8 Public procurement Regular, consistent  observation of public  procurement practices  and appropriate  assistance provided to all  departments.  Clear mandate of the procurement  function established, staff informed,  forms available, number and type of  procurement processes handled, files of  procurement processes organized, files for  audit available. List of number of purchase  orders per supplier, number of complaints  processed.  9 Contract management General support on  contract management.  Number of contracts prepared and signed  by the Agency, number of requests for  support received from departments,  number of claims processed.  10 Ex-ante controls Well developed at  procedural, operational and  financial level.  Number of transactions as compared to  number of erroneous transactions.  11 Ex-post controls Developed with the  assistance of the  professional service  provider.  Number of transactions as compared to  number of erroneous transactions.  44  MANAGEMENT ASSUR ANCE  Exceptions  In 2013, the Agency faced three main categories of  deviation that led to exceptions reported in the Register  of Exceptions:  • A posteriori commitments • Procedural errors • Missions guideline interpretation  The main reasons associated with the a posteriori  commitments were limitations in planning.  The information reported in Parts 2 and 3 stems from  the results of auditing by management and auditors.  The results are contained in the reports listed. These  reports result from a systematic analysis of the evidence  available. This approach provides sufficient guarantees  as to the completeness and reliability of the information  reported, and results in complete coverage of the  budget delegated to the Executive Director of ENISA.  45  DECL AR ATION OF ASSUR ANCE  DECLARATION OF ASSURANCE  I, the undersigned,  Udo Helmbrecht  Executive Director of the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  In my capacity as authorising officer  Declare that the information contained in this report gives a true and fair view10.  State that I have reasonable assurance that the resources assigned to the activities described in this  report have been used for their intended purpose and in accordance with the principles of sound  financial management, and that the control procedures put in place give the necessary guarantees  concerning the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.  This reasonable assurance is based on my own judgement and on the information at my disposal,  such as the results of the self-assessment, ex-post controls, the work of the internal audit capability,  the observations of the Internal Audit Service and the lessons learnt from the reports of the Court of  Auditors for years prior to the year of this declaration.  Confirm that I am not aware of anything not reported here which could harm the interests of the  institution .  Heraklion, 17/06/2014  [signed]  Udo Helmbrecht  Executive Director  10  True and fair in this context means a reliable, complete and correct view on the state of affairs in the service.  46  47  ANNEXES  48  ANNE XES  ANNEX 1: HUMAN AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES  Code ABB Activity ABB Activity Full Time Equivalents (FTE)  Work Stream 1 Evolving Risk Environment & Opportunities 3.1  Work Stream 2 Improving Pan-European CIIP & Resilience 11.9  Work Stream 3 Enabling Communities to improve NIS 10.0  SR Stakeholder Relations 2.5  PS Project Support Activities 0.6  PAU Public Affairs Activities 3.9  None Management & support activities 8.0  Total 40.0*  * Staff directly involved in the implementation of the Annual Work Programme  Financial resources  In 2013, the Agency allocated its appropriations at a rate of 99.99% (considering the non-automatic carry overs as  committed on 31/12/2013), repeating the performances of 2012, 2011 and 2010. The efficient planning of Work  Programme projects and relevant procurement procedures, allowed the Agency to carry out its operational activities  as specified in the Work Programme 2013 within the year 2013, and to make the investments needed to ensure an  appropriate operating environment, compliance with the regulatory framework and the continued provision of  services by the Agency.  ANNE XES  49  Payments reached the level of 91.6% of the total committed appropriation and 86% of the total appropriations for  2013. In addition, the payment rate of the appropriations carried forward from 2012 reached the level of 92%. These  figures demonstrate the strong effort made to finalise administrative and operational activities and deliverables within  the financial year. Both commitment and payment rates confirm the sustained capacity of the Agency to efficiently  utilise its annual budget, given that the appropriations of the Agency are non-differentiated. An overview of the year’s  performance follows below:  Total EU Subsidy – C1  Budget  Title  Description Budget (‘000 EUR)  Committed (‘000 EUR)  % Paid (‘000 EUR)  %  Title 1 Staff expenditure 5,743 5,743 100% 5,545 97%  Title 2 Administrative expenditure 1,389 884 64% 568 41%  Title 3 Operational expenditure 1,898 1,898 100% 1,695 89%  Total 9,030 8,525 94% 7,807 86%  External Assigned revenue (rent subsidy from Hellenic Republic) – R0  Budget  Title  Description Budget (‘000 EUR)  Committed (‘000 EUR)  % Paid (‘000 EUR)  %  Title 2 Administrative expenditure 640 640 100% 340 53%  Total Budget 640 640 100% 340 53%  Carry forward (N+1) – C8 or C3  Type Budget %  Automatic Carry Forwards to year N+1 (C8) 718 7.95%  Non-automatic Carry Overs to year N+1 – on MB decision1 (C3) 505 5.59%  Adjusted Commitments’ rate2 100%  Adjusted Payments’ rate3 100%  1 This amount corresponds to two calls for tenders launched in 2013 for works necessary for Athens office refurbishment (tentative cost 480,000 EUR)  and for the lease of optical fibre line for Athens office (tentative cost 24,934 EUR); both contracts will be awarded in 2014. The amount was carried  over to 2014 with the approval of the Management Board, and committed in March 2014.  2 The adjusted commitments’ rate corresponds to rate of the sum of actual commitments made plus the non-automatic carry overs over total C1  appropriations (EU subsidy received in 2013). The rent subsidy received by the Hellenic Republic is excluded as it is a separate source of revenue.  3 The adjusted payments’ rate corresponds to rate of the actual payments made over the actual commitments made on C1 appropriations (EU subsidy  received in 2013). It excludes the amount of the non-automatic carry over (504,934 EUR) as it was not available for payment. The rent subsidy  received by the Hellenic Republic is excluded as it is a separate source of revenue.  ANNE XES  50  The initial Budget of ENISA was amended twice in 2013 in order to include:  • The amount of 480,632 EUR requested to the Budgetary Authority for the estimated refurbishment works and  other investments needed for the new Athens office.  • The amount of 640,000 EUR granted as a rent subsidy by the Hellenic Republic by a Greek Law and a subsequent  ministerial decision of the Minister of Infrastructure, Transport and Networks signed in September 2013.  Statistics on ENISA staff As of 31/12/2013, ENISA counts 59 Staff members: 43 TA’s (27 AD’s and 16 AST’s), 13 CA’s and 3 SNE’s.

Supervisory  desk review of  procurement and  financial transactions.  Representative  sample.  Depth: review of  the procedures  implemented  (procurement  and financial  transactions).  Costs: estimation of  cost of staff involved.  Benefits: Amounts  detected associated  with fraud & error. Deterrents  & systematic  weaknesses  corrected.  Effectiveness:  Amounts associated  with errors detected  (related to fraud,  irregularities and  error). In % over total checked. N° system  improvements made.  Efficiency: Costs of  the ex post controls  and supervisory  measures with  respect to the  ‘benefits’. Average cost of an  ex-post control.  Ex-post publication  (possible reaction  from tenderer /  potential tenderer  such as whistle  blowing).  Potentially 100%  Review of ex post  results.  100% at least once a  year. Depth: look for  any systemic problem  in the procurement  procedure and in the  financial transaction  procedure and any  weakness in the  selection process of  the ex post controls.  Review of exceptions  reported.  100% at least once  a year. Depth: look  for any weakness  in the procedures  (procurement  and financial  transactions).  Review of the process  after each procedure.  100%.  Depth: review any  significant problem  that occurred.  ANNE XES  61  ANNEX 4: PERFORMANCE INFORMATION  INCLUDED IN EVALUATIONS As this is a new requirement for ENISA’s Annual Activity Report, the Agency will change its approach. Until 2014, ENISA  approached the topic of “impact assessment” in a more global way, by commissioning an impact assessment of the  Agency as a whole. ENISA is now looking into making the assessment of the direct impact of its products, deliverables  and services an inherent part of its project management. This approach has already been applied in selected projects  in 2014. For example, by issuing evaluation sheets to participants of training programmes or workshops, by issuing  surveys in order to assess the quality of products or by assessing an entire thematic area (impact assessment in the  area of CERT support).

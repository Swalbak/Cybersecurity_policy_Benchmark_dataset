Taking stock of all existing standardization, legislative and policy  initiatives, this report aims to serve as a reference point to promote cybersecurity for smart cars  (connected and automated cars) across Europe and raise awareness on relevant threats and  risks with a focus on “cybersecurity for safety”.  The automotive industry is undergoing a paradigm change towards connected and autonomous  vehicles1. Smart cars already available today provide connected, added-value features in order  to enhance car users’ experience or improve car safety. With this increased connectivity (that  the emergence of 5G is expected to further promote) novel cybersecurity risks and threats arise  and need to be managed.  It is undeniable that there is a rapid pace when it comes to technological advancements in the  area of connected and autonomous cars. With the emergence of semi-autonomous and  autonomous cars, which make use of advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence  techniques, the potential risks and cybersecurity challenges increase. Moreover, Vehicle-to-  Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) interfaces needed for the deployment of  intelligent transport systems and autonomous cars, further exacerbate security risks since they  largely expand the potential attack surface and attack vectors.  With the increasing smart cars connectivity and the emergence of (semi)-autonomous cars,  novel cybersecurity challenges, risks and threats are arising. Attacks targeting smart cars may  lead to vehicle immobilization, road accidents, financial losses, disclosure of sensitive and/or  personal data, and even endanger road users’ safety. Thus, appropriate security measures  need to be implemented to mitigate the potential risks, especially as these attacks threaten the  security, safety and even the privacy of vehicle passengers and all other road users, including  pedestrians.  It is therefore important to analyse the relevant threats and cybersecurity risks pertaining to  smart cars and put forward security measures to address these risks taking into account the  particularities of this highly complex, heterogeneous and volatile environment.  Accordingly, this ENISA study provides the following information:   High level reference model of connected and autonomous vehicles.   Detailed asset and threat taxonomy for the connected and autonomous vehicles  ecosystem.   Concrete and actionable good practices to improve the cybersecurity posture of  connected and autonomous vehicles.   Mapping to existing legislative, standardization and policy initiatives to foster  harmonization.  1 See JRC 2019 Report 111477, Alonso Raposo M., Grosso, M., Després, J., Fernández Macías, E., Galassi, C.,  Krasenbrink, A., Krause, J., Levati, L., Mourtzouchou, A., Saveyn, B., Thiel, C. and Ciuffo, B.

INTRODUCTION  Over the last few years, the automotive industry has undergone a paradigm change towards  increasingly connected and autonomous cars. Smart cars available today are vehicles equipped  with systems providing connected and added-value features in order to enhance car users  experience and/or improve car safety. Within the next few years, smart cars’ connectivity is  expected to expand and smart cars will become connected to other vehicles, pedestrians and  their surrounding infrastructure through information exchanges via Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)  communications2. Semi-autonomous and autonomous cars (i.e. levels 4 and 5 of autonomy as  defined in SAE J30163), which make use of advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial  Intelligence (AI) techniques, are also emerging. Indeed, several smart cars stakeholders  (including car manufacturers, system suppliers, road operators and other providers) are already  carrying out trials of supervised autonomous vehicles, with a driver on board ready to take  control of the car if necessary.  In recent years, there has been a growing interest in autonomous cars both from end users and  manufacturers and deployment of smart cars has a growing rate in the automotive market45.  According to a survey of 5,500 global city dwellers from all around the world6, 58% of global  respondents are willing to take a ride in a driverless vehicle. Acceptance rates are higher in  emerging markets such as China (75%) and India (85%) than in European countries such as  United Kingdom (49%) and Germany (44%).  However, the European economy is expected to  benefit from autonomous vehicles7, as EU gathers 23% of global motor vehicle production.  Moreover, almost 72% of inland freight is transported by road in Europe, and trust in Original  Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) is strong. While optimistic predictions mention that fully  automated vehicles could be widely deployed by 20308, scientific experts are more cautious and  underline that further research is still required to build a fully autonomous vehicle, mostly in the  fields of AI and cybersecurity9.  Cybersecurity is a crucial aspect that will affect the evolution of smart cars. There have already  been several research publications on attacks targeting smart cars. One of the most known  attacks is the spectacular proof-of-concept remote attack10 where the researchers took control  of a vehicle and sent it off-the-road, thus leading to the recall of over a million cars. Lately, some  researchers also demonstrated that it was possible to locally or remotely take control of smart  2 See EC Communication “On the road to automated mobility: An EU strategy for mobility of the future”:  https://ec.europa.eu/transport/sites/transport/files/3rd-mobility-pack/com20180283_en.pdf, May 2018  3 See SAE J3016 “Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to Driving Automations Systems for On-Road Motor  Vehicles”: http://sae.org/standards/content/J3016_201806/  4 See JRC 2019 Report 111477, Alonso Raposo M., Grosso, M., Després, J., Fernández Macías, E., Galassi, C.,  Krasenbrink, A., Krause, J., Levati, L., Mourtzouchou, A., Saveyn, B., Thiel, C. and Ciuffo, B.

Moreover, security specialists succeeded to hijack cars using their smart alarm, thereby  illegitimately performing actions such as enabling/disabling the immobilizer or cutting the  engine12. Towards the objective to provide a generic development and evaluation environment  for vehicle cybersecurity technologies, an open-source testing platform called PASTA13  (Portable Automotive Security Testbed with Adaptability) was recently released; it simulates the  remote operations of vehicle wheels, brakes, windows, and other features to learn more about  the electronic communications features  and find vulnerabilities as well as test exploits.  However, such a platform may also be used by an attacker, thus facilitating their tasks.  With the increasing smart cars connectivity and the emergence of (semi)-autonomous cars,  novel cybersecurity challenges, risks and threats are arising. For instance, there have been  some experimental remote attacks14,15 on autonomous cars’ cameras and Light Detection and  Ranging (LiDAR) systems showing effective camera blinding, making real objects appear further  than their actual locations or even creating fake objects. In addition to malicious sensor  manipulations, other attack vectors have been practically demonstrated such as Global  Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) spoofing16 and fooling AI-based functions17 with the  famous example of trapping a self-driving car by just drawing a chalk circle around the vehicle.  Attacks targeting smart cars may lead to vehicle immobilization, road accidents, financial losses,  disclosure of sensitive and/or personal data, and even endanger road users’ safety. Thus,  appropriate security measures need to be implemented to mitigate the potential risks, especially  as these attacks threaten the security, safety and even the privacy of vehicle passengers and all  other road users, including pedestrians.  1.1 OBJECTIVES  This ENISA study aims at addressing the security and privacy challenges related to the  evolution of smart cars. The main objectives were to collect good practices to ensure the  security of smart cars, while mapping the relevant security and privacy challenges, threats, risks  and attack scenarios.  More specifically, the aim of this study is to identify the good practices in order to ensure smart  cars security against cyber threats, while focusing on V2X communications and (semi-)  autonomous cars18. Towards this end, the following objectives have been set:   Analyse smart cars architecture and define a high-level reference model   Identify smart cars sensitive assets   Identify potential and main cyber threats, risks and attack scenarios targeting smart cars   Map identified threats to assets   Identify relevant security measures based on the threats and assets, and map the identified  security measures to the relevant threat(s).  11 See “Experimental security assessment of BMW cars: A summary report”:  https://keenlab.tencent.com/en/whitepapers/Experimental_Security_Assessment_of_BMW_Cars_by_KeenLab.pdf  12 See “Hacking smart car alarm systems”: https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/hacking-smart-car-alarm-systems/26014/  13 See “PASTA: Portable Automotive Security Testbed with Adaptability”: https://i.blackhat.com/eu-18/Wed-Dec-5/eu-18- Toyama-PASTA-Portable-Automotive-Security-Testbed-with-Adaptability-wp.pdf  14 See “Remote attacks on Automated Vehicles Sensors: Experiments on Camera and LiDAR”:  https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e06f/ef73f5bad0489bb033f490d41a046f61878a.pdf  15 See “Self-driving and connected cars: fooling sensors and tracking drivers”: https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu- 15/materials/eu-15-Petit-Self-Driving-And-Connected-Cars-Fooling-Sensors-And-Tracking-Drivers.pdf  16 See “All Your GPS Are Belong To Us: Towards Stealthy Manipulation of Road Navigation Systems”:  https://www.usenix.org/node/217477  17 See “Meet the Artist Using Ritual Magic to Trap Self-Driving Cars”: https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ywwba5/meet-the- artist-using-ritual-magic-to-trap-self-driving-cars  18 See SAE J3016 “Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to Driving Automations Systems for On-Road Motor  Vehicles”: http://sae.org/standards/content/J3016_201806/  https://keenlab.tencent.com/en/whitepapers/Experimental_Security_Assessment_of_BMW_Cars_by_KeenLab.pdf https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/hacking-smart-car-alarm-systems/26014/ https://i.blackhat.com/eu-18/Wed-Dec-5/eu-18-Toyama-PASTA-Portable-Automotive-Security-Testbed-with-Adaptability-wp.pdf https://i.blackhat.com/eu-18/Wed-Dec-5/eu-18-Toyama-PASTA-Portable-Automotive-Security-Testbed-with-Adaptability-wp.pdf https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e06f/ef73f5bad0489bb033f490d41a046f61878a.pdf https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu-15/materials/eu-15-Petit-Self-Driving-And-Connected-Cars-Fooling-Sensors-And-Tracking-Drivers.pdf https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu-15/materials/eu-15-Petit-Self-Driving-And-Connected-Cars-Fooling-Sensors-And-Tracking-Drivers.pdf https://www.usenix.org/node/217477 https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ywwba5/meet-the-artist-using-ritual-magic-to-trap-self-driving-cars https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ywwba5/meet-the-artist-using-ritual-magic-to-trap-self-driving-cars http://sae.org/standards/content/J3016_201806/  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  8  This ENISA study aims to serve as a reference point to promote collaborative automotive  cybersecurity across the European Union and raise awareness of the relevant threats and risks  with a focus on “security for safety”.  1.2 SCOPE  This ENISA study outlines good practices for the security of smart cars. It is building on the  previous ENISA study on smart cars entitled “Cyber Security and Resilience of Smart Cars”19  and mainly focuses on V2X communications and (semi-)autonomous cars20 as these  technologies were not previously considered.  During this study, ENISA identified available documentation and standards on smart cars cyber  security, with a focus on connected and autonomous cars. ENISA also collected inputs from a  number of automotive security experts through a structured questionnaire and a series of  interviews. Following a thorough analysis of the identified material and the review of security  experts feedbacks, ENISA identified the main assets and threats targeting smart cars. Based on  these threats, a set of security measures and good practices were defined to ensure smart cars  security.  The study highlights three groups of security measures to address security challenges in terms  of technologies, policies and processes. A risk-based and holistic approach to security was  undertaken. ENISA considered the cybersecurity of smart cars throughout their lifecycle (from  conception to end-of-life) and addressed all the essential elements of automotive cybersecurity.  Particular attention was paid to the overall supply chain while considering the different  stakeholders involved in the smart cars manufacturing (i.e. OEM, software and hardware  components providers, etc.).  1.3 EU AND INTERNATIONAL POLICY CONTEXT  The various attacks on smart cars10,16,17,21,22,23,24 that were publicly reported over the last few  years led to a relatively quick awareness of the automotive industry of the security needs and  the development of several cybersecurity regulations and initiatives aiming to ensure properly  secure vehicles, as presented below.   EU Policy:  o Early 2014, the Commission's Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport (DG  MOVE) set up a C-ITS deployment platform. This latter was  conceived as a cooperative  framework including national authorities, Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-  ITS) stakeholders and the European Commission with the objective to identify and agree  on how to ensure interoperability of C-ITS across borders and along the whole value  chain, as well as to identify the most likely and suitable deployment scenario(s).  o In 2017, the Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and  Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) (DG GROW) launched an initiative on  safety regulations with the aim to contribute to a further decrease of the number of road  fatalities and injuries considering amendments to the General Safety Regulation and the  Pedestrian Safety Regulation.  19 See ENISA (2016) “Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars – Good practices and recommendations”:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-security-and-resilience-of-smart-cars  20 See SAE J3016 “Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to Driving Automations Systems for On-Road Motor  Vehicles”: http://sae.org/standards/content/J3016_201806/  21 See “Remote Attacks on Automated Vehicles Sensors: Experiments on Camera and LiDAR”:  https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e06f/ef73f5bad0489bb033f490d41a046f61878a.pdf  22 See “Illusion and Dazzle: Adversarial Optical Channel Exploits against Lidars for Automotive Applications”:  https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/613.pdf  23 See “Fast and Vulnerable: A Story of Telematic Failures”:  https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/woot15/woot15-paper-foster.pdf  24 See “Robust Physical-World Attacks on Deep Learning Visual Classification”: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.08945.pdf  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-security-and-resilience-of-smart-cars http://sae.org/standards/content/J3016_201806/ https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/613.pdf https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/613.pdf  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  9  o In 2018, the Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and  Technology (DG CONNECT) launched an initiative on Cooperative, Connected and  Automated Mobility (CCAM) with the aim to:   provide further guidance on a governance framework for access and sharing of data  generated by connected vehicles   clarify cybersecurity requirements for the connected car environment   provide guidance on the use of pioneer spectrum for 5G connectivity for large scale  testing and experimentation for connected vehicles  o In 2019, the European Commission has set up an informal group of a hundred experts  named “the Single Platform for open road testing and pre-deployment of cooperative,  connected, automated and autonomous mobility” in order to provide advice and support  regarding testing and pre-deployment activities for CCAM25.  o The protection of road users’ privacy and personal information is also addressed by the  recent EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)26 which officially went into effect  in May 2018.  o The Network and Information Security directive (NIS)27 also addresses autonomous  vehicles’ cybersecurity issues as it intends to provide generic security measures in order  to enhance cybersecurity across EU.   International Context:  o The European OEMs published a set of cybersecurity principles, through the ACEA  Principles of Automobile Cybersecurity28, which are already implemented by OEM  companies.  o The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) from the U.S. government  issued in late 2016 a document introducing several cybersecurity best practices for smart  cars29.  o The US Automotive Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Auto-ISAC) has been  maintaining since 2016 a series of Automotive Cybersecurity Best Practices30 which  provide guidance on the implementation of automotive cybersecurity principles.  o Several cybersecurity standards and recommendation documents are also under  development. In particular, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe  (UNECE) is currently drafting a proposal for a recommendation on Cyber Security31 with  a focus on key cyber threats and vulnerabilities against vehicles as well as measures to  be considered in order to mitigate the identified threats. UNECE is also introducing a  United Nations regulation on cybersecurity which defines a set of requirements that shall  be fulfilled by vehicle manufacturers, suppliers and service providers, covering the entire  vehicle lifecycle (i.e. from the vehicle development to its decommissioning).  25 See “European Commission Launches CCAM Single Platform”:  https://connectedautomateddriving.eu/mediaroom/european-commission-launches-ccam-single-platform/  26 See EU “General Data Protection Regulation”: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679  27 See Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 concerning measures for a  high common level of security of network and information systems across the Union”: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN  28 See ACEA “https://www.acea.be/publications/article/acea-principles-of-automobile-cybersecurity”  29 See NHTSA “Cybesecurity best practices for modern vehicles”:  https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=2ahUKEwji2PqR0cDjAhXq2eAKHcnrAnUQFj AAegQIAxAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nhtsa.gov%2Fstaticfiles%2Fnvs%2Fpdf%2F812333_CybersecurityForModernV ehicles.pdf&usg=AOvVaw33nVAk2UWXpL3tzDmpRBjl  30 See Auto-ISAC “Automotive Cybersecurity Best Practices – Executive summary”: https://www.automotiveisac.com/best- practices/  31 See current draft of the UNECE “Proposal for Recommendation on Cyber Security”:  https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/doc/2019/wp29grva/ECE-TRANS-WP29-GRVA-2019-02e.pdf  https://connectedautomateddriving.eu/mediaroom/european-commission-launches-ccam-single-platform/ https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN https://www.acea.be/publications/article/acea-principles-of-automobile-cybersecurity https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=2ahUKEwji2PqR0cDjAhXq2eAKHcnrAnUQFjAAegQIAxAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nhtsa.gov%2Fstaticfiles%2Fnvs%2Fpdf%2F812333_CybersecurityForModernVehicles.pdf&usg=AOvVaw33nVAk2UWXpL3tzDmpRBjl https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=2ahUKEwji2PqR0cDjAhXq2eAKHcnrAnUQFjAAegQIAxAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nhtsa.gov%2Fstaticfiles%2Fnvs%2Fpdf%2F812333_CybersecurityForModernVehicles.pdf&usg=AOvVaw33nVAk2UWXpL3tzDmpRBjl https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=2ahUKEwji2PqR0cDjAhXq2eAKHcnrAnUQFjAAegQIAxAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nhtsa.gov%2Fstaticfiles%2Fnvs%2Fpdf%2F812333_CybersecurityForModernVehicles.pdf&usg=AOvVaw33nVAk2UWXpL3tzDmpRBjl https://www.automotiveisac.com/best-practices/ https://www.automotiveisac.com/best-practices/ https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/doc/2019/wp29grva/ECE-TRANS-WP29-GRVA-2019-02e.pdf  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  10   Standards:  o The British Standards Institution (BSI) Group published in December 2018 two Publicly  Available Specifications (PAS), namely PAS 188532 and PAS 1128133. The former, which  is entitled “The fundamental principles of automotive cyber security”, provides high-level  guidance to provide and maintain cybersecurity. As regards to PAS 11281, entitled  “Connected automotive ecosystems – Impact of security on safety – Code of practice”, it  provides recommendations for managing security risks in a connected automotive  ecosystem.  o The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) has been developing a  set of technical specifications, ETSI TS 102 940 to 102 943 34, which define an Intelligent  Transport System (ITS) security architecture along with services specification to ensure  information confidentiality and prevent unauthorized access to ITS services. They also  address the trust and privacy management for ITS communications.  o The standard of Society of Automotive Engineers SAE J306135, officially published in  January 2016, is considered as the first standard addressing automotive cybersecurity. It  provides a set of high-level cybersecurity principles and guidance for cyber-physical  vehicle systems.  o The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and SAE collaborated to  supersede the SAE J3061 recommended practice and propose the ISO/SAE 2143436.  This standard is also under development and focuses on automotive cybersecurity  engineering by specifying requirements and providing recommendations for  cybersecurity risk management for cars (including their components, software and  interfaces) all along their entire lifecycle. Concurrently, the SAE is working on another  document, SAE J3101, which aims to define common requirements for security to be  implemented in hardware for ground vehicles.  In 2016, ENISA performed a study on smart cars security issues which resulted in a document  entitled “Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars”37. It has also established the Cars and  Roads SECurity (CaRSEC) working group which addresses smart cars cybersecurity threats,  challenges and solutions so as to protect road users’ safety. CaRSEC group members are car  manufacturers with focus on cybersecurity, suppliers and developers of embedded  hardware/software for smart cars, road authorities and academia, as well as standardisation  bodies and policy makers.  1.4 TARGET AUDIENCE  This study provides a set of good practices and security measures to improve smart cars  security and mitigate the potential threats and risks. Therefore, similarly to the previous ENISA  smart cars study, the target audience of this study is mainly:   Car manufacturers: also referred to as OEMs, they design new cars and handle the  assembly of the various car components. In particular, most of the various car components  are not produced by the car manufacturer itself, but rather by their suppliers according to a  set of functional, safety and security requirements defined by the car manufacturers.  32 See “PAS 1885:2018 - The fundamental principles of automotive cyber security.

Tier 1 refers to the entities having direct contractual  relationships with the car manufacturers, whereas Tier 2 refers to the entities having  contractual relationships with Tier 1 suppliers. For instance, car seats are manufactured by  Tier 1 suppliers whilst electronic components or software are usually provided by Tier 2  suppliers.   Aftermarket suppliers: provide added-value aftermarket products, such as smart dongles  or third-party GNSS systems, which can be bought by customers and connected to the car  to provide additional features.  1.5 METHODOLOGY  ENISA has developed this study following a five-step methodological approach as depicted in  Figure 1.  Figure 1: Methodology  1. Project scope definition: the first step consisted in establishing the scope of the  project and identifying the main topics to be considered during the study.  2. Desktop research and experts’ identification: extensive research of relevant  documents to gather as much information as possible about (semi-)autonomous cars  and V2X communication technologies. The identified documents and standards were  used as references for the development of this report. During this step, subject matter  experts were also invited to validate scope and provide feedback. Experts from car  manufacturers, tier-1 and tier-2 suppliers as well as other organisations, such as  Government Authorities and ITS system suppliers were invited. Additionally, experts  from ENISA’s CaRSEC38 informal expert group were also invited to contribute.  3. Questionnaire and interviews with identified experts: ENISA got in touch with the  identified experts in order to get their point of view. To this end, a structured  38 See https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/carsec-expert-group for more information on the terms of reference and scope of  the ENISA CarSEC Informal Expert Group.  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/carsec-expert-group  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  12  questionnaire covering various security aspects, such as critical assets, key threats  targeting smart cars and awareness with respect to smart cars standards and  guidelines, was developed. The questionnaire was completed by some of the identified  experts, and interviews were conducted to collect additional valuable inputs to prepare  the report.  4. Analysis of collected material and report development: all the collected  information, either through desktop research or directly from the identified experts, was  thoroughly analysed. This led to the development of the first draft of this report.  5. Review and report validation: ENISA shared the draft of the report with its relevant  stakeholder communities and reference groups for review. Taking into account the  stakeholders feedbacks, the proposed final version of the report was issued and a  validation face-to-face workshop was organized to present the results of the study.  1.6 STRUCTURE OF THE DOCUMENT  The study is structured as follows:   Chapter 1 – Introduction: provides introductory information on the objectives, scope,  relevant EU and international policies, target audience, followed methodology and the  structure of this study.   Chapter 2 – Smart cars: Connected and (semi-)autonomous cars: first defines V2X  communications, semi-autonomous and autonomous cars. Then, it provides a high-level  reference architecture of smart cars and lists the sensitive assets to be protected.   Chapter 3 – Threats and risk analysis: identifies the main threats against smart cars and  indicates the affected assets. Some examples of significant smart cars attack scenarios are  also detailed.   Chapter 4 – Security measures and good practices: describes the security measures  and good practices to mitigate the aforementioned attacks.  Further details are provided in the appendix:   Annex A – Asset Taxonomy: presents the different assets and provides a brief description  of them   Annex B – Threat Taxonomy: provides a brief description of the different threats and maps  each threat to the asset(s) that may potentially be affected   Annex C – Mapping of security measures to threats, standard and good practices:  details the security measures mentioned in chapter 4 and maps them to the corresponding  threats.  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  13  2. SMART CARS: CONNECTED  AND (SEMI-) AUTONOMOUS CARS  2.1 DEFINITIONS  The SAE J301639 standard defines six levels of driving automation for on-road vehicles, ranging  from level 0 with no driving automation at all to level 5 with full driving automation and no need  for a driver, as shown in Figure 2.  Figure 2: SAE vehicles automation levels as defined in SAE J3016  Even though the provided recommendations and good practices can apply to all vehicles (i.e.  no matter their automation level), this study focuses on semi-autonomous and autonomous  cars, which are also referred to as Automated Driving System-Dedicated Vehicle (ADS-DS) in  SAE J3016 standard, as well as on V2X communications, defined as follows:   Semi-autonomous cars (level 4 of automation): refers to highly automated cars that are  equipped with a multitude of sensors in order to be able to autonomously (i.e. without any  human driver intervention) perform all driving functions under certain conditions (e.g. on a  given type of roads).   Autonomous cars (level 5 of automation): refers to fully automated cars that are  equipped with a multitude of sensors in order to be able to autonomously perform all driving  functions under all conditions (i.e. at any time and on any road). Those cars may not even  include a steering wheel or accelerator/brake pedals.   V2X communications: refers to data exchanges between a vehicle and any other entity  (e.g. a road infrastructure, another vehicle, a pedestrian, etc.). It covers the notions of V2V  (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) communications and V2I (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure) communications. In  this study, the term V2I refers to all communications between the vehicle and its  39 See SAE J3016 “Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to Driving Automations Systems for On-Road Motor  Vehicles”: http://sae.org/standards/content/J3016_201806/  http://sae.org/standards/content/J3016_201806/  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  14  surrounding, aside from V2V communications. Thus, V2I includes V2P (Vehicle-to-  Pedestrian) and V2N (Vehicle-to-Network) communications. To enable V2X  communications, vehicles are equipped with different wireless communication systems such  as Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC40), Visible Light Communication (VLC),  Image Sensor Communication (ISC), Wi-Fi or mobile communication technologies, such as  3G, 4G and 5G. This study is meant to be agnostic about the communication technologies  actually used.  Figure 3 gives an overview of the smart car ecosystem depicting systems and application both  in-vehicle 41 and outside the car.  Figure 3: Smart cars ecosystem  In this study, we focus on smart cars that, as connected systems, have the necessary  capabilities to autonomously perform all driving functions under certain (or all) conditions, and  are able to communicate with their surroundings including other vehicles, pedestrians and  Road-Side Units (RSU).  Good practices discussed in this report do not only concern passenger cars but also commercial  vehicles (e.g. buses, coaches, etc.), including self-driving ride-sharing vehicles which can be  40 In this document, DSRC refers to the standards from the European Committee for Standardization EN 12253:2004 and  EN 12795:2002  41 In-vehicle refers to assets inside the vehicle  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  15  shared with other users. This study does not focus on specific use cases such as connected  infotainment and specific intra-vehicular communications.  To achieve enhanced autonomous driving capabilities, smart cars rely on various technologies  including:   Sensors and Actuators: devices that have various capabilities, such as sensing and  detecting objects, actuating, etc.   Artificial Intelligence: algorithms that enable ECUs and computers to perform tasks  typically associated with intelligent human beings.   Machine Learning: algorithms that enable computers to act and enhance their ability to  predict events or situations.   Cloud Computing: solutions enabling access to shared sets of resources such as servers  and applications with minimal requirements concerning managerial effort and service  provider interaction.   Communications and/or Networks: radio technologies and communication protocols that  allow data exchange between different entities.  2.2 HIGH-LEVEL REFERENCE MODEL  Smart cars and especially (semi-)autonomous cars, which include several ECUs and  components, may seem unduly complicated at first glance. Although smart cars functions (e.g.  braking, steering, door locking, etc.) are the same throughout vehicles, nevertheless each OEM  has its own in-vehicle architecture and there is no common and unique architecture that can be  used as a reference model. Figure 4 presents the high-level functional model that ENISA  Figure 4: High-Level Smart Cars Reference Model  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  16  defined for the study based on an extensive review of relevant efforts and having validated it  with the experts. The model’s aim is to provide a generic overview of the smart cars  technologies and their interplay. It needs to be noted that the model is only indicative and does  not reflect the complexity of the various automotive architectures; it aims at encapsulating the  main elements of the latter in a high-level view.  This model provides a general overview of the  different functionalities, used technologies and most important components providing smart cars  major features.  The high-level reference model consists of four layers arranged in order, with the three lowest  layers being part of the smart car, whereas the upper layer represents components that are  outside the actual containment of the car, but which are part of its environment such as RSUs  and map servers for instance. In addition to the components and technologies depicted in  Figure 4, smart cars also include critical functions (e.g. acceleration, braking, object detection,  navigation, etc.) that ought to be protected against cyberattacks. Indeed, altering the operations  of those functions may lead to unexpected situations (e.g. vehicle collision or crash) that could  endanger road users’ safety.  Hereinafter, we provide a brief description of the different layers:   Car sensors and actuators: the lowest layer of the architecture comprises the various  smart cars sensors used to monitor the driving environment by collecting data on the vehicle  surroundings, such as road conditions, distance to other objects and vehicles, Global  Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) positions, as well as the different actuators that  execute the necessary actions.   Car ECUs, processing and decision making components: this layer comprises all the  hardware and software components, including AI, that are used for the processing of the  data received from layer Car sensors and actuators (i.e. data collected by the smart cars  sensors) and In-vehicle communication components (e.g. data received from other C-ITS  stations), as well taking the appropriate decision and transmitting it to the relevant actuator.   In-vehicle communication components: this layer includes the different in-vehicle  communication components used for both in-vehicle communications (e.g. Head-Unit which  is also referred to as In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI), or in-vehicle gateway) as well as  communications with external components such as other vehicles or RSUs.  2.3 SMART CARS INFRASTRUCTURE AND BACKEND SYSTEMS:  This layer comprises the different external communication components (e.g. RSU, traffic signs)  or systems (e.g. other vehicles, access points, pedestrian smartphone) that communicate  directly with the smart cars, as well as servers and systems that remotely provide services to  smart cars. It includes, amongst others, OEM back-end systems used for over-the-air (OTA)  updates, map data servers and third party service provider’s systems.assets taxonomy.  To address smart cars cybersecurity issues, it is essential to identify assets of such a complex  ecosystem. A taxonomy of the key assets that should be protected in order to ensure highly  secure vehicles is depicted in Figure 5, and a brief description of the different assets is provided  in Annex A. Especially, smart cars functions (e.g. obstacle detection) are of utmost importance  as they directly influence smart cars behaviours and may endanger passengers’ safety. These  functions are at the crossroads between different technologies from sensors to AI-based  algorithms by way of infrastructure components, listed in the asset taxonomy. This highlights  that securing smart cars requires a multidisciplinary approach, as assets domains are quite  diversified.  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  17  Figure 5: Asset taxonomy  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  18  3. THREATS AND ATTACK SCENARIOS  3.1 THREATS TAXONOMY  Smart cars increased connectivity and automation expose them to several crucial cyber threats.  Those threats may directly target smart cars or their surroundings such as RSUs, traffic  signs/lights or even remote servers of the OEM or third-party service providers.  In accordance with the ENISA Threat Taxonomy42, we have developed a threat taxonomy43  focused on smart cars as depicted in Figure 6. Annex C provides a description of the different  threats and identifies the assets that may be affected by each threat.  42 See “ENISA Threat Taxonomy” (2016): https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and- trends/enisa-threat-landscape/threat-taxonomy/view  43 It is a snapshot of today’s threats and may not be up-to-date in the future.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/enisa-threat-landscape/threat-taxonomy/view https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/enisa-threat-landscape/threat-taxonomy/view  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  19  Figure 6: Threat taxonomy  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  20  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  21  3.2 EXAMPLES OF SMART CARS CYBER SECURITY ATTACK  SCENARIOS  During the interviews, automotive experts assessed the criticality of several attack scenarios  based on their potential impacts and the aforementioned threats, so as to enable the  identification of critical attack scenarios. For each attack scenario, experts were asked to  indicate whether they consider its potential impact (i.e. severity level) as high, medium or low.  Table 1 depicts the different attack scenarios along with the interviewees’ perceived severity  level.  Table 1: Smart cars attack scenarios  ATTACK SCENARIOS SEVERITY44  1. Vulnerability exploit in a communication stack: exploitation of a vulnerability  in a communication stack of an in-vehicle network (e.g. no protection mechanism  against replay attacks, lack of authentication, etc.) can lead to severe issues such as  critical ECU reprogramming and taking control the vehicle over the Controller Area  Network (CAN bus).  High  2. Mobile car application45 being hacked/attacked allowing access to the car:  by hacking the mobile application, an attacker could order a car to drive him  somewhere although he is not allowed to do so.  High  3. Attack on remote servers to influence car behaviours: several attack  scenarios exist regarding remote servers. For instance, an attacker could  compromise map data with the aim to affect plausibility checks, or even alter data on  traffic conditions to change the current car itinerary resulting in an inefficient service.  High  4. Fake communication unit to compromise telematics unit and deploy rogue  firmware: use of malicious communication unit, such as Base Transceiver Station  (BTS), Wi-Fi router, RSU, with the objective to spread a malware or just disrupting  the infrastructure communications.  High  5. Large scale deployment of rogue firmware after hacking OEM back-end  servers: penetration of OEM back-end servers with the aim to initiate malicious  firmware updates could lead to devastating results as this kind of attacks is highly-  scalable.  High  6. Hacking an RSU with the aim to spread wrong traffic and safety  messages: as RSUs constitute an important part of the autonomous vehicles’  ecosystem, they could be the target of hackers in order to create traffic jams or other  kind of disruptions.  High – Medium  7. Rogue vehicle sending wrong information through V2V interfaces: vehicles  unknown from the infrastructure (e.g. counterfeit cars) that are deployed to decrease  the safety level by sending wrong information about traffic conditions and other  functionalities (i.e. fake information with the aim to update map data).  Medium  44 This severity is a global perception of the risk based on interviews. In practice, it varies strongly depending on the actual  architecture of each smart car.  45 Mobile application that provides value added services with respect to the car (e.g. mobile application that enables to  unlock the car, start the engine, etc.)  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  22  8. Sensor fooling by adversarial perturbation: attack scenarios to disrupt the  sensors’ proper functioning by different means depending on the targeted sensor  (e.g. flash the camera, relay the light waves from the LiDAR).  Medium – Low  9. Communication jamming: producing radio interferences to disrupt wireless  networks so the vehicles cannot emit or receive V2X messages.  Low  10. GNSS spoofing: by replacing GNSS signals, an attacker can fool a third-party  service into thinking that the vehicle is elsewhere in either time or location. This can  lead to accident or vehicle theft.  Medium  11. Blocking critical messages at automation level 4: an attacker can block  critical messages, such as Denial of a Service (DoS) attack, and prevent the semi-  autonomous vehicle (or driver) from reacting appropriately to the situation (e.g. apply  the brakes, warn the driver that he needs to take control of the vehicle, etc.).  High  Hereinafter, we detail three types of attack scenarios encompassing various use-cases. The first  attack scenario (Large scale deployment of a rogue firmware after hacking OEM back-end  servers) is typical of the threats lying over connected cars. The second one (Hacking/altering  a V2X mobile application that allows access to the car) is extracted from V2X use-cases.  The third one (Sensor fooling by adversarial perturbation) is more related to (semi-  )autonomous features. These three attack scenarios were selected so as to represent different  families of attacks linked with connected cars and automation levels 4 & 5, which are the focus  of this study. The impact is an overall estimation based on the outcome of the interviews.  Attack scenario 1: Large scale deployment of a rogue firmware after hacking OEM back-end servers  DESCRIPTION  This attack scenario refers to deployment of malicious firmware from back-end  servers. This could be initiated by OEMs employees (e.g. developers) or by external  attackers capable of penetrating back-end servers. Malicious OTA updates could  then be executed so that autonomous vehicles think it is a legitimate one, as it is  initiated from a trusted server.  IMPACT  High – Crucial: Remote servers might communicate with numerous vehicles at the  same time. Thus, compromising such a centralised server could affect the entire  ecosystem, including passengers’ safety.  EASE OF DETECTION CASCADE EFFECT RISK  Medium: Remote servers should have enough  resources to implement advanced monitoring  techniques. However, the deployment of many  remote servers increases the attack surface to be  protected.  High: Such attacks are  highly-scalable as they  can be executed  remotely and affect a  fleet of vehicles instantly.  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  23  ASSETS AFFECTED  STAKEHOLDERS  INVOLVED  Back-end system  Software and Licenses  OTA Updates  Vehicle functions  Information (User, Device, Keys  and Certificates)  OEMs  ATTACK STEPS  1. To perform this attack scenario, the attacker needs first to penetrate the  targeted OEM back-end server. This may be carried out by leveraging a  known vulnerability of used software, a misconfiguration on the server side  or by spoofing the administrator account for instance.  2. Once the attacker gets access to the OEM back-end server, the attacker can  request the execution of an OTA firmware update for a given fleet of  vehicles. To this end, he follows the same steps required to perform a  legitimate OTA firmware update.  3. Upon receiving the OTA update request, vehicles acknowledge and accept  the request as it is initiated by a legitimate OEM server.  4. Next, the attacker uploads a rogue firmware on the OEM back-end server  and launches the OTA update process to deploy this firmware.  5. Once the rogue firmware is installed on smart cars, the attacker can take  remote control of a fleet of vehicles by exploiting a backdoor introduced in  the rogue firmware.  RECOVERY TIME / EFFORT  GAPS AND  CHALLENGES  Medium – High: Depending on the nature of  the deployed firmware, cancelling the update  by returning back to the retro version can be  challenging if the attacker was able to change  update related information (e.g. certificates,  policies). Use of logging can help to identify  the attack origin.  Lack of awareness and knowledge  Lack of a secure boot process  Lack of proper product lifecycle  management  COUNTERMEASURES  1. Regularly assess the security controls and patch vulnerabilities.  2. Deploy Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) at vehicle and back-end levels.  3. Introduce a new device or software change into the vehicle only according to  an established, accepted and communicated change management process.  4. Consider establishing a CSIRT.  5. Apply security controls at back-end servers.  6. Establish an incident handling process.  7. Incident report to back-end servers.  8. Conduct periodic reviews, of authorization and access control privileges for  instance.  9. Software authenticity and integrity checked before installation.  10. Use of secure OTA firmware updates.  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  24  11. Protect OTA update process.  12. Use of secure boot mechanisms.  13. Application of security controls to back-end servers.  14. Apply least privileges principle and use individual accounts to access  devices and systems.  15. Maintain properly protected audit logs.  16. Allow and encourage the use of strong authentication mechanisms.  Attack scenario 2: Hacking/altering a V2X mobile application that allows access to the car  DESCRIPTION  IMPACT  High: Such attacks can result in illegitimate access to the smart car or even its theft  through the compromise or hacking of a V2X mobile application.  EASE OF DETECTION CASCADE EFFECT RISK  Medium: Individual should pay  attention to the different  applications installed on their  smartphone (e.g. avoid installing  suspicious applications).  Medium: This attack scenario  target individuals and allows  compromising many vehicles at  once using V2X application  ASSETS AFFECTED STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED  Mobile application  User information  Keys and certificates  Mobile devices (smartphones and  Tablets)  OEMs  Third-party service providers  ATTACK STEPS (SAMPLE BASED ON A REAL-CASE ATTACK SCENARIO)  1. The attacker manages to retrieve user’s credentials associated to a V2X  application (e.g. car, traffic or platooning application) by one of the following  means: by making the honest user install a fake application instead of the real  one, via a phishing attack, or by leveraging an existing or a new discovered  vulnerability in the V2X application.  2. Once the attacker has retrieved the user’s credentials, he installs the legitimate  V2X application and uses stolen credentials to login successfully; thus  impersonating the honest user.  3. Finally, the attacker can use the V2X application to get access to the smart car,  and potentially steal the smart car if keyless driving is allowed and the hacked  application enables to start the engine.  RECOVERY TIME / EFFORT GAPS AND CHALLENGES  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  25  Medium: As soon as the flaw in the application that  allow such attacks is discovered, a security patch  should be applied. Depending on the vulnerability, it  might take days or weeks.  If V2X application user has informed OEM about  credential compromise, they should revoke the  disclosed credentials for that particular user.  Response to zero-day vulnerabilities  Lack of awareness and knowledge  Insecure design or development  COUNTERMEASURES  1. Perform vulnerability surveys.  2. Third party testing of V2X applications.  3. Regularly assess the security controls and patch vulnerabilities.  4. Information sharing between different actors.  5. Adopt a holistic approach to security training and awareness among the employees.  6. Raise users’ awareness.  7. Allow and encourage the use of strong authentication (e.g. multi-factor  authentication).  8. Consider establishing a Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT).  9. Mitigate vulnerabilities or limitations of software libraries.  10. Protect mobile applications against reverse engineering and tampering of their  binary code.  11. Securely store sensitive data on mobile devices.  Attack scenario 3: Sensor fooling by adversarial perturbation  DESCRIPTION  IMPACT  High: The impact depends on the introduced perturbation. However, abusive detection, or  lack of detection of stop signs could entail major accidents endangering road users’ safety  and leading to driver, passenger, or pedestrian deaths.  EASE OF DETECTION CASCADE EFFECT RISK  Medium: Without appropriate  countermeasure, the  modifications brought to the signs  could be undetected by human  eyes before an accident occurs.  Low: The perturbation is local,  and may affect only the cars  passing by the modified or  spoofed sign.  ASSETS AFFECTED STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED  Decision Making algorithms  Sensors for autonomous vehicles  Vehicle functions  OEMs  Road infrastructure  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  26  ATTACK STEPS (SAMPLE BASED ON A REAL-CASE ATTACK SCENARIO)  1. The attacker first analyses the capabilities of the targeted versions of cameras  and AI-based image classifier to ensure detection and classification as desired of  the modified sign. This setup phase can require trying multiple perturbation  patterns or display parameters. The attacker needs to perform some  experimentation as well, to test the adversarial perturbation and ensure that his  attack will succeed.  2. At a next step, the attacker attaches a set of black and white stickers46 to a  physical road sign to cause misclassification of the traffic sign.  3. Due to the added stickers, the cars passing by the altered traffic sign will  erroneously classify it into the attacker’s targeted class (e.g. interpret a stop sign  as a speed limit sign) and react accordingly (e.g. reduce speed instead of  stopping the vehicle).  RECOVERY TIME / EFFORT GAPS AND CHALLENGES  Medium: Sensor fooling attacks  can go unnoticed. Once detected,  modified traffic signs can be  repaired in hours.  Traffic sign authentication would be an  appropriate countermeasure but is  complicated to deploy  Collaboration of vehicles  COUNTERMEASURES  1. Protect critical sensors in order to prevent attacks that may alter their perception  of the environment.  2. Hardening against Adversarial Machine Learning.  3. Use of hardware redundancy mechanisms.  4. Use of data redundancy mechanisms, such as sensors information fusion.  5. Perform data validation, for instance by comparing sign information collected by  sensor with information from digital maps stored in the vehicle.  46 “Robust Physical-World Attacks on Deep Learning Models”: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.08945.pdf  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.08945.pdf  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  27  4. SECURITY MEASURES AND GOOD  PRACTICES  4.1 SECURITY MEASURES CATEGORISATION  Security measures and good practices development is one of the major objectives of this study.  Indeed, a considerable effort was expended to identify all relevant security measures in order to  help mitigate the potential threats and risks, thus improving smart cars security.  The list of security measures has been established by analysing relevant documents and  standards identified during desktop research47. This analysis allowed the identification of  frequently mentioned topics regarding smart cars security and their classifications into different  security domains. The resulting list consists of seventeen security domains grouped into three  main categories, namely Policies, Organisational practices and Technical practices as shown in  Figure 7. The latter provides a comprehensive view of smart cars security landscape, and  points out the areas to be protected.  Figure 7: Cybersecurity Good Practices Overview  47 The data collection was performed between March and July 2019. Updates may have impacted the reference documents  since the publication of this report. See Bibliography in chapter 6.  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  28  4.2 POLICIES  This first category of security measures encompasses the different policies and procedures to  be established within organizations to ensure an appropriate cybersecurity level.  Policies-related security measures cover both security and privacy aspects, and have been  classified into four main security domains, namely Security by design, Privacy by design,  Asset management and Risk and threat management.  The security measures in this section are addressed at both OEMs and suppliers, due to the  tight links between them.  4.2.1 Security by design  These security measures emphasize the need to consider security aspects from the very  beginning of product development, throughout the supply chain and all over smart cars lifecycle.   PS-01: Adopt a security by design approach where smart cars cybersecurity is considered  from both the vehicles as well as the infrastructure perspective.   PS-02: Address security in each relevant specification document to ensure that security  aspects are considered from the very beginning of the concept phase, and not as an  afterthought.   PS-03: Promote the use of methodologies that consider security in every stage of the  development phase and operations phases (e.g. DevSecOps48, Secure Development  Lifecycle (SDL)49, etc.).   PS-04: Consider including a security role within the product engineering team to lead  security related tasks.  4.2.2 Privacy by design  This security domain includes a set of security measures related to the protection of private data  that are collected, processed and/or stored by smart cars stakeholders.   PS-05: Consider applying local and international privacy related regulations, such as the  GDPR, to prevent privacy issues.   PS-06: Conduct Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA), taken into account the context of use, in  order to identify any privacy related risk, and define appropriate countermeasures to mitigate  it.   PS-07: Perform Privacy Audits during smart cars development and over back-end systems  on a regular basis, e.g. at least once year, in order to ensure compliance with privacy related  policies.  4.2.3 Asset Management  Hereinafter, security measures pertaining to assets discovery, monitoring, administration and  maintenance are outlined.   PS-08: Use tools supporting asset management that can automatically discover, identify and  enumerate assets specific to the organization and smart cars ecosystem.   PS-09: Ensure that the organization maintains a consistent and up-to-date asset inventory.  48 DevSecOps is short for Development, Security and Operations. It aims to implement security decisions and actions at the  same scale and speed as development and operations decisions and actions. See https://www.forcepoint.com/cyber- edu/devsecops  49 See SAE J3061 “Cybersecurity Guidebook for Cyber-Physical Vehicle Systems”:  https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j3061_201601/  https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j3061_201601/  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  29   PS-10: Introduce a new device or software change into the vehicle only according to an  established, accepted and communicated change management process.  4.2.4 Risk and Threat Management  This security domain gathers the security measures related to the process of risk and threat  management.   PS-11: Adopt an approach to risk management dedicated and suitable for automotive  sector, considering emerging threats and attack scenarios targeting smart cars.   PS-12: Perform a cybersecurity risk analysis from the very early stages of the design  process, and which should be revised at least annually and upon any major change or in  case of critical security vulnerability detection or critical security incident.   PS-13: Monitor security vulnerabilities with a focus on vehicles that are on the market on a  regular basis, e.g. every 6 months or more frequently based on risk assessment.   PS-14: Conduct security evaluations, such as penetration testing, during the development  phase and then, on a regular basis following an event driven approach, e.g. in the case of  new threats or vulnerabilities and after major updates.   PS-15: Consider establishing a threat intelligence process in order to be informed on  emerging attack types and sources as well as new relevant vulnerabilities.   PS-16: Regularly assess the security controls at least once a year overall smart cars  lifecycle, and deploy patches (after testing them) to mitigate vulnerabilities.   PS-17: Regularly check, at least every six months over smart cars lifecycle, that the security  assumptions (e.g. operational environment assumptions) are still valid. In particular,  consider defining procedure for communication and handling of end-of-life/out-of-warranty  status for cybersecurity.  4.3 ORGANISATIONAL PRACTICES  Organisational and governance processes are of utmost importance to ensure smart cars  security. In what follows, a set of organisational rules and best practices are detailed. They  cover several aspects such as relationships with suppliers, employees training, incident  management, etc.  4.3.1 Relationships with Suppliers   OP-01: Foster security-related information sharing between the different stakeholders while  protecting intellectual property.   OP-02: Define cybersecurity relevant aspects of the partnerships along the supply chain,  and develop security requirements and procurement guidelines for suppliers50.  4.3.2 Training and Awareness   OP-03: Share relevant information between all organisations, including subcontractors,  suppliers and third parties to enhance smart cars security, by following the examples of  existing Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) for instance.   OP-04: Adopt a holistic approach to security training and awareness among the employees,  including employees on all levels of the organization, as well as consider expanding it to  suppliers.   OP-05: Ensure that security trainings are continuous, regular and frequently updated.  50 The current draft of the ISO/SAE 21434 standard provide a Development Interface Agreement (DIA) template example  where for each work product, one can clearly mark each organisation as either responsible, approver, support, inform or  consult.  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  30   OP-06: Raise vehicle owners’, drivers’ and passengers’ awareness with respect to security  issues and how to prevent them, on a regular basis.  4.3.3 Security Management   OP-07: Consider establishing an OEM Security Operations Center (SOC) with clearly  defined roles, responsibilities and cybersecurity competences to centralize knowledge on  cybersecurity, monitor and anticipate potential threats.   OP-08: Designate one or several51 dedicated security team(s) with security specialists  having diversified and broad range of competencies in security related topics (e.g. risk  assessment, penetration testing, secure design, etc.).   OP-09: Define a dedicated Information Security Management System (ISMS)52 that covers  smart cars entire lifecycle.   OP-10: Consider defining an internal task force, which involves board-level management, to  guide security-related strategic decisions and facilitate accountability.  4.3.4 Incident Management   OP-11: OEMs and 3rd party suppliers should establish an incident handling process that  should be tested and revised at least annually and as soon as possible in the case of a  major change.   OP-12: OEMs and 3rd party suppliers should consider establishing a Product Security  Incident Response Team (PSIRT) and Computer Security Incident Response Team  (CSIRT)53. Each team would be dedicated to handling security incidents respectively related  to Products and Infrastructure and work along with the SOC if there is one.   OP-13: Report incidents to back-end servers to ensure that systems are secure over their  lifetime.   OP-14: Define and classify relevant cybersecurity incidents to enable the identification of the  most critical incidents and their prioritization, based on their potential impacts or broader  effect for instance.   OP-15: Consider establishing a secure and reliable process for detecting and handling  misbehaving ITS stations, e.g. revoke credentials of misbehaving ITS stations.  4.4 TECHNICAL PRACTICES  Besides to the policies and organisational practices listed above, a set of technical security  measures should be implemented to protect both smart cars and the associated back-end  systems. Hereinafter, we provide an overview of these technical practices which covers several  aspects such as software security, cloud security, detection, access control and so on.  4.4.1 Detection   TM-01: Deploy Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) both at vehicle and back-end levels to  enable the detection of malicious activities or policy violations.   TM-02: Maintain properly protected audit logs to prevent their disclosure to unauthorised  entities, while clearly defining their storage location and retaining period.  51 For large organisations, it may be considered to build several security teams to split the scope, for instance, by  separating corporate security policy, back-end systems and connectivity services, cars and embedded components  security.  52 “An ISMS consists of the policies, procedures, guidelines and associated resources and activities, collectively managed  by an organisation, in the pursuit of protecting its information assets.” See ISO 27000:  https://www.iso.org/fr/standard/73906.html  53 See for instance https://www.first.org/  https://www.iso.org/fr/standard/73906.html https://www.first.org/  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  31   TM-03: Consider periodically reviewing network logs, access control privileges and assets  configuration.   TM-04: Perform data validation to check the correctness of incoming information.   TM-05: Define appropriate forensics procedures to enable event reconstruction, facilitate  crash investigation, prevent similar attacks and/or for accountability purposes.  4.4.2 Protection of Networks and Protocols   TM-06: Protect remote monitoring and administration interfaces through mutual  authentication and access control mechanisms to prevent illegitimate access to smart cars  systems.   TM-07: Protect the integrity and authenticity of all critical in-vehicle internal communications.   TM-08: Protect the integrity and authenticity of all external communications between the  smart cars and all the different entities it is interacting with.   TM-09: Enforce session management policies for the different communication sessions (e.g.  administration, ) to avoid session hijacking.   TM-10: Timestamp all exchanged messages using reliable time sources (e.g. provided by  secure embedded component or coming from satellite system) to mitigate replay attacks.   TM-11: Manage radio frequencies and the frequency of beaconing54 and other repeated  messages in order to prevent Distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks.   TM-12: Implement frequency agility feature to prevent signals jamming, if applicable.   TM-13: Perform packet filtering at the different layers (e.g. ECU and sensors, mobile  network communications, etc.) to analyse incoming and outgoing packets and discard  illegitimate traffic.   TM-14: Provide end-to-end protection of sensitive data in terms of confidentiality and  integrity using secure protocols.  4.4.3 Software Security   TM-15: Secure the default configuration of devices and services and ensure that the most  secure operation mode of device (or service) is used by default.   TM-16: Ensure software authenticity and integrity before its installation, to ensure that only  legitimate software is used.   TM-17: Implement and document changes in configuration according to a change  management policy developed by the organisation based on risk analysis.   TM-18: Secure OTA firmware updates to avoid firmware manipulation, disclosure or rollback  to vulnerable versions.55   TM-19: Define a secure OTA update process.   TM-20: Implement secure boot processes that ensure systems integrity and authenticity. A  risk-based approach may be used to identify when secure boot is actually needed.   TM-21: Ensure that vulnerabilities and limitations of software dependencies, especially open  source libraries, are mitigated or addressed in a risk assessment.   TM-22: Protect mobile applications against reverse engineering (e.g. through code  obfuscation techniques) and against tampering of their binary code (e.g. by signing it).   TM-23: Securely store sensitive data (e.g. passwords) on mobile devices, and protect local  files created by the mobile application.  54 Beacons are messages exchanged periodically over vehicular networks to carry information such as location, heading,  and speed.  55 An example of secure OTA firmware update guidelines can be found in the Uptane project documentation  https://uptane.github.io/uptane-standard/uptane-standard.html  https://uptane.github.io/uptane-standard/uptane-standard.html  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  32  4.4.4 Cloud Security   TM-24: Cover security and availability aspects in agreements with cloud security providers, if  applicable.   TM-25: In the context of cloud-based application and centralised systems, ensure that single  points of failure are prevented.   TM-26: Operate critical systems and applications within the private56 or at least hybrid57  deployment models.   TM-27: Protect all data within the cloud and during transfer while ensuring that cloud  services providers do not have access to the decryption keys, so as to mitigate any potential  risk stemming from cloud attacks.  4.4.5 Cryptography   TM-28: Encrypt all sensitive, personal and private data to prevent its disclosure to  illegitimate entities. Moreover, authenticated encryption may be used to avoid the  manipulation of personal data while ensuring their confidentiality.   TM-29: Use well-known and standardized cryptographic schemes and protocols that are  widely considered as secure, and avoid the use of proprietary schemes.   TM-30: Use of storage encryption to protect both users’ data as well as data needed to  enforce smart cars security (e.g. used keys, security credentials, etc.).   TM-31: Implement a secure key management process. The process should cover all the  steps of key lifecycle: key length choice in relation with key lifetime, key generation using an  appropriate level of entropy from a reliable source, secure key storage, key rotation and  revocation, etc.   TM-32: Consider the use of dedicated and tamper resistant hardware security modules for  secure execution of cryptographic algorithms and secure key storage.  4.4.6 Access Control   TM-33: Apply security controls at back-end servers; covering policies, physical and logical  security aspects as well as the security of internal networks and data.   TM-34: Apply least privileges principle and use individual accounts to access devices and/or  systems.   TM-35: Segregate remote access by developing a set of rules for the control and monitoring  of remote communications.   TM-36: Allow and encourage the use of strong authentication mechanisms, e.g. Multi-Factor  Authentication (MFA), define an account lockout functionality, etc.  4.4.7 Self-Protection and Cyber Resilience   TM-37: Implement differential monitoring on the GNSS system, to ensure accurate  localisation data.   TM-38: Apply a hardening approach on the different level (i.e. devices, network, back-end,  etc.) to reduce the attack surface.  56 A private cloud refers to a cloud environment that is operated exclusively for a single organization.  57 A hybrid cloud combines both private  and public cloud that are bound together for better cost-effectiveness and to  provide more flexibility and control.  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  33   TM-39: Reinforce interfaces robustness, e.g. to cope with buffer overflows or fuzzing.   TM-40: Consider strengthening applications isolation at runtime, using trusted software  technologies.   TM-41: Apply system, sub-domain and network segregation using physical and logical  isolation techniques where appropriate (based on risk assessment).  4.4.8 (Semi-) Autonomous Systems Self Protection and Cyber Resilience   TM-42: Consider using inboard Inertial Navigation System (INS) or existing dead-reckoning  methods to get localisation data, even in case of GNSS failure.   TM-43: Protect critical autonomous sensors to prevent the different attacks aiming to alter  smart cars environment perception.   TM-44: Harden against Adversarial attacks, to prevent AI and ML components from being  tricked.   TM-45: Prevent data falsification or manipulation in regard to AI and ML.   TM-46: Use of data redundancy mechanisms (e.g. sensor data fusion) that correlate data  acquired from the different sensors in the vehicle and data obtained via V2X  communications before making a decision.   TM-47: Use of hardware redundancy mechanisms by adding extra hardware components  able to carry out the required operations and perform self-driving tasks.  4.4.9 Continuity of Operations   TM-48: Ensure that notifications are easy to understand, and help users find a remediation  or workaround.   TM-49: Create a Business Continuity Plan (BCP) and a Business Recovery Plan (BRP) that  cover third-party aspects and are periodically tested, at least annually, to ensure the  resilience of smart cars systems.   TM-50: Define important parameters for the business continuity of the organisation, e.g.  Recovery Time Objective (RTO), Maximum Tolerable Outage (MTO), etc.  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  34  5.

ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  54  ANNEX B: THREAT TAXONOMY  Annex B provides a brief description of the different threats subcategories mentioned in Figure  6, and maps each threat to the asset(s) that may potentially be affected.  Threat  Category  Threat Description Impacted Assets  Nefarious  activity/Abuse  Denial of Service  Smart cars and their infrastructure, may be  subject to Distributed Denial of Service  (DDoS) attacks, or even used to launch such  attacks.  DoS attacks may target (or originate from)  RSUs or the IT systems. An attacker may for  instance shut down the RSU (via physical  access or remotely), overload the system  with messages to process or even jam radio  communications, etc.  In-vehicle components can also be the target  of DoS attacks. For instance, overloading the  CAN bus with malicious messages will alter  the vehicle behaviour63.  All assets  Malware  These malicious software aim at performing  unwanted and illegitimate actions such as  disabling smart cars functions (e.g. prevent  car unlocking or immobilize the engine).  Malware can cause unexpected behaviours  of the smart car and even endanger  passengers’ safety. Common examples or  malwares are Ransomware64, viruses,  Trojan horses, Spyware65 and exploit kits.  All assets  Manipulation of  hardware and  software  This threat consists of unauthorized and  illegitimate alteration of a component  firmware, operations or configuration data by  an attacker (e.g. malicious OTA updates). An  attack might also access the binary file,  compromising the intellectual property. The  risk is emphasized when there are no  security measures (e.g. secure boot) to  protect the authenticity of critical hardware  and software components. An attacker may  also perform Man-in-the-middle attacks by  All assets  63 See “Hopping on the CAN Bus – Automotive Security and the CANard Toolkit”: https://www.blackhat.com/docs/asia- 15/materials/asia-15-Evenchick-Hopping-On-The-Can-Bus.pdf  64 See “DEFCON – Connected Car Security”: https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/defcon- connected-car-security/  65 See “Spatially Clustered Autonomous Vehicle Malware: Producing New Urban Geographies of Inequity”:  https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0361198118794057  https://www.blackhat.com/docs/asia-15/materials/asia-15-Evenchick-Hopping-On-The-Can-Bus.pdf https://www.blackhat.com/docs/asia-15/materials/asia-15-Evenchick-Hopping-On-The-Can-Bus.pdf https://www.blackhat.com/docs/asia-15/materials/asia-15-Evenchick-Hopping-On-The-Can-Bus.pdf https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/defcon-connected-car-security/ https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/defcon-connected-car-security/ https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0361198118794057  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  55  Threat  Category  Threat Description Impacted Assets  manipulating the hardware. Potential  consequences of this kind of threats may  include inappropriate smart cars behaviours.  Manipulation of  information  This threat consists of illegitimate and  unwanted data alteration by an attacker. To  this end, the attacker may use various  technical means such injecting fake Basic  Safety Message (BSM)66, performing map  data poisoning, faking security-related  information (e.g. keys, certificates, Certificate  Revocation List), tampering with RSU data or  OTA update exchanges, injection of packet  over CAN bus67, repudiation of actions (e.g.  deny eToll), loss of data (e.g. erase of  vehicle history),  etc.  Information manipulation threats may result  in inappropriate decisions that are based on  the altered/falsified data, and may also lead  to information or intellectual values  disclosure.  - Vehicle sensors  and actuators  - Decision making  algorithms  - Vehicle Functions  - Network and  Domain Isolation  Features  - Information  - In-vehicle  Communication  Networks  - In-vehicle  Communication  Components  - External  Communication  Components  - Servers, Systems  and Cloud  Computing  - Mobile Devices  - Humans  OEM Targeted  attacks  Cyberattacks targeting smart cars  manufactured by a specific OEM or its  backend systems during which the attackers  typically use several attack methods and  entry points to achieve their goals.

Outside vehicles, manufacturers may also be  confronted with garages using unauthorized  or unlicensed professional tools and  software. Unauthorised software may also be  installed by an attacker.  This threat also includes the notion of  cloning, for example when an attacker copies  the firmware of an existing device, in order to  commercialize it without authorization.  Identity theft  Impersonation attacks in which an adversary  successfully assumes the identity of one of  the legitimate parties in the system or in a  communication protocol. A common example  is to impersonate a key fob68 to steal the  associated car. This may, however, be  completed for other purposes, such as fraud,  for example if a user wants their car to  display another identity when communicating  with:  - road infrastructures such as toll systems,  thus leading to financial fraud;  - manufacturer backend46 (to get access to  paid services without subscription).  An attacker may also impersonate a police  car or ambulance in order to make other  vehicles slow down or pull over. Thus, the  attacker can reach his destination more  quickly.  All assets  Abuse of  authorizations  A disgruntled employee (backend services,  garage) may use their authorizations to  perform malicious actions (e.g. create  illegitimate user accounts, or add malicious  software into the system).  A slightly different scenario would be for an  infotainment application to abuse its  authorizations (for example, to mine private  data or perform surveillance activities).

GNSS spoofing71 attacks may also be  performed in an attempt to deceive a GNSS  receiver through the broadcast of incorrect  GNSS signals.  - Sensors for  autonomous vehicles  - Vehicle Functions  - Information  Threats against AI  and ML  Attacks may be carried out against AI and  ML features. For instance, the attacker may  perform adversarial perturbation72 in an  intent to hide objects, fool auto-controls (e.g.  radar/LIDAR confusion) and/or perceive fake  data (e.g. fake crash sound or ultrasonic  reflection73, magnetic attacks targeting  odometric sensors). An attacker may also  provide malicious inputs during the model  training phase in order to alter the  classification.  - Sensors for  autonomous vehicles  - Decision Making  algorithms  - Vehicle Functions  - Information  Physical  attack  Sabotage  Intentional tampering of a device by an  attacker with the aim to alter the proper  functioning of the vehicle, thus endangering  the safety of smart cars passengers and  roads users.

Remove unused services  or interfaces, integrate dedicated security  software, activate memory or control flow  protections. For devices that have a  complete operating system, several  measures can be considered to harden  the device, such as ASLR, non-  executable memory, process segregation  or sandboxing. Another measure is  removing unused tools, services and  libraries. Unnecessary services should  not be present on the device (typically  telnet must always be deactivated, but  even SSH or FTP can be deactivated in  many cases). This type of measures is  also applicable at a network level: the  device should not leave open ports,  especially ports that could be exposed via  plug-n-play protocols. The default  configuration of the device should be  based upon the most secure parameters,  and users should be warned if they have  the possibility to roll back to less secure  parameters.  • Nefarious activity / Abuse  • Failures/Malfunctions  • Hijacking  • Physical attacks  • Unintenational damages  -Cloud Security Alliance - Identity and Access Management for the  I+E68nternet of Things - Summary Guidance  -ENISA - Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  -GSMA (Global System for Mobile Communications) - GSMA CLP.12 IoT  Security Guidelines for IoT Service Ecosystems  -GSMA (Global System for Mobile Communications) - GSMA CLP.13 IoT  Security Guidelines for Endpoint Ecosystems  -IoT Security Foundation - Connected Consumer Products.

Taking stock of all existing standardization, legislative and policy  initiatives, this report aims to serve as a reference point to promote cybersecurity for smart cars  (connected and automated cars) across Europe and raise awareness on relevant threats and  risks with a focus on “cybersecurity for safety”.  The automotive industry is undergoing a paradigm change towards connected and autonomous  vehicles1. Smart cars already available today provide connected, added-value features in order  to enhance car users’ experience or improve car safety. With this increased connectivity (that  the emergence of 5G is expected to further promote) novel cybersecurity risks and threats arise  and need to be managed.  It is undeniable that there is a rapid pace when it comes to technological advancements in the  area of connected and autonomous cars. With the emergence of semi-autonomous and  autonomous cars, which make use of advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence  techniques, the potential risks and cybersecurity challenges increase. Moreover, Vehicle-to-  Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) interfaces needed for the deployment of  intelligent transport systems and autonomous cars, further exacerbate security risks since they  largely expand the potential attack surface and attack vectors.  With the increasing smart cars connectivity and the emergence of (semi)-autonomous cars,  novel cybersecurity challenges, risks and threats are arising. Attacks targeting smart cars may  lead to vehicle immobilization, road accidents, financial losses, disclosure of sensitive and/or  personal data, and even endanger road users’ safety. Thus, appropriate security measures  need to be implemented to mitigate the potential risks, especially as these attacks threaten the  security, safety and even the privacy of vehicle passengers and all other road users, including  pedestrians.  It is therefore important to analyse the relevant threats and cybersecurity risks pertaining to  smart cars and put forward security measures to address these risks taking into account the  particularities of this highly complex, heterogeneous and volatile environment.  Accordingly, this ENISA study provides the following information:   High level reference model of connected and autonomous vehicles.   Detailed asset and threat taxonomy for the connected and autonomous vehicles  ecosystem.   Concrete and actionable good practices to improve the cybersecurity posture of  connected and autonomous vehicles.   Mapping to existing legislative, standardization and policy initiatives to foster  harmonization.  1 See JRC 2019 Report 111477, Alonso Raposo M., Grosso, M., Després, J., Fernández Macías, E., Galassi, C.,  Krasenbrink, A., Krause, J., Levati, L., Mourtzouchou, A., Saveyn, B., Thiel, C. and Ciuffo, B.

INTRODUCTION  Over the last few years, the automotive industry has undergone a paradigm change towards  increasingly connected and autonomous cars. Smart cars available today are vehicles equipped  with systems providing connected and added-value features in order to enhance car users  experience and/or improve car safety. Within the next few years, smart cars’ connectivity is  expected to expand and smart cars will become connected to other vehicles, pedestrians and  their surrounding infrastructure through information exchanges via Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)  communications2. Semi-autonomous and autonomous cars (i.e. levels 4 and 5 of autonomy as  defined in SAE J30163), which make use of advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial  Intelligence (AI) techniques, are also emerging. Indeed, several smart cars stakeholders  (including car manufacturers, system suppliers, road operators and other providers) are already  carrying out trials of supervised autonomous vehicles, with a driver on board ready to take  control of the car if necessary.  In recent years, there has been a growing interest in autonomous cars both from end users and  manufacturers and deployment of smart cars has a growing rate in the automotive market45.  According to a survey of 5,500 global city dwellers from all around the world6, 58% of global  respondents are willing to take a ride in a driverless vehicle. Acceptance rates are higher in  emerging markets such as China (75%) and India (85%) than in European countries such as  United Kingdom (49%) and Germany (44%).  However, the European economy is expected to  benefit from autonomous vehicles7, as EU gathers 23% of global motor vehicle production.  Moreover, almost 72% of inland freight is transported by road in Europe, and trust in Original  Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) is strong. While optimistic predictions mention that fully  automated vehicles could be widely deployed by 20308, scientific experts are more cautious and  underline that further research is still required to build a fully autonomous vehicle, mostly in the  fields of AI and cybersecurity9.  Cybersecurity is a crucial aspect that will affect the evolution of smart cars. There have already  been several research publications on attacks targeting smart cars. One of the most known  attacks is the spectacular proof-of-concept remote attack10 where the researchers took control  of a vehicle and sent it off-the-road, thus leading to the recall of over a million cars. Lately, some  researchers also demonstrated that it was possible to locally or remotely take control of smart  2 See EC Communication “On the road to automated mobility: An EU strategy for mobility of the future”:  https://ec.europa.eu/transport/sites/transport/files/3rd-mobility-pack/com20180283_en.pdf, May 2018  3 See SAE J3016 “Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to Driving Automations Systems for On-Road Motor  Vehicles”: http://sae.org/standards/content/J3016_201806/  4 See JRC 2019 Report 111477, Alonso Raposo M., Grosso, M., Després, J., Fernández Macías, E., Galassi, C.,  Krasenbrink, A., Krause, J., Levati, L., Mourtzouchou, A., Saveyn, B., Thiel, C. and Ciuffo, B.

Moreover, security specialists succeeded to hijack cars using their smart alarm, thereby  illegitimately performing actions such as enabling/disabling the immobilizer or cutting the  engine12. Towards the objective to provide a generic development and evaluation environment  for vehicle cybersecurity technologies, an open-source testing platform called PASTA13  (Portable Automotive Security Testbed with Adaptability) was recently released; it simulates the  remote operations of vehicle wheels, brakes, windows, and other features to learn more about  the electronic communications features  and find vulnerabilities as well as test exploits.  However, such a platform may also be used by an attacker, thus facilitating their tasks.  With the increasing smart cars connectivity and the emergence of (semi)-autonomous cars,  novel cybersecurity challenges, risks and threats are arising. For instance, there have been  some experimental remote attacks14,15 on autonomous cars’ cameras and Light Detection and  Ranging (LiDAR) systems showing effective camera blinding, making real objects appear further  than their actual locations or even creating fake objects. In addition to malicious sensor  manipulations, other attack vectors have been practically demonstrated such as Global  Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) spoofing16 and fooling AI-based functions17 with the  famous example of trapping a self-driving car by just drawing a chalk circle around the vehicle.  Attacks targeting smart cars may lead to vehicle immobilization, road accidents, financial losses,  disclosure of sensitive and/or personal data, and even endanger road users’ safety. Thus,  appropriate security measures need to be implemented to mitigate the potential risks, especially  as these attacks threaten the security, safety and even the privacy of vehicle passengers and all  other road users, including pedestrians.  1.1 OBJECTIVES  This ENISA study aims at addressing the security and privacy challenges related to the  evolution of smart cars. The main objectives were to collect good practices to ensure the  security of smart cars, while mapping the relevant security and privacy challenges, threats, risks  and attack scenarios.  More specifically, the aim of this study is to identify the good practices in order to ensure smart  cars security against cyber threats, while focusing on V2X communications and (semi-)  autonomous cars18. Towards this end, the following objectives have been set:   Analyse smart cars architecture and define a high-level reference model   Identify smart cars sensitive assets   Identify potential and main cyber threats, risks and attack scenarios targeting smart cars   Map identified threats to assets   Identify relevant security measures based on the threats and assets, and map the identified  security measures to the relevant threat(s).  11 See “Experimental security assessment of BMW cars: A summary report”:  https://keenlab.tencent.com/en/whitepapers/Experimental_Security_Assessment_of_BMW_Cars_by_KeenLab.pdf  12 See “Hacking smart car alarm systems”: https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/hacking-smart-car-alarm-systems/26014/  13 See “PASTA: Portable Automotive Security Testbed with Adaptability”: https://i.blackhat.com/eu-18/Wed-Dec-5/eu-18- Toyama-PASTA-Portable-Automotive-Security-Testbed-with-Adaptability-wp.pdf  14 See “Remote attacks on Automated Vehicles Sensors: Experiments on Camera and LiDAR”:  https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e06f/ef73f5bad0489bb033f490d41a046f61878a.pdf  15 See “Self-driving and connected cars: fooling sensors and tracking drivers”: https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu- 15/materials/eu-15-Petit-Self-Driving-And-Connected-Cars-Fooling-Sensors-And-Tracking-Drivers.pdf  16 See “All Your GPS Are Belong To Us: Towards Stealthy Manipulation of Road Navigation Systems”:  https://www.usenix.org/node/217477  17 See “Meet the Artist Using Ritual Magic to Trap Self-Driving Cars”: https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ywwba5/meet-the- artist-using-ritual-magic-to-trap-self-driving-cars  18 See SAE J3016 “Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to Driving Automations Systems for On-Road Motor  Vehicles”: http://sae.org/standards/content/J3016_201806/  https://keenlab.tencent.com/en/whitepapers/Experimental_Security_Assessment_of_BMW_Cars_by_KeenLab.pdf https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/hacking-smart-car-alarm-systems/26014/ https://i.blackhat.com/eu-18/Wed-Dec-5/eu-18-Toyama-PASTA-Portable-Automotive-Security-Testbed-with-Adaptability-wp.pdf https://i.blackhat.com/eu-18/Wed-Dec-5/eu-18-Toyama-PASTA-Portable-Automotive-Security-Testbed-with-Adaptability-wp.pdf https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e06f/ef73f5bad0489bb033f490d41a046f61878a.pdf https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu-15/materials/eu-15-Petit-Self-Driving-And-Connected-Cars-Fooling-Sensors-And-Tracking-Drivers.pdf https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu-15/materials/eu-15-Petit-Self-Driving-And-Connected-Cars-Fooling-Sensors-And-Tracking-Drivers.pdf https://www.usenix.org/node/217477 https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ywwba5/meet-the-artist-using-ritual-magic-to-trap-self-driving-cars https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ywwba5/meet-the-artist-using-ritual-magic-to-trap-self-driving-cars http://sae.org/standards/content/J3016_201806/  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  8  This ENISA study aims to serve as a reference point to promote collaborative automotive  cybersecurity across the European Union and raise awareness of the relevant threats and risks  with a focus on “security for safety”.  1.2 SCOPE  This ENISA study outlines good practices for the security of smart cars. It is building on the  previous ENISA study on smart cars entitled “Cyber Security and Resilience of Smart Cars”19  and mainly focuses on V2X communications and (semi-)autonomous cars20 as these  technologies were not previously considered.  During this study, ENISA identified available documentation and standards on smart cars cyber  security, with a focus on connected and autonomous cars. ENISA also collected inputs from a  number of automotive security experts through a structured questionnaire and a series of  interviews. Following a thorough analysis of the identified material and the review of security  experts feedbacks, ENISA identified the main assets and threats targeting smart cars. Based on  these threats, a set of security measures and good practices were defined to ensure smart cars  security.  The study highlights three groups of security measures to address security challenges in terms  of technologies, policies and processes. A risk-based and holistic approach to security was  undertaken. ENISA considered the cybersecurity of smart cars throughout their lifecycle (from  conception to end-of-life) and addressed all the essential elements of automotive cybersecurity.  Particular attention was paid to the overall supply chain while considering the different  stakeholders involved in the smart cars manufacturing (i.e. OEM, software and hardware  components providers, etc.).  1.3 EU AND INTERNATIONAL POLICY CONTEXT  The various attacks on smart cars10,16,17,21,22,23,24 that were publicly reported over the last few  years led to a relatively quick awareness of the automotive industry of the security needs and  the development of several cybersecurity regulations and initiatives aiming to ensure properly  secure vehicles, as presented below.   EU Policy:  o Early 2014, the Commission's Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport (DG  MOVE) set up a C-ITS deployment platform. This latter was  conceived as a cooperative  framework including national authorities, Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-  ITS) stakeholders and the European Commission with the objective to identify and agree  on how to ensure interoperability of C-ITS across borders and along the whole value  chain, as well as to identify the most likely and suitable deployment scenario(s).  o In 2017, the Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and  Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) (DG GROW) launched an initiative on  safety regulations with the aim to contribute to a further decrease of the number of road  fatalities and injuries considering amendments to the General Safety Regulation and the  Pedestrian Safety Regulation.  19 See ENISA (2016) “Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars – Good practices and recommendations”:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-security-and-resilience-of-smart-cars  20 See SAE J3016 “Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to Driving Automations Systems for On-Road Motor  Vehicles”: http://sae.org/standards/content/J3016_201806/  21 See “Remote Attacks on Automated Vehicles Sensors: Experiments on Camera and LiDAR”:  https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e06f/ef73f5bad0489bb033f490d41a046f61878a.pdf  22 See “Illusion and Dazzle: Adversarial Optical Channel Exploits against Lidars for Automotive Applications”:  https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/613.pdf  23 See “Fast and Vulnerable: A Story of Telematic Failures”:  https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/woot15/woot15-paper-foster.pdf  24 See “Robust Physical-World Attacks on Deep Learning Visual Classification”: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.08945.pdf  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-security-and-resilience-of-smart-cars http://sae.org/standards/content/J3016_201806/ https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/613.pdf https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/613.pdf  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  9  o In 2018, the Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and  Technology (DG CONNECT) launched an initiative on Cooperative, Connected and  Automated Mobility (CCAM) with the aim to:   provide further guidance on a governance framework for access and sharing of data  generated by connected vehicles   clarify cybersecurity requirements for the connected car environment   provide guidance on the use of pioneer spectrum for 5G connectivity for large scale  testing and experimentation for connected vehicles  o In 2019, the European Commission has set up an informal group of a hundred experts  named “the Single Platform for open road testing and pre-deployment of cooperative,  connected, automated and autonomous mobility” in order to provide advice and support  regarding testing and pre-deployment activities for CCAM25.  o The protection of road users’ privacy and personal information is also addressed by the  recent EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)26 which officially went into effect  in May 2018.  o The Network and Information Security directive (NIS)27 also addresses autonomous  vehicles’ cybersecurity issues as it intends to provide generic security measures in order  to enhance cybersecurity across EU.   International Context:  o The European OEMs published a set of cybersecurity principles, through the ACEA  Principles of Automobile Cybersecurity28, which are already implemented by OEM  companies.  o The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) from the U.S. government  issued in late 2016 a document introducing several cybersecurity best practices for smart  cars29.  o The US Automotive Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Auto-ISAC) has been  maintaining since 2016 a series of Automotive Cybersecurity Best Practices30 which  provide guidance on the implementation of automotive cybersecurity principles.  o Several cybersecurity standards and recommendation documents are also under  development. In particular, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe  (UNECE) is currently drafting a proposal for a recommendation on Cyber Security31 with  a focus on key cyber threats and vulnerabilities against vehicles as well as measures to  be considered in order to mitigate the identified threats. UNECE is also introducing a  United Nations regulation on cybersecurity which defines a set of requirements that shall  be fulfilled by vehicle manufacturers, suppliers and service providers, covering the entire  vehicle lifecycle (i.e. from the vehicle development to its decommissioning).  25 See “European Commission Launches CCAM Single Platform”:  https://connectedautomateddriving.eu/mediaroom/european-commission-launches-ccam-single-platform/  26 See EU “General Data Protection Regulation”: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679  27 See Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 concerning measures for a  high common level of security of network and information systems across the Union”: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN  28 See ACEA “https://www.acea.be/publications/article/acea-principles-of-automobile-cybersecurity”  29 See NHTSA “Cybesecurity best practices for modern vehicles”:  https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=2ahUKEwji2PqR0cDjAhXq2eAKHcnrAnUQFj AAegQIAxAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nhtsa.gov%2Fstaticfiles%2Fnvs%2Fpdf%2F812333_CybersecurityForModernV ehicles.pdf&usg=AOvVaw33nVAk2UWXpL3tzDmpRBjl  30 See Auto-ISAC “Automotive Cybersecurity Best Practices – Executive summary”: https://www.automotiveisac.com/best- practices/  31 See current draft of the UNECE “Proposal for Recommendation on Cyber Security”:  https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/doc/2019/wp29grva/ECE-TRANS-WP29-GRVA-2019-02e.pdf  https://connectedautomateddriving.eu/mediaroom/european-commission-launches-ccam-single-platform/ https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN https://www.acea.be/publications/article/acea-principles-of-automobile-cybersecurity https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=2ahUKEwji2PqR0cDjAhXq2eAKHcnrAnUQFjAAegQIAxAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nhtsa.gov%2Fstaticfiles%2Fnvs%2Fpdf%2F812333_CybersecurityForModernVehicles.pdf&usg=AOvVaw33nVAk2UWXpL3tzDmpRBjl https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=2ahUKEwji2PqR0cDjAhXq2eAKHcnrAnUQFjAAegQIAxAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nhtsa.gov%2Fstaticfiles%2Fnvs%2Fpdf%2F812333_CybersecurityForModernVehicles.pdf&usg=AOvVaw33nVAk2UWXpL3tzDmpRBjl https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=2ahUKEwji2PqR0cDjAhXq2eAKHcnrAnUQFjAAegQIAxAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nhtsa.gov%2Fstaticfiles%2Fnvs%2Fpdf%2F812333_CybersecurityForModernVehicles.pdf&usg=AOvVaw33nVAk2UWXpL3tzDmpRBjl https://www.automotiveisac.com/best-practices/ https://www.automotiveisac.com/best-practices/ https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/doc/2019/wp29grva/ECE-TRANS-WP29-GRVA-2019-02e.pdf  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  10   Standards:  o The British Standards Institution (BSI) Group published in December 2018 two Publicly  Available Specifications (PAS), namely PAS 188532 and PAS 1128133. The former, which  is entitled “The fundamental principles of automotive cyber security”, provides high-level  guidance to provide and maintain cybersecurity. As regards to PAS 11281, entitled  “Connected automotive ecosystems – Impact of security on safety – Code of practice”, it  provides recommendations for managing security risks in a connected automotive  ecosystem.  o The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) has been developing a  set of technical specifications, ETSI TS 102 940 to 102 943 34, which define an Intelligent  Transport System (ITS) security architecture along with services specification to ensure  information confidentiality and prevent unauthorized access to ITS services. They also  address the trust and privacy management for ITS communications.  o The standard of Society of Automotive Engineers SAE J306135, officially published in  January 2016, is considered as the first standard addressing automotive cybersecurity. It  provides a set of high-level cybersecurity principles and guidance for cyber-physical  vehicle systems.  o The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and SAE collaborated to  supersede the SAE J3061 recommended practice and propose the ISO/SAE 2143436.  This standard is also under development and focuses on automotive cybersecurity  engineering by specifying requirements and providing recommendations for  cybersecurity risk management for cars (including their components, software and  interfaces) all along their entire lifecycle. Concurrently, the SAE is working on another  document, SAE J3101, which aims to define common requirements for security to be  implemented in hardware for ground vehicles.  In 2016, ENISA performed a study on smart cars security issues which resulted in a document  entitled “Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars”37. It has also established the Cars and  Roads SECurity (CaRSEC) working group which addresses smart cars cybersecurity threats,  challenges and solutions so as to protect road users’ safety. CaRSEC group members are car  manufacturers with focus on cybersecurity, suppliers and developers of embedded  hardware/software for smart cars, road authorities and academia, as well as standardisation  bodies and policy makers.  1.4 TARGET AUDIENCE  This study provides a set of good practices and security measures to improve smart cars  security and mitigate the potential threats and risks. Therefore, similarly to the previous ENISA  smart cars study, the target audience of this study is mainly:   Car manufacturers: also referred to as OEMs, they design new cars and handle the  assembly of the various car components. In particular, most of the various car components  are not produced by the car manufacturer itself, but rather by their suppliers according to a  set of functional, safety and security requirements defined by the car manufacturers.  32 See “PAS 1885:2018 - The fundamental principles of automotive cyber security.

Tier 1 refers to the entities having direct contractual  relationships with the car manufacturers, whereas Tier 2 refers to the entities having  contractual relationships with Tier 1 suppliers. For instance, car seats are manufactured by  Tier 1 suppliers whilst electronic components or software are usually provided by Tier 2  suppliers.   Aftermarket suppliers: provide added-value aftermarket products, such as smart dongles  or third-party GNSS systems, which can be bought by customers and connected to the car  to provide additional features.  1.5 METHODOLOGY  ENISA has developed this study following a five-step methodological approach as depicted in  Figure 1.  Figure 1: Methodology  1. Project scope definition: the first step consisted in establishing the scope of the  project and identifying the main topics to be considered during the study.  2. Desktop research and experts’ identification: extensive research of relevant  documents to gather as much information as possible about (semi-)autonomous cars  and V2X communication technologies. The identified documents and standards were  used as references for the development of this report. During this step, subject matter  experts were also invited to validate scope and provide feedback. Experts from car  manufacturers, tier-1 and tier-2 suppliers as well as other organisations, such as  Government Authorities and ITS system suppliers were invited. Additionally, experts  from ENISA’s CaRSEC38 informal expert group were also invited to contribute.  3. Questionnaire and interviews with identified experts: ENISA got in touch with the  identified experts in order to get their point of view. To this end, a structured  38 See https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/carsec-expert-group for more information on the terms of reference and scope of  the ENISA CarSEC Informal Expert Group.  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/carsec-expert-group  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  12  questionnaire covering various security aspects, such as critical assets, key threats  targeting smart cars and awareness with respect to smart cars standards and  guidelines, was developed. The questionnaire was completed by some of the identified  experts, and interviews were conducted to collect additional valuable inputs to prepare  the report.  4. Analysis of collected material and report development: all the collected  information, either through desktop research or directly from the identified experts, was  thoroughly analysed. This led to the development of the first draft of this report.  5. Review and report validation: ENISA shared the draft of the report with its relevant  stakeholder communities and reference groups for review. Taking into account the  stakeholders feedbacks, the proposed final version of the report was issued and a  validation face-to-face workshop was organized to present the results of the study.  1.6 STRUCTURE OF THE DOCUMENT  The study is structured as follows:   Chapter 1 – Introduction: provides introductory information on the objectives, scope,  relevant EU and international policies, target audience, followed methodology and the  structure of this study.   Chapter 2 – Smart cars: Connected and (semi-)autonomous cars: first defines V2X  communications, semi-autonomous and autonomous cars. Then, it provides a high-level  reference architecture of smart cars and lists the sensitive assets to be protected.   Chapter 3 – Threats and risk analysis: identifies the main threats against smart cars and  indicates the affected assets. Some examples of significant smart cars attack scenarios are  also detailed.   Chapter 4 – Security measures and good practices: describes the security measures  and good practices to mitigate the aforementioned attacks.  Further details are provided in the appendix:   Annex A – Asset Taxonomy: presents the different assets and provides a brief description  of them   Annex B – Threat Taxonomy: provides a brief description of the different threats and maps  each threat to the asset(s) that may potentially be affected   Annex C – Mapping of security measures to threats, standard and good practices:  details the security measures mentioned in chapter 4 and maps them to the corresponding  threats.  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  13  2. SMART CARS: CONNECTED  AND (SEMI-) AUTONOMOUS CARS  2.1 DEFINITIONS  The SAE J301639 standard defines six levels of driving automation for on-road vehicles, ranging  from level 0 with no driving automation at all to level 5 with full driving automation and no need  for a driver, as shown in Figure 2.  Figure 2: SAE vehicles automation levels as defined in SAE J3016  Even though the provided recommendations and good practices can apply to all vehicles (i.e.  no matter their automation level), this study focuses on semi-autonomous and autonomous  cars, which are also referred to as Automated Driving System-Dedicated Vehicle (ADS-DS) in  SAE J3016 standard, as well as on V2X communications, defined as follows:   Semi-autonomous cars (level 4 of automation): refers to highly automated cars that are  equipped with a multitude of sensors in order to be able to autonomously (i.e. without any  human driver intervention) perform all driving functions under certain conditions (e.g. on a  given type of roads).   Autonomous cars (level 5 of automation): refers to fully automated cars that are  equipped with a multitude of sensors in order to be able to autonomously perform all driving  functions under all conditions (i.e. at any time and on any road). Those cars may not even  include a steering wheel or accelerator/brake pedals.   V2X communications: refers to data exchanges between a vehicle and any other entity  (e.g. a road infrastructure, another vehicle, a pedestrian, etc.). It covers the notions of V2V  (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) communications and V2I (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure) communications. In  this study, the term V2I refers to all communications between the vehicle and its  39 See SAE J3016 “Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to Driving Automations Systems for On-Road Motor  Vehicles”: http://sae.org/standards/content/J3016_201806/  http://sae.org/standards/content/J3016_201806/  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  14  surrounding, aside from V2V communications. Thus, V2I includes V2P (Vehicle-to-  Pedestrian) and V2N (Vehicle-to-Network) communications. To enable V2X  communications, vehicles are equipped with different wireless communication systems such  as Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC40), Visible Light Communication (VLC),  Image Sensor Communication (ISC), Wi-Fi or mobile communication technologies, such as  3G, 4G and 5G. This study is meant to be agnostic about the communication technologies  actually used.  Figure 3 gives an overview of the smart car ecosystem depicting systems and application both  in-vehicle 41 and outside the car.  Figure 3: Smart cars ecosystem  In this study, we focus on smart cars that, as connected systems, have the necessary  capabilities to autonomously perform all driving functions under certain (or all) conditions, and  are able to communicate with their surroundings including other vehicles, pedestrians and  Road-Side Units (RSU).  Good practices discussed in this report do not only concern passenger cars but also commercial  vehicles (e.g. buses, coaches, etc.), including self-driving ride-sharing vehicles which can be  40 In this document, DSRC refers to the standards from the European Committee for Standardization EN 12253:2004 and  EN 12795:2002  41 In-vehicle refers to assets inside the vehicle  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  15  shared with other users. This study does not focus on specific use cases such as connected  infotainment and specific intra-vehicular communications.  To achieve enhanced autonomous driving capabilities, smart cars rely on various technologies  including:   Sensors and Actuators: devices that have various capabilities, such as sensing and  detecting objects, actuating, etc.   Artificial Intelligence: algorithms that enable ECUs and computers to perform tasks  typically associated with intelligent human beings.   Machine Learning: algorithms that enable computers to act and enhance their ability to  predict events or situations.   Cloud Computing: solutions enabling access to shared sets of resources such as servers  and applications with minimal requirements concerning managerial effort and service  provider interaction.   Communications and/or Networks: radio technologies and communication protocols that  allow data exchange between different entities.  2.2 HIGH-LEVEL REFERENCE MODEL  Smart cars and especially (semi-)autonomous cars, which include several ECUs and  components, may seem unduly complicated at first glance. Although smart cars functions (e.g.  braking, steering, door locking, etc.) are the same throughout vehicles, nevertheless each OEM  has its own in-vehicle architecture and there is no common and unique architecture that can be  used as a reference model. Figure 4 presents the high-level functional model that ENISA  Figure 4: High-Level Smart Cars Reference Model  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  16  defined for the study based on an extensive review of relevant efforts and having validated it  with the experts. The model’s aim is to provide a generic overview of the smart cars  technologies and their interplay. It needs to be noted that the model is only indicative and does  not reflect the complexity of the various automotive architectures; it aims at encapsulating the  main elements of the latter in a high-level view.  This model provides a general overview of the  different functionalities, used technologies and most important components providing smart cars  major features.  The high-level reference model consists of four layers arranged in order, with the three lowest  layers being part of the smart car, whereas the upper layer represents components that are  outside the actual containment of the car, but which are part of its environment such as RSUs  and map servers for instance. In addition to the components and technologies depicted in  Figure 4, smart cars also include critical functions (e.g. acceleration, braking, object detection,  navigation, etc.) that ought to be protected against cyberattacks. Indeed, altering the operations  of those functions may lead to unexpected situations (e.g. vehicle collision or crash) that could  endanger road users’ safety.  Hereinafter, we provide a brief description of the different layers:   Car sensors and actuators: the lowest layer of the architecture comprises the various  smart cars sensors used to monitor the driving environment by collecting data on the vehicle  surroundings, such as road conditions, distance to other objects and vehicles, Global  Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) positions, as well as the different actuators that  execute the necessary actions.   Car ECUs, processing and decision making components: this layer comprises all the  hardware and software components, including AI, that are used for the processing of the  data received from layer Car sensors and actuators (i.e. data collected by the smart cars  sensors) and In-vehicle communication components (e.g. data received from other C-ITS  stations), as well taking the appropriate decision and transmitting it to the relevant actuator.   In-vehicle communication components: this layer includes the different in-vehicle  communication components used for both in-vehicle communications (e.g. Head-Unit which  is also referred to as In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI), or in-vehicle gateway) as well as  communications with external components such as other vehicles or RSUs.  2.3 SMART CARS INFRASTRUCTURE AND BACKEND SYSTEMS:  This layer comprises the different external communication components (e.g. RSU, traffic signs)  or systems (e.g. other vehicles, access points, pedestrian smartphone) that communicate  directly with the smart cars, as well as servers and systems that remotely provide services to  smart cars. It includes, amongst others, OEM back-end systems used for over-the-air (OTA)  updates, map data servers and third party service provider’s systems.assets taxonomy.  To address smart cars cybersecurity issues, it is essential to identify assets of such a complex  ecosystem. A taxonomy of the key assets that should be protected in order to ensure highly  secure vehicles is depicted in Figure 5, and a brief description of the different assets is provided  in Annex A. Especially, smart cars functions (e.g. obstacle detection) are of utmost importance  as they directly influence smart cars behaviours and may endanger passengers’ safety. These  functions are at the crossroads between different technologies from sensors to AI-based  algorithms by way of infrastructure components, listed in the asset taxonomy. This highlights  that securing smart cars requires a multidisciplinary approach, as assets domains are quite  diversified.

THREATS AND ATTACK SCENARIOS  3.1 THREATS TAXONOMY  Smart cars increased connectivity and automation expose them to several crucial cyber threats.  Those threats may directly target smart cars or their surroundings such as RSUs, traffic  signs/lights or even remote servers of the OEM or third-party service providers.  In accordance with the ENISA Threat Taxonomy42, we have developed a threat taxonomy43  focused on smart cars as depicted in Figure 6. Annex C provides a description of the different  threats and identifies the assets that may be affected by each threat.  42 See “ENISA Threat Taxonomy” (2016): https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and- trends/enisa-threat-landscape/threat-taxonomy/view  43 It is a snapshot of today’s threats and may not be up-to-date in the future.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/enisa-threat-landscape/threat-taxonomy/view https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/enisa-threat-landscape/threat-taxonomy/view  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  19  Figure 6: Threat taxonomy  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  20  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  21  3.2 EXAMPLES OF SMART CARS CYBER SECURITY ATTACK  SCENARIOS  During the interviews, automotive experts assessed the criticality of several attack scenarios  based on their potential impacts and the aforementioned threats, so as to enable the  identification of critical attack scenarios. For each attack scenario, experts were asked to  indicate whether they consider its potential impact (i.e. severity level) as high, medium or low.  Table 1 depicts the different attack scenarios along with the interviewees’ perceived severity  level.  Table 1: Smart cars attack scenarios  ATTACK SCENARIOS SEVERITY44  1. Vulnerability exploit in a communication stack: exploitation of a vulnerability  in a communication stack of an in-vehicle network (e.g. no protection mechanism  against replay attacks, lack of authentication, etc.) can lead to severe issues such as  critical ECU reprogramming and taking control the vehicle over the Controller Area  Network (CAN bus).  High  2. Mobile car application45 being hacked/attacked allowing access to the car:  by hacking the mobile application, an attacker could order a car to drive him  somewhere although he is not allowed to do so.  High  3. Attack on remote servers to influence car behaviours: several attack  scenarios exist regarding remote servers. For instance, an attacker could  compromise map data with the aim to affect plausibility checks, or even alter data on  traffic conditions to change the current car itinerary resulting in an inefficient service.  High  4. Fake communication unit to compromise telematics unit and deploy rogue  firmware: use of malicious communication unit, such as Base Transceiver Station  (BTS), Wi-Fi router, RSU, with the objective to spread a malware or just disrupting  the infrastructure communications.  High  5. Large scale deployment of rogue firmware after hacking OEM back-end  servers: penetration of OEM back-end servers with the aim to initiate malicious  firmware updates could lead to devastating results as this kind of attacks is highly-  scalable.  High  6. Hacking an RSU with the aim to spread wrong traffic and safety  messages: as RSUs constitute an important part of the autonomous vehicles’  ecosystem, they could be the target of hackers in order to create traffic jams or other  kind of disruptions.  High – Medium  7. Rogue vehicle sending wrong information through V2V interfaces: vehicles  unknown from the infrastructure (e.g. counterfeit cars) that are deployed to decrease  the safety level by sending wrong information about traffic conditions and other  functionalities (i.e. fake information with the aim to update map data).  Medium  44 This severity is a global perception of the risk based on interviews. In practice, it varies strongly depending on the actual  architecture of each smart car.  45 Mobile application that provides value added services with respect to the car (e.g. mobile application that enables to  unlock the car, start the engine, etc.)  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  22  8. Sensor fooling by adversarial perturbation: attack scenarios to disrupt the  sensors’ proper functioning by different means depending on the targeted sensor  (e.g. flash the camera, relay the light waves from the LiDAR).  Medium – Low  9. Communication jamming: producing radio interferences to disrupt wireless  networks so the vehicles cannot emit or receive V2X messages.  Low  10. GNSS spoofing: by replacing GNSS signals, an attacker can fool a third-party  service into thinking that the vehicle is elsewhere in either time or location. This can  lead to accident or vehicle theft.  Medium  11. Blocking critical messages at automation level 4: an attacker can block  critical messages, such as Denial of a Service (DoS) attack, and prevent the semi-  autonomous vehicle (or driver) from reacting appropriately to the situation (e.g. apply  the brakes, warn the driver that he needs to take control of the vehicle, etc.).  High  Hereinafter, we detail three types of attack scenarios encompassing various use-cases. The first  attack scenario (Large scale deployment of a rogue firmware after hacking OEM back-end  servers) is typical of the threats lying over connected cars. The second one (Hacking/altering  a V2X mobile application that allows access to the car) is extracted from V2X use-cases.  The third one (Sensor fooling by adversarial perturbation) is more related to (semi-  )autonomous features. These three attack scenarios were selected so as to represent different  families of attacks linked with connected cars and automation levels 4 & 5, which are the focus  of this study. The impact is an overall estimation based on the outcome of the interviews.  Attack scenario 1: Large scale deployment of a rogue firmware after hacking OEM back-end servers  DESCRIPTION  This attack scenario refers to deployment of malicious firmware from back-end  servers. This could be initiated by OEMs employees (e.g. developers) or by external  attackers capable of penetrating back-end servers. Malicious OTA updates could  then be executed so that autonomous vehicles think it is a legitimate one, as it is  initiated from a trusted server.  IMPACT  High – Crucial: Remote servers might communicate with numerous vehicles at the  same time. Thus, compromising such a centralised server could affect the entire  ecosystem, including passengers’ safety.  EASE OF DETECTION CASCADE EFFECT RISK  Medium: Remote servers should have enough  resources to implement advanced monitoring  techniques. However, the deployment of many  remote servers increases the attack surface to be  protected.  High: Such attacks are  highly-scalable as they  can be executed  remotely and affect a  fleet of vehicles instantly.  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  23  ASSETS AFFECTED  STAKEHOLDERS  INVOLVED  Back-end system  Software and Licenses  OTA Updates  Vehicle functions  Information (User, Device, Keys  and Certificates)  OEMs  ATTACK STEPS  1. To perform this attack scenario, the attacker needs first to penetrate the  targeted OEM back-end server. This may be carried out by leveraging a  known vulnerability of used software, a misconfiguration on the server side  or by spoofing the administrator account for instance.  2. Once the attacker gets access to the OEM back-end server, the attacker can  request the execution of an OTA firmware update for a given fleet of  vehicles. To this end, he follows the same steps required to perform a  legitimate OTA firmware update.  3. Upon receiving the OTA update request, vehicles acknowledge and accept  the request as it is initiated by a legitimate OEM server.  4. Next, the attacker uploads a rogue firmware on the OEM back-end server  and launches the OTA update process to deploy this firmware.  5. Once the rogue firmware is installed on smart cars, the attacker can take  remote control of a fleet of vehicles by exploiting a backdoor introduced in  the rogue firmware.  RECOVERY TIME / EFFORT  GAPS AND  CHALLENGES  Medium – High: Depending on the nature of  the deployed firmware, cancelling the update  by returning back to the retro version can be  challenging if the attacker was able to change  update related information (e.g. certificates,  policies). Use of logging can help to identify  the attack origin.  Lack of awareness and knowledge  Lack of a secure boot process  Lack of proper product lifecycle  management  COUNTERMEASURES  1. Regularly assess the security controls and patch vulnerabilities.  2. Deploy Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) at vehicle and back-end levels.  3. Introduce a new device or software change into the vehicle only according to  an established, accepted and communicated change management process.  4. Consider establishing a CSIRT.  5. Apply security controls at back-end servers.  6. Establish an incident handling process.  7. Incident report to back-end servers.  8. Conduct periodic reviews, of authorization and access control privileges for  instance.  9. Software authenticity and integrity checked before installation.  10. Use of secure OTA firmware updates.  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  24  11. Protect OTA update process.  12. Use of secure boot mechanisms.  13. Application of security controls to back-end servers.  14. Apply least privileges principle and use individual accounts to access  devices and systems.  15. Maintain properly protected audit logs.  16. Allow and encourage the use of strong authentication mechanisms.  Attack scenario 2: Hacking/altering a V2X mobile application that allows access to the car  DESCRIPTION  IMPACT  High: Such attacks can result in illegitimate access to the smart car or even its theft  through the compromise or hacking of a V2X mobile application.  EASE OF DETECTION CASCADE EFFECT RISK  Medium: Individual should pay  attention to the different  applications installed on their  smartphone (e.g. avoid installing  suspicious applications).  Medium: This attack scenario  target individuals and allows  compromising many vehicles at  once using V2X application  ASSETS AFFECTED STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED  Mobile application  User information  Keys and certificates  Mobile devices (smartphones and  Tablets)  OEMs  Third-party service providers  ATTACK STEPS (SAMPLE BASED ON A REAL-CASE ATTACK SCENARIO)  1. The attacker manages to retrieve user’s credentials associated to a V2X  application (e.g. car, traffic or platooning application) by one of the following  means: by making the honest user install a fake application instead of the real  one, via a phishing attack, or by leveraging an existing or a new discovered  vulnerability in the V2X application.  2. Once the attacker has retrieved the user’s credentials, he installs the legitimate  V2X application and uses stolen credentials to login successfully; thus  impersonating the honest user.  3. Finally, the attacker can use the V2X application to get access to the smart car,  and potentially steal the smart car if keyless driving is allowed and the hacked  application enables to start the engine.  RECOVERY TIME / EFFORT GAPS AND CHALLENGES  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  25  Medium: As soon as the flaw in the application that  allow such attacks is discovered, a security patch  should be applied. Depending on the vulnerability, it  might take days or weeks.  If V2X application user has informed OEM about  credential compromise, they should revoke the  disclosed credentials for that particular user.  Response to zero-day vulnerabilities  Lack of awareness and knowledge  Insecure design or development  COUNTERMEASURES  1. Perform vulnerability surveys.  2. Third party testing of V2X applications.  3. Regularly assess the security controls and patch vulnerabilities.  4. Information sharing between different actors.  5. Adopt a holistic approach to security training and awareness among the employees.  6. Raise users’ awareness.  7. Allow and encourage the use of strong authentication (e.g. multi-factor  authentication).  8. Consider establishing a Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT).  9. Mitigate vulnerabilities or limitations of software libraries.  10. Protect mobile applications against reverse engineering and tampering of their  binary code.  11. Securely store sensitive data on mobile devices.  Attack scenario 3: Sensor fooling by adversarial perturbation  DESCRIPTION  IMPACT  High: The impact depends on the introduced perturbation. However, abusive detection, or  lack of detection of stop signs could entail major accidents endangering road users’ safety  and leading to driver, passenger, or pedestrian deaths.  EASE OF DETECTION CASCADE EFFECT RISK  Medium: Without appropriate  countermeasure, the  modifications brought to the signs  could be undetected by human  eyes before an accident occurs.  Low: The perturbation is local,  and may affect only the cars  passing by the modified or  spoofed sign.  ASSETS AFFECTED STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED  Decision Making algorithms  Sensors for autonomous vehicles  Vehicle functions  OEMs  Road infrastructure  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  26  ATTACK STEPS (SAMPLE BASED ON A REAL-CASE ATTACK SCENARIO)  1. The attacker first analyses the capabilities of the targeted versions of cameras  and AI-based image classifier to ensure detection and classification as desired of  the modified sign. This setup phase can require trying multiple perturbation  patterns or display parameters. The attacker needs to perform some  experimentation as well, to test the adversarial perturbation and ensure that his  attack will succeed.  2. At a next step, the attacker attaches a set of black and white stickers46 to a  physical road sign to cause misclassification of the traffic sign.  3. Due to the added stickers, the cars passing by the altered traffic sign will  erroneously classify it into the attacker’s targeted class (e.g. interpret a stop sign  as a speed limit sign) and react accordingly (e.g. reduce speed instead of  stopping the vehicle).  RECOVERY TIME / EFFORT GAPS AND CHALLENGES  Medium: Sensor fooling attacks  can go unnoticed. Once detected,  modified traffic signs can be  repaired in hours.  Traffic sign authentication would be an  appropriate countermeasure but is  complicated to deploy  Collaboration of vehicles  COUNTERMEASURES  1. Protect critical sensors in order to prevent attacks that may alter their perception  of the environment.  2. Hardening against Adversarial Machine Learning.  3. Use of hardware redundancy mechanisms.  4. Use of data redundancy mechanisms, such as sensors information fusion.  5. Perform data validation, for instance by comparing sign information collected by  sensor with information from digital maps stored in the vehicle.  46 “Robust Physical-World Attacks on Deep Learning Models”: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.08945.pdf  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.08945.pdf  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  27  4. SECURITY MEASURES AND GOOD  PRACTICES  4.1 SECURITY MEASURES CATEGORISATION  Security measures and good practices development is one of the major objectives of this study.  Indeed, a considerable effort was expended to identify all relevant security measures in order to  help mitigate the potential threats and risks, thus improving smart cars security.  The list of security measures has been established by analysing relevant documents and  standards identified during desktop research47. This analysis allowed the identification of  frequently mentioned topics regarding smart cars security and their classifications into different  security domains. The resulting list consists of seventeen security domains grouped into three  main categories, namely Policies, Organisational practices and Technical practices as shown in  Figure 7. The latter provides a comprehensive view of smart cars security landscape, and  points out the areas to be protected.  Figure 7: Cybersecurity Good Practices Overview  47 The data collection was performed between March and July 2019. Updates may have impacted the reference documents  since the publication of this report. See Bibliography in chapter 6.  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  28  4.2 POLICIES  This first category of security measures encompasses the different policies and procedures to  be established within organizations to ensure an appropriate cybersecurity level.  Policies-related security measures cover both security and privacy aspects, and have been  classified into four main security domains, namely Security by design, Privacy by design,  Asset management and Risk and threat management.  The security measures in this section are addressed at both OEMs and suppliers, due to the  tight links between them.  4.2.1 Security by design  These security measures emphasize the need to consider security aspects from the very  beginning of product development, throughout the supply chain and all over smart cars lifecycle.   PS-01: Adopt a security by design approach where smart cars cybersecurity is considered  from both the vehicles as well as the infrastructure perspective.   PS-02: Address security in each relevant specification document to ensure that security  aspects are considered from the very beginning of the concept phase, and not as an  afterthought.   PS-03: Promote the use of methodologies that consider security in every stage of the  development phase and operations phases (e.g. DevSecOps48, Secure Development  Lifecycle (SDL)49, etc.).   PS-04: Consider including a security role within the product engineering team to lead  security related tasks.  4.2.2 Privacy by design  This security domain includes a set of security measures related to the protection of private data  that are collected, processed and/or stored by smart cars stakeholders.   PS-05: Consider applying local and international privacy related regulations, such as the  GDPR, to prevent privacy issues.   PS-06: Conduct Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA), taken into account the context of use, in  order to identify any privacy related risk, and define appropriate countermeasures to mitigate  it.   PS-07: Perform Privacy Audits during smart cars development and over back-end systems  on a regular basis, e.g. at least once year, in order to ensure compliance with privacy related  policies.  4.2.3 Asset Management  Hereinafter, security measures pertaining to assets discovery, monitoring, administration and  maintenance are outlined.   PS-08: Use tools supporting asset management that can automatically discover, identify and  enumerate assets specific to the organization and smart cars ecosystem.   PS-09: Ensure that the organization maintains a consistent and up-to-date asset inventory.  48 DevSecOps is short for Development, Security and Operations. It aims to implement security decisions and actions at the  same scale and speed as development and operations decisions and actions. See https://www.forcepoint.com/cyber- edu/devsecops  49 See SAE J3061 “Cybersecurity Guidebook for Cyber-Physical Vehicle Systems”:  https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j3061_201601/  https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j3061_201601/  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  29   PS-10: Introduce a new device or software change into the vehicle only according to an  established, accepted and communicated change management process.  4.2.4 Risk and Threat Management  This security domain gathers the security measures related to the process of risk and threat  management.   PS-11: Adopt an approach to risk management dedicated and suitable for automotive  sector, considering emerging threats and attack scenarios targeting smart cars.   PS-12: Perform a cybersecurity risk analysis from the very early stages of the design  process, and which should be revised at least annually and upon any major change or in  case of critical security vulnerability detection or critical security incident.   PS-13: Monitor security vulnerabilities with a focus on vehicles that are on the market on a  regular basis, e.g. every 6 months or more frequently based on risk assessment.   PS-14: Conduct security evaluations, such as penetration testing, during the development  phase and then, on a regular basis following an event driven approach, e.g. in the case of  new threats or vulnerabilities and after major updates.   PS-15: Consider establishing a threat intelligence process in order to be informed on  emerging attack types and sources as well as new relevant vulnerabilities.   PS-16: Regularly assess the security controls at least once a year overall smart cars  lifecycle, and deploy patches (after testing them) to mitigate vulnerabilities.   PS-17: Regularly check, at least every six months over smart cars lifecycle, that the security  assumptions (e.g. operational environment assumptions) are still valid. In particular,  consider defining procedure for communication and handling of end-of-life/out-of-warranty  status for cybersecurity.  4.3 ORGANISATIONAL PRACTICES  Organisational and governance processes are of utmost importance to ensure smart cars  security. In what follows, a set of organisational rules and best practices are detailed. They  cover several aspects such as relationships with suppliers, employees training, incident  management, etc.  4.3.1 Relationships with Suppliers   OP-01: Foster security-related information sharing between the different stakeholders while  protecting intellectual property.   OP-02: Define cybersecurity relevant aspects of the partnerships along the supply chain,  and develop security requirements and procurement guidelines for suppliers50.  4.3.2 Training and Awareness   OP-03: Share relevant information between all organisations, including subcontractors,  suppliers and third parties to enhance smart cars security, by following the examples of  existing Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) for instance.   OP-04: Adopt a holistic approach to security training and awareness among the employees,  including employees on all levels of the organization, as well as consider expanding it to  suppliers.   OP-05: Ensure that security trainings are continuous, regular and frequently updated.  50 The current draft of the ISO/SAE 21434 standard provide a Development Interface Agreement (DIA) template example  where for each work product, one can clearly mark each organisation as either responsible, approver, support, inform or  consult.  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  30   OP-06: Raise vehicle owners’, drivers’ and passengers’ awareness with respect to security  issues and how to prevent them, on a regular basis.  4.3.3 Security Management   OP-07: Consider establishing an OEM Security Operations Center (SOC) with clearly  defined roles, responsibilities and cybersecurity competences to centralize knowledge on  cybersecurity, monitor and anticipate potential threats.   OP-08: Designate one or several51 dedicated security team(s) with security specialists  having diversified and broad range of competencies in security related topics (e.g. risk  assessment, penetration testing, secure design, etc.).   OP-09: Define a dedicated Information Security Management System (ISMS)52 that covers  smart cars entire lifecycle.   OP-10: Consider defining an internal task force, which involves board-level management, to  guide security-related strategic decisions and facilitate accountability.  4.3.4 Incident Management   OP-11: OEMs and 3rd party suppliers should establish an incident handling process that  should be tested and revised at least annually and as soon as possible in the case of a  major change.   OP-12: OEMs and 3rd party suppliers should consider establishing a Product Security  Incident Response Team (PSIRT) and Computer Security Incident Response Team  (CSIRT)53. Each team would be dedicated to handling security incidents respectively related  to Products and Infrastructure and work along with the SOC if there is one.   OP-13: Report incidents to back-end servers to ensure that systems are secure over their  lifetime.   OP-14: Define and classify relevant cybersecurity incidents to enable the identification of the  most critical incidents and their prioritization, based on their potential impacts or broader  effect for instance.   OP-15: Consider establishing a secure and reliable process for detecting and handling  misbehaving ITS stations, e.g. revoke credentials of misbehaving ITS stations.  4.4 TECHNICAL PRACTICES  Besides to the policies and organisational practices listed above, a set of technical security  measures should be implemented to protect both smart cars and the associated back-end  systems. Hereinafter, we provide an overview of these technical practices which covers several  aspects such as software security, cloud security, detection, access control and so on.  4.4.1 Detection   TM-01: Deploy Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) both at vehicle and back-end levels to  enable the detection of malicious activities or policy violations.   TM-02: Maintain properly protected audit logs to prevent their disclosure to unauthorised  entities, while clearly defining their storage location and retaining period.  51 For large organisations, it may be considered to build several security teams to split the scope, for instance, by  separating corporate security policy, back-end systems and connectivity services, cars and embedded components  security.  52 “An ISMS consists of the policies, procedures, guidelines and associated resources and activities, collectively managed  by an organisation, in the pursuit of protecting its information assets.” See ISO 27000:  https://www.iso.org/fr/standard/73906.html  53 See for instance https://www.first.org/  https://www.iso.org/fr/standard/73906.html https://www.first.org/  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  31   TM-03: Consider periodically reviewing network logs, access control privileges and assets  configuration.   TM-04: Perform data validation to check the correctness of incoming information.   TM-05: Define appropriate forensics procedures to enable event reconstruction, facilitate  crash investigation, prevent similar attacks and/or for accountability purposes.  4.4.2 Protection of Networks and Protocols   TM-06: Protect remote monitoring and administration interfaces through mutual  authentication and access control mechanisms to prevent illegitimate access to smart cars  systems.   TM-07: Protect the integrity and authenticity of all critical in-vehicle internal communications.   TM-08: Protect the integrity and authenticity of all external communications between the  smart cars and all the different entities it is interacting with.   TM-09: Enforce session management policies for the different communication sessions (e.g.  administration, ) to avoid session hijacking.   TM-10: Timestamp all exchanged messages using reliable time sources (e.g. provided by  secure embedded component or coming from satellite system) to mitigate replay attacks.   TM-11: Manage radio frequencies and the frequency of beaconing54 and other repeated  messages in order to prevent Distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks.   TM-12: Implement frequency agility feature to prevent signals jamming, if applicable.   TM-13: Perform packet filtering at the different layers (e.g. ECU and sensors, mobile  network communications, etc.) to analyse incoming and outgoing packets and discard  illegitimate traffic.   TM-14: Provide end-to-end protection of sensitive data in terms of confidentiality and  integrity using secure protocols.  4.4.3 Software Security   TM-15: Secure the default configuration of devices and services and ensure that the most  secure operation mode of device (or service) is used by default.   TM-16: Ensure software authenticity and integrity before its installation, to ensure that only  legitimate software is used.   TM-17: Implement and document changes in configuration according to a change  management policy developed by the organisation based on risk analysis.   TM-18: Secure OTA firmware updates to avoid firmware manipulation, disclosure or rollback  to vulnerable versions.55   TM-19: Define a secure OTA update process.   TM-20: Implement secure boot processes that ensure systems integrity and authenticity. A  risk-based approach may be used to identify when secure boot is actually needed.   TM-21: Ensure that vulnerabilities and limitations of software dependencies, especially open  source libraries, are mitigated or addressed in a risk assessment.   TM-22: Protect mobile applications against reverse engineering (e.g. through code  obfuscation techniques) and against tampering of their binary code (e.g. by signing it).   TM-23: Securely store sensitive data (e.g. passwords) on mobile devices, and protect local  files created by the mobile application.  54 Beacons are messages exchanged periodically over vehicular networks to carry information such as location, heading,  and speed.  55 An example of secure OTA firmware update guidelines can be found in the Uptane project documentation  https://uptane.github.io/uptane-standard/uptane-standard.html  https://uptane.github.io/uptane-standard/uptane-standard.html  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  32  4.4.4 Cloud Security   TM-24: Cover security and availability aspects in agreements with cloud security providers, if  applicable.   TM-25: In the context of cloud-based application and centralised systems, ensure that single  points of failure are prevented.   TM-26: Operate critical systems and applications within the private56 or at least hybrid57  deployment models.   TM-27: Protect all data within the cloud and during transfer while ensuring that cloud  services providers do not have access to the decryption keys, so as to mitigate any potential  risk stemming from cloud attacks.  4.4.5 Cryptography   TM-28: Encrypt all sensitive, personal and private data to prevent its disclosure to  illegitimate entities. Moreover, authenticated encryption may be used to avoid the  manipulation of personal data while ensuring their confidentiality.   TM-29: Use well-known and standardized cryptographic schemes and protocols that are  widely considered as secure, and avoid the use of proprietary schemes.   TM-30: Use of storage encryption to protect both users’ data as well as data needed to  enforce smart cars security (e.g. used keys, security credentials, etc.).   TM-31: Implement a secure key management process. The process should cover all the  steps of key lifecycle: key length choice in relation with key lifetime, key generation using an  appropriate level of entropy from a reliable source, secure key storage, key rotation and  revocation, etc.   TM-32: Consider the use of dedicated and tamper resistant hardware security modules for  secure execution of cryptographic algorithms and secure key storage.  4.4.6 Access Control   TM-33: Apply security controls at back-end servers; covering policies, physical and logical  security aspects as well as the security of internal networks and data.   TM-34: Apply least privileges principle and use individual accounts to access devices and/or  systems.   TM-35: Segregate remote access by developing a set of rules for the control and monitoring  of remote communications.   TM-36: Allow and encourage the use of strong authentication mechanisms, e.g. Multi-Factor  Authentication (MFA), define an account lockout functionality, etc.  4.4.7 Self-Protection and Cyber Resilience   TM-37: Implement differential monitoring on the GNSS system, to ensure accurate  localisation data.   TM-38: Apply a hardening approach on the different level (i.e. devices, network, back-end,  etc.) to reduce the attack surface.  56 A private cloud refers to a cloud environment that is operated exclusively for a single organization.  57 A hybrid cloud combines both private  and public cloud that are bound together for better cost-effectiveness and to  provide more flexibility and control.  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  33   TM-39: Reinforce interfaces robustness, e.g. to cope with buffer overflows or fuzzing.   TM-40: Consider strengthening applications isolation at runtime, using trusted software  technologies.   TM-41: Apply system, sub-domain and network segregation using physical and logical  isolation techniques where appropriate (based on risk assessment).  4.4.8 (Semi-) Autonomous Systems Self Protection and Cyber Resilience   TM-42: Consider using inboard Inertial Navigation System (INS) or existing dead-reckoning  methods to get localisation data, even in case of GNSS failure.   TM-43: Protect critical autonomous sensors to prevent the different attacks aiming to alter  smart cars environment perception.   TM-44: Harden against Adversarial attacks, to prevent AI and ML components from being  tricked.   TM-45: Prevent data falsification or manipulation in regard to AI and ML.   TM-46: Use of data redundancy mechanisms (e.g. sensor data fusion) that correlate data  acquired from the different sensors in the vehicle and data obtained via V2X  communications before making a decision.   TM-47: Use of hardware redundancy mechanisms by adding extra hardware components  able to carry out the required operations and perform self-driving tasks.  4.4.9 Continuity of Operations   TM-48: Ensure that notifications are easy to understand, and help users find a remediation  or workaround.   TM-49: Create a Business Continuity Plan (BCP) and a Business Recovery Plan (BRP) that  cover third-party aspects and are periodically tested, at least annually, to ensure the  resilience of smart cars systems.   TM-50: Define important parameters for the business continuity of the organisation, e.g.  Recovery Time Objective (RTO), Maximum Tolerable Outage (MTO), etc.  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  34  5.

Asset Group Assets Description  Car sensors and actuators  Standard Sensors  These devices are common sensors (e.g. tire  pressure, air bag impact, GNSS, speed, powertrain,  seat belt, passenger occupancy, temperature, oil,  water coolant, parking and climate control sensors)  usually embedded in cars to measure some  parameters and/or monitor or detect some events.  The collected data is transmitted to ECU for  processing purposes.  Sensors for autonomous  vehicles  These devices are relatively new sensors embedded  in autonomous vehicles to provide self-driving  capabilities (e.g. localization, enabling the detection  and identification of objects and people). This  category of sensors mainly includes the following  sensors:   Light Detecting and Ranging (LiDAR)   Lasers   Cameras   Radars   Ultrasonic sonars  Actuators  These devices are an important part of vehicles.  They interact with the environment by converting an  electrical signals received from the ECU into an  action (e.g. apply the brake when a red light or a  pedestrian crossing the road is detected, speed  reduction on bad weather conditions, change of  direction to get around an obstacle). The engine  control unit, suspension, transmission, brake system  and steering system are some examples of  actuators.  Decision Making  Algorithms  (Car ECUs, processing  and decision making  components  Smart cars Infrastructure  and Backend systems)  ML and AI algorithms  These software components provide smart cars with  the capability to perform tasks that are typical for  intelligent beings, such as reacting to an  unanticipated and new situation based on previously  collected data. ML and AI algorithms are  implemented inside smart cars to enable them to  react in real time whenever required, but they may  be implemented outside the vehicle in remote  servers as well.  ENISA GOOD PRACTICES FOR SECURITY OF SMART CARS  NOVEMBER 2019  49  Asset Group Assets Description  Data fusion algorithms  These software components combine data acquired  from different sensors (e.g. LiDAR and camera) and  V2X communications.

Threat  Category  Threat Description Impacted Assets  Nefarious  activity/Abuse  Denial of Service  Smart cars and their infrastructure, may be  subject to Distributed Denial of Service  (DDoS) attacks, or even used to launch such  attacks.  DoS attacks may target (or originate from)  RSUs or the IT systems. An attacker may for  instance shut down the RSU (via physical  access or remotely), overload the system  with messages to process or even jam radio  communications, etc.  In-vehicle components can also be the target  of DoS attacks. For instance, overloading the  CAN bus with malicious messages will alter  the vehicle behaviour63.  All assets  Malware  These malicious software aim at performing  unwanted and illegitimate actions such as  disabling smart cars functions (e.g. prevent  car unlocking or immobilize the engine).  Malware can cause unexpected behaviours  of the smart car and even endanger  passengers’ safety. Common examples or  malwares are Ransomware64, viruses,  Trojan horses, Spyware65 and exploit kits.  All assets  Manipulation of  hardware and  software  This threat consists of unauthorized and  illegitimate alteration of a component  firmware, operations or configuration data by  an attacker (e.g. malicious OTA updates). An  attack might also access the binary file,  compromising the intellectual property.

Outside vehicles, manufacturers may also be  confronted with garages using unauthorized  or unlicensed professional tools and  software. Unauthorised software may also be  installed by an attacker.  This threat also includes the notion of  cloning, for example when an attacker copies  the firmware of an existing device, in order to  commercialize it without authorization.  Identity theft  Impersonation attacks in which an adversary  successfully assumes the identity of one of  the legitimate parties in the system or in a  communication protocol. A common example  is to impersonate a key fob68 to steal the  associated car. This may, however, be  completed for other purposes, such as fraud,  for example if a user wants their car to  display another identity when communicating  with:  - road infrastructures such as toll systems,  thus leading to financial fraud;  - manufacturer backend46 (to get access to  paid services without subscription).  An attacker may also impersonate a police  car or ambulance in order to make other  vehicles slow down or pull over. Thus, the  attacker can reach his destination more  quickly.  All assets  Abuse of  authorizations  A disgruntled employee (backend services,  garage) may use their authorizations to  perform malicious actions (e.g. create  illegitimate user accounts, or add malicious  software into the system).

Even a home-brewed implementation of a  standard is not a good practice when  standard implementations are available. If  needed, consider getting advice from  security experts or your national  cybersecurity agency.

Cryptographic keys should be  securely generated, provisioned, used,  stored, and deleted/revoked. Badly  implemented key management can  introduce vulnerabilities that may easily  be exploited. Devices without direct user  interfaces are particularly vulnerable to  PKI compromising. While users can  easily delete or install certificates on a  PC, embedded devices (e.g. ECUs) rely  mostly on remote administration, and do  not even allow end-users to perform such  administration tasks. For this reason,  OEMs as well as Tier-1/Tier-2 should pay  careful attention to the key management  system, especially when the key  provisioning and management are  performed over-the-air.

Remove unused services  or interfaces, integrate dedicated security  software, activate memory or control flow  protections. For devices that have a  complete operating system, several  measures can be considered to harden  the device, such as ASLR, non-  executable memory, process segregation  or sandboxing. Another measure is  removing unused tools, services and  libraries. Unnecessary services should  not be present on the device (typically  telnet must always be deactivated, but  even SSH or FTP can be deactivated in  many cases). This type of measures is  also applicable at a network level: the  device should not leave open ports,  especially ports that could be exposed via  plug-n-play protocols. The default  configuration of the device should be  based upon the most secure parameters,  and users should be warned if they have  the possibility to roll back to less secure  parameters.  • Nefarious activity / Abuse  • Failures/Malfunctions  • Hijacking  • Physical attacks  • Unintenational damages  -Cloud Security Alliance - Identity and Access Management for the  I+E68nternet of Things - Summary Guidance  -ENISA - Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT  -GSMA (Global System for Mobile Communications) - GSMA CLP.12 IoT  Security Guidelines for IoT Service Ecosystems  -GSMA (Global System for Mobile Communications) - GSMA CLP.13 IoT  Security Guidelines for Endpoint Ecosystems  -IoT Security Foundation - Connected Consumer Products.

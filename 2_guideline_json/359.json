Procurement is a key process shaping the ICT environment of modern hospitals  and, as such, should be at the forefront when it comes to meeting cybersecurity objectives.  This report aims to provide hospital procurement officers and CISOs/CIOs with a  comprehensive set of tools and good practices that can be adapted to the hospitals’  procurement process in order to ensure that cybersecurity objectives are met. In this context,  the report maps good practices in three distinct phases comprising the procurement lifecycle,  namely plan, source and manage. Indeed, cybersecurity considerations are relevant for all  three phases and this report offers an easy-to-use guide for hospitals to improve their  procurement process from a cybersecurity perspective.  This report provides the context for addressing cybersecurity in procurement by defining the  three procurement phases, identifying 10 types of procurement (assets, products, services etc.)  for which cybersecurity considerations are relevant, lists industry standards with cybersecurity  aspects relevant to these types of procurement and highlights the main respective cybersecurity  challenges. A threat taxonomy and a list of key risks associated with procurement are also  presented. All this information is accompanied by quick guides providing insights as to how  hospitals can use it in their procurement process.  The report concludes with a comprehensive set of good practices (GP) for cybersecurity in  procurement. These good practices can be general practices applicable throughout the  procurement lifecycle or may be relevant to individual procurement phases. All good practices  are linked to types of procurement for which they are relevant and to threats which they can  mitigate, providing an easy to filter set of practices for hospitals who want to focus on particular  aspects. Overall, hospitals are encouraged to adopt these good practices for cybersecurity in  procurement:   General practices:  o Involve the IT department in procurement  o Vulnerability management  o Develop a policy for hardware and software updates  o Secure wireless communication  o Establish testing policies  o Establish Business Continuity plans  o Consider interoperability issues  o Allow auditing and logging  o Use encryption   Plan phase:  o Conduct risk assessment  o Plan requirements in advance  o Identify threats  o Segregate network  o Establish eligibility criteria for suppliers  o Create dedicated RfP for cloud   Source phase  o Require certification  o Conduct DPIA  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  6  o Address legacy systems  o Provide cybersecurity training  o Develop incident response plans  o Involve supplier in incident management  o Organise maintenance operations  o Secure remote access  o Require patching   Manage phase  o Raise cybersecurity awareness  o Perform asset inventory and configuration management  o Dedicated access control mechanisms for medical device facilities  o Schedule penetration testing frequently or after a change in the architecture/  system  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  7  1. INTRODUCTION  Healthcare is becoming increasingly connected, as medical technology companies currently  manufacture more than 500,000 different types of medical devices, such as wearables,  implantable and stationary medical devices1. The Internet of Medical Things market in Europe  alone is expected to grow from 11 billion in 2017 to 40 billion in 2022, while the European  medical technology market was estimated at roughly 115 billion in 20172. At the same time, a  study showed that U.S. hospitals had, on average, between 10 and 15 connected devices per  bed, exemplifying how the proliferation of medical technology solutions has completely changed  the ICT landscape in healthcare organisations worldwide. All these devices are made by  different manufacturers, and all must effectively communicate with each other to deliver patient  care. The increasing interconnection of medical devices and the use of remote connections for  their maintenance; the need to continuously monitor the patients -even the ones out of the  hospital; the use of smartphones to access health information by patients and doctors; along  with the inability of the information technology (IT) department to apply patches and the usual  lack of budget for cybersecurity services and solutions, make the healthcare sector especially  vulnerable3. Cybersecurity should be considered in the early days of purchasing assets  (infrastructure, software, systems, devices etc.) for healthcare organisations.  1.1 OBJECTIVES  This study focuses on one part of the vast healthcare ecosystem: the hospital. The hospital is  considered as a collection of assets (infrastructure, software, systems, devices etc.), and  cybersecurity should be explicitly addressed in all its different components. Overall, the  objective of this study, is to provide healthcare professionals in hospitals with guidelines on how  to improve their procurement process to meet cybersecurity objectives. These guidelines cover  multiple topics and range from good organisational practices for the healthcare organisations  themselves, up to what information to request from suppliers as cybersecurity “evidences” when  procuring systems and services.  1.2 SCOPE  The scope of this study is on hospitals: the most complex and critical healthcare organisations  and the main stakeholder for procurement. Also hospitals often face lack of resources, so this  report aims at being a “guidebook” for healthcare professionals. Many of the practices and  recommendations will be useful to other healthcare organisations as well, as procurement  processes can be very similar. The procurement guidelines proposed in this report cover the  entire procurement scope of healthcare organisations that can potentially impact cybersecurity.  1.3 TARGET AUDIENCE  This report is addressed to healthcare professionals occupying technical positions in hospitals,  i.e. Chief-level executives: CIO4, CISO, CTO, IT teams as well as procurement officers in  healthcare organisations.  This report may be of interest to manufacturers of medical devices that provide products to  hospitals; in this case products can be (but are not limited to) medical devices, clinical  information systems, networking equipment, cloud services, etc. When these manufacturers  1 https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Life-Sciences-Health-Care/gx-lshc-medtech-iomt- brochure.pdf  2 https://www.medtecheurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/The-European-Medical-Technology-Industry-in-figures- 2019-1.pdf  3 Lynne Coventry and Dawn Branley, ‘Cybersecurity in Healthcare: A Narrative Review of Trends, Threats and Ways  Forward’, Maturitas 113 (July 2018): 48–52, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.maturitas.2018.04.008.  4 Chief Information Officer – CIO, Chief Information Security Officer – CISO, Chief Technology Officer – CTO etc  During the  Wannacry attack  in 2017, a  ransomware  spread  exponentially,  taking advantage  of a vulnerability  present only in 5%  of the UK National  Healthcare System  (NHS) computers,  which were still  running outdated  and unsupported  software.  https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Life-Sciences-Health-Care/gx-lshc-medtech-iomt-brochure.pdf https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Life-Sciences-Health-Care/gx-lshc-medtech-iomt-brochure.pdf https://www.medtecheurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/The-European-Medical-Technology-Industry-in-figures-2019-1.pdf https://www.medtecheurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/The-European-Medical-Technology-Industry-in-figures-2019-1.pdf  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  8  offer services or products, they will know the security requirements that the hospital expects  them to fulfil and they can provide evidence to prove it.  1.4 METHODOLOGY  Information presented in this report is the result of analysis of data received through a series of  interviews. The interviews were conducted with subject matter experts from hospitals, policy  makers or regulators (ministries of health), medical device manufacturers and cybersecurity  experts with a focus in healthcare. The report was validated by the experts participating in the  survey/interviews, as well as with the ENISA eHealth Security Experts Group5.  This methodology enabled ENISA to engage actively with the interested stakeholders and:   identify the types of procurement and corresponding assets with relevance to the  hospitals’ cybersecurity objectives,   identify possible threats, risks and challenges related to procurement in hospital  organisations,   list good practices related to healthcare procurement in order to meet cybersecurity  objectives, and   map the proposed good practices to types of procurement for which they may be used  and to threats for which they are relevant.  1.5 POLICY CONTEXT  1.5.1 European Policy  Legislation plays a major role in defining the cybersecurity requirements that should be  described in the technical specifications when obtaining products and services in a hospital.  Some of the most prominent are presented below:  1.5.1.1 The Network and Information Security Directive (NISD)  The Network and Information Security Directive (NISD) 2016/1148/EU, which came into force in  May 2018, has two main goals: the implementation of minimum security requirements and the  establishment of cybersecurity notifications for both Operators of Essential Services and Digital  Service Providers. Healthcare providers, namely hospitals, are identified as Operators of  Essential Services in most Member States. Therefore, these organizations will have to take into  account the Directive and the respective national law when contracting a product or service.  The Directive goes beyond implementation of security requirements, as it gives power to the  regulatory bodies to audit the Operators of Essential Services to ensure the level of  cybersecurity in the organization is acceptable and as per the provisions of the Directive. In the  hospital ecosystems, this can be translated as cybersecurity requirements for all the products so  it should be included as a provision in the procurement process. One vulnerable  device/system/service can result into great cybersecurity impact for the hospital as an operator  of essential service.  1.5.1.2 Medical Device Regulation (MDR)  The Medical Device Regulation (MDR) is a new regulation that includes specific provisions  related to the IT security (hardware, software etc.) for all medical devices. The General Safety  and Performance Requirements defined within the MDR (Medical Devices/SW) include:   repeatability, reliability and performance according to the intended use   the principles of development life cycle, risk management, verification and validation   the use of software in combination with mobile computing platforms  5 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/ehealth-security  European legislation  introduces a  notification  obligation to the  hospitals. In some  cases the  notification should  follow the supply  chain. This has to  be foreseen during  the procurement  process.  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/ehealth-security  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  9   IT security measures, including protection against unauthorised access  The Medical Device Coordination Group (MDCG) published the Guidance on Cybersecurity  for medical devices6 in December 2019 in order to provide manufacturers with guidance on  how to fulfil all the relevant essential requirements of the MDR. These cybersecurity  requirements, listed in Annex I of the Medical Devices Regulations, deal with both pre-market  and post-market aspects. The MDCG is composed of representatives of all Member States and  it is chaired by a representative of the European Commission. The MDCG provides advice to  the Commission and assists the Commission and the Member States in ensuring a harmonised  implementation of medical devices Regulations.  1.5.1.3 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)7 came into force on 25 May 2018. It sets the  rules for the processing and free movement of personal data and applies to all domains of the  public and private sector; however, some specific derogations are defined for data concerning  health, aiming at protecting the rights of data subjects and confidentiality of their personal health  data and at the same time preserving the benefits of data processing for research and public  health purposes.  GDPR treats health data as a \"special category\" of personal data which are considered to be  sensitive by nature and imposes a higher standard of protection for their process. Organizations  processing health data have the following obligations (among others):   to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure security of the  processing systems, services and personal data,   to perform data protection impact assessment, and   to report data breaches which are likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of  individuals within 72 hours after having become aware of.  Article 4 (12) of the GDPR defines a “personal data breach” as a breach of security leading to  accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to,  personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed; It has to be noted that if a data  breach incident impacts the continuity of the health services as well, then it has to be reported  according to the NIS Directive.  1.5.2 International Policy  1.5.2.1 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)8  This Act required the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to  develop regulations protecting the privacy and security of certain health information. The  Security Standards for the Protection of Electronic Protected Health Information (the Security  Rule) establish a national set of security standards for protecting certain health information that  is held or transferred in electronic form. The Security Rule operationalizes the protections  contained in the Privacy Rule by addressing the technical and non-technical safeguards that  organizations called “covered entities” must put in place to secure individuals’ “electronic  protected health information” (e-PHI).  1.5.2.2 FDA Guidance for cybersecurity9  6 https://ec.europa.eu/docsroom/documents/38941  7 REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016 on the  protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and  repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation)  8 https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ191/html/PLAW-104publ191.htm  9 https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/content-premarket-submissions- management-cybersecurity-medical-devices  https://ec.europa.eu/docsroom/documents/38941 https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ191/html/PLAW-104publ191.htm https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/content-premarket-submissions-management-cybersecurity-medical-devices https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/content-premarket-submissions-management-cybersecurity-medical-devices  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  10  This guidance has been developed by the FDA to assist industry by identifying issues related to  cybersecurity that manufacturers should address in the design and development of their  medical devices as well as in preparing premarket submissions for those devices.  If a manufacturer would aim for internal markets, then the device should comply with both  European and international law.  1.6 STRUCTURE OF THE REPORT  The study is structured as follows:  Section 2: Definition of the context around Healthcare Procurement Processes and its variants  with an overview of the concepts discussed and the related security challenges.  Section 3: Threat and risk analysis containing a taxonomy of the threats and examples of  Healthcare sector attack scenarios.  Section 4: Description of good procurement practices mapped to threats and types of  procurement.  Annex A: List of relevant industry standards  Each section of the report is accompanied by a description of how  hospitals can use the information provided in the section to address  cybersecurity in their procurement processes. The relevant descriptions  are given in text boxes such as this one.  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  11  2. PROCUREMENT IN  HOSPITALS  2.1 PROCUREMENT PROCESS  Since the hospital ecosystem is comprised by several IT components, cybersecurity should be  examined separately in all these different components. Cybersecurity should be part of all  different stages of the procurement process. In this section, we present the common stages of  the procurement process for obtaining products and services (including medical devices,  information systems and infrastructures), together with some considerations as per each stage of  the process.  Figure 1: Procurement process lifecycle for hospitals  Understand where cybersecurity fits in the different phases of the procurement  lifecycle. This section indicates what cybersecurity considerations should be  addressed when planning procurement, in the source process and in the post-  sales/manage phases.  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  12   Plan phase: Initially, the hospital analyses its needs and collects requirements from  several divisions internally. For example, in the case of obtaining a new cloud service,  the CTO should identify the needs and understand what kind of usability this service  will offer.   Source phase: Afterwards, the requirements are translated into technical specifications  and, in collaboration with the procurement office, the sourcing process begins (e.g., a  tender is published). The hospital receives the designated offers, the committee  (including the CTO/ CISO or and member of the IT team) evaluates the offers and  selects the most appropriate products. Negotiations are conducted with the contractor  and the contract is awarded.   Manage phase: Finally, the contract (management and monitoring) is assigned to the  business owner within the hospital. The assigned officer is responsible for closing the  tender and receiving any feedback from users on the actual performance of the  equipment/system/service.  Throughout the different phases of the procurement lifecycle, the hospital should ensure  cybersecurity is considered as a requirement for the product/service to be procured. Relevant  considerations may include:   Plan phase: The cybersecurity risks associated with a new procurement are assessed  and specific cybersecurity requirements for the new procurement are defined.   Source phase: Cybersecurity requirements are translated into technical specifications  and product security features and supplier responsibilities for cybersecurity aspects are  clarified and included in the contracts.   Manage phase: Cybersecurity aspects, such as incidents and new vulnerabilities are  continuously monitored and corrective measures, such as patching are applied to  maintain a high level of security. Similarly, at the end of the products lifecycle, secure  disposal is required for privacy reasons as devices have patient information stored.  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  13  2.2 TYPES OF PROCUREMENT  As discussed throughout this document, the hospital is an ecosystem comprised by several  components and cybersecurity should be a priority for all these different components. In this  chapter we created a taxonomy to categorise the types of procurement and eventually investigate  how cybersecurity is addressed in each type.  Figure 2: Types of procurement (asset taxonomy)  Cybersecurity considerations are relevant for a number of different types of  procurement. Consult the following list to understand if the specific type of  procurement you are planning/managing has possible cybersecurity  implications that should be addressed.  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  14  Table 1: Types of procurement  Type of procurement Type description  Clinical information systems  Includes procurement of any kind of software oriented to medical care:  - Hospital Information Systems & Electronic Medical Record (HIS-EMR),  - Laboratory Information System (LIS),  - Radiology Information System, Picture Archiving and Communication System (RIS- PACS),  - Pharmacy,  - Drug Databases,  - Care Management,  - Diet Software,  - Computer Physician Order Entry (CPOE),  - Big Data analysis, etc.  CIS must be located in the medical building or in a data centre facility under  complete control of the IT division of the medical centre. Cloud-based systems have  their own category.  Medical devices  Any piece of hardware dedicated to treatment, control or diagnosis of diseases:  radiology equipment, radiotherapy, nuclear medicine, operative room or intensive  care equipment, robots for surgery, electro-medical equipment, infusion pumps,  spirometry devices, medical lasers, endoscopy equipment, etc.  Includes patient implantable devices10 (holters, pacemakers, insulin pumps, cochlear  implants, brain stimulators, cardiac defibrillators, gastric stimulators, etc.11) or  wearables (external EKG or pressure holters, glucose monitors, etc.) given they  communicate by electronic means with the IT systems of the hospital.  Network equipment  Network lines (coaxial, optical), gateways, routers, switches, firewalls, VPNs, IPS,  IDS, etc.  Remote care systems  Facilities or devices to provide care outside the hospital environment, especially what  today is called “Hospital-based home care services”.  Can include the remote communication “press-for-help” devices used for the help of  the elderly population that live alone at home.  Mobile client devices  All piece of software that provides health assistance or medical data collection not  directly connected to the hospital network; for example: telemedicine apps. It does not  include health wearables as they are included into a separate category.  Mobile client devices need a defined protocol to connect to the hospital network.  Identification systems  Systems to uniquely identify patients or medical personnel (biometric scanners, card  readers etc.) and guarantee identification and/or authorization to access the IT  systems.  Building Management Systems  Any type of construction that can hold medical facilities. It includes electricity lines,  water, gas, medical gases, furniture, etc. except network lines, which is included  under the “network equipment” category.  Building Management Systems (BMS) are  included in the next procurement category as they are, mainly, control systems.  Industrial control systems  Systems that control all physical aspects of the centres such as power regulation  systems, door lock systems, close circuit security systems, HVAC12 systems, alarm  systems, water, heating,  auxiliary power units, security access, elevators, fire  extinguishing, etc. Nowadays, control of all these systems is managed through  10 Knee or hip replacements or intraocular lens are also examples or “medical devices” as well but are out of the scope of  this study.

The following section lists existing standards and protocols that  directly, or indirectly, have a relation to procurement.  An industry standard very relevant to cybersecurity and procurement is the Manufacturer  Disclosure Statement for Medical Device Security (MDS2). The MDS2 form provides  medical device manufacturers with a means of disclosing the security-related features of their  medical devices. The MDS2 form provides a set of medical device security questions and allows  for comparison of security features across different devices and different manufacturers.  As of today, ISO is developing more than 25 new standards in Medical Informatics, some of the  most interesting being:   ISO/DTR 22696 Health informatics — Guidance for identification and  authentication for connectable personal healthcare devices ,   ISO/DTR 21332 Health informatics — Cloud computing considerations for health  information systems security and privacy,   ISO/WD 13131 Health informatics — Telehealth services — Quality planning  guidelines,   ISO/AWI 22697 Health informatics — Application of privacy management to  personal health information  In addition, a number of guidelines, standards and good practices exist at EU and Member  State level. A brief overview of the relevant landscape is depicted in Figure 3.  There already exist a number of regulations, international standards and good  practices on healthcare systems, products and services that include  cybersecurity baselines. Consult the mapping in this section to see if a relevant  industry standard is available for the specific type of procurement you are  planning/managing.

As one interviewee pointed out, the most  challenging threats are normally associated with procurements for which the IT department is  not typically involved.  Other interesting challenges not included in the list but pointed out by the stakeholders were  “Maintenance Services” and challenges associated with free software handed over by some  medical suppliers.  Based on the feedback from the interviews with the stakeholders, several key challenges  associated with procurement in healthcare organisations were identified. These challenges  have been grouped based on the previously defined types of procurement.  Clinical Information Systems   Component vulnerability: Information systems in healthcare organisations are  usually made of different pieces from different suppliers. Besides that, these systems  interact and share files and data, so a vulnerability of one component can affect  others.   Increasing interoperability: Software specialization, and new trends as big data,  analytics, create the need of sharing patient data between different systems. This  process needs to be done in a secure way, using appropriate protocols and  transmitting only the required data to only the right receiver.   Full continuous operation: Healthcare organisations usually operate 24x7, and  resources are scarce, so stopping a modality or even a desktop computer can impact  seriously the service. When an incident is detected, it is sometimes really difficult to  isolate the equipment, and thus this make propagation easier. In such cases the  procurement process should require from providers contingency plans and  redundancy.  Medical devices   Manufacturing processes: Although this topic has been traditionally strictly  controlled by medical device suppliers, actually it is very common to have third-party  suppliers of software and electronics in their supply chain. This introduces new  challenges for manufacturers: they need not only to check materials, durability, or  sterilization, they now have to test software and electronics to ensure they are robust  and secure before putting the device into the market.   Rented equipment: Especially when considering expensive healthcare equipment, it  is common to rent devices that could have been previously used by other healthcare  organisations, and often come with default set up. Procurement of rental services  should establish measures to avoid risks of this practice.  Many systems, products or services procured by hospitals introduce or are  characterised by significant cybersecurity challenges. Consult this section for a  list of the key relevant challenges and identify what are the major challenges  associated with the specific type of procurement you are planning/managing.  Work jointly with your IT, security or risk departments to identify the best ways  to address the relevant challenges.  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  19   Legacy devices: Medical equipment usually is very expensive; these devices are  expected to be in service for many years. Due to this long life cycle, buyers can  sometimes have difficulties in getting maintenance support from manufacturers. For  this reason, vulnerabilities cannot always be corrected, and thus can be exploited  through cyberattacks.   Hidden functionalities: Medical equipment is always complex to manage and set  up. Neither doctors nor the IT department are usually trained on new equipment. The  habitual action is to leave this equipment13 in a standard setup, so preventing default  passwords and ensure that unknown functionalities are not activated is another  challenge in these environments. Devices can have operative procedures  implemented (e.g. requests for date/time, communication of technical & service data  to the manufacturer, requests for maintenance, automatic updates etc.) unknown to  the buyer that could trigger security alerts on the IPS system of the hospital. That  interconnectivity opens up an array of opportunities for malicious individuals to gain  access to the organization’s IT infrastructure.   Updates / Lifecycle management: The most recent devices have usually the  functionality of being operated remotely. This allows the providers to reduce  maintenance costs and perform other operations. But these cases, if ignored or  neglected, can result in back doors in the organisation because they are often set up  without knowledge of the IT department.  Building Management Systems – Industrial Control Systems   IT/OT hybrid solutions: Hybrid solutions make possible the convergence between  digital and physical worlds, ranging from smart buildings to digital twins, and  including for example real time location systems for patients and valuable assets,  hospital laundries, pharmacy systems, or surgery blocks. Of course, this opens a new  scenario for threats and risks that healthcare organisations should deal with.  Networking   Unprotected protocols: As in other sectors, protocols have been designed with the  use cases in mind but ignoring abuse cases. On the other hand, health data is very  persistent: a data leakage could have permanent impact in patients. Improving the  security of protocols used to exchange patient data is crucial.  Professional services   Human factors: Users’ awareness allows healthcare organisations to improve their  level of protection almost exponentially. In healthcare, nonetheless, the pressure and  the need of providing urgent health care sometimes makes more likely for a user to  relax good practices in cybersecurity to provide health care to patients14.   Patient safety: In healthcare organisations there are two specific conditions that  make information systems different from the rest of the IS: (1) Patient data is  permanent, cannot be changed if privacy is broken (as you could do with your credit  card number for example); and (2) cyberattacks can become physical and cost  human lives. Clinicians work hard to improve patient safety and medical devices and  IT services must be considered another layer in patient safety15. This should be the  key in the procurement phase specific cybersecurity requirements.  13 Clemens Scott Kruse et al., ‘Cybersecurity in Healthcare: A Systematic Review of Modern Threats and Trends’,  Technology and Health Care 25, no. 1 (21 February 2017): 1–10, https://doi.org/10.3233/THC-161263.  14 Ross Koppel et al., ‘Workarounds to Computer Access in Healthcare Organizations: You Want My Password or a Dead  Patient?’, Studies in Health Technology and Informatics 208 (2015): 215–20.  15 ECRI Institute, ‘2019 Top 10 Health Technology Hazards Executive Brief’ (ECRI Institute, 2018).  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  20  3. CYBERSECURITY IN  PROCUREMENT  3.1 THREAT TAXONOMY  Threat sources are the other risk factors that must be taken into consideration when analysing  risk. A threat source is characterized as: (i) the intent and method targeted at the exploitation of  a vulnerability; or (ii) a situation and method that may accidentally exploit a vulnerability16. Some  examples of threat sources are: an individual, an organization, a customer, hack activist, a user,  a privileged user/administrator, failure of a storage device, failure of a temperature control,  failure of an operating system, fire. Keep in mind that the list of threat sources is quite large.  Previously referenced NIST Special Publication 800-30 Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments  appendix D, contains table D-2 with a useful taxonomy of threat sources.  Based on the last ENISA reports on Smart Hospitals (2016)17 and the 2018 threat landscape  report18 this study analyses the top cyber threats with a specific focus in healthcare ( for  example medjacking and medical equipment threats).  16 Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative, ‘Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments’ (Gaithersburg, MD: National  Institute of Standards and Technology, 2012), https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-30r1.  17 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-security-and-resilience-for-smart-hospitals  18 European Union and Agency for Network and Information Security, ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2018: 15 Top  Cyberthreats and Trends., 2019, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report- 2018/at_download/fullReport.  Different types of procurement are associated with various threats to a  hospital's ICT environment. Consult the threat taxonomy presented in this  section together with your IT, security or risk department to identify which  threats are most relevant to your organisation. This activity should be part of  the IT tasks in the hospital regardless of the procurement potential.  You can  then prioritise the good procurement practices presented in Chapter 4 that can  mitigate the identified threats.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-security-and-resilience-for-smart-hospitals  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  21  Figure 4: General overview of healthcare threats  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  22  The proposed threat taxonomy comprises of five groups, described in more detail in the  following matrices:  3.1.1 Natural phenomena  Threat Description  Natural  phenomena  Fire, floods or earthquakes are infrequent but possible threats for the infrastructure and overall equipment  (devices, network components etc.). Habitually, computerized tomography scan machines, magnetic  resonance imaging equipment, radiotherapy equipment and other highly expensive devices are usually  located in the ground floor or at the basement of the hospitals -either by regulatory laws or just because  their weight and dimensions- and are specially affected by this type of phenomena.  It should be noted, that failures due to floods or fires i.e. broken pipe flooding the basement of a patient  room can have different impact than a disaster due to natural phenomena (wildfire, storm, tsunami etc.)  and eventually could affect the whole hospital and its surrounding or supply chain provider.  3.1.2 Supply chain failure  Threat Description  Cloud Services  provider failure  Not all services are hosted in hospital servers. Accounting, salaries, stock control may be outsourced and  depend on third party cloud services. Nearly all of the personal IoT medical devices work in the cloud. In  fact, some hospitals -especially regional or small associated centres-, can have their entire electronic  health record system located in other site. These services, if not adequately backed up to work off-line,  may cause severe disruptions in the provision of medical services.  Network provider  failure  A network failure can have devastating effects. Most of the main hospital centres form a hub between the  main building and its associated centres -mostly radiology or ambulatory or day-care centres-. Redundancy  and topology design are crucial when mitigating this type of threat.  Power supply  failure  Loss of electricity can be of importance depending of the equipment affected. Intensive care units,  operative rooms, servers and clients are usually protected by uninterruptible power sources or batteries but  other equipment such as MRI or CT machines can be compromised.  Medical device  manufacturer  failure / non- liability  All medical devices can have design errors in their systems. These latent errors may arise under certain  circumstances during the normal use of the device. Most of the times, these errors are known and cannot  be mitigated because the device does not allow for updates. If the manufacturers who make this equipment  are acquired by larger companies or run out of business there may be problems with device updates or  repairs. Also, security information shared with third parties can be compromised.  3.1.3 Human errors  Threat Description  Medical system  configuration  error  Not changing factory-default passwords is one of the most common errors that gives attackers access to  the devices once they have gained access to the network. Other errors of this kind can be, for example, to  configure our device to allow incoming connections from any address or communicate using non-encrypted  protocols.  Absence of audit  logs  Logs are a crucial part of the secure-test-analyse-improve strategy of security. If we assume that sooner or  later our system will be compromised, logs are one of the most useful tools that we can use to trace back  how attackers gained access to our system. We can also evaluate how much information was  compromised. Keeping the logs secure is one of the most important tasks of security, although its absence  does not compromise already implemented security.  In some circumstances logs may be a legal requirement for normal operation of the system (e.g. access to  medical history)  Unauthorised  access control /  lack or  processes  Due to the variety of roles in a hospital (i.e. physicians, caregivers, administration) access control  procedures should be in place. As the priority to all hospital staff is care, workarounds are often the case  when it comes to access control (including all types of access control from buildings to systems and  accounts). This poses great threats to the hospital interconnected environment.  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  23  Threat Description  Non-compliance  (BYOD)  Today’s employees want the freedom to work from any location and any device at any time of day. These  individuals are increasingly using their personal mobile devices to undertake work tasks. From a business  perspective, enabling BYOD is an advantageous strategy19. However, bring-your-own-device (BYOD) can  also represent a significant risk for organisations. For the IT department, there is massive pressure to find  a way to securely enable BYOD. Failure to do so can lead to malware outbreaks, noncompliance with  regulatory requirements, and corporate exposure in the wake of personal device theft.  Medical staff /  patient error  There is always the possibility of human error when entering data by either part, particularly when entering  the clinical history number. Sometimes two patients can have identical names and the clinical information  of one can be written on the medical history of the other. This is of critical importance when the information  provided will activate subsequent clinical decisions that will affect the patient’s health: e.g. a patient with  the same name as other could be misdiagnosed of cancer. In the worst case the patient could receive non- needed surgery (amputations) or radio/chemotherapy. On the contrary, a patient with cancer could receive  an invalid report of normality and delay a treatment that could potentially improve his/her status.  Although the impact is low because only affects one or two patients, global impact on the company’s or  healthcare organisation's reputation can be very high.  3.1.4 Malicious actions  Threat Description  Malware:  -Virus  -Ransomware  -BYOD  In healthcare organisations, IT systems are strongly interconnected and difficult to isolate without  generating service disruption, creating a comfortable ecosystem for malware.  Enterprises with a very large number of devices may have difficulties updating their licenses because of  the elevated costs.  Adware is one of the easiest ways to distribute malware and more often ignored by users20 .  Ransomware is perhaps the most known threat for healthcare organisations, due mainly to the Wannacry  case. Ransomware usually makes indiscriminate low-cost attacks. It’s very easy to infect healthcare  infrastructure because of two factors; (i) software infrastructure is hard to keep updated because it’s very  difficult to get a downtime slot, (ii) machines that run legacy software that only works on specific OS or  drivers’ version turns out to be an easy target for these attacks. Many of these legacy devices that cannot  be updated act as reservoirs for the malware helping it spread through the network.  Enterprises that allow bring-your-own-device (BYOD) without appropriate policies are exposed to additional  risks.  Hijack:  Cryptojacking /  Medjacking  Medical equipment needs usually real time communications, and clinicians need also a quick response  from the system when they look for patient data or test information. Dedicating processor time or  communication capacity to mining cryptocurrency impacts performance and of course, the health care  provision.  The difference between cryptojacking and medjacking is basically the kind of hardware involved. In the first  case we are talking about general purpose IT infrastructure and in the second we are referring to IT-based  medical equipment.  Social  engineering:  -Phishing  -Baiting  -Device cloning  Compromised email (phishing, spam and spear-phishing) is the dominating attack vector for malware  infections. According to Verizon DBIR334, email compromise was the attack vector for 92,4% of detected  malware21. Most organizations still allow access to private mail web accounts in most of the computers of  the hospital.  Mail addresses from clinicians are easy to collect through hospital public directories, existing presentations  on the web, etc. In our research, we found both cases of using professional e-mail accounts for personal  matters, and cases of using personal e-mail accounts for professional matters.  Fight against phishing is not easy: keeping an adequate user awareness is very difficult. Multiple factors  have been blamed: most personnel in the health field has no technical knowledge at all, a stressful  19 BYOD and GDPR: Managing the compliance conundrum.

Device cloning (ID cards) requires a high level of specialization and the necessity to get closer to the victim  to clone his/her ID. Two factor identification has made this type of threat very unlikely.  Theft:  - Device  - Data  The cost of medical devices is very high. Stealing of medical equipment is a very common crime. Devices  are usually sold in the second-hand market of underdeveloped countries or for veterinary uses for a  fraction of their price. Small to medium-sized portable devices as ultrasound equipment, EKG,  defibrillators, infusion pumps or vital signs monitors are among the most robbed pieces.  Devices should not expose medical data unless adequately logged in. Unfortunately, most of them use the  factory default credentials.  The lack of involvement of IT security department in setting up and managing medical equipment, the lack  of risk-awareness of the staff can generate information leaks that could impact on reputation, patient  privacy, penalties, or even patient safety.  Medical device  tampering  Unprotected communications between medical devices and servers can result in tampering of the  information. Sophisticated man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks can change the data coming from vital signs  monitors, laboratory, pathology reports or even DICOM images coming from CT scans, MRI or ultrasound  systems in their way to the PACS server.  Skimming  Skimming (stealing of credit card information) can occur from breaches in patients’ administrative data. It is  unlikely to occur in public health systems where no payment is the rule and social security numbers are  used instead. That is not the case in private institutions.  When protection of administrative data becomes secondary against protection of medical records, a breach  can occur more easily.  Large shopping areas, and e-commerce systems seem to be the target for this type of organized criminals.  Great effort from some public and private organizations has been made in the last years to prevent fraud in  this area and is out of the scope of this report.  Denial of service  Denial of Service is a very common cyberattack that can take down servers at a healthcare organisation,  especially because they are usually reluctant to use public cloud infrastructure, so the capacity of servers  is limited. The impact can be high, depending on the type of systems affected.  Web based  attacks  Extended use of undocumented web services for interoperability purposes, and the delay in applying  updates, trying to keep the system configuration without changes and to reduce the downtime as much as  possible, makes it easier to exploit known vulnerabilities.  Web application  attacks  SQL Injection and Denial of Service represent the 68,8% of web application attacks, while in government  institutions represent only the 26% or 27,7% globally. SQL injection alone represents the 46% in the case  of healthcare, similar percentage to energy and manufacturing companies, another environment where  industrial equipment is very frequent25.  Insider threat  Hospital staff can act as insider threats, at any position (physicians, nurses, administrative, maintenance,  etc.), but patients or guests can act also from within the hospital, given that access cannot be restricted to  certain areas.  Physical  manipulation /  damage  Medical equipment can be very expensive, and many times, physical access is granted to non-authorized  or poorly trained personnel -if not-trained at all-, allowing manipulation, damages, theft or loss of this  equipment or the information assets they contain.  Identity theft  There are 2 cases: employees’ identity or patients’ identity. The first case can be dangerous because  impersonating a doctor or nurse allows, for example, to do wrong prescriptions or diagnose a patient of a  certain disease, and the second case could be used to fraud the healthcare system and introduce wrong  diagnoses as well.  Cyber espionage  Interest of multinational pharmaceutic industries or other interest groups on clinical research results or  patient data can be one the drivers of this kind of threats. Cases have been documented of new technology  that it’s being tested in a hospital and other nations have been spying with the intention of copying this new  technology or treatment.  22 Annalena Welp et al., ‘Teamwork and Clinician Burnout in Swiss Intensive Care: The Predictive Role of Workload, and  Demographic and Unit Characteristics’, Swiss Medical Weekly, 24 March 2019, https://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2019.20033.  23 Koppel et al., ‘Workarounds to Computer Access in Healthcare Organizations’.  24 Sean W Smith and Ross Koppel, ‘Healthcare Information Technology’s Relativity Problems: A Typology of How Patients’  Physical Reality, Clinicians’ Mental Models, and Healthcare Information Technology Differ’, Journal of the American  Medical Informatics Association 21, no. 1 (January 2014): 117–31, https://doi.org/10.1136/amiajnl-2012-001419.  25 Positive Technologies, ‘Web Application Attack Statistics: Q2 2017’, September 2017,  http://blog.ptsecurity.com/2017/09/web-application-attack-statistics-q2.html.  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  25  Threat Description  Components  mechanical  disruption  Imaging devices such as MRI machines and CT scanners, include mechanical components which are  remotely controlled. A compromise can transfer control to a malicious actor and they can cause undesired  movement of these components. This can have direct impact to the patient.  3.1.5 System failures  Threat Description  Software failure  Any piece of software can have errors. Special security measures are taken in devices such as infusion  pumps, electrosurgical units, ventilators, medical use lasers, or devices that use ionizing radiation to work - radiology and radiotherapy equipment- that could generate physical damage if an error occurred. Lessons  have been learned from severe incidents occurred in the past26. The general rule is: all measures have to  be taken so no overdose can be administered under any circumstance.  These devices undergo extensive tests before going out to the market. In few occasions, their software is  updated by the manufacturer.  Servers are more prone to failure, not only because of failures in the design of their dedicated software but  because they rely in other software platforms (operating systems, programming frameworks, databases)  that can fail as well. If fact, experience has shown us that many errors occur after a software update.  Failures in medical servers occur normally as latent errors and, in some occasions, can stop the service.  They habitually disappear after server reboot. Analysis of the generated logs is crucial to find what the  cause of the error was. Failures that do not cause server breakdowns or service disruption (loss of  patients’ appointments or patient’s clinical information, for example) are usually detected several months  after the system has been running.  Several specially prepared tests should be run to ensure that the system does what it is expected to do. As  these systems run 24-7, finding downtime slots to run the tests can be very difficult if not impossible.  Frequent server failures deteriorate medical care and degrade confidence in the institution.  Outdated  firmware  Lack of procedures in place to update firmware in all devices (medical or not) in the hospital, is a top threat  for healthcare organisations and namely hospitals. Legacy systems and software offer back doors to  malicious actors that can access sensitive healthcare data.  Device failure  Failure of simply limited/reduced capability may severely impact processes that rely, e.g. on the real-time  collection of patient data, such as glucose measuring devices;  Network  components  failure  The interconnected ecosystem of a hospital has to be resilient as the requirement for real time data  analysis is high. If a component fails this can cause unavailability of a system, which can have cascading  effects to other healthcare systems (i.e. Patient Health Record)  Insufficient  maintenance  Lack of updates or lack of patching is another very common threat that can have great impact to the  healthcare organisation, i.e. malware spread. Operational issues might be left unresolved eventually  jeopardising patients’ health.  26 More information at “Overview of some major incidents in radiotherapy and their consequences”, Hamish Porter.

It is important that administrators of  healthcare organisations understand these risk factors and the negative impact they could  cause on the IT infrastructure, patients’ health, patients’ information, diagnosis and quality of  service.  The following table illustrates some indicative risk factors associated with each type of  procurement. This is not a comprehensive list of risk factors and the list should not be  considered exhaustive. Next to each factor there are sample negative outcomes.  Table 3: Risks in procurement  Type of procurement Risk Factors Negative outcome  Clinical information  systems  Infrastructure incapable  of handling system  New system sluggishness due to under rated server CPU or small  system memory.  Disk errors due to not enough disk space.  Network bandwidth unable to handle data traffic, affecting all the  Organization’s network communications.  Poorly designed or  poorly programmed  system  Erroneous results due to poor programming.  System errors due to lack of input validations.  Long user learning curve due to poorly designed user interfaces.  User errors due to poorly designed user interfaces.  Lack of security  considerations  Stolen credentials due to poor handling of passwords, i.e.,  passwords stored in clear text, allows intruder to steal patients’ data.  Fraud and errors, due to absence of separation of duties.  Opportunity for attackers due to lack of input validations, i.e., SQL  injection.  Absence of transaction records (logging) allows attacked to hide  their actions.  Industrial Control Systems  Known (published)  service password  Attackers are able to control BMS devices due to known (published)  administrator’s login credentials not changed during installation.  Once the attacker controls the device, he/she utilizes the device to  launch Denial of Service attacks on the Organization’s infrastructure.  Use of insecure network  protocols  Due to the use of insecure network protocols (HTTP), attackers are  able enter the Organization’s network.  BMS installed with open  and exposed ports  Open ports on a device can be used as an attack vector.  Poor physical security  protection of BMS  devices controllers and  workstations.  Attackers may gain physical access to consoles to install malware or  to sabotage the devices.  Medical Devices  Absence of  authentication controls  Intruder manages device console to produce erroneous results.  Each type of procurement carries its own risk factors. Consult the following list  to identify the main risks associated with the specific type of procurement you  are planning/managing. Work jointly with your IT, security or risk departments  to identify the best ways to address the relevant risks.  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  27  Unencrypted data  Transmission of data in clear text, allows attackers to alter sensor’s  results.  Use of insecure network  protocols  Attackers enter the Organization’s network.  Mobile connected medical  devices  Use of vulnerable  smartphone  Attackers may interfere with the correct operation of the medical  device.  Identification systems Unencrypted data  Due to the clear text transmission, attackers are able access user  identification and gain access to facilities.

GOOD PRACTICES FOR  CYBERSECURITY IN  PROCUREMENT  This chapter presents good practices for enhancing cybersecurity in procurement. The good  practices categorised per phase of the procurement lifecycle and for each one of these  description, examples, procurement type addressed, mitigated threat and evidence are  included. The general practices apply to all three stages of the lifecycle. In some cases, a good  practice may apply to two phases, in which case they are categorised under the phase where  they should first be applied or where they are most relevant.  The list of good practices below is by no means exhaustive; it gives however a solid advantage  to the healthcare IT professional responsible for purchasing equipment in a hospital. The set of  good practices are the collective result of all input received by healthcare professionals  interviewed. The reader can adapt the list based on the priorities of his/her organization.  How to use the good practices of this chapter:  Step 1: Identify the type of procurement you are planning/managing (Ch.2)  Step 2: (Optional) Identify the threats you are most interested in mitigating  (Ch.3)  Step 3: Identify the good procurement practices relevant for the identified type  of procurement (and threats)  Step 4: Assess on which phase of the procurement lifecycle cybersecurity  should be addressed. Understand the description and objectives to be achieved  in the selected good practices in the corresponding phase.  Step 5: Using the graphs provided, understand in which procurement phases  each good practice can be implemented  Step 6: See the indicative examples of how to implement each practice or  evidence that can be requested from supplier; adapt to your own procurement  practices/methodology as needed.  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  29  4.1 GENERAL GOOD PRACTICES  GP 1. Involve the IT department in procurement  Involve the IT department in the different stages of procurement to ensure that  expertise in cybersecurity aspects is considered  Examples/ Evidence  Involve IT staff in drafting cybersecurity requirements   Consult IT department to integrate cybersecurity considerations when planning  new procurements   Make cybersecurity requirements part of the RfP   It should be part of healthcare organization’s procurement policy to include IT  departments in all system, service or device acquisitions committees  Related Procurement Types All  Related Threats All  GP 2. Implement a vulnerability identification and management process  Ensure that vulnerabilities are considered before procuring new products or services  and that vulnerabilities of existing products/services are monitored throughout their  lifecycle  Examples/ Evidence  Establish a vulnerability management process to monitor and address  vulnerabilities of ICT products/services   Information on existing vulnerabilities may be obtained from the manufacturer or  from public sources, such as the NIST vulnerability database27   Address newly identified vulnerabilities accordingly and include provisions in the  RFP/contract for supplier responsibility in addressing vulnerabilities via timely  patching   Healthcare organizations may consider including a requirement for the Bill of  Materials (BOM28) used in acquired systems or products. This will may help in  the tracking of vulnerable systems in a healthcare organization's infrastructure based  on publicly available vulnerability information.  27 https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search  28 The practice of having a vendor publish a Bill Of Materials (BOM) of the actual software and hardware used in a system  allows any third party to track independently whether a certain device may be susceptible to a certain known vulnerability. It  is common for such BOM information to be disclosed to the Notified Bodies, so that the Notified Bodies may disclose  advisories about certain medical systems and devices. However, it may be beneficial for healthcare administrators to also  have access to such information in order to track vulnerable components across their infrastructure.  https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  30  Related Procurement Types Clinical information systems, medical devices, networking equipment, remote care  system, mobile client devices, identification systems, industrial control systems, cloud  services  Related Threats All  GP 3. Develop a policy for hardware and software updates  Develop an update policy to ensure that the latest patches to your OS and Software  are applied and that the antivirus Software is updated.  Examples/ Evidence  Create a registry / IT asset inventory of all current SW and HW running including  versions of SW and HW installed on them.   Regularly investigate if new patches are released.   Inform CISO/ISO of these new releases.   Test the proposed patch in some machines before taking the decision to patch  all the machines.   Determine the most suitable timing to apply the patches in every segment of the  network.   Determine workarounds for machines that cannot be patched.   Document the update procedure.   Define the involvement of third party providers.   Defined the actions to take to revert the situation if patched machines do not  work as expected  Related Procurement Types Medical Devices, Clinical Information Systems, Networking Equipment, Remote Care  System, Mobile Client Devices, Identification Systems, Industrial Control Systems,  Cloud Services  Related Threats Malicious Actions, Supply Chain Failure, System Failures  GP 4. Enhance security controls for wireless communication  Access to the Hospital’s Wi-Fi networks should be limited and strictly controlled.  Number of devices connected should be monitored and in the case of medical devices  should be verified and restricted. Non authorized personnel should not have access to  the Wi-Fi.  Examples/ Evidence  By default, strong Wi-Fi passwords (keep log of the frequency the password is  changed). This should be linked with a policy   Make two-factor authentication obligatory  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  31   Medical devices that require wireless communication have a dedicated wireless  network with strict access control and supporting dedicated policy   Access from public devices is prohibited  Related Procurement Types Medical devices, remote client devices, identification systems, cloud services  Related Threats Malicious actions, human error  GP 5. Establish testing policies  The healthcare organisation should establish a minimum set of security tests to be  performed on acquired products or system, depending on the product/system type. It  is also important to note that a newly acquired or newly configured product must  undergo a penetration test in its actual installed environment. In the same way,  remediating action taken must be inline with the operational parameters of the actual  environment.  Examples/ Evidence  For any type of product or system a set of security tests and assorted thresholds  are defined by the healthcare organisation   Testing policies cover all stages of procurement and may include periodic security  audits and penetration tests of systems already in production environment   Testing and thresholds are communicated to suppliers and are part of the RfP   Acceptance criteria are defined on the basis of the security tests before the  finalisation of procurement   The RfP/contract states specific supplier responsibilities to address findings  following security tests of systems in production   All the test policies should be revised and approved by the CISO   Some systems bill depending on the load. Talk about this issue with the provider  before running load tests that could entail a cost   Always prepare a contingency plan in case the server, the communications  system or the medical device stops working during a test   If the test load can potentially permanently stop a medical device or medical  system, verify if your maintenance plan covers a reset & reboot of the  device/system  Related Procurement Types Clinical information systems, medical devices, networking equipment, remote care  system, mobile client devices, identification systems, building management system,  industrial control systems, cloud services  Related Threats Malicious actions, system failures, human errors  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  32  GP 6. Establish Business Continuity plans  Business continuity plans should be established whenever the failure of a system may  disrupt the hospital’s core services and the role of the supplier is such cases must be  well-defined  Examples/ Evidence  It should be clear from the RfP what will be the supplier’s assistance services in  case of service interruption, including the cost of the supplier's services (during  and after warranty) and the response time (SLA) expected   Different disaster scenarios must be thought out when planning for business  continuity, and if the business continuity strategy includes supplier’s assistance,  this must be clearly stated in the RFP and put into the final contract   Costs and service level requirements for business continuity services must be  made clear during the RFP process   If failure of a newly acquired system may jeopardise the hospital's ability to provide  core services, the Business Continuity Plan must establish the strategy (replace  the device or change faulty components), the means and the procedures  necessary for an organization to keep its critical services available under the worst  of circumstances  Related Procurement Types Medical Devices, Clinical Information Systems, Networking Equipment, Remote Care  System, Mobile Client Devices, Identification Systems, Industrial Control Systems,  Cloud Services  Related Threats Malicious Actions, Supply Chain Failure, System Failures  GP 7. Take into account interoperability issues  Interoperability is one of the greatest cybersecurity risk for healthcare  organisations. The hospital’s IT ecosystem is comprised by different  components medical devices, networking equipment, remote care systems  etc. Some of these components exist already (legacy IT) and connection with  new components might result into security gaps.  Examples/ Evidence  The supplier should indicate how the solution proposed is integrated to  the already existing system. If necessary they should include in the offer  the technical documentation explaining how integration will take place   The supplier should also ensure that they monitor transmission (at least  for a predefined period of time) to avoid data loss  Related Procurement Types Clinical information systems, medical devices, Remote Care System, Mobile  Client Devices, Identification Systems, Industrial Control Systems, Cloud  services  Related Threats System failures, Human Error, Malicious actions  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  33  GP 8. Enable testing of all components  Information systems should be thoroughly tested to guarantee they deliver what is  promised:  verify easiness of use, check the correctness of results under load, and  check for security flaws (weak password policy, SQL injection). Testing should be a  requirement in procurement as well as monitoring during testing. Testing should be  aligned with testing policies  Examples/ Evidence  The supplier should include testing scenarios for the devices/ systems offered.  They should explain how testing should take place and how it will be coordinated.  Define benchmarks for every test   Reports from testing could be shared in confidence   Always prepare a contingency plan in case the server, the communications system  or the medical device stopped working during the test   If the test load can potentially permanently stop a medical device or medical  system, verify if your maintenance plan covers a reset & reboot of the  device/system  Related Procurement Types Clinical information systems, medical devices, remote client devices, identification  systems, cloud services, industrial control systems, remote care system, building  management system, mobile client devices  Related Threats Malicious actions, human error, system failures, supply chain failure  GP 9. Allow auditing and logging  Logs are a crucial part of the secure-test-analyse-improve strategy of security. If we  assume that sooner or later our system will be compromised, logs are one of the most  useful tools that we can use to trace back how attackers gained access to our system.  We can also evaluate how much information was compromised. Keeping the logs  secure is one of the most important tasks of security, although its absence does not  compromise already implemented security  Examples/ Evidence  Create a secure Central Logging System to keep a copy of the logs so these  files can be safely off-site in a secure location   Maintaining an external log system also allows for convenience. For instance, if  you have a server that crashed and is unresponsive, you can check the kernel  error logs on your centralized syslog server   The supplier could enable access to the logs for auditing purposes  Related Procurement Types Medical Devices, Remote Care System, Mobile Client Devices, Identification  Systems, Industrial Control Systems  Related Threats Malicious Actions, Supply Chain Failure, System Failures  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  34  GP 10. Encrypt sensitive personal data at rest and in transit  As a minimum, define a policy for systems, services or devices processing GDPR’s  Article 9 special categories of personal data. These types of information must be  always encrypted (whenever stored or transmitted). For all other personal data  categories, require encryption whenever the data leaves the Organization. Be  aware that in many instances this requirement does not fall on the supplier of the  system, service or device, but on the Organization itself. Data might be copied to an  external disk drive for storage in an alternate site. In this case, it is the  Organization’s responsibility to provide the mechanism for encryption  If data has to leave the Organization’s facilities as a system-to-system  communications process (sending data results to a remote processing centre), then  it is the supplier’s responsibility to provide a secure encrypted communications  protocol  Examples/ Evidence  Define if data must be encrypted, at storage or during transmission. Include  this requirement in the RfP. In the offer provided by the supplier look for the  algorithms and encryption methods. At this stage the Data Protection Officer  should be advised.   The supplier should explicitly define encryption methods for data at rest, data  in transit and for different types of data (sensitive health data vs personal data)   Sometimes the devices are unable to encrypt the information they provide.  Adequate gateways for encryption should be provided between the device and  our network  Related Procurement Types Medical Devices, Clinical Information Systems, Networking Equipment, Remote  Care System, Mobile Client Devices, Identification Systems, Industrial Control  Systems, Cloud Services  Related Threats Malicious Actions, Supply Chain Failure, System Failures  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  35  4.2 PLAN PHASE PRACTICES  GP11. Conduct a risk assessment as part of the procurement process  As part of the procurement process, healthcare organizations should conduct  risk assessments.  Examples/ Evidence  Before launching a new procurement process, healthcare organisations  should assess the impact of the new acquisition on their IT security risk  (e.g. new risk, increase/decrease in likelihood or impact of existing risk)   After identifying the risks associated to the acquisition of a system, service  or devices, a strategy for dealing with them must be designed and  integrated in their respective procurement (including budget changes,  specifications changes, etc.)   Risks should be identified early in the procurement process   Procurement planning may be cancelled or alternative solutions should be  examined in case of a significant increase in IT security risk associated with  a planned procurement  Related Procurement Types All  Related Threats All  GP 12. Plan network, hardware and license requirements in advance  Assess whether the new systems, service or device requires third party  software or whether the system will use current software but will need  additional licensing. Match hardware requirements (disk space, bandwidth,  CPU capacity, memory) gathered from suppliers during the RFP against  current and already planned capacity usage, to determine whether additional  upgrades and/or purchases must be made before installation to accommodate  the new system.  Examples/ Evidence  Some devices come with their own free-of-license software, others need  acquisition of additional software from the same company. Make your legal  department verify the terms of the licenses and their scope   Investigate if the software can be used directly as-provided or needs to be  configured   Check if licenses have to be renewed and if updates are covered   Check that you have available space in your data centre to accommodate  the new servers  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  36   Some of your external IT providers may need space in your data centre.  Reserve some space for unexpected future needs (and IPS/IDS server for  example)   Ensure that your existing power system (including auxiliary power units)  has enough capacity. Habitually there is lack of available plugs for the new  devices   Plan how the new devices will be physically linked to your network  Related Procurement Types Clinical Information Systems, Networking Equipment, Identification Systems,  Industrial Control Systems.  Related Threats Supply Chain Failure, System Failures, Natural Phenomena, Human errors  GP 13. Identify threats related to procurement products or services  Cybersecurity threats should be considered when planning procurement  of a new system, product or service and threat identification should be  continuous in the procurement lifecycle  Examples/ Evidence  Use a structured approach to accurately identify relevant threats   Include all relevant stakeholders when assessing threats associated  with a new procurement   The healthcare organisation’s threat modelling process should be  updated if applicable following the procurement of a new product or  service  Related Procurement Types All  Related Threats All  GP 14. Segregate your network  Sometimes the inherent vulnerabilities of the devices connected to the  network cannot be mitigated: for example, legacy devices that use Windows  NT that cannot be upgraded to newer OS. To protect the existing IT  infrastructure from these devices, compensating controls must be  implemented. It is important to isolate all network connected devices from the  rest of the network. To do so, implement network segmentation. With network  segmentation network traffic can be isolated and / or filtered to limit and / or  prevent access between network zones  Examples/ Evidence  In the RfP the hospital should provide a rough overview of the current  network topology and require the potential vendor to provide a new  topology taking into account network segregation practices   The vendor should provide information on security perimeter for the  network based on the medical devices connected. This information should  be included in the RfP  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  37  Related Procurement Types Medical Devices, Clinical Information Systems, Networking Equipment,  Remote Care System, Mobile Client Devices, Identification Systems, Industrial  Control Systems, Cloud Services  Related Threats Malicious Actions, Supply Chain Failure, System Failures  GP 15. Determine network requirements  After creating the network and components topology (how the devices are  connected to the systems), the hospital professionals should list the security  requirements for each different component also to ensure interoperability and  avoid gaps (bandwidth requirements etc.). The hospital needs to know  beforehand the security features they want the network equipment to have  Examples/ Evidence  Check your switches. Ensure that you have available space to connect the  new servers and devices   Create new virtual networks if needed   Are there enough wall-plugs or will devices communicate wirelessly?   Is bandwidth adequate? Verify if new lines are to be installed or if the  wireless router has enough speed and capability   Some devices may use different protocols other than TCP/IP. Check if  they will need special gateways to communicate with your network   Some devices do no encrypt communications by default. Check if the  device has encryption capabilities or if you have to provide them by  yourself through a gateway before data enters your network   Ensure that your device will not initiate unexpected communications with  third parties   Do external devices need a dedicated entry gateway or firewall?   Check and document ports in use   Design a redundant topology in case of main communications line failure  Related Procurement Types Clinical Information Systems, Networking Equipment, Identification Systems,  Industrial Control Systems, Cloud Services, Remote care systems, Mobile  client devices.

Establish eligibility criteria for suppliers  Establish security baseline requirements and translate them into eligibility  criteria when selecting suppliers.  Examples/ Evidence  For procurement purposes, healthcare organisations should have  baselines for common components such as PCs, Operating Systems,  communication protocols (e.g. no HTTP allowed), authentication  mechanisms (Single Factor Authentication or Two Factor Authentication),  databases, encryption, etc. Manufacturers that do not comply with the  baselines, cannot participate in the procurement process   Determine minimum security certification requirements for suppliers for  different types of procurement (e.g. for the supply of security services, the  supplier must be ISO 27001 certified)   Include the security baselines as part of the RFP document (eligibility  criteria)  Related Procurement Types Medical Devices, Clinical Information Systems, Networking Equipment,  Remote Care System, Mobile Client Devices, Identification Systems, Industrial  Control Systems, Cloud Services  Related Threats Malicious Actions, Supply Chain Failure, System Failures  GP 17. Create a dedicated RfP for procuring Cloud Services  When procuring Cloud Services, especially in the case of hospitals, specific  RfP should be put in place taking into account the regulatory and policy  requirements. In several Member States (MS), the state has issued guidelines  on what to ensure when buying cloud services  Examples/ Evidence  The Cloud service provider (CSP) should concretely state where the  hospital data is stored. The hospital should demand that the sensitive data  remains in the EU borders (so that EU data protection regulation applies).  They should also explain which encryption mechanisms they use   The CSP prove redundancy and business continuity in case of an incident.  Also they should share the process for incident reporting (as per the  requirements of the NIS Directive)   The CSP could share results of auditing and penetration testing with the  Hospital, in confidence  Related Procurement Types Cloud services  Related Threats Malicious Actions, Supply Chain Failure  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  39  4.3 SOURCE PHASE PRACTICES  GP 18. Require cybersecurity certification  Healthcare organisations should prioritise the procurement of assets that are  certified against cybersecurity schemes/standards.  Examples/ Evidence  Procured medical devices should adhere to the Medical Devices Regulation  (procurement should require the manufacturer to provide evidence)   Procurement should prioritise products that have been certified against EU  cybersecurity certification schemes, if applicable   For external services, such as cloud services, it is important to require that  the provider of the service has accredited security certifications, such as ISO  27001/ ISO 27018/ CCM etc.   When looking at certifications, it is important to understand the scope of the  certification and the scope of the service to be contracted. A provider of  cloud services might be ISO 27001 certified on some parts of the service  (customer support service) but not in other services which could be of more  importance to the Organization   If available online, healthcare organisations should review the vendor  certificates which come with the full report from the certification authority,  detailing its findings. The scope chapter of the report typically details each  service under scope. These documents are made available to provide  assurance on the offered services  Related Procurement Types Medical Devices, Clinical Information Systems, Networking Equipment, Remote  Care System, Mobile Client Devices, Identification Systems, Industrial Control  Systems, Cloud Services  Related Threats Malicious Actions, Supply Chain Failure, System Failures  GP 19.

Examples/ Evidence  Whenever the system, device or service under consideration processes  large volumes of special categories of information, a data protection impact  assessment (DPIA) must be conducted  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  40   Document the need for any given supplier to process personal data and limit  the data to whatever is necessary   Fully document the type of data that needs to be processed by a new  product/system and apply limitations in the RFP requirements  Related Procurement Types Clinical information systems, medical devices, networking equipment, remote  care system, mobile client devices, identification systems, professional services,  cloud services  Related Threats Malicious actions, human errors  GP 20. Set gateways to keep legacy systems/machines connected  Whenever a medical device must use an old version of OS known to have  vulnerabilities it should be maintained off the network; instead, a PC gateway  should be developed to communicate with this device to obtain the data and  pass it to the network, implementing encryption.  Sometimes a whole segment of the network should communicate through this  gateway. (e.g. all laboratory equipment). This gateway provides excellent  frontier control in case of problems inside these groups. Blocking the gateway  isolates all machines upstream. Follow this recommendation whenever the  machines inside the segment do not need to communicate with the rest of the  network except for one or two CIS servers.  Examples/ Evidence  Due to hardware or other requirements, some medical devices do not  allow for updates (e.g. some ultrasound machines may run on old  versions of Windows)   Medical devices have a long lifespan. The drivers used to  communicate with the machine may not be available in newer versions  of the OS and old OS versions must be kept to access data in the  machine   Community or Day Care centres may be using devices that were  discarded for use in the hospital but are still useful for not-so- demanding environments as these kind of centres  Related Procurement Types Medical Devices, Remote Care System, Mobile Client Devices, Identification  Systems, Industrial Control Systems  Related Threats Malicious Actions, Supply Chain Failure, System Failures  GP 21.

This regulation is based to some extent on ISO 9001. ISO 13485 requires only that the  certified organization demonstrate the quality system is effectively implemented and  maintained and is often seen as the first step in achieving compliance with European  regulatory requirements.  ISO 14971  ISO 14971 establishes the standard recommended for medical device risk management to  determine the safety of a medical device during the product life cycle. Such activity is  required by higher level regulation (EU directives 93/42/EEC, 90/385/EEC and 98/79/EEC)  and other quality management system standards such as ISO 13485.  Technical report ISO/TR 24971, also from ISO, provides guidance on the application of  this standard.  MDS2  The standard, ANSI/NEMA HN 1-2019, Manufacturer Disclosure Statement for Medical  Device Security, consists of the MDS2 form and instructions for completing it. The updated  MDS2 calls for medical device manufacturers to use a new spreadsheet, which is included  in the document, to describe their products’ security features in order to ease healthcare  organisations’ efforts to perform risk assessments and protect the data created, received,  transmitted, or maintained by their medical devices. Healthcare organisations can use data  in the new MDS2 form to compare equipment from different manufacturers and make  informed purchasing decisions that comply with their security and privacy policies.  Table 5: Standards related to the acquisition and management of health information systems  Standard Description  ISO / IEC 20000  The series ISO/IEC 20000 is the internationally recognized standard for Service  Management  in IT.  ISO 20000 specifies requirements for \"establishing, implementing, maintaining and  continually improving a service management system […] including planning, design,  transition, delivery and improvement of services”.  ISO 27000  ISO/IEC 27000-series provides best practice recommendations on information security  management.  ISO 27799  ISO 27799 defines guidelines to support the interpretation and implementation in health  informatics of ISO/IEC 27002 and is a companion to that International Standard.  By implementing ISO 27799:2016, healthcare organizations will be able to ensure a  minimum requisite level of security that is appropriate to their organization's circumstances  and that will maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of personal health  information in their care.  IEC 62304  The international standard IEC 62304 is a standard which specifies life cycle requirements  for the development of medical software and software within medical devices.  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  48  It is harmonized by the European Union (EU) and the United States (US), and therefore  can be used as a benchmark to comply with regulatory requirements from both these  markets.  Technical report ISO/TR 24971, also from ISO, provides guidance on the application of this  standard.  NIST-SP 800-66  Special Publication 800-66 Rev. 1, it’s a guide for implementing the Health Insurance  Probability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Security Rule, which discusses security  considerations and resources that may provide value when implementing the requirements  of the HIPAA Security Rule.

ISO 22857  ISO 22857:2013 Health informatics — Guidelines on data protection to facilitate trans-  border flows of personal health data, provides guidance on data protection requirements to  facilitate the transfer of personal health data across national or jurisdictional borders.  It is normative only in respect of international or trans-jurisdictional exchange of personal  health data. However it can be informative with respect to the protection of health  information within national/jurisdictional boundaries and provide assistance to national or  jurisdictional bodies involved in the development and implementation of data protection  principles.  Table 6: Standards related to the communication between healthcare devices and the sharing  of medical information  Standard Description  ISO 80001  ISO 80001 is the standard recommended for risk management in IT-networks  incorporating medical devices.  It defines the functions, responsibilities and activities that are necessary for the IT-Network  Risk Management to address safety, effectiveness and data and system security (the key  properties).  This standard does not specify acceptable risk levels, however, risk management activities  derive from the aforementioned standard, ISO 14971.  ISO 15225:2016 (withdrawn)  ISO 15225:2016 specified rules and guidelines for a medical device nomenclature data  structure, in order to facilitate cooperation and exchange of data used by regulatory bodies  on an international level between interested parties.  Included guidelines for a minimum data set and its structure. These guidelines are  provided for system designers setting up databases that utilize the nomenclature system  described herein.  The requirements contained in this International Standard were to be applicable to the  development and maintenance of an international nomenclature for medical device  identification.

DICOM  Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) is the most widely used  standard for the communication and management of medical imaging information and  related data. DICOM is most commonly used for storing and transmitting medical images  to Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) from multiple manufacturers.  DICOM defines the formats for medical images that can be exchanged with the data and  quality necessary for clinical use.  Its derived ISO standard, ISO 12052:2017, within the field of health informatics, addresses  the exchange of digital images and information related to the production and management  of those images, between both medical imaging equipment and systems concerned with  the management and communication of that information.  NIST NISTIR 7497.  NIST NISTIR 7497: also known as The Health Information Exchange (HIE) Security  Architecture defines guidelines to provide a systematic approach to designing a technical  security architecture for the exchange of health information.

Procurement is a key process shaping the ICT environment of modern hospitals  and, as such, should be at the forefront when it comes to meeting cybersecurity objectives.  This report aims to provide hospital procurement officers and CISOs/CIOs with a  comprehensive set of tools and good practices that can be adapted to the hospitals’  procurement process in order to ensure that cybersecurity objectives are met. In this context,  the report maps good practices in three distinct phases comprising the procurement lifecycle,  namely plan, source and manage. Indeed, cybersecurity considerations are relevant for all  three phases and this report offers an easy-to-use guide for hospitals to improve their  procurement process from a cybersecurity perspective.  This report provides the context for addressing cybersecurity in procurement by defining the  three procurement phases, identifying 10 types of procurement (assets, products, services etc.)  for which cybersecurity considerations are relevant, lists industry standards with cybersecurity  aspects relevant to these types of procurement and highlights the main respective cybersecurity  challenges. A threat taxonomy and a list of key risks associated with procurement are also  presented. All this information is accompanied by quick guides providing insights as to how  hospitals can use it in their procurement process.  The report concludes with a comprehensive set of good practices (GP) for cybersecurity in  procurement. These good practices can be general practices applicable throughout the  procurement lifecycle or may be relevant to individual procurement phases. All good practices  are linked to types of procurement for which they are relevant and to threats which they can  mitigate, providing an easy to filter set of practices for hospitals who want to focus on particular  aspects. Overall, hospitals are encouraged to adopt these good practices for cybersecurity in  procurement:   General practices:  o Involve the IT department in procurement  o Vulnerability management  o Develop a policy for hardware and software updates  o Secure wireless communication  o Establish testing policies  o Establish Business Continuity plans  o Consider interoperability issues  o Allow auditing and logging  o Use encryption   Plan phase:  o Conduct risk assessment  o Plan requirements in advance  o Identify threats  o Segregate network  o Establish eligibility criteria for suppliers  o Create dedicated RfP for cloud   Source phase  o Require certification  o Conduct DPIA  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  6  o Address legacy systems  o Provide cybersecurity training  o Develop incident response plans  o Involve supplier in incident management  o Organise maintenance operations  o Secure remote access  o Require patching   Manage phase  o Raise cybersecurity awareness  o Perform asset inventory and configuration management  o Dedicated access control mechanisms for medical device facilities  o Schedule penetration testing frequently or after a change in the architecture/  system  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  7  1. INTRODUCTION  Healthcare is becoming increasingly connected, as medical technology companies currently  manufacture more than 500,000 different types of medical devices, such as wearables,  implantable and stationary medical devices1. The Internet of Medical Things market in Europe  alone is expected to grow from 11 billion in 2017 to 40 billion in 2022, while the European  medical technology market was estimated at roughly 115 billion in 20172. At the same time, a  study showed that U.S. hospitals had, on average, between 10 and 15 connected devices per  bed, exemplifying how the proliferation of medical technology solutions has completely changed  the ICT landscape in healthcare organisations worldwide. All these devices are made by  different manufacturers, and all must effectively communicate with each other to deliver patient  care. The increasing interconnection of medical devices and the use of remote connections for  their maintenance; the need to continuously monitor the patients -even the ones out of the  hospital; the use of smartphones to access health information by patients and doctors; along  with the inability of the information technology (IT) department to apply patches and the usual  lack of budget for cybersecurity services and solutions, make the healthcare sector especially  vulnerable3. Cybersecurity should be considered in the early days of purchasing assets  (infrastructure, software, systems, devices etc.) for healthcare organisations.  1.1 OBJECTIVES  This study focuses on one part of the vast healthcare ecosystem: the hospital. The hospital is  considered as a collection of assets (infrastructure, software, systems, devices etc.), and  cybersecurity should be explicitly addressed in all its different components. Overall, the  objective of this study, is to provide healthcare professionals in hospitals with guidelines on how  to improve their procurement process to meet cybersecurity objectives. These guidelines cover  multiple topics and range from good organisational practices for the healthcare organisations  themselves, up to what information to request from suppliers as cybersecurity “evidences” when  procuring systems and services.  1.2 SCOPE  The scope of this study is on hospitals: the most complex and critical healthcare organisations  and the main stakeholder for procurement. Also hospitals often face lack of resources, so this  report aims at being a “guidebook” for healthcare professionals. Many of the practices and  recommendations will be useful to other healthcare organisations as well, as procurement  processes can be very similar. The procurement guidelines proposed in this report cover the  entire procurement scope of healthcare organisations that can potentially impact cybersecurity.  1.3 TARGET AUDIENCE  This report is addressed to healthcare professionals occupying technical positions in hospitals,  i.e. Chief-level executives: CIO4, CISO, CTO, IT teams as well as procurement officers in  healthcare organisations.  This report may be of interest to manufacturers of medical devices that provide products to  hospitals; in this case products can be (but are not limited to) medical devices, clinical  information systems, networking equipment, cloud services, etc. When these manufacturers  1 https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Life-Sciences-Health-Care/gx-lshc-medtech-iomt- brochure.pdf  2 https://www.medtecheurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/The-European-Medical-Technology-Industry-in-figures- 2019-1.pdf  3 Lynne Coventry and Dawn Branley, ‘Cybersecurity in Healthcare: A Narrative Review of Trends, Threats and Ways  Forward’, Maturitas 113 (July 2018): 48–52, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.maturitas.2018.04.008.  4 Chief Information Officer – CIO, Chief Information Security Officer – CISO, Chief Technology Officer – CTO etc  During the  Wannacry attack  in 2017, a  ransomware  spread  exponentially,  taking advantage  of a vulnerability  present only in 5%  of the UK National  Healthcare System  (NHS) computers,  which were still  running outdated  and unsupported  software.  https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Life-Sciences-Health-Care/gx-lshc-medtech-iomt-brochure.pdf https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Life-Sciences-Health-Care/gx-lshc-medtech-iomt-brochure.pdf https://www.medtecheurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/The-European-Medical-Technology-Industry-in-figures-2019-1.pdf https://www.medtecheurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/The-European-Medical-Technology-Industry-in-figures-2019-1.pdf  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  8  offer services or products, they will know the security requirements that the hospital expects  them to fulfil and they can provide evidence to prove it.  1.4 METHODOLOGY  Information presented in this report is the result of analysis of data received through a series of  interviews. The interviews were conducted with subject matter experts from hospitals, policy  makers or regulators (ministries of health), medical device manufacturers and cybersecurity  experts with a focus in healthcare. The report was validated by the experts participating in the  survey/interviews, as well as with the ENISA eHealth Security Experts Group5.  This methodology enabled ENISA to engage actively with the interested stakeholders and:   identify the types of procurement and corresponding assets with relevance to the  hospitals’ cybersecurity objectives,   identify possible threats, risks and challenges related to procurement in hospital  organisations,   list good practices related to healthcare procurement in order to meet cybersecurity  objectives, and   map the proposed good practices to types of procurement for which they may be used  and to threats for which they are relevant.  1.5 POLICY CONTEXT  1.5.1 European Policy  Legislation plays a major role in defining the cybersecurity requirements that should be  described in the technical specifications when obtaining products and services in a hospital.  Some of the most prominent are presented below:  1.5.1.1 The Network and Information Security Directive (NISD)  The Network and Information Security Directive (NISD) 2016/1148/EU, which came into force in  May 2018, has two main goals: the implementation of minimum security requirements and the  establishment of cybersecurity notifications for both Operators of Essential Services and Digital  Service Providers. Healthcare providers, namely hospitals, are identified as Operators of  Essential Services in most Member States. Therefore, these organizations will have to take into  account the Directive and the respective national law when contracting a product or service.  The Directive goes beyond implementation of security requirements, as it gives power to the  regulatory bodies to audit the Operators of Essential Services to ensure the level of  cybersecurity in the organization is acceptable and as per the provisions of the Directive. In the  hospital ecosystems, this can be translated as cybersecurity requirements for all the products so  it should be included as a provision in the procurement process. One vulnerable  device/system/service can result into great cybersecurity impact for the hospital as an operator  of essential service.  1.5.1.2 Medical Device Regulation (MDR)  The Medical Device Regulation (MDR) is a new regulation that includes specific provisions  related to the IT security (hardware, software etc.) for all medical devices. The General Safety  and Performance Requirements defined within the MDR (Medical Devices/SW) include:   repeatability, reliability and performance according to the intended use   the principles of development life cycle, risk management, verification and validation   the use of software in combination with mobile computing platforms  5 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/ehealth-security  European legislation  introduces a  notification  obligation to the  hospitals. In some  cases the  notification should  follow the supply  chain. This has to  be foreseen during  the procurement  process.  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/ehealth-security  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  9   IT security measures, including protection against unauthorised access  The Medical Device Coordination Group (MDCG) published the Guidance on Cybersecurity  for medical devices6 in December 2019 in order to provide manufacturers with guidance on  how to fulfil all the relevant essential requirements of the MDR. These cybersecurity  requirements, listed in Annex I of the Medical Devices Regulations, deal with both pre-market  and post-market aspects. The MDCG is composed of representatives of all Member States and  it is chaired by a representative of the European Commission. The MDCG provides advice to  the Commission and assists the Commission and the Member States in ensuring a harmonised  implementation of medical devices Regulations.  1.5.1.3 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)7 came into force on 25 May 2018. It sets the  rules for the processing and free movement of personal data and applies to all domains of the  public and private sector; however, some specific derogations are defined for data concerning  health, aiming at protecting the rights of data subjects and confidentiality of their personal health  data and at the same time preserving the benefits of data processing for research and public  health purposes.  GDPR treats health data as a \"special category\" of personal data which are considered to be  sensitive by nature and imposes a higher standard of protection for their process. Organizations  processing health data have the following obligations (among others):   to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure security of the  processing systems, services and personal data,   to perform data protection impact assessment, and   to report data breaches which are likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of  individuals within 72 hours after having become aware of.  Article 4 (12) of the GDPR defines a “personal data breach” as a breach of security leading to  accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to,  personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed; It has to be noted that if a data  breach incident impacts the continuity of the health services as well, then it has to be reported  according to the NIS Directive.  1.5.2 International Policy  1.5.2.1 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)8  This Act required the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to  develop regulations protecting the privacy and security of certain health information. The  Security Standards for the Protection of Electronic Protected Health Information (the Security  Rule) establish a national set of security standards for protecting certain health information that  is held or transferred in electronic form. The Security Rule operationalizes the protections  contained in the Privacy Rule by addressing the technical and non-technical safeguards that  organizations called “covered entities” must put in place to secure individuals’ “electronic  protected health information” (e-PHI).  1.5.2.2 FDA Guidance for cybersecurity9  6 https://ec.europa.eu/docsroom/documents/38941  7 REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016 on the  protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and  repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation)  8 https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ191/html/PLAW-104publ191.htm  9 https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/content-premarket-submissions- management-cybersecurity-medical-devices  https://ec.europa.eu/docsroom/documents/38941 https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ191/html/PLAW-104publ191.htm https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/content-premarket-submissions-management-cybersecurity-medical-devices https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/content-premarket-submissions-management-cybersecurity-medical-devices  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  10  This guidance has been developed by the FDA to assist industry by identifying issues related to  cybersecurity that manufacturers should address in the design and development of their  medical devices as well as in preparing premarket submissions for those devices.  If a manufacturer would aim for internal markets, then the device should comply with both  European and international law.  1.6 STRUCTURE OF THE REPORT  The study is structured as follows:  Section 2: Definition of the context around Healthcare Procurement Processes and its variants  with an overview of the concepts discussed and the related security challenges.  Section 3: Threat and risk analysis containing a taxonomy of the threats and examples of  Healthcare sector attack scenarios.  Section 4: Description of good procurement practices mapped to threats and types of  procurement.  Annex A: List of relevant industry standards  Each section of the report is accompanied by a description of how  hospitals can use the information provided in the section to address  cybersecurity in their procurement processes. The relevant descriptions  are given in text boxes such as this one.  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  11  2. PROCUREMENT IN  HOSPITALS  2.1 PROCUREMENT PROCESS  Since the hospital ecosystem is comprised by several IT components, cybersecurity should be  examined separately in all these different components. Cybersecurity should be part of all  different stages of the procurement process. In this section, we present the common stages of  the procurement process for obtaining products and services (including medical devices,  information systems and infrastructures), together with some considerations as per each stage of  the process.  Figure 1: Procurement process lifecycle for hospitals  Understand where cybersecurity fits in the different phases of the procurement  lifecycle. This section indicates what cybersecurity considerations should be  addressed when planning procurement, in the source process and in the post-  sales/manage phases.  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  12   Plan phase: Initially, the hospital analyses its needs and collects requirements from  several divisions internally. For example, in the case of obtaining a new cloud service,  the CTO should identify the needs and understand what kind of usability this service  will offer.   Source phase: Afterwards, the requirements are translated into technical specifications  and, in collaboration with the procurement office, the sourcing process begins (e.g., a  tender is published). The hospital receives the designated offers, the committee  (including the CTO/ CISO or and member of the IT team) evaluates the offers and  selects the most appropriate products. Negotiations are conducted with the contractor  and the contract is awarded.   Manage phase: Finally, the contract (management and monitoring) is assigned to the  business owner within the hospital. The assigned officer is responsible for closing the  tender and receiving any feedback from users on the actual performance of the  equipment/system/service.  Throughout the different phases of the procurement lifecycle, the hospital should ensure  cybersecurity is considered as a requirement for the product/service to be procured. Relevant  considerations may include:   Plan phase: The cybersecurity risks associated with a new procurement are assessed  and specific cybersecurity requirements for the new procurement are defined.   Source phase: Cybersecurity requirements are translated into technical specifications  and product security features and supplier responsibilities for cybersecurity aspects are  clarified and included in the contracts.   Manage phase: Cybersecurity aspects, such as incidents and new vulnerabilities are  continuously monitored and corrective measures, such as patching are applied to  maintain a high level of security. Similarly, at the end of the products lifecycle, secure  disposal is required for privacy reasons as devices have patient information stored.  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  13  2.2 TYPES OF PROCUREMENT  As discussed throughout this document, the hospital is an ecosystem comprised by several  components and cybersecurity should be a priority for all these different components. In this  chapter we created a taxonomy to categorise the types of procurement and eventually investigate  how cybersecurity is addressed in each type.  Figure 2: Types of procurement (asset taxonomy)  Cybersecurity considerations are relevant for a number of different types of  procurement. Consult the following list to understand if the specific type of  procurement you are planning/managing has possible cybersecurity  implications that should be addressed.  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  14  Table 1: Types of procurement  Type of procurement Type description  Clinical information systems  Includes procurement of any kind of software oriented to medical care:  - Hospital Information Systems & Electronic Medical Record (HIS-EMR),  - Laboratory Information System (LIS),  - Radiology Information System, Picture Archiving and Communication System (RIS- PACS),  - Pharmacy,  - Drug Databases,  - Care Management,  - Diet Software,  - Computer Physician Order Entry (CPOE),  - Big Data analysis, etc.  CIS must be located in the medical building or in a data centre facility under  complete control of the IT division of the medical centre. Cloud-based systems have  their own category.  Medical devices  Any piece of hardware dedicated to treatment, control or diagnosis of diseases:  radiology equipment, radiotherapy, nuclear medicine, operative room or intensive  care equipment, robots for surgery, electro-medical equipment, infusion pumps,  spirometry devices, medical lasers, endoscopy equipment, etc.  Includes patient implantable devices10 (holters, pacemakers, insulin pumps, cochlear  implants, brain stimulators, cardiac defibrillators, gastric stimulators, etc.11) or  wearables (external EKG or pressure holters, glucose monitors, etc.) given they  communicate by electronic means with the IT systems of the hospital.  Network equipment  Network lines (coaxial, optical), gateways, routers, switches, firewalls, VPNs, IPS,  IDS, etc.  Remote care systems  Facilities or devices to provide care outside the hospital environment, especially what  today is called “Hospital-based home care services”.  Can include the remote communication “press-for-help” devices used for the help of  the elderly population that live alone at home.  Mobile client devices  All piece of software that provides health assistance or medical data collection not  directly connected to the hospital network; for example: telemedicine apps. It does not  include health wearables as they are included into a separate category.  Mobile client devices need a defined protocol to connect to the hospital network.  Identification systems  Systems to uniquely identify patients or medical personnel (biometric scanners, card  readers etc.) and guarantee identification and/or authorization to access the IT  systems.  Building Management Systems  Any type of construction that can hold medical facilities. It includes electricity lines,  water, gas, medical gases, furniture, etc. except network lines, which is included  under the “network equipment” category.  Building Management Systems (BMS) are  included in the next procurement category as they are, mainly, control systems.  Industrial control systems  Systems that control all physical aspects of the centres such as power regulation  systems, door lock systems, close circuit security systems, HVAC12 systems, alarm  systems, water, heating,  auxiliary power units, security access, elevators, fire  extinguishing, etc. Nowadays, control of all these systems is managed through  10 Knee or hip replacements or intraocular lens are also examples or “medical devices” as well but are out of the scope of  this study.

The following section lists existing standards and protocols that  directly, or indirectly, have a relation to procurement.  An industry standard very relevant to cybersecurity and procurement is the Manufacturer  Disclosure Statement for Medical Device Security (MDS2). The MDS2 form provides  medical device manufacturers with a means of disclosing the security-related features of their  medical devices. The MDS2 form provides a set of medical device security questions and allows  for comparison of security features across different devices and different manufacturers.  As of today, ISO is developing more than 25 new standards in Medical Informatics, some of the  most interesting being:   ISO/DTR 22696 Health informatics — Guidance for identification and  authentication for connectable personal healthcare devices ,   ISO/DTR 21332 Health informatics — Cloud computing considerations for health  information systems security and privacy,   ISO/WD 13131 Health informatics — Telehealth services — Quality planning  guidelines,   ISO/AWI 22697 Health informatics — Application of privacy management to  personal health information  In addition, a number of guidelines, standards and good practices exist at EU and Member  State level. A brief overview of the relevant landscape is depicted in Figure 3.  There already exist a number of regulations, international standards and good  practices on healthcare systems, products and services that include  cybersecurity baselines.

As one interviewee pointed out, the most  challenging threats are normally associated with procurements for which the IT department is  not typically involved.  Other interesting challenges not included in the list but pointed out by the stakeholders were  “Maintenance Services” and challenges associated with free software handed over by some  medical suppliers.  Based on the feedback from the interviews with the stakeholders, several key challenges  associated with procurement in healthcare organisations were identified. These challenges  have been grouped based on the previously defined types of procurement.  Clinical Information Systems   Component vulnerability: Information systems in healthcare organisations are  usually made of different pieces from different suppliers. Besides that, these systems  interact and share files and data, so a vulnerability of one component can affect  others.   Increasing interoperability: Software specialization, and new trends as big data,  analytics, create the need of sharing patient data between different systems. This  process needs to be done in a secure way, using appropriate protocols and  transmitting only the required data to only the right receiver.   Full continuous operation: Healthcare organisations usually operate 24x7, and  resources are scarce, so stopping a modality or even a desktop computer can impact  seriously the service. When an incident is detected, it is sometimes really difficult to  isolate the equipment, and thus this make propagation easier. In such cases the  procurement process should require from providers contingency plans and  redundancy.  Medical devices   Manufacturing processes: Although this topic has been traditionally strictly  controlled by medical device suppliers, actually it is very common to have third-party  suppliers of software and electronics in their supply chain. This introduces new  challenges for manufacturers: they need not only to check materials, durability, or  sterilization, they now have to test software and electronics to ensure they are robust  and secure before putting the device into the market.   Rented equipment: Especially when considering expensive healthcare equipment, it  is common to rent devices that could have been previously used by other healthcare  organisations, and often come with default set up. Procurement of rental services  should establish measures to avoid risks of this practice.  Many systems, products or services procured by hospitals introduce or are  characterised by significant cybersecurity challenges. Consult this section for a  list of the key relevant challenges and identify what are the major challenges  associated with the specific type of procurement you are planning/managing.  Work jointly with your IT, security or risk departments to identify the best ways  to address the relevant challenges.  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  19   Legacy devices: Medical equipment usually is very expensive; these devices are  expected to be in service for many years. Due to this long life cycle, buyers can  sometimes have difficulties in getting maintenance support from manufacturers. For  this reason, vulnerabilities cannot always be corrected, and thus can be exploited  through cyberattacks.   Hidden functionalities: Medical equipment is always complex to manage and set  up. Neither doctors nor the IT department are usually trained on new equipment. The  habitual action is to leave this equipment13 in a standard setup, so preventing default  passwords and ensure that unknown functionalities are not activated is another  challenge in these environments. Devices can have operative procedures  implemented (e.g. requests for date/time, communication of technical & service data  to the manufacturer, requests for maintenance, automatic updates etc.) unknown to  the buyer that could trigger security alerts on the IPS system of the hospital. That  interconnectivity opens up an array of opportunities for malicious individuals to gain  access to the organization’s IT infrastructure.   Updates / Lifecycle management: The most recent devices have usually the  functionality of being operated remotely. This allows the providers to reduce  maintenance costs and perform other operations. But these cases, if ignored or  neglected, can result in back doors in the organisation because they are often set up  without knowledge of the IT department.  Building Management Systems – Industrial Control Systems   IT/OT hybrid solutions: Hybrid solutions make possible the convergence between  digital and physical worlds, ranging from smart buildings to digital twins, and  including for example real time location systems for patients and valuable assets,  hospital laundries, pharmacy systems, or surgery blocks. Of course, this opens a new  scenario for threats and risks that healthcare organisations should deal with.  Networking   Unprotected protocols: As in other sectors, protocols have been designed with the  use cases in mind but ignoring abuse cases. On the other hand, health data is very  persistent: a data leakage could have permanent impact in patients. Improving the  security of protocols used to exchange patient data is crucial.  Professional services   Human factors: Users’ awareness allows healthcare organisations to improve their  level of protection almost exponentially. In healthcare, nonetheless, the pressure and  the need of providing urgent health care sometimes makes more likely for a user to  relax good practices in cybersecurity to provide health care to patients14.   Patient safety: In healthcare organisations there are two specific conditions that  make information systems different from the rest of the IS: (1) Patient data is  permanent, cannot be changed if privacy is broken (as you could do with your credit  card number for example); and (2) cyberattacks can become physical and cost  human lives. Clinicians work hard to improve patient safety and medical devices and  IT services must be considered another layer in patient safety15. This should be the  key in the procurement phase specific cybersecurity requirements.  13 Clemens Scott Kruse et al., ‘Cybersecurity in Healthcare: A Systematic Review of Modern Threats and Trends’,  Technology and Health Care 25, no. 1 (21 February 2017): 1–10, https://doi.org/10.3233/THC-161263.  14 Ross Koppel et al., ‘Workarounds to Computer Access in Healthcare Organizations: You Want My Password or a Dead  Patient?’, Studies in Health Technology and Informatics 208 (2015): 215–20.  15 ECRI Institute, ‘2019 Top 10 Health Technology Hazards Executive Brief’ (ECRI Institute, 2018).  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  20  3. CYBERSECURITY IN  PROCUREMENT  3.1 THREAT TAXONOMY  Threat sources are the other risk factors that must be taken into consideration when analysing  risk. A threat source is characterized as: (i) the intent and method targeted at the exploitation of  a vulnerability; or (ii) a situation and method that may accidentally exploit a vulnerability16. Some  examples of threat sources are: an individual, an organization, a customer, hack activist, a user,  a privileged user/administrator, failure of a storage device, failure of a temperature control,  failure of an operating system, fire. Keep in mind that the list of threat sources is quite large.  Previously referenced NIST Special Publication 800-30 Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments  appendix D, contains table D-2 with a useful taxonomy of threat sources.  Based on the last ENISA reports on Smart Hospitals (2016)17 and the 2018 threat landscape  report18 this study analyses the top cyber threats with a specific focus in healthcare ( for  example medjacking and medical equipment threats).  16 Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative, ‘Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments’ (Gaithersburg, MD: National  Institute of Standards and Technology, 2012), https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-30r1.  17 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-security-and-resilience-for-smart-hospitals  18 European Union and Agency for Network and Information Security, ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2018: 15 Top  Cyberthreats and Trends., 2019, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report- 2018/at_download/fullReport.  Different types of procurement are associated with various threats to a  hospital's ICT environment. Consult the threat taxonomy presented in this  section together with your IT, security or risk department to identify which  threats are most relevant to your organisation. This activity should be part of  the IT tasks in the hospital regardless of the procurement potential.  You can  then prioritise the good procurement practices presented in Chapter 4 that can  mitigate the identified threats.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-security-and-resilience-for-smart-hospitals  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  21  Figure 4: General overview of healthcare threats  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  22  The proposed threat taxonomy comprises of five groups, described in more detail in the  following matrices:  3.1.1 Natural phenomena  Threat Description  Natural  phenomena  Fire, floods or earthquakes are infrequent but possible threats for the infrastructure and overall equipment  (devices, network components etc.). Habitually, computerized tomography scan machines, magnetic  resonance imaging equipment, radiotherapy equipment and other highly expensive devices are usually  located in the ground floor or at the basement of the hospitals -either by regulatory laws or just because  their weight and dimensions- and are specially affected by this type of phenomena.  It should be noted, that failures due to floods or fires i.e. broken pipe flooding the basement of a patient  room can have different impact than a disaster due to natural phenomena (wildfire, storm, tsunami etc.)  and eventually could affect the whole hospital and its surrounding or supply chain provider.  3.1.2 Supply chain failure  Threat Description  Cloud Services  provider failure  Not all services are hosted in hospital servers. Accounting, salaries, stock control may be outsourced and  depend on third party cloud services. Nearly all of the personal IoT medical devices work in the cloud. In  fact, some hospitals -especially regional or small associated centres-, can have their entire electronic  health record system located in other site. These services, if not adequately backed up to work off-line,  may cause severe disruptions in the provision of medical services.  Network provider  failure  A network failure can have devastating effects. Most of the main hospital centres form a hub between the  main building and its associated centres -mostly radiology or ambulatory or day-care centres-. Redundancy  and topology design are crucial when mitigating this type of threat.  Power supply  failure  Loss of electricity can be of importance depending of the equipment affected. Intensive care units,  operative rooms, servers and clients are usually protected by uninterruptible power sources or batteries but  other equipment such as MRI or CT machines can be compromised.  Medical device  manufacturer  failure / non- liability  All medical devices can have design errors in their systems. These latent errors may arise under certain  circumstances during the normal use of the device. Most of the times, these errors are known and cannot  be mitigated because the device does not allow for updates. If the manufacturers who make this equipment  are acquired by larger companies or run out of business there may be problems with device updates or  repairs. Also, security information shared with third parties can be compromised.  3.1.3 Human errors  Threat Description  Medical system  configuration  error  Not changing factory-default passwords is one of the most common errors that gives attackers access to  the devices once they have gained access to the network. Other errors of this kind can be, for example, to  configure our device to allow incoming connections from any address or communicate using non-encrypted  protocols.  Absence of audit  logs  Logs are a crucial part of the secure-test-analyse-improve strategy of security. If we assume that sooner or  later our system will be compromised, logs are one of the most useful tools that we can use to trace back  how attackers gained access to our system. We can also evaluate how much information was  compromised. Keeping the logs secure is one of the most important tasks of security, although its absence  does not compromise already implemented security.  In some circumstances logs may be a legal requirement for normal operation of the system (e.g. access to  medical history)  Unauthorised  access control /  lack or  processes  Due to the variety of roles in a hospital (i.e. physicians, caregivers, administration) access control  procedures should be in place. As the priority to all hospital staff is care, workarounds are often the case  when it comes to access control (including all types of access control from buildings to systems and  accounts). This poses great threats to the hospital interconnected environment.  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  23  Threat Description  Non-compliance  (BYOD)  Today’s employees want the freedom to work from any location and any device at any time of day. These  individuals are increasingly using their personal mobile devices to undertake work tasks. From a business  perspective, enabling BYOD is an advantageous strategy19. However, bring-your-own-device (BYOD) can  also represent a significant risk for organisations. For the IT department, there is massive pressure to find  a way to securely enable BYOD. Failure to do so can lead to malware outbreaks, noncompliance with  regulatory requirements, and corporate exposure in the wake of personal device theft.  Medical staff /  patient error  There is always the possibility of human error when entering data by either part, particularly when entering  the clinical history number. Sometimes two patients can have identical names and the clinical information  of one can be written on the medical history of the other. This is of critical importance when the information  provided will activate subsequent clinical decisions that will affect the patient’s health: e.g. a patient with  the same name as other could be misdiagnosed of cancer. In the worst case the patient could receive non- needed surgery (amputations) or radio/chemotherapy. On the contrary, a patient with cancer could receive  an invalid report of normality and delay a treatment that could potentially improve his/her status.  Although the impact is low because only affects one or two patients, global impact on the company’s or  healthcare organisation's reputation can be very high.  3.1.4 Malicious actions  Threat Description  Malware:  -Virus  -Ransomware  -BYOD  In healthcare organisations, IT systems are strongly interconnected and difficult to isolate without  generating service disruption, creating a comfortable ecosystem for malware.  Enterprises with a very large number of devices may have difficulties updating their licenses because of  the elevated costs.  Adware is one of the easiest ways to distribute malware and more often ignored by users20 .  Ransomware is perhaps the most known threat for healthcare organisations, due mainly to the Wannacry  case. Ransomware usually makes indiscriminate low-cost attacks. It’s very easy to infect healthcare  infrastructure because of two factors; (i) software infrastructure is hard to keep updated because it’s very  difficult to get a downtime slot, (ii) machines that run legacy software that only works on specific OS or  drivers’ version turns out to be an easy target for these attacks. Many of these legacy devices that cannot  be updated act as reservoirs for the malware helping it spread through the network.  Enterprises that allow bring-your-own-device (BYOD) without appropriate policies are exposed to additional  risks.  Hijack:  Cryptojacking /  Medjacking  Medical equipment needs usually real time communications, and clinicians need also a quick response  from the system when they look for patient data or test information. Dedicating processor time or  communication capacity to mining cryptocurrency impacts performance and of course, the health care  provision.  The difference between cryptojacking and medjacking is basically the kind of hardware involved. In the first  case we are talking about general purpose IT infrastructure and in the second we are referring to IT-based  medical equipment.  Social  engineering:  -Phishing  -Baiting  -Device cloning  Compromised email (phishing, spam and spear-phishing) is the dominating attack vector for malware  infections. According to Verizon DBIR334, email compromise was the attack vector for 92,4% of detected  malware21. Most organizations still allow access to private mail web accounts in most of the computers of  the hospital.  Mail addresses from clinicians are easy to collect through hospital public directories, existing presentations  on the web, etc. In our research, we found both cases of using professional e-mail accounts for personal  matters, and cases of using personal e-mail accounts for professional matters.  Fight against phishing is not easy: keeping an adequate user awareness is very difficult. Multiple factors  have been blamed: most personnel in the health field has no technical knowledge at all, a stressful  19 BYOD and GDPR: Managing the compliance conundrum.

Device cloning (ID cards) requires a high level of specialization and the necessity to get closer to the victim  to clone his/her ID. Two factor identification has made this type of threat very unlikely.  Theft:  - Device  - Data  The cost of medical devices is very high. Stealing of medical equipment is a very common crime. Devices  are usually sold in the second-hand market of underdeveloped countries or for veterinary uses for a  fraction of their price. Small to medium-sized portable devices as ultrasound equipment, EKG,  defibrillators, infusion pumps or vital signs monitors are among the most robbed pieces.  Devices should not expose medical data unless adequately logged in. Unfortunately, most of them use the  factory default credentials.  The lack of involvement of IT security department in setting up and managing medical equipment, the lack  of risk-awareness of the staff can generate information leaks that could impact on reputation, patient  privacy, penalties, or even patient safety.  Medical device  tampering  Unprotected communications between medical devices and servers can result in tampering of the  information. Sophisticated man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks can change the data coming from vital signs  monitors, laboratory, pathology reports or even DICOM images coming from CT scans, MRI or ultrasound  systems in their way to the PACS server.  Skimming  Skimming (stealing of credit card information) can occur from breaches in patients’ administrative data. It is  unlikely to occur in public health systems where no payment is the rule and social security numbers are  used instead. That is not the case in private institutions.  When protection of administrative data becomes secondary against protection of medical records, a breach  can occur more easily.  Large shopping areas, and e-commerce systems seem to be the target for this type of organized criminals.  Great effort from some public and private organizations has been made in the last years to prevent fraud in  this area and is out of the scope of this report.  Denial of service  Denial of Service is a very common cyberattack that can take down servers at a healthcare organisation,  especially because they are usually reluctant to use public cloud infrastructure, so the capacity of servers  is limited. The impact can be high, depending on the type of systems affected.  Web based  attacks  Extended use of undocumented web services for interoperability purposes, and the delay in applying  updates, trying to keep the system configuration without changes and to reduce the downtime as much as  possible, makes it easier to exploit known vulnerabilities.  Web application  attacks  SQL Injection and Denial of Service represent the 68,8% of web application attacks, while in government  institutions represent only the 26% or 27,7% globally. SQL injection alone represents the 46% in the case  of healthcare, similar percentage to energy and manufacturing companies, another environment where  industrial equipment is very frequent25.  Insider threat  Hospital staff can act as insider threats, at any position (physicians, nurses, administrative, maintenance,  etc.), but patients or guests can act also from within the hospital, given that access cannot be restricted to  certain areas.  Physical  manipulation /  damage  Medical equipment can be very expensive, and many times, physical access is granted to non-authorized  or poorly trained personnel -if not-trained at all-, allowing manipulation, damages, theft or loss of this  equipment or the information assets they contain.  Identity theft  There are 2 cases: employees’ identity or patients’ identity. The first case can be dangerous because  impersonating a doctor or nurse allows, for example, to do wrong prescriptions or diagnose a patient of a  certain disease, and the second case could be used to fraud the healthcare system and introduce wrong  diagnoses as well.  Cyber espionage  Interest of multinational pharmaceutic industries or other interest groups on clinical research results or  patient data can be one the drivers of this kind of threats. Cases have been documented of new technology  that it’s being tested in a hospital and other nations have been spying with the intention of copying this new  technology or treatment.  22 Annalena Welp et al., ‘Teamwork and Clinician Burnout in Swiss Intensive Care: The Predictive Role of Workload, and  Demographic and Unit Characteristics’, Swiss Medical Weekly, 24 March 2019, https://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2019.20033.  23 Koppel et al., ‘Workarounds to Computer Access in Healthcare Organizations’.  24 Sean W Smith and Ross Koppel, ‘Healthcare Information Technology’s Relativity Problems: A Typology of How Patients’  Physical Reality, Clinicians’ Mental Models, and Healthcare Information Technology Differ’, Journal of the American  Medical Informatics Association 21, no. 1 (January 2014): 117–31, https://doi.org/10.1136/amiajnl-2012-001419.  25 Positive Technologies, ‘Web Application Attack Statistics: Q2 2017’, September 2017,  http://blog.ptsecurity.com/2017/09/web-application-attack-statistics-q2.html.  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  25  Threat Description  Components  mechanical  disruption  Imaging devices such as MRI machines and CT scanners, include mechanical components which are  remotely controlled. A compromise can transfer control to a malicious actor and they can cause undesired  movement of these components. This can have direct impact to the patient.  3.1.5 System failures  Threat Description  Software failure  Any piece of software can have errors. Special security measures are taken in devices such as infusion  pumps, electrosurgical units, ventilators, medical use lasers, or devices that use ionizing radiation to work - radiology and radiotherapy equipment- that could generate physical damage if an error occurred. Lessons  have been learned from severe incidents occurred in the past26. The general rule is: all measures have to  be taken so no overdose can be administered under any circumstance.  These devices undergo extensive tests before going out to the market. In few occasions, their software is  updated by the manufacturer.  Servers are more prone to failure, not only because of failures in the design of their dedicated software but  because they rely in other software platforms (operating systems, programming frameworks, databases)  that can fail as well. If fact, experience has shown us that many errors occur after a software update.  Failures in medical servers occur normally as latent errors and, in some occasions, can stop the service.  They habitually disappear after server reboot. Analysis of the generated logs is crucial to find what the  cause of the error was. Failures that do not cause server breakdowns or service disruption (loss of  patients’ appointments or patient’s clinical information, for example) are usually detected several months  after the system has been running.  Several specially prepared tests should be run to ensure that the system does what it is expected to do. As  these systems run 24-7, finding downtime slots to run the tests can be very difficult if not impossible.  Frequent server failures deteriorate medical care and degrade confidence in the institution.  Outdated  firmware  Lack of procedures in place to update firmware in all devices (medical or not) in the hospital, is a top threat  for healthcare organisations and namely hospitals. Legacy systems and software offer back doors to  malicious actors that can access sensitive healthcare data.  Device failure  Failure of simply limited/reduced capability may severely impact processes that rely, e.g. on the real-time  collection of patient data, such as glucose measuring devices;  Network  components  failure  The interconnected ecosystem of a hospital has to be resilient as the requirement for real time data  analysis is high. If a component fails this can cause unavailability of a system, which can have cascading  effects to other healthcare systems (i.e. Patient Health Record)  Insufficient  maintenance  Lack of updates or lack of patching is another very common threat that can have great impact to the  healthcare organisation, i.e. malware spread. Operational issues might be left unresolved eventually  jeopardising patients’ health.  26 More information at “Overview of some major incidents in radiotherapy and their consequences”, Hamish Porter.

It is important that administrators of  healthcare organisations understand these risk factors and the negative impact they could  cause on the IT infrastructure, patients’ health, patients’ information, diagnosis and quality of  service.  The following table illustrates some indicative risk factors associated with each type of  procurement. This is not a comprehensive list of risk factors and the list should not be  considered exhaustive. Next to each factor there are sample negative outcomes.  Table 3: Risks in procurement  Type of procurement Risk Factors Negative outcome  Clinical information  systems  Infrastructure incapable  of handling system  New system sluggishness due to under rated server CPU or small  system memory.  Disk errors due to not enough disk space.  Network bandwidth unable to handle data traffic, affecting all the  Organization’s network communications.  Poorly designed or  poorly programmed  system  Erroneous results due to poor programming.  System errors due to lack of input validations.  Long user learning curve due to poorly designed user interfaces.  User errors due to poorly designed user interfaces.  Lack of security  considerations  Stolen credentials due to poor handling of passwords, i.e.,  passwords stored in clear text, allows intruder to steal patients’ data.  Fraud and errors, due to absence of separation of duties.  Opportunity for attackers due to lack of input validations, i.e., SQL  injection.  Absence of transaction records (logging) allows attacked to hide  their actions.  Industrial Control Systems  Known (published)  service password  Attackers are able to control BMS devices due to known (published)  administrator’s login credentials not changed during installation.  Once the attacker controls the device, he/she utilizes the device to  launch Denial of Service attacks on the Organization’s infrastructure.  Use of insecure network  protocols  Due to the use of insecure network protocols (HTTP), attackers are  able enter the Organization’s network.  BMS installed with open  and exposed ports  Open ports on a device can be used as an attack vector.  Poor physical security  protection of BMS  devices controllers and  workstations.  Attackers may gain physical access to consoles to install malware or  to sabotage the devices.  Medical Devices  Absence of  authentication controls  Intruder manages device console to produce erroneous results.  Each type of procurement carries its own risk factors. Consult the following list  to identify the main risks associated with the specific type of procurement you  are planning/managing. Work jointly with your IT, security or risk departments  to identify the best ways to address the relevant risks.  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  27  Unencrypted data  Transmission of data in clear text, allows attackers to alter sensor’s  results.  Use of insecure network  protocols  Attackers enter the Organization’s network.  Mobile connected medical  devices  Use of vulnerable  smartphone  Attackers may interfere with the correct operation of the medical  device.  Identification systems Unencrypted data  Due to the clear text transmission, attackers are able access user  identification and gain access to facilities.

GOOD PRACTICES FOR  CYBERSECURITY IN  PROCUREMENT  This chapter presents good practices for enhancing cybersecurity in procurement. The good  practices categorised per phase of the procurement lifecycle and for each one of these  description, examples, procurement type addressed, mitigated threat and evidence are  included. The general practices apply to all three stages of the lifecycle. In some cases, a good  practice may apply to two phases, in which case they are categorised under the phase where  they should first be applied or where they are most relevant.  The list of good practices below is by no means exhaustive; it gives however a solid advantage  to the healthcare IT professional responsible for purchasing equipment in a hospital. The set of  good practices are the collective result of all input received by healthcare professionals  interviewed. The reader can adapt the list based on the priorities of his/her organization.  How to use the good practices of this chapter:  Step 1: Identify the type of procurement you are planning/managing (Ch.2)  Step 2: (Optional) Identify the threats you are most interested in mitigating  (Ch.3)  Step 3: Identify the good procurement practices relevant for the identified type  of procurement (and threats)  Step 4: Assess on which phase of the procurement lifecycle cybersecurity  should be addressed. Understand the description and objectives to be achieved  in the selected good practices in the corresponding phase.  Step 5: Using the graphs provided, understand in which procurement phases  each good practice can be implemented  Step 6: See the indicative examples of how to implement each practice or  evidence that can be requested from supplier; adapt to your own procurement  practices/methodology as needed.

Involve the IT department in procurement  Involve the IT department in the different stages of procurement to ensure that  expertise in cybersecurity aspects is considered  Examples/ Evidence  Involve IT staff in drafting cybersecurity requirements   Consult IT department to integrate cybersecurity considerations when planning  new procurements   Make cybersecurity requirements part of the RfP   It should be part of healthcare organization’s procurement policy to include IT  departments in all system, service or device acquisitions committees  Related Procurement Types All  Related Threats All  GP 2. Implement a vulnerability identification and management process  Ensure that vulnerabilities are considered before procuring new products or services  and that vulnerabilities of existing products/services are monitored throughout their  lifecycle  Examples/ Evidence  Establish a vulnerability management process to monitor and address  vulnerabilities of ICT products/services   Information on existing vulnerabilities may be obtained from the manufacturer or  from public sources, such as the NIST vulnerability database27   Address newly identified vulnerabilities accordingly and include provisions in the  RFP/contract for supplier responsibility in addressing vulnerabilities via timely  patching   Healthcare organizations may consider including a requirement for the Bill of  Materials (BOM28) used in acquired systems or products. This will may help in  the tracking of vulnerable systems in a healthcare organization's infrastructure based  on publicly available vulnerability information.  27 https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search  28 The practice of having a vendor publish a Bill Of Materials (BOM) of the actual software and hardware used in a system  allows any third party to track independently whether a certain device may be susceptible to a certain known vulnerability. It  is common for such BOM information to be disclosed to the Notified Bodies, so that the Notified Bodies may disclose  advisories about certain medical systems and devices. However, it may be beneficial for healthcare administrators to also  have access to such information in order to track vulnerable components across their infrastructure.  https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  30  Related Procurement Types Clinical information systems, medical devices, networking equipment, remote care  system, mobile client devices, identification systems, industrial control systems, cloud  services  Related Threats All  GP 3.

Examples/ Evidence  Create a registry / IT asset inventory of all current SW and HW running including  versions of SW and HW installed on them.   Regularly investigate if new patches are released.   Inform CISO/ISO of these new releases.   Test the proposed patch in some machines before taking the decision to patch  all the machines.   Determine the most suitable timing to apply the patches in every segment of the  network.   Determine workarounds for machines that cannot be patched.   Document the update procedure.   Define the involvement of third party providers.   Defined the actions to take to revert the situation if patched machines do not  work as expected  Related Procurement Types Medical Devices, Clinical Information Systems, Networking Equipment, Remote Care  System, Mobile Client Devices, Identification Systems, Industrial Control Systems,  Cloud Services  Related Threats Malicious Actions, Supply Chain Failure, System Failures  GP 4. Enhance security controls for wireless communication  Access to the Hospital’s Wi-Fi networks should be limited and strictly controlled.  Number of devices connected should be monitored and in the case of medical devices  should be verified and restricted. Non authorized personnel should not have access to  the Wi-Fi.  Examples/ Evidence  By default, strong Wi-Fi passwords (keep log of the frequency the password is  changed). This should be linked with a policy   Make two-factor authentication obligatory  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  31   Medical devices that require wireless communication have a dedicated wireless  network with strict access control and supporting dedicated policy   Access from public devices is prohibited  Related Procurement Types Medical devices, remote client devices, identification systems, cloud services  Related Threats Malicious actions, human error  GP 5. Establish testing policies  The healthcare organisation should establish a minimum set of security tests to be  performed on acquired products or system, depending on the product/system type. It  is also important to note that a newly acquired or newly configured product must  undergo a penetration test in its actual installed environment. In the same way,  remediating action taken must be inline with the operational parameters of the actual  environment.  Examples/ Evidence  For any type of product or system a set of security tests and assorted thresholds  are defined by the healthcare organisation   Testing policies cover all stages of procurement and may include periodic security  audits and penetration tests of systems already in production environment   Testing and thresholds are communicated to suppliers and are part of the RfP   Acceptance criteria are defined on the basis of the security tests before the  finalisation of procurement   The RfP/contract states specific supplier responsibilities to address findings  following security tests of systems in production   All the test policies should be revised and approved by the CISO   Some systems bill depending on the load. Talk about this issue with the provider  before running load tests that could entail a cost   Always prepare a contingency plan in case the server, the communications  system or the medical device stops working during a test   If the test load can potentially permanently stop a medical device or medical  system, verify if your maintenance plan covers a reset & reboot of the  device/system  Related Procurement Types Clinical information systems, medical devices, networking equipment, remote care  system, mobile client devices, identification systems, building management system,  industrial control systems, cloud services  Related Threats Malicious actions, system failures, human errors  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  32  GP 6. Establish Business Continuity plans  Business continuity plans should be established whenever the failure of a system may  disrupt the hospital’s core services and the role of the supplier is such cases must be  well-defined  Examples/ Evidence  It should be clear from the RfP what will be the supplier’s assistance services in  case of service interruption, including the cost of the supplier's services (during  and after warranty) and the response time (SLA) expected   Different disaster scenarios must be thought out when planning for business  continuity, and if the business continuity strategy includes supplier’s assistance,  this must be clearly stated in the RFP and put into the final contract   Costs and service level requirements for business continuity services must be  made clear during the RFP process   If failure of a newly acquired system may jeopardise the hospital's ability to provide  core services, the Business Continuity Plan must establish the strategy (replace  the device or change faulty components), the means and the procedures  necessary for an organization to keep its critical services available under the worst  of circumstances  Related Procurement Types Medical Devices, Clinical Information Systems, Networking Equipment, Remote Care  System, Mobile Client Devices, Identification Systems, Industrial Control Systems,  Cloud Services  Related Threats Malicious Actions, Supply Chain Failure, System Failures  GP 7. Take into account interoperability issues  Interoperability is one of the greatest cybersecurity risk for healthcare  organisations. The hospital’s IT ecosystem is comprised by different  components medical devices, networking equipment, remote care systems  etc. Some of these components exist already (legacy IT) and connection with  new components might result into security gaps.  Examples/ Evidence  The supplier should indicate how the solution proposed is integrated to  the already existing system. If necessary they should include in the offer  the technical documentation explaining how integration will take place   The supplier should also ensure that they monitor transmission (at least  for a predefined period of time) to avoid data loss  Related Procurement Types Clinical information systems, medical devices, Remote Care System, Mobile  Client Devices, Identification Systems, Industrial Control Systems, Cloud  services  Related Threats System failures, Human Error, Malicious actions  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  33  GP 8. Enable testing of all components  Information systems should be thoroughly tested to guarantee they deliver what is  promised:  verify easiness of use, check the correctness of results under load, and  check for security flaws (weak password policy, SQL injection). Testing should be a  requirement in procurement as well as monitoring during testing. Testing should be  aligned with testing policies  Examples/ Evidence  The supplier should include testing scenarios for the devices/ systems offered.  They should explain how testing should take place and how it will be coordinated.  Define benchmarks for every test   Reports from testing could be shared in confidence   Always prepare a contingency plan in case the server, the communications system  or the medical device stopped working during the test   If the test load can potentially permanently stop a medical device or medical  system, verify if your maintenance plan covers a reset & reboot of the  device/system  Related Procurement Types Clinical information systems, medical devices, remote client devices, identification  systems, cloud services, industrial control systems, remote care system, building  management system, mobile client devices  Related Threats Malicious actions, human error, system failures, supply chain failure  GP 9. Allow auditing and logging  Logs are a crucial part of the secure-test-analyse-improve strategy of security. If we  assume that sooner or later our system will be compromised, logs are one of the most  useful tools that we can use to trace back how attackers gained access to our system.  We can also evaluate how much information was compromised. Keeping the logs  secure is one of the most important tasks of security, although its absence does not  compromise already implemented security  Examples/ Evidence  Create a secure Central Logging System to keep a copy of the logs so these  files can be safely off-site in a secure location   Maintaining an external log system also allows for convenience. For instance, if  you have a server that crashed and is unresponsive, you can check the kernel  error logs on your centralized syslog server   The supplier could enable access to the logs for auditing purposes  Related Procurement Types Medical Devices, Remote Care System, Mobile Client Devices, Identification  Systems, Industrial Control Systems  Related Threats Malicious Actions, Supply Chain Failure, System Failures  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  34  GP 10. Encrypt sensitive personal data at rest and in transit  As a minimum, define a policy for systems, services or devices processing GDPR’s  Article 9 special categories of personal data. These types of information must be  always encrypted (whenever stored or transmitted). For all other personal data  categories, require encryption whenever the data leaves the Organization. Be  aware that in many instances this requirement does not fall on the supplier of the  system, service or device, but on the Organization itself. Data might be copied to an  external disk drive for storage in an alternate site. In this case, it is the  Organization’s responsibility to provide the mechanism for encryption  If data has to leave the Organization’s facilities as a system-to-system  communications process (sending data results to a remote processing centre), then  it is the supplier’s responsibility to provide a secure encrypted communications  protocol  Examples/ Evidence  Define if data must be encrypted, at storage or during transmission. Include  this requirement in the RfP. In the offer provided by the supplier look for the  algorithms and encryption methods. At this stage the Data Protection Officer  should be advised.   The supplier should explicitly define encryption methods for data at rest, data  in transit and for different types of data (sensitive health data vs personal data)   Sometimes the devices are unable to encrypt the information they provide.  Adequate gateways for encryption should be provided between the device and  our network  Related Procurement Types Medical Devices, Clinical Information Systems, Networking Equipment, Remote  Care System, Mobile Client Devices, Identification Systems, Industrial Control  Systems, Cloud Services  Related Threats Malicious Actions, Supply Chain Failure, System Failures  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  35  4.2 PLAN PHASE PRACTICES  GP11. Conduct a risk assessment as part of the procurement process  As part of the procurement process, healthcare organizations should conduct  risk assessments.  Examples/ Evidence  Before launching a new procurement process, healthcare organisations  should assess the impact of the new acquisition on their IT security risk  (e.g. new risk, increase/decrease in likelihood or impact of existing risk)   After identifying the risks associated to the acquisition of a system, service  or devices, a strategy for dealing with them must be designed and  integrated in their respective procurement (including budget changes,  specifications changes, etc.)   Risks should be identified early in the procurement process   Procurement planning may be cancelled or alternative solutions should be  examined in case of a significant increase in IT security risk associated with  a planned procurement  Related Procurement Types All  Related Threats All  GP 12. Plan network, hardware and license requirements in advance  Assess whether the new systems, service or device requires third party  software or whether the system will use current software but will need  additional licensing. Match hardware requirements (disk space, bandwidth,  CPU capacity, memory) gathered from suppliers during the RFP against  current and already planned capacity usage, to determine whether additional  upgrades and/or purchases must be made before installation to accommodate  the new system.  Examples/ Evidence  Some devices come with their own free-of-license software, others need  acquisition of additional software from the same company. Make your legal  department verify the terms of the licenses and their scope   Investigate if the software can be used directly as-provided or needs to be  configured   Check if licenses have to be renewed and if updates are covered   Check that you have available space in your data centre to accommodate  the new servers  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  36   Some of your external IT providers may need space in your data centre.  Reserve some space for unexpected future needs (and IPS/IDS server for  example)   Ensure that your existing power system (including auxiliary power units)  has enough capacity. Habitually there is lack of available plugs for the new  devices   Plan how the new devices will be physically linked to your network  Related Procurement Types Clinical Information Systems, Networking Equipment, Identification Systems,  Industrial Control Systems.  Related Threats Supply Chain Failure, System Failures, Natural Phenomena, Human errors  GP 13. Identify threats related to procurement products or services  Cybersecurity threats should be considered when planning procurement  of a new system, product or service and threat identification should be  continuous in the procurement lifecycle  Examples/ Evidence  Use a structured approach to accurately identify relevant threats   Include all relevant stakeholders when assessing threats associated  with a new procurement   The healthcare organisation’s threat modelling process should be  updated if applicable following the procurement of a new product or  service  Related Procurement Types All  Related Threats All  GP 14. Segregate your network  Sometimes the inherent vulnerabilities of the devices connected to the  network cannot be mitigated: for example, legacy devices that use Windows  NT that cannot be upgraded to newer OS. To protect the existing IT  infrastructure from these devices, compensating controls must be  implemented. It is important to isolate all network connected devices from the  rest of the network. To do so, implement network segmentation. With network  segmentation network traffic can be isolated and / or filtered to limit and / or  prevent access between network zones  Examples/ Evidence  In the RfP the hospital should provide a rough overview of the current  network topology and require the potential vendor to provide a new  topology taking into account network segregation practices   The vendor should provide information on security perimeter for the  network based on the medical devices connected. This information should  be included in the RfP  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  37  Related Procurement Types Medical Devices, Clinical Information Systems, Networking Equipment,  Remote Care System, Mobile Client Devices, Identification Systems, Industrial  Control Systems, Cloud Services  Related Threats Malicious Actions, Supply Chain Failure, System Failures  GP 15. Determine network requirements  After creating the network and components topology (how the devices are  connected to the systems), the hospital professionals should list the security  requirements for each different component also to ensure interoperability and  avoid gaps (bandwidth requirements etc.). The hospital needs to know  beforehand the security features they want the network equipment to have  Examples/ Evidence  Check your switches. Ensure that you have available space to connect the  new servers and devices   Create new virtual networks if needed   Are there enough wall-plugs or will devices communicate wirelessly?   Is bandwidth adequate? Verify if new lines are to be installed or if the  wireless router has enough speed and capability   Some devices may use different protocols other than TCP/IP. Check if  they will need special gateways to communicate with your network   Some devices do no encrypt communications by default. Check if the  device has encryption capabilities or if you have to provide them by  yourself through a gateway before data enters your network   Ensure that your device will not initiate unexpected communications with  third parties   Do external devices need a dedicated entry gateway or firewall?   Check and document ports in use   Design a redundant topology in case of main communications line failure  Related Procurement Types Clinical Information Systems, Networking Equipment, Identification Systems,  Industrial Control Systems, Cloud Services, Remote care systems, Mobile  client devices.

Establish eligibility criteria for suppliers  Establish security baseline requirements and translate them into eligibility  criteria when selecting suppliers.  Examples/ Evidence  For procurement purposes, healthcare organisations should have  baselines for common components such as PCs, Operating Systems,  communication protocols (e.g. no HTTP allowed), authentication  mechanisms (Single Factor Authentication or Two Factor Authentication),  databases, encryption, etc. Manufacturers that do not comply with the  baselines, cannot participate in the procurement process   Determine minimum security certification requirements for suppliers for  different types of procurement (e.g. for the supply of security services, the  supplier must be ISO 27001 certified)   Include the security baselines as part of the RFP document (eligibility  criteria)  Related Procurement Types Medical Devices, Clinical Information Systems, Networking Equipment,  Remote Care System, Mobile Client Devices, Identification Systems, Industrial  Control Systems, Cloud Services  Related Threats Malicious Actions, Supply Chain Failure, System Failures  GP 17. Create a dedicated RfP for procuring Cloud Services  When procuring Cloud Services, especially in the case of hospitals, specific  RfP should be put in place taking into account the regulatory and policy  requirements. In several Member States (MS), the state has issued guidelines  on what to ensure when buying cloud services  Examples/ Evidence  The Cloud service provider (CSP) should concretely state where the  hospital data is stored. The hospital should demand that the sensitive data  remains in the EU borders (so that EU data protection regulation applies).  They should also explain which encryption mechanisms they use   The CSP prove redundancy and business continuity in case of an incident.  Also they should share the process for incident reporting (as per the  requirements of the NIS Directive)   The CSP could share results of auditing and penetration testing with the  Hospital, in confidence  Related Procurement Types Cloud services  Related Threats Malicious Actions, Supply Chain Failure  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  39  4.3 SOURCE PHASE PRACTICES  GP 18. Require cybersecurity certification  Healthcare organisations should prioritise the procurement of assets that are  certified against cybersecurity schemes/standards.  Examples/ Evidence  Procured medical devices should adhere to the Medical Devices Regulation  (procurement should require the manufacturer to provide evidence)   Procurement should prioritise products that have been certified against EU  cybersecurity certification schemes, if applicable   For external services, such as cloud services, it is important to require that  the provider of the service has accredited security certifications, such as ISO  27001/ ISO 27018/ CCM etc.   When looking at certifications, it is important to understand the scope of the  certification and the scope of the service to be contracted. A provider of  cloud services might be ISO 27001 certified on some parts of the service  (customer support service) but not in other services which could be of more  importance to the Organization   If available online, healthcare organisations should review the vendor  certificates which come with the full report from the certification authority,  detailing its findings. The scope chapter of the report typically details each  service under scope. These documents are made available to provide  assurance on the offered services  Related Procurement Types Medical Devices, Clinical Information Systems, Networking Equipment, Remote  Care System, Mobile Client Devices, Identification Systems, Industrial Control  Systems, Cloud Services  Related Threats Malicious Actions, Supply Chain Failure, System Failures  GP 19.

Examples/ Evidence  Whenever the system, device or service under consideration processes  large volumes of special categories of information, a data protection impact  assessment (DPIA) must be conducted  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  40   Document the need for any given supplier to process personal data and limit  the data to whatever is necessary   Fully document the type of data that needs to be processed by a new  product/system and apply limitations in the RFP requirements  Related Procurement Types Clinical information systems, medical devices, networking equipment, remote  care system, mobile client devices, identification systems, professional services,  cloud services  Related Threats Malicious actions, human errors  GP 20. Set gateways to keep legacy systems/machines connected  Whenever a medical device must use an old version of OS known to have  vulnerabilities it should be maintained off the network; instead, a PC gateway  should be developed to communicate with this device to obtain the data and  pass it to the network, implementing encryption.  Sometimes a whole segment of the network should communicate through this  gateway. (e.g. all laboratory equipment). This gateway provides excellent  frontier control in case of problems inside these groups. Blocking the gateway  isolates all machines upstream. Follow this recommendation whenever the  machines inside the segment do not need to communicate with the rest of the  network except for one or two CIS servers.  Examples/ Evidence  Due to hardware or other requirements, some medical devices do not  allow for updates (e.g. some ultrasound machines may run on old  versions of Windows)   Medical devices have a long lifespan. The drivers used to  communicate with the machine may not be available in newer versions  of the OS and old OS versions must be kept to access data in the  machine   Community or Day Care centres may be using devices that were  discarded for use in the hospital but are still useful for not-so- demanding environments as these kind of centres  Related Procurement Types Medical Devices, Remote Care System, Mobile Client Devices, Identification  Systems, Industrial Control Systems  Related Threats Malicious Actions, Supply Chain Failure, System Failures  GP 21.

OUTLOOK  Figure 5: Good practices for cybersecurity in procurement for Hospitals  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  47  A ANNEX: INDUSTRY  STANDARDS  Table 4: Standards related to the manufacturing of medical devices  Standard Description  ISO 13485  ISO 13485 defines the requirements that a quality management system must meet for the  design and manufacture of medical devices.  This regulation is based to some extent on ISO 9001. ISO 13485 requires only that the  certified organization demonstrate the quality system is effectively implemented and  maintained and is often seen as the first step in achieving compliance with European  regulatory requirements.  ISO 14971  ISO 14971 establishes the standard recommended for medical device risk management to  determine the safety of a medical device during the product life cycle. Such activity is  required by higher level regulation (EU directives 93/42/EEC, 90/385/EEC and 98/79/EEC)  and other quality management system standards such as ISO 13485.  Technical report ISO/TR 24971, also from ISO, provides guidance on the application of  this standard.  MDS2  The standard, ANSI/NEMA HN 1-2019, Manufacturer Disclosure Statement for Medical  Device Security, consists of the MDS2 form and instructions for completing it. The updated  MDS2 calls for medical device manufacturers to use a new spreadsheet, which is included  in the document, to describe their products’ security features in order to ease healthcare  organisations’ efforts to perform risk assessments and protect the data created, received,  transmitted, or maintained by their medical devices. Healthcare organisations can use data  in the new MDS2 form to compare equipment from different manufacturers and make  informed purchasing decisions that comply with their security and privacy policies.  Table 5: Standards related to the acquisition and management of health information systems  Standard Description  ISO / IEC 20000  The series ISO/IEC 20000 is the internationally recognized standard for Service  Management  in IT.  ISO 20000 specifies requirements for \"establishing, implementing, maintaining and  continually improving a service management system […] including planning, design,  transition, delivery and improvement of services”.  ISO 27000  ISO/IEC 27000-series provides best practice recommendations on information security  management.  ISO 27799  ISO 27799 defines guidelines to support the interpretation and implementation in health  informatics of ISO/IEC 27002 and is a companion to that International Standard.  By implementing ISO 27799:2016, healthcare organizations will be able to ensure a  minimum requisite level of security that is appropriate to their organization's circumstances  and that will maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of personal health  information in their care.  IEC 62304  The international standard IEC 62304 is a standard which specifies life cycle requirements  for the development of medical software and software within medical devices.  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  48  It is harmonized by the European Union (EU) and the United States (US), and therefore  can be used as a benchmark to comply with regulatory requirements from both these  markets.  Technical report ISO/TR 24971, also from ISO, provides guidance on the application of this  standard.  NIST-SP 800-66  Special Publication 800-66 Rev. 1, it’s a guide for implementing the Health Insurance  Probability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Security Rule, which discusses security  considerations and resources that may provide value when implementing the requirements  of the HIPAA Security Rule.  NIST CSF  NIST CSF (NIST CyberSecurity Framework) provides a policy framework of computer  security guidance for private sector organizations in the United States can assess and  improve their ability to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber-attacks.  ISO 22857  ISO 22857:2013 Health informatics — Guidelines on data protection to facilitate trans-  border flows of personal health data, provides guidance on data protection requirements to  facilitate the transfer of personal health data across national or jurisdictional borders.  It is normative only in respect of international or trans-jurisdictional exchange of personal  health data. However it can be informative with respect to the protection of health  information within national/jurisdictional boundaries and provide assistance to national or  jurisdictional bodies involved in the development and implementation of data protection  principles.  Table 6: Standards related to the communication between healthcare devices and the sharing  of medical information  Standard Description  ISO 80001  ISO 80001 is the standard recommended for risk management in IT-networks  incorporating medical devices.  It defines the functions, responsibilities and activities that are necessary for the IT-Network  Risk Management to address safety, effectiveness and data and system security (the key  properties).

ISO 15225:2016 (withdrawn)  ISO 15225:2016 specified rules and guidelines for a medical device nomenclature data  structure, in order to facilitate cooperation and exchange of data used by regulatory bodies  on an international level between interested parties.  Included guidelines for a minimum data set and its structure. These guidelines are  provided for system designers setting up databases that utilize the nomenclature system  described herein.  The requirements contained in this International Standard were to be applicable to the  development and maintenance of an international nomenclature for medical device  identification.  ISO 13972  ISO 13972:2016 Health informatics — Detailed clinical models, characteristics and  processes defines Detailed Clinical Models (DCMs) in terms of an underlying logical  model.  ETSI eHealth standards  The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) is an independent, not-for- profit, standardization organization in the telecommunications industry (equipment makers  and network operators) in Europe, headquartered in France.  ETSI Project (EP) eHEALTH is “committed to the creation of a technical standards-based  market for health. It will promote a climate of innovation, underpinned by technical  standards to ensure interoperability, efficiency, security, privacy and safety in the provision  of health services worldwide”.  HL7 Health Level Seven or HL7 refers to a set of international standards developed by  HL7international that is becoming increasingly popular. HL7 provides a comprehensive  https://www.nist.gov/healthcare/security/hipaa-security-rule  PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES FOR CYBERSECURITY IN HOSPITALS  February 2020  49  framework and related standards for transfer of clinical and administrative data in a uniform  and consistent manner between software applications of health organizations.  HL7 is the standard ISO/HL7 27931:2009 [HL7 RIM R1 - 2003] Data Exchange  Standards — Health Level Seven Version 2.5 — An application protocol for electronic data  exchange in healthcare environments.  DICOM  Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) is the most widely used  standard for the communication and management of medical imaging information and  related data. DICOM is most commonly used for storing and transmitting medical images  to Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) from multiple manufacturers.  DICOM defines the formats for medical images that can be exchanged with the data and  quality necessary for clinical use.  Its derived ISO standard, ISO 12052:2017, within the field of health informatics, addresses  the exchange of digital images and information related to the production and management  of those images, between both medical imaging equipment and systems concerned with  the management and communication of that information.  NIST NISTIR 7497.  NIST NISTIR 7497: also known as The Health Information Exchange (HIE) Security  Architecture defines guidelines to provide a systematic approach to designing a technical  security architecture for the exchange of health information.  Table 7: Standards related to the provisioning of Industrial Control Systems  Standard Description  ISO 27019  ISO/IEC TR 27019:2013 provides guiding principles based on ISO/IEC 27002 for  information security management applied to process control systems as used in the  energy utility industry.  IEC 60364-7-710  IEC 60364-7-710 applies to electrical installations in medical locations, to ensure the  safety of patients and medical staff. Its requirements mainly cover hospitals, private clinics,  medical and dental practices, health care centres and dedicated medical rooms in the  workplace.  UK Health Technical Memoranda  (HTMs)  Health Technical Memoranda (HTMs) give comprehensive advice and guidance on the  design, installation and operation of specialised building and engineering technology used  in the delivery of healthcare.

    "abstract": "As cybersecurity becomes more of a priority for hospitals, it is essential that it is integrated holistically in the different processes, components and stages influencing the healthcare ICT ecosystem. Procurement is a key process shaping the ICT environment of modern hospitals and, as such, should be at the forefront when it comes to meeting cybersecurity objectives. This report offers cybersecurity guidelines for Hospitals when procuring services, products and infrastructure. All good practices are linked to types of procurement for which they are relevant and to threats which they can mitigate, providing an easy to filter set of practices for hospitals who want to focus on particular aspects."

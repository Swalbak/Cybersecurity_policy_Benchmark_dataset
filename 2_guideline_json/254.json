INTRODUCTION  1.1 THEMATIC AREA  This training material is an updated version of the ENISA training material Aspects of  Cooperation between CSIRT and LE - Toolset, Document for trainees3, that was developed  based particularly on the ENISA 2020 Report on CSIRT-LE Cooperation - A study of the roles  and synergies among selected EU MS/EFTA countries 4 (an updated and expanded version of it  is expected to be published in Q1 2022). Some of the 2020 report's conclusions are that, in  terms of incident response and cybercrime, the position and role of the Computer Security  Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) and Law Enforcement (LE) in the national institutional  framework varies from country to country. Similarly, the structure and the organisation of the  Judiciary also depends on the country.  In addition, between the three communities - CSIRTs, LE and Judiciary - different approaches  and different levels of cooperation exist. While the operational cooperation, especially in the  daily interactions and informal communication, seems to be well-established, sometimes it  seems that more structured cooperation could be achieved to have less fragmented information  flow between the three communities. Also, there is a more significant gap in the interaction  between CSIRTs and the Judiciary, compared to the cooperation established between LE and  the Judiciary. CSIRTs would rather often interact with the Judiciary in case they are called as an  expert witness in court.  Moreover, LE is not solely involved in the detection and investigation of cybercrimes. A key  component of their role is the preventive aspects of cybercrime, and it is in this role that  cooperation with other communities, particularly the CSIRT community, becomes apparent to  support preventive strategies. Preventive aspects of incidents/cybercrimes can also be seen as  the initial ground for establishing cooperation between the CSIRTs and the LE communities,  which can then extend to other phases of the incident/crime investigation. On the other hand,  CSIRTs play an important role in informing (potential) victims of cybercrime and providing them  with information on how to report a crime to the Police.  CSIRT and LE communities also need to closely cooperate to mitigate the risks of having  evidence compromised or destroyed.  Regarding the incident handling and cybercrime investigation, several competences are  required. While each community has developed its own set of skills and knowledge, they can all  benefit from the competences of the other communities.  Furthermore, the 2020 report on CSIRT and LE cooperation also concluded that despite the  initiatives that are already in place to facilitate training within each community, or joint trainings  engaging two communities (e.g. CSIRTs and LE, or LE and the Judiciary), it seems that there is  a need for more training and exercises addressing the three communities together.  3 Aspects of Cooperation between CSIRT and LE - Toolset, Document for trainees,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/online-training-material/legal- cooperation#Aspects  4 ENISA, 2020 Report on CSIRT-LE Cooperation - A study of the roles and synergies among selected EU Member  States/EFTA countries, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/2020-report-on-csirt-le-cooperation (published on 26  January 2021).  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/online-training-material/legal-cooperation#Aspects https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/online-training-material/legal-cooperation#Aspects  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  5  This training material, as mentioned, is an updated version of the ENISA training material  Aspects of Cooperation between CSIRT and LE - Toolset, Document for trainees published in  January 20215. The updates have been made based on the feedback received during the two  training sessions organised by ENISA to pilot the training material. These pilot sessions took  place as virtual events in August and in October 2021 and representatives from CSIRTs, LE,  Judiciary and some EU Agencies participated in these pilots.  Finally, the 2020 report on CSIRT and LE, the handbook and this toolset are a set of  deliverables complementing each other as follows:  • The report analyses roles, duties, competences, synergies and potential interferences  across the three communities (CSIRTs, LE and Judiciary).  • The handbook helps the trainer explain these concepts through scenarios.  • The toolset contains exercises for trainees based on these scenarios.  1.2 LEARNING OUTCOMES  As a result of attending this training, the trainee should be able to:  • demonstrate knowledge of interactions across the three communities (CSIRTs, LE and  Judiciary); synergies, interferences and challenges  • use the Segregation of Duties (SoD) matrix to collect the data to identify the key  responsibilities for their communities (CSIRTs, LE, and Judiciary) and link them with  the skills required to fulfil these duties  • better understand the legal and organisational framework defining the competences of  CSIRTs, LE, and the Judiciary, in their activities related to fighting cybercrime  • understand different decision-making processes among the communities  • capture potential synergies and possible overlaps  • overcome possible interferences of cooperation between CSIRTs and LE and their  interaction with the Judiciary  • ensure structured integration of liaison officers for coordination between the different  communities  • perform uniform and effective communication between CSIRTs, LE and the Judiciary  toward victim and relevant stakeholders  • coordinate basic first responder actions at victim site (collecting evidence without  tampering it, informing partners of which evidence is gathered)  • explain technical terms to non-technical participants, e.g. to the Judiciary  • better translate legal constraints to CSIRTs  • identify appropriate approaches and tools to help support effective collaboration  • identify and develop a common plan to enhance cooperation  1.3 COURSE DURATION AND TRAINING OUTLINE  3 hours and 5 minutes, including one break.  1.4 COURSE CONTENTS  The training includes three scenarios where trainees learn when and how CSIRT members  cooperate with LE when dealing with cyber security incidents. The three scenarios cover:  -  Theft of confidential data  -  Ransomware  -  Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and malware blended attack  5 Aspects of Cooperation between CSIRT and LE - Toolset, Document for trainees,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/online-training-material/legal- cooperation#Aspects  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/online-training-material/legal-cooperation#Aspects https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/online-training-material/legal-cooperation#Aspects  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  6  The use case 1 (theft of confidential data) and use case 2 (ransomware) are updated with the  feedback from the pilot sessions. The use case 3 is added as a supplementary case.  Training sessions should cover only one-use case and use the material from the other use  case to steer further discussion or re-iterate on certain topics.  The training agenda consists of  • An introduction to the training (25')  • Explanation of the frameworks and models used in the training (25')  • Introduction to the use cases (15')  • Study of one-use case (85')  • The closure and overview of the learning outcomes (10')  • A final section with room for questions and feedback (10')  One break of 15' is foreseen before the start of the study of the use case. The trainer can  optionally add additional breaks. The total course duration is 185 minutes, including one break.  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  7  2. USE CASES  2.1 USE CASE 1: THEFT OF CONFIDENTIAL DATA  Figure 1: Overview of use case 1  Overview of the use case 1  Targeted Audience  This exercise is useful for incident responders and members of Law  Enforcement of all experience levels. It is particularly helpful for national  CSIRT members and Law Enforcement officers involved in cybercrime  investigations  Total Duration 85 minutes  Scenario  This is a group exercise. Each trainee is a member of CSIRT, LE or the  Judiciary who is involved in the prevention, mitigation and investigation of the  cybersecurity incident/crime. Their goals are to address key ramifications  resulting from the theft of confidential data, identify synergies that could be  exploited by cooperating with the other communities, and potential  interferences in case of lack of cooperation/coordination  Task 1 Identify and describe the organisational profile  Task 2  Describe measures that CSIRT and/or LE can take to prevent the  incident/crime  Task 3  Use the SoD Matrix to analyse possible duties (tasks), synergies and potential  interferences between CSIRT, LE and the Judiciary  Task 4  List possible measures that CSIRT and/or LE can take during the incident  response/crime investigation while performing different duties  Task 5  Group discussion on balancing the incident mitigation (asset protection) and  criminal investigation (evidence collection and preservation)  2.1.1 Objectives  In this exercise, the trainees will learn when and how CSIRT, LE, and Judiciary representatives  can cooperate. In particular, the objectives of the exercise are to:  • Understand and appreciate the specifics of CSIRT/LE activities  • Analyse roles of different actors and how they can cooperate  • Identify synergies that can be exploited  • Grasp the complexity of cooperation  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  8  2.1.2 Scenario  2.1.2.1 Setting the stage  This scenario describes an incident where carefully selected individuals working for different  Member States (MS A, MS B, and MS C) subscribe to a fake event. The event website mimics  an event organized by an EU Commissioner and contains malicious documents. Once installed  on the victim’s computer, the malware included in the document exfiltrates domain, Virtual  Private Network (VPN) access login credentials and selected documents with sensitive  information. The credentials and the sensitive information are then monetized by the attacker  via a semi-public website.  The internal security team of the Ministry of Education of MS A, to which one of the victims  belongs, detects the incident. The internal security team of the Ministry of Education of MS A  notifies the MS A national CSIRT, which in turn contacts Law Enforcement (of MS A).  The location where the exfiltration of data took place is in European MS D - whereas the  website making the exfiltrated data available is located in Country Z, a non-EU/EFTA country.  In this use case, we use the concept of lanes to describe two distinct events that are part of the  same security incident. The concept of lanes is used to demonstrate to the students that  different security events which at first seem unrelated, can in fact be related to the same  security incident. It is an opportunity for students to understand that separate investigations,  started from different security events, will eventually merge because they deal with the same  security incident. Students should cover both lanes to grasp the full details of the security  incident.  Figure 2: Graphical representation of scenario 1 – Attack  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  9  2.1.2.2 Before the breach  Reconnaissance  The attackers in this scenario spent a considerable amount of time on the reconnaissance of  their potential new victim. They used online research of the Ministry of Education of MS A to find  individuals of interest. They mapped out with whom these individuals typically collaborate, in  particular with individuals at other ministries in MS A but also at Ministries of Education in other  countries and with the European Commission. The attackers supplemented this information with  the publicly available calendar information from the Commissioner.  The attackers used the following tactics and techniques:  Tactic  TA0017 - Organizational  Information Gathering6  “Organizational information gathering consists of the process of identifying critical  organizational elements of intelligence an adversary will need about a target in order to best  attack.  Similar to competitive intelligence, organisational intelligence gathering focuses on  understanding the operational tempo of an organization and gathering a deep understanding of  the organization and how it operates, in order to best develop a strategy to target it.”  Tactic  TA0016 - People  Information Gathering7  “People Information Gathering consists of the process of identifying critical personnel elements  of intelligence an adversary will need about a target in order to best attack.  People intelligence  gathering focuses on identifying key personnel or individuals with critical accesses in order to  best approach a target for attack.  It may involve aspects of social engineering, elicitation,  mining social media sources, or be thought of as understanding the personnel element of  competitive intelligence.”  6 MITRE Corporation, Organizational Information Gathering, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0017/ (retrieved on 13  October 2020).  7 MITRE Corporation, People Information Gathering, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0016/ (retrieved on 13 October  2020).

Technique  T1283 – Identify  business relationships11  \"Business relationship information may be used by an adversary to shape social engineering  attempts (exploiting who a target expects to hear from) or to plan for technical actions such as  exploiting network trust relationship\"  Technique  T1295 - Analyze social  and business  relationships, interests,  and affiliations12  “Social media provides insight into the target's affiliations with groups and organizations.  Certification information can explain their technical associations and professional associations.  Personal information can provide data for exploitation or even blackmail.”  Technique  T1296 – Assess  targeting options  'OPSEC'13  \"An adversary may assess a target's operational security (OPSEC) practices in order to  identify targeting options. A target may share different information in different settings or be  more of less cautious in different environments.\"  Technique  T1269 – Identify people  of interest14  \"The attempt to identify people of interest or with an inherent weakness for direct or indirect  targeting to determine an approach to compromise a person or organization. Such targets may  include individuals with poor OPSEC practices or those who have a trusted relationship with  the intended target.\"  Technique  T1274 – Vulnerable  sensitive personnel  information15  \"An adversary may identify sensitive personnel information not typically posted on a social  media site, such as address, marital status, financial history, and law enforcement infractions.  This could be conducted by searching public records that are frequently available for free or at  a low cost online.\"  The attackers then used one of the appointments in the Commissioner’s calendar to set up a  fake round table event to collect future views on a specific topic, hosted by the Ministry of  Education of MS B. The attackers identified which individuals in the Ministry of Education of MS  A would be the most interested in this topic. Then, the attackers set up fake personas to  impersonate representatives of the Ministry of Education of MS B, and they created a website  mimicking the event registration website of the Ministry of Education of MS B.  Tactic  TA0023 - Persona Development16  “Persona development consists of the development of public information, presence,  history and appropriate affiliations. This development could be applied to social  media, website, or other publicly available information that could be referenced and  scrutinized for legitimacy throughout an operation using that persona or identity.”  Tactic  TA0022 - Establish & Maintain  Infrastructure17  \"Establishing and maintaining infrastructure consists of building, purchasing, co- opting, and maintaining systems and services used to conduct cyber operations. An  adversary will need to establish infrastructure used to communicate with and control  assets used throughout the course of their operations.\"  8 MITRE Corporation, Organizational Weakness Identification, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0020/  (retrieved on 13 October 2020).  9 MITRE Corporation, People Weakness Identification, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0019/  (retrieved on 13 October 2020).  10 MITRE Corporation, Analyze business processes, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1301/ (retrieved on 13 October 2020).  11 MITRE Corporation, Identify business relationships, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1283/ (retrieved on 13 October 2020).  12 MITRE Corporation, Analyze social and business relationships, interests, and affiliations, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1295/  (retrieved on 13 October 2020).  13 MITRE Corporation, Assess targeting options 'OPSEC, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1296/  (retrieved on 13 October 2020).  14 MITRE Corporation, Identify people of interest, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1269/ (retrieved on 13 October 2020).  15 MITRE Corporation, Vulnerable sensitive personnel information, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1274/ (retrieved on 13 October 2020).  16 MITRE Corporation, Persona Development, https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0023/ (retrieved on 13 October 2020).  17 MITRE Corporation, Establish & Maintain Infrastructure, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0022/  (retrieved on 13 October 2020).  https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0020/ https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0019/ https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1301/ https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1283/ https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1295/ https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1296/ https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1269/ https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1274/ https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0023/ https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0022/  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  11  Initial access  Armed with a list of targets selected during reconnaissance, the attackers used the personas  impersonating staff working for the Ministry of Education of MS B to send out invitations for the  fake event. The event website requested that visitors enter personal information, and it  contained documents, such as a call for proposals or Q&A, which were prepared by the  attackers to include malicious code.  Tactic  TA0001 – Initial Access18  \"Initial Access consists of techniques that use various entry vectors to gain their  initial foothold within a network. Techniques used to gain a foothold include  targeted spearphishing and exploiting weaknesses on public-facing web servers.  Footholds gained through initial access may allow for continued access, like valid  accounts and use of external remote services, or may be limited-use due to  changing passwords.\"  Technique  T1566 - Phishing: Spear phishing  Link19  “Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious link in an attempt  to elicit sensitive information and/or gain access to victim systems.  Spearphishing with a link is a specific variant of spearphishing. It is different from  other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of links to download  malware contained in the email, instead of attaching malicious files to the email  itself, to avoid defenses that may inspect email attachments.”  Execution  The event website included text to lure the visitors into opening the documents because they  contained “essential” information on the event. The malicious documents were Office  documents, with a blurred image and a text stating that to see the content, the user needed to  “Enable Decryption via Enable Content”, which enabled Word macros. Once the macro was  enabled, it downloaded and ran the malicious executable file.  Technique  T1204 - User Execution20  “An adversary may rely upon specific actions by a user in order to gain execution.  Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to execute malicious  code by, for example, opening a malicious document file or link. These user  actions will typically be observed as follow-on behaviour from forms of Phishing.”  Credential access and collection  The malicious executable was, in fact, a variant of a well-known keylogger specifically designed  to collect credentials entered by a user when starting a VPN client. The captured credentials  were regularly sent out to an external website. Apart from a keylogger, the malware was also  able to collect files on the local system of the victim. It searched for specific types of files with  particular names which were sent out to an external website.  Technique  T1056 – Input Capture21  “Adversaries may use methods of capturing user input to obtain credentials or collect  information. During normal system usage, users often provide credentials to different  locations, such as login pages/portals or system dialog boxes. Input capture  mechanisms may be transparent to the user (e.g. Credential API Hooking) or rely on  deceiving the user into providing input into what they believe to be a genuine service  (e.g. Web Portal Capture).”  Technique  T1567 – Exfiltration Over Web  Service22  “Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service to exfiltrate data  rather than their primary command and control channel. Popular Web services acting  as an exfiltration mechanism may give a significant amount of cover due to the  likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to  the compromise. Firewall rules may also already exist to permit traffic to these  services.  18 MITRE Corporation, Initial Access, https://attack.mitre.org/version/v7/tactics/TA0001/  (retrieved on 13 October 2020).  19 MITRE Corporation, Phishing:Spearphishing Link, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1566/002/ (retrieved on 1 December 2021).  20 MITRE Corporation, User Execution, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1204/  (retrieved on 1 December 2021).  21 MITRE Corporation, Input Capture, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1056/ (retrieved on 1 December 2021).  22 MITRE Corporation, Exfiltration Over Web Service, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1567/ (retrieved on 2 December 2021).  https://attack.mitre.org/version/v7/tactics/TA0001/ https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1566/002/ https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1204/ https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1056/ https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1567/  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  12  Web service providers also commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving adversaries  an added level of protection.”  Technique  T1029 – Scheduled Transfer23  “Adversaries may schedule data exfiltration to be performed only at certain times of  day or at certain intervals. This could be done to blend traffic patterns with normal  activity or availability.”  Technique  T1560 – Archive Collected Data24  “An adversary may compress and/or encrypt data that is collected prior to exfiltration.  Compressing the data can help to obfuscate the collected data and minimize the  amount of data sent over the network. Encryption can be used to hide information  that is being exfiltrated from detection or make exfiltration less conspicuous upon  inspection by a defender.”  Technique  T1005 – Data from the local  system25  “Adversaries may search local system sources, such as file systems or local  databases, to find files of interest and sensitive data prior to Exfiltration.”  2.1.2.3 Initial response  Breach notification  Lane 1  During a weekly review of network activity, the security operations team of the Ministry of  Education of MS A noticed that there was a substantial amount of outbound traffic to an external  website located in MS D. Their initial investigation showed that the internal source of the traffic  was on a network segment used by individuals working on sensitive material.  The security team of the Ministry of Education of MS A alerted its internal CSIRT and started  collecting information on the affected assets.  Lane 2  At the same time, the CSIRT team of the Ministry of Education of MS A got an alert from one of  their public crawlers. The team received an internal notification from the Analysis Information  Leak framework (AIL) framework26 showing that there was a hit on the name of the Ministry of  Education of MS A for a website located on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) in Country Z. The  website was protected with a password and required payment to access it. It provided some  screenshots and extracts of texts to show what type of information was available for potential  “customers”.  Upon inspection of the screenshot of the alert, the CSIRT of the Ministry of Education  immediately spotted that the document contained sensitive information which should not be  publicly accessible.  The response of the CSIRT  The CSIRT handler on duty for the Ministry of Education of MS A classified the incidents  according to the ENISA Reference Security Incident Taxonomy (RSIT)27 as “Information  Content Security”, “Leak of confidential information”.  The CSIRT requested the security operations team to safeguard the logs of the affected assets  in their Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and use Endpoint Detection and  Response (EDR) tooling to capture live system memory and collect important system artefacts.  23 MITRE Corporation, Scheduled Transfer, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1029/ (retrieved on 2 December 2021).  24 MITRE Corporation, Archive Collected Data, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1560/ (retrieved on 2 December 2021).  25 MITRE Corporation, Data from Local System, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1005/ (retrieved on 2 December 2021).  26 GitHub, CIRCL  / AIL-framework, https://github.com/CIRCL/AIL-framework (retrieved on 13 October 2020).  27 GitHub, enisaeu  / Reference-Security-Incident-Taxonomy-Task-Force, https://github.com/enisaeu/Reference-Security-Incident-Taxonomy- Task-Force (retrieved on 13 October 2020).  https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1029/ https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1560/ https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1005/ https://github.com/CIRCL/AIL-framework https://github.com/enisaeu/Reference-Security-Incident-Taxonomy-Task-Force https://github.com/enisaeu/Reference-Security-Incident-Taxonomy-Task-Force  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  13  Unfortunately, the EDR had not been deployed to all assets. In the meantime, the security  operations team was able to isolate the system process responsible for the exfiltration of the  data. Additionally, they still saw active network activity to the external website. This activity  meant that the exfiltration was ongoing.  The CSIRT notified the CISO and the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Education of MS A of  the possible security incident. A crisis team was formed, including the Press Officer, the legal  department, the HR department and a representative of the General Secretariat of the Ministry  of Education of MS A.  At this stage, it was unknown which type of data was exfiltrated. Still, because of the volume of  data already exfiltrated and the type of assets (workstations and individuals involved), the  CSIRT of the Ministry of Education of MS A suggested filtering traffic to the IP in MS D until  further investigation. Additionally, according to the representative of the Ministry of Education of  MS A, the screenshot in the AIL alert was of a document which had not been published and  which was processed on one of the affected assets.  The CSIRT of the Ministry of Education of MS A immediately instructed the network team to  filter all traffic to and from the IP in MS D.  The CISO of the Ministry of Education of MS A, together with the head of CSIRT of the Ministry  of Education of MS A, contacted the national CSIRT of MS A to report the incident and LE of  MS A to file a complaint.  Criminal investigation in MS A  LE officials of MS A were informed of the case details, including the fact that this concerned  sensitive information and that there was a very high suspicion that data had been exfiltrated to a  server in MS D.  LE conducted an investigation and went on-site to the Ministry of Education of MS A to review  the available log material.  The CSIRT of the Ministry of Education of MS A provided LE with their collected reports on  network traffic, together with the screenshots and information of the leaked documents on the  server in Country Z, a non-EU/EFTA country.  The CSIRT of the Ministry of Education of MS A informed LE that the activity was still ongoing  and that they implemented a network filter.  Investigation analysis  Because of the network filter, the malware was unable to contact the server in MS D. This  triggered a failsafe mechanism, and it started encrypting all the files on the workstation.  The CSIRT of the Ministry of Education of MS A informed LE that the evidence on the  workstation was most likely no longer usable. The logs in the SIEM were still available.  Lane 1  LE analysed the network traffic with support from the national CSIRT of MS A. The logs clearly  showed the volume of traffic to the server in MS D.  LE of MS A reached out to their contacts in MS D (with the support of Europol) requesting to  seize the server and collect the evidence. Unfortunately, the hosting company, a bulletproof  hoster, did not respond to the request. LE then attempted to get a warrant for the server.  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  14  Together with the information from the MS A national CSIRT, the LE created a timeline of  events.  Lane 2  Based on the alert data of the CSIRT of the Ministry of Education of MS A, LE identified the  hosting company where the website was offering the sensitive information. LE contacted their  peers in Country Z (with the support of INTERPOL) to formally request the server be seized and  investigated. They used the evidence received from the agency to support their case.  Criminal investigation in MS D  Lane 1  LE in MS D was able to identify the individuals that registered and set up the website and VPS.  An investigation of the activity on the server showed that it was accessed multiple times via IP  addresses belonging to VPN nodes, but also included one residential IP address from MS D.  This most likely occurred after a glitch of the VPN killswitch exposed the IP of the user behind  the VPN. The activity on the server corresponded with the victim’s VPN login attempts of stolen  credentials.  Most of the logs included VPN node accesses, but also had one residential IP address from MS  D, most likely after a glitch of the VPN service which exposed the IP of the user behind the  VPN. The activity on the server corresponded with VPN login attempts of stolen credentials.  The server also had temporary copies of some of the sensitive documents, sorted according to  the collection date.  The server in MS D, however, did not show any activity related to the server in the Country Z.  Lane 2  LE was unable to collect the server in Country Z because, by the time the hosting company  received the request, the owners of the server had destroyed their VPS server.  However, LE was able to identify the individuals that purchased the VPS at the hosting  company.  LE investigation did take different screenshots of the website before the server’s destruction.  These screenshots showed the nature of the site’s documents, along with the methods used to  request money to access the website.  LE / Prosecutor requested a warrant and seizure of the electronic devices of this individual.  LE investigation of the computers of the individuals in MS D showed that their devices contained  traces of the sensitive documents. An examination of the Secure Shell (SSH) history, browser  and e-mail activity also revealed frequent access to the server in Country Z.  The investigation also showed frequent open-source IM (instant messaging) conversations with  another individual in MS D, not linked to the website in MS D but seemingly with a form of  control on the server in Country Z.  The forensic investigation of these electronic devices showed that this individual had configured  and set up the server in Country Z. The e-mail conversation stored on the devices showed an  exchange of the content of the documents and methods of payment.

Figure 7: Duty/suggested measure template  Duty (task) Suggested measure Comments  2.1.3.5 Task 5: Discussion on lessons learned from this scenario  Discuss the issue of balancing the incident mitigation (asset protection) and the criminal  investigation (evidence collection and preservation) with reference to the scenario.  One of the responses of the CSIRT of the Ministry of Education of MS A involves filtering  outgoing network activity to the attackers, effectively preventing the further exfiltration of  sensitive information. This filtering is an understandable activity, certainly as a short-term  containment measure. The side-effect of this measure, however, triggers the malware and  results in encrypted workstations, and as such a loss of evidence.  Discuss the pros and cons of short-term containment actions to protect the victim, but which  might alert the attacker that they have been detected. In general, this depends on the type of  incident and the victim.  As a reference, the courses of action matrix from Lockheed Martin28 can be use. This action  matrix includes two significant categories of actions:  -  passive (Discover and Detect)  28 Eric M. Hutchins E. M., Clopperty M. J., Amin R.

Although for training purposes the scenario is presented as less complicated than real cases  might be, it still allows each party to understand the complexities in terms of actors involved,  roles played, duties (tasks) performed, synergies to exploit, and risks of interference.  2.2 USE CASE 2: RANSOMWARE  Figure 8: Overview of use case 2  Overview of use case 2  Targeted Audience This exercise is useful for incident responders and members of Law  Enforcement of all experience levels. It is particularly helpful for national  CSIRT members and Law Enforcement officers involved in cybercrime  investigations.  Total Duration 85 minutes  Scenario This is a group exercise. Each trainee is a member of either a CSIRT team  and/or Law Enforcement that is involved in the prevention, mitigation and  investigation of cybersecurity incidents. Their goal is to address the key  ramification of a ransomware attack against the municipal hospital.  Task 1 Notification of the incident  Task 2  Setting up the task force, division of duties  Task 3 Possible duties (tasks), synergies and potential interferences between CSIRT,  LE and the Judiciary  Task 4 Incident handling, evidence collection, cooperation  Task 5 International cooperation and information sharing  Task 6 Post-incident preventive measures  2.2.1 Objectives  In this exercise, the trainees will learn when and how CSIRT members cooperate with LE. In  particular, the objectives of the exercise are to:  • Explain CSIRT and LE cooperation in a health sector-related ransomware scenario  • Raise the trainees’ awareness regarding the differences between the legal systems of  various countries and the consequences of these differences  • Understand and appreciate the specifics of CSIRT/LE activities  • Practice setting up and coordinating a task force for dealing with large scale attacks  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  18  • Provide information on how to cooperate and share information  • Practice how to identify and propose post-incident reactive and preventive measures  2.2.2 Scenario  2.2.2.1 Setting the stage  A ransomware attack has been discovered in a large municipal hospital on the hospital patient  records servers. All computers are locked and display a message indicating that the files have  been encrypted; the hacker is demanding 11 bitcoins (approx. €100,000) to provide the  decryption key. The image on the computer screens also states that if the payment is not  received within five days, the price will increase. Within ten days, the patient data will be erased  on the servers and leaked to a public website, and a notification will be sent to the national data  privacy agency.  You are a member of a task force established to help the hospital’s network and information  security team to deal with the incident. You have been assembled; it is now 05:45. It appears  that all significant servers are affected. An initial assessment shows that the hospital email  system and patient record systems are inaccessible, and the hospital intranet sites are also  unavailable.  Figure 9: Graphical representation of scenario 2 – Attack  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  19  2.2.2.2 Organisational profile  The hospital is the largest municipal hospital in your area. Last year the hospital took care of  almost 1 million patients and had about 5,000 employees. As such, the hospital relies on a  network with up to 10,000 connected devices, which includes workstations, diagnostic tools and  servers storing patients’ data. In recent years, hospital management was somewhat reluctant to  invest in cybersecurity, and even though most computers are relatively well taken care of, some,  especially that operating specialised equipment, are running legacy systems like Windows XP,  due to compatibility issues. The network is not segmented, and critical systems are in the same  network as specialised equipment, as well as all workstations. The hospital has no clear rules  on data management and backup. Patient data that are stored in the hospital’s information  systems are backed up and protected from ransomware. Still, a lot of relevant data about  currently hospitalised and treated patients are not stored in the information systems, but on the  doctors’ workstations, which are not being backed up.  2.2.2.3 Before the breach  The COVID-19 pandemic is still very much going on, which leads to heavy pressure on your  country’s hospital system. Some cybercriminals decided to take advantage of this situation and  started targeting medical facilities with their ransomware campaigns. The hospital’s security  team issued and distributed a directive that explained this threat to the employees and informed  them how to be cautious and prevent their devices from getting infected with malware.  Reconnaissance  The attackers in this scenario spent a considerable amount of time on the reconnaissance of  their potential new victim. They researched the online available information of the hospital to  Figure 10: Graphical representation of scenario 2 – Overview of interactions  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  20  find out its departments and individuals of interest. None of this required any specific access.  This type of research is also typically called OSINT, Open-source intelligence. The attackers  used the following tactics and techniques:  Tactic  TA0017 - Organizational  Information Gathering29  “Organizational information gathering consists of the process of identifying critical  organizational elements of intelligence an adversary will need about a target in order to best  attack.  Similar to competitive intelligence, organisational intelligence gathering focuses on  understanding the operational tempo of an organization and gathering a deep understanding of  the organization and how it operates, in order to best develop a strategy to target it.”  Tactic  TA0016 - People  Information Gathering30  “People Information Gathering consists of the process of identifying critical personnel elements  of intelligence an adversary will need about a target in order to best attack.  People intelligence  gathering focuses on identifying key personnel or individuals with critical accesses in order to  best approach a target for attack.  It may involve aspects of social engineering, elicitation,  mining social media sources, or be thought of as understanding the personnel element of  competitive intelligence.”  Tactic  TA0015 – Technical  Information Gathering31  \"Technical information gathering consists of the process of identifying critical technical  elements of intelligence an adversary will need about a target in order to best attack.  Technical intelligence gathering includes, but is not limited to, understanding the target's  network architecture, IP space, network services, email format, and security procedures.\"  Tactic  TA0018 – Technical  Weakness  Identification32  \"Technical weakness identification consists of identifying and analysing weaknesses and  vulnerabilities collected during the intelligence gathering phases to determine best approach  based on technical complexity and adversary priorities (e.g., expediency, stealthiness).\"  The attackers compiled a detailed picture of the hospital infrastructure based on the information  from:  - The hospital public website, with the full names and roles of the medical staff;  - IT security job descriptions, disclosing the type of security devices that are in use;  - Procurement documents, disclosing details on the current network infrastructure and  network layout as well as information for maintenance framework contracts for legacy  medical equipment.  The identification of the legacy medical equipment gave the attackers opportunity to compile a  set of default access credentials, potential vulnerabilities of these devices as well as a list of  typically network exposed services. Note that they did not take the approach of using for  example, Shodan to look up vulnerable Internet exposed medical systems, although this would  most likely have given them an easier access into the hospital network.  The attackers identified which individuals in the hospital would be the most interested to target  with initial infection. Then, the attackers created the malware mimicking a tool for the analysis of  the diseases symptoms and setup a website to distribute the malware. Afterwards the link to this  website was distributed via phishing e-mails, specifically send to the targeted individuals.  Tactic  TA0022 - Establish & Maintain  Infrastructure33  \"Establishing and maintaining infrastructure consists of building, purchasing, co- opting, and maintaining systems and services used to conduct cyber operations.

Spearphishing with  a link is a specific variant of spearphishing. It is different from other forms of  spearphishing in that it employs the use of links to download malware contained in  the email, instead of attaching malicious files to the email itself, to avoid defences  that may inspect email attachments.”  2.2.2.4 Initial response  Breach notification  When a receptionist in the X-ray department tried to log in at the start of her shift, she could not  open the files and a message indicating that the files have been encrypted appeared on her  screen. She notified a supervisor who then called the hospital’s IT helpdesk to report what  happened, who in turn notified the hospital’s network and information security team.  The response of the CSIRT team  The hospital’s network and information security team handler received the alert from the  hospital staff and identified it as a high priority threat. The handler classified it according to the  ENISA RSIT35 as an incident of “Information Content Security”, “Unauthorised modification of  information”, caused by the ransomware.  From an initial analysis, it appeared that the ransomware was called UnluckyLocky, a new type  of ransomware with limited online information. Therefore, it was assumed that there was no  known decryption key. The handler uncovered a news report online that described another  hospital that seemed to have been infected by a similar attack with ransomware named Gotcha.  The news article suggested that the response to the incident was slow and that almost all the  computers and servers were infected. Additionally, the public was made aware of the incident  as it had a significant impact on the hospital not being able to offer essential services. The  incident went on for six days during which time even the hospital’s most basic functionality was  forced to stop.  The handler then attempted to identify the source of the ransomware with the limited publicly  available information on UnluckyLocky published by the respected security company.  The handlers analysed the activity that was related to the affected system and user, and used  the logs from the web proxy server and e-mail server to further investigate the source of this  problem.  They were able to find out that the source was a malicious website that informed about the  COVID-19 pandemic and offered for download a tool for analysis of the decease symptoms.  The handler was able to download a sample of the malware.  The malware was executed by the user who downloaded it from the website, after clicking a link  received via a phishing e-mail.  Technique  T1204 - User Execution36  “An adversary may rely upon specific actions by a user to gain execution. Users  may be subjected to social engineering to get them to execute malicious code by,  for example, opening a malicious document file or link. These user actions will  typically be observed as follow-on behaviour from forms of Phishing.”  34 MITRE Corporation, Phishing:Spearphishing Link, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1566/002/ (retrieved on 13  October 2020).  35 GitHub, enisaeu  / Reference-Security-Incident-Taxonomy-Task-Force, https://github.com/enisaeu/Reference-Security-Incident- Taxonomy-Task-Force (retrieved on 13 October 2020).  36 MITRE Corporation, User Execution, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1204/ (retrieved on 13 October 2020).  https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1566/002/ https://github.com/enisaeu/Reference-Security-Incident-Taxonomy-Task-Force https://github.com/enisaeu/Reference-Security-Incident-Taxonomy-Task-Force https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1204/  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  22  Upon execution, the malware first enumerated and encrypted the data within the target  computer system and any connected storages. This rendered most of the data unavailable to  the user while still allowing the user to operate the essential functions of the computer system.  The malware also regularly prompted a window warning the user that the system was encrypted  and decryption keys would be provided upon payment of the ransom.  Technique  T1486 - Data Encrypted for Impact37  “Adversaries may encrypt data on target systems or on large numbers of systems  in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources. They can  attempt to render stored data inaccessible by encrypting files or data on local and  remote drives and withholding access to a decryption key. This may be done to  extract monetary compensation from a victim in exchange for decryption or a  decryption key (ransomware) or to render data permanently inaccessible in cases  where the key is not saved or transmitted. In the case of ransomware, it is typical  that common user files like Office documents, PDFs, images, videos, audio, text,  and source code files will be encrypted. In some cases, adversaries may encrypt  critical system files, disk partitions, and the MBR.”  The malware also regularly launched a task that attempted to spread the malicious code via  email messages sent to stored addresses and through executing software on remote computers  via legitimate network tool (psexec). For the latter the attackers made use of the default  credentials of the legacy systems, as well as abusing misconfigurations in these systems.  Technique  T1053 - Scheduled Task/Job38  “Adversaries may abuse task scheduling functionality to facilitate initial or  recurring execution of malicious code. Utilities exist within all major operating  systems to schedule programs or scripts to be executed at a specified date and  time. A task can also be scheduled on a remote system, provided the proper  authentication is met (ex: RPC and file and printer sharing in Windows  environments). Scheduling a task on a remote system typically requires being a  member of an admin or otherwise privileged group on the remote system.”  Technique  T1021/002 - Remote Services:  SMB/Windows Admin Shares39  \"Adversaries may use Valid Accounts to interact with a remote network share  using Server Message Block (SMB). The adversary may then perform actions as  the logged-on user.  SMB is a file, printer, and serial port sharing protocol for Windows machines on  the same network or domain. Adversaries may use SMB to interact with file  shares, allowing them to move laterally throughout a network. Linux and macOS  implementations of SMB typically use Samba.  Windows systems have hidden network shares that are accessible only to  administrators and provide the ability for remote file copy and other administrative  functions. Example network shares include C$, ADMIN$, and IPC$. Adversaries  may use this technique in conjunction with administrator-level Valid Accounts to  remotely access a networked system over SMB, to interact with systems using  remote procedure calls (RPCs), transfer files, and run transferred binaries  through remote Execution. Example execution techniques that rely on  authenticated sessions over SMB/RPC are Scheduled Task/Job, Service  Execution, and Windows Management Instrumentation. Adversaries can also use  NTLM hashes to access administrator shares on systems with Pass the Hash and  certain configuration and patch levels.\"  The handler proceeded to analyse the extent of the issue by randomly checking workstations  within the hospital for signs of the malware. He found out that the malware managed to spread  across the whole hospital, rendering some of the critical data and equipment unavailable.  The hospital’s network and information security team was overwhelmed by the attack, so they  reached out to the national CSIRT, part of the national cybersecurity authority.  37 MITRE Corporation, Data Encrypted for Impact, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1486/ (retrieved on 13 October 2020).  38 MITRE Corporation, Scheduled Task/Job, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1053/ (retrieved on 13 October 2020).  39 MITRE Corporation, Remote Services, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1021/002/ (retrieved on 13 October 2020).  https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1486/ https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1053/ https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1021/002/  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  23  Note: In this scenario, you are a member of the national CSIRT that is helping the hospital with  this security breach.  Criminal investigation  The hospital notified40 this attack to the national CSIRT, which contacted the national  cybersecurity authority who then reported this incident to Law Enforcement. The Police cyber  unit started the investigation. They immediately contacted the national CSIRT, which provided  general information, a sample of the ransomware and a link to the source website. A sample  was sent to Europol through the Europol Malware Analysis Solution (EMAS) sandbox for  crossmatching.  The Police found out that the website was hosted by a web hosting provider based in one of the  EU MSs. The Police ordered the provider, via European investigation order, to provide stored  subscriber and traffic data related to the relevant account.  Provided data revealed that the malicious content was uploaded from a country outside the EU.  Even though the Police immediately requested legal assistance (including Europol), based on  past experiences with this particular country, it was virtually impossible to get any cooperation in  such cases from the official authorities.  Note that in this use case we do not focus on investigations on the C&C (command and control)  servers that are typically used by ransomware. Information found on these servers can be used  during incident response, for example to decrypt the data, as well as to identify the other  potential victims and the criminals behind the attack.  Information sharing  Even though it was unlikely that LE would get assistance through official channels, in the third  country there is a well-functioning CSIRT community which is regularly and openly sharing  information. The national CSIRT involved in dealing with the incident offered to help the LE by  requesting traffic data.  2.2.3 Tasks  2.2.3.1 Task 1: Notification of the incident  As stated above, the hospital’s network and information security team notified the national  CSIRT, part of the cybersecurity authority of the incident. Who else should be notified within and  outside of the hospital? Are there any legal obligations for the hospital to report such incidents  to public institutions? Use the template below to list individuals, authorities and other parties that  should be informed about the incident. Column 1 should be used to list the parties to be notified  and column 2 to identify whether the notification is required or recommended. Column 3 can be  used for comments.

ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  24  Outside the organisation  2.2.3.2 Task 2: Setting up the task force, division of duties  The national cybersecurity authority decided that a task force should be established to  deal with the crisis. Who should be involved in this task force (e.g. which organisations or  [inter]national authorities, the expertise level of members of the task force)? Are there any  rules on this in your country?  Use the template below to list individuals/organisations that should be involved in the task  force. Column 1 should be used to list the parties to be involved, column 2 to identify what  kind of expertise can they contribute and column 3 to identify which tasks they can be  involved in and what role should they play. Column 4 can be used for comments.  Afterwards, discuss whether there are any relevant rules or best practices on this in your  country.  Figure 12: Task force members list - template  Organisation Expertise Tasks/role Comments  While in some Members States the victim is part of the task force, in some other Member  States not. Discuss this point and how it works in your country.  The university that cooperates with the hospital offered their volunteer ICT experts  (students and employees) who can help to deal with the crisis. Can they be involved? In  which activities (e.g. reinstallation of hospitals computers, incident handling, attempting to  break the encryption, track the source of the attack, etc.)?  Explain which activities related to the incident handling can volunteers be involved and  how. Column 1 should be used to name the activity and column 2 to describe the  involvement.

Figure 15: Duties, synergies and potential interferences – Template  Duty (task) Synergies and potential interferences  Comments  2.2.3.4 Task 4: Incident handling, evidence collection, coordination  Experts in the task force found out by using sandbox analysis that the ransomware is not only  encrypting data from the information systems but is also exfiltrating patient data outside the  organisation. CSIRT members immediately proposed to block communication to the C&C server  to prevent further disclosure of sensitive information. LE, however, suggested to wait with this  measure and try to track the data in an attempt to locate the attacker, since they’re suspecting  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  26  that the attacker is based in the EU even though s/he used servers located in third countries to  disseminate the malware.  Explain, how you would deal with this issue, what should have priority – protection of sensitive  data or locating the attacker, and whether there are any official rules on this in your country?

v2.0, March 2022  30  A ANNEX:  SUPPLEMENTAL USE CASE  USE CASE 3: DDOS AND MALWARE BLENDED ATTACK  Figure 19: Overview of use case 3  This use case should be conducted in groups so that different results and approaches of each  group can be compared. Then, the advantages and disadvantages of individual solutions should  be discussed.  Objectives  The current exercise scenario aims to familiarize the trainees with technical, procedural and  legal aspects of incident management. In particular, the objectives are to:  • Raise awareness about what types of cyber incidents might affect an airport and what  can be the impact of such incidents  • Learn about the role of the CSIRT, Law Enforcement, and National Cybersecurity  Authority  • Understand the importance of efficient coordination between main stakeholders during  a large scale/high impact incident  Overview of use case 3  Targeted Audience  This exercise is useful for incident responders and members of the Law  Enforcement of all experience levels. It is particularly helpful for national  CSIRT members and Law Enforcement officers involved in cybercrime  investigations  Total Duration  30 minutes  Note that this use case is a supplemental use case and not directly covered in  a training session.  Scenario  This is a group exercise. Each trainee is a member of either the CSIRT team  and/or Law Enforcement who is involved in the prevention, mitigation and  investigation of cybersecurity incidents. Their goal is to address the key  ramification of a DDoS and malware blended attack against a large size airport  in a European capital city  Task 1 Notification of the incident  Task 2  Setting up task force, division of duties  Task 3  Possible duties (tasks), synergies and potential interferences between CSIRT,  LE and the Judiciary  Task 4 International cooperation and information sharing  Task 5 Post incident preventive measures  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  31  • Practice setting up and coordinating task force for dealing with large scale attack  • Understand the importance of information sharing during cybersecurity attacks  • Practice how to identify and propose post-incident reactive and preventive measures  • Learn about preventive measures against such type of incidents  Scenario  Setting the stage  A large size airport in a European capital city is under massive DDoS attack, combined with a  malware attack, causing key systems outages and malfunctioning (i.e. systems assuring  functions like flight scheduling, passengers’ check-in, baggage routing, etc.).  Already the situation has had significant adverse effects on the airport’s operations and safety.  Undetected attacks resulted in the change of the flight plans provoking delays and influencing  the aircrafts cleaning and fuelling process, as well as the time required to load the luggage,  affecting the world-wide traffic.  You are a member of a task force established to help the airport company to deal with the  incident. An initial assessment shows that the IT team has yet to come up with a course of  action for stopping the attack and restoring the services. The pressure from the media,  authorities, and passengers is rapidly growing.  Figure 20: Graphical representation of scenario 3 – Attack  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  32  Organisational profile  The affected airport is one of the biggest air traffic hubs in Europe, with an average of more than  100,000 passengers passing through per day.  The management of the airport invested only in perimetral security in recent years (firewalls,  gateways, etc.). At the same time, internal network suffers from lack of proper segmentation,  and some of the critical systems are running old operating systems due to legacy and  compatibility constraints.  The airport is running its own on-prem data centre doubled by a disaster recovery site, but the  Business Continuity Plan (BCP) plan wasn’t tested in the last two years.  Before the breach  The attackers gathered information online about the airport company and identified useful data:  the IP addresses space, systems and applications, management and key personnel names and  contact details, etc.  Reconnaissance was also done at the physical perimeter of the airport by attackers disguised  as passengers.  Attackers managed to plant a rogue 3G Raspberry Pi device in the airport network. The device  is used to sniff the network traffic for systems discovery and credentials extraction (plain-text  credentials sent over the network or easy-to-crack hashes).  Figure 21: Graphical representation of scenario 3 – Overview of interactions  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  33  While the attacker created a diversion with the DDoS attack, some of the internal systems of the  airport were infected with a customized malware delivered using two different infection vectors:  spear-phishing emails sent from the rogue device to avoid email gateway filtering, and Windows  SMB exploits launched from the same device.  Technique  TA0015 – Technical information  gathering41  “Technical information gathering consists of the process of identifying critical  technical elements of intelligence an adversary will need about a target in order  to best attack.  Technical intelligence gathering includes, but is not limited to,  understanding the target's network architecture, IP space, network services,  email format, and security procedures”.  Technique  T1566.001 – Spearphishing  attachment42  “Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious attachment in an  attempt to elicit sensitive information and/or gain access to victim systems.  Spearphishing attachment is a specific variant of spearphishing. Spearphishing  attachment is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the  use of malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically  delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or  industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and  usually rely upon User Execution to gain execution”.  Technique  T1210 - Exploitation of Remote  Services43  “Adversaries may exploit remote services to gain unauthorized access to internal  systems once inside of a network. Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs  when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program,  service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute  adversary-controlled code. A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of  remote services is for lateral movement to enable access to a remote system.”  Initial response  Breach notification  A lot of people are reporting at the check-in desks that their flights seem to have disappeared  from the schedule display systems or they have long delays. At the same time, people can’t  obtain information from other online sources because the internet is inaccessible from the  airport Wi-Fi network and even if they use their 3G/4G/5G connection the airport website and  other related platforms are unavailable.  It becomes clear that the IT infrastructure and applications are affected by an incident, and a  cyber-attack is suspected. The network team starts to investigate, and they report that a huge  DDoS attack is conducted against the airport’s internet-facing systems.  The security team is also reporting that a high number of database operations were executed in  a short interval of time using credentials of a user that is claiming to know nothing about the  situation.  The airport management board decides to notify the aviation sectorial CSIRT and to file a  complaint to the Police. The sectoral CSIRT share the information with the other relevant  CSIRTs, in particular the national CSIRT, which is part of the national cybersecurity authority.  Technique  T1498 – Network Denial of Service44  “Adversaries may perform Network Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to degrade or  block the availability of targeted resources to users. Network DoS can be  performed by exhausting the network bandwidth services rely on. Example  resources include specific websites, email services, DNS, and web-based  41 MITRE Corporation, Technical information gathering, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0015/ (retrieved on 2 December 2021).  42 MITRE Corporation, Spearphishing attachment,  https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1566/001 (retrieved on 2 December 2021).  43 MITRE Corporation, Exploitation of remote services, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1210/ (retrieved on 13 October 2020)  44 MITRE Corporation, Network Denial of Service, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1498 (retrieved on 13 October 2020).  https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1204 https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0015/ https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1566/001 https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1210/ https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1498  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  34  applications. Adversaries have been observed conducting network DoS attacks  for political purposes[1] and to support other malicious activities, including  distraction[2], hacktivism, and extortion”.  Technique  TA0006 – Credential Access45  “Credential Access consists of techniques for stealing credentials like account  names and passwords. Techniques used to get credentials include keylogging or  credential dumping. Using legitimate credentials can give adversaries access to  systems, make them harder to detect, and provide the opportunity to create more  accounts to help achieve their goals”  Response of the CSIRT team  The CSIRT Team uses lessons learned from recent similar attacks against airports and starts  the Incident Response process with actions meant to contain the incident as much as possible.  The user account responsible for altering the airport databases is disabled, and the user  workstation is isolated from the network and sent to the digital forensics laboratory. All recent  activity of the user is tracked because there’s plausible suspicion that the user was the victim of  a spear-phishing attack which resulted in his workstation being infected with malware.  Additionally, the CSIRT team is working with the airport IT personnel, the ISP, airport IT  vendors, and international partners to try to come up with a mitigation plan for the DDoS attack.  Multiple scenarios are studied, but for the moment it is decided to ask the ISP to filter the traffic  coming from outside of the country the airport is located in.  Next, the technical investigation of the incident is started:  • Analysis of logs from perimeter security solutions (firewall, web and email gateway,  proxy, etc.)  • Analysis of the recent activity of the user causing the malicious actions of the database  and conduction of a forensically-sound investigation of his/her workstation  • Try to identify rogue devices in the network  Criminal investigation  The national cybersecurity authority informed the LE of this incident. The local Police cyber unit  started the investigation by:  • Analysing security video cameras from the airport in the last month to try to identify  attackers planting rogue devices  • LE/Prosecutor requesting a warrant and seizure of the electronic devices of the  possible suspects  To be complete, in real cases such visual identification might take some time and is not always  that straightforward, but we now just assume this happened for the good flow of the use case.  Information sharing  The CSIRT is conducting an information exchange about the incident with other CSIRTs  (especially the ones in the aviation sector/sectorial CSIRTs), trying to find out if similar attacks  were conducted recently and gather information about investigation results and mitigation  measures.  In cooperation with the airport management, the CSIRT will share the gathered information with  the national LE and will offer their further support to continue the investigations and facilitate  information exchange nationally and internationally.  45 MITRE Corporation, Credential Access, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0006/ (retrieved on 2 December 2021).  https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/11/operation-poisoned-handover-unveiling-ties-between-apt-activity-in-hong-kongs-pro-democracy-movement.html https://www.ic3.gov/media/2012/FraudAlertFinancialInstitutionEmployeeCredentialsTargeted.pdf https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0006/  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  35  Tasks  Task 1: Notification of the incident  The airport security team needs to quickly do an initial assessment of the situation and notify the  incident according to existing procedures and legal framework.  As previously mentioned, the National Competent Cybersecurity Authority or the National  CSIRT is notified.  To whom else and when should the incident be reported?  Figure 22: Notification list – Template  Who to notify Required /  recommended Comments  Within the organisation  Outside the organisation  Task 2: Setting up the task force, division of duties  While in the context of a criminal investigation the prosecutor/judge is in charge of assigning the  roles for dealing with the investigation of the cybercrime, the national CSIRT may establish a  task force to respond to the incident and deal with the crisis generated by the incident.  Analyse the legal and organisational framework by defining the competences of CSIRTs, LE,  and the Judiciary in their activities related to fighting cybercrime, and capture potential synergies  and possible overlaps. Analyse the possible interferences in the cooperation between CSIRTs  and LE and their interaction with the Judiciary. To collect data and roles and duties, use the  SoD matrix in ANNEX B.  The role of the IT contractors of the airport should be decided: will they be part of the task  force?  Figure 23: Task force template  Organisation Expertise Tasks/role Comments  Task 3: Possible duties (tasks), synergies and potential interferences between  CSIRT, LE and Judiciary  Select some of the duties from column 1 of the SoD in Annex B and with some of these duties,  briefly describe the measures to that could be taken by each community in the scenario.

INTRODUCTION  1.1 THEMATIC AREA  This training material is an updated version of the ENISA training material Aspects of  Cooperation between CSIRT and LE - Toolset, Document for trainees3, that was developed  based particularly on the ENISA 2020 Report on CSIRT-LE Cooperation - A study of the roles  and synergies among selected EU MS/EFTA countries 4 (an updated and expanded version of it  is expected to be published in Q1 2022). Some of the 2020 report's conclusions are that, in  terms of incident response and cybercrime, the position and role of the Computer Security  Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) and Law Enforcement (LE) in the national institutional  framework varies from country to country. Similarly, the structure and the organisation of the  Judiciary also depends on the country.  In addition, between the three communities - CSIRTs, LE and Judiciary - different approaches  and different levels of cooperation exist. While the operational cooperation, especially in the  daily interactions and informal communication, seems to be well-established, sometimes it  seems that more structured cooperation could be achieved to have less fragmented information  flow between the three communities. Also, there is a more significant gap in the interaction  between CSIRTs and the Judiciary, compared to the cooperation established between LE and  the Judiciary. CSIRTs would rather often interact with the Judiciary in case they are called as an  expert witness in court.  Moreover, LE is not solely involved in the detection and investigation of cybercrimes. A key  component of their role is the preventive aspects of cybercrime, and it is in this role that  cooperation with other communities, particularly the CSIRT community, becomes apparent to  support preventive strategies. Preventive aspects of incidents/cybercrimes can also be seen as  the initial ground for establishing cooperation between the CSIRTs and the LE communities,  which can then extend to other phases of the incident/crime investigation. On the other hand,  CSIRTs play an important role in informing (potential) victims of cybercrime and providing them  with information on how to report a crime to the Police.  CSIRT and LE communities also need to closely cooperate to mitigate the risks of having  evidence compromised or destroyed.  Regarding the incident handling and cybercrime investigation, several competences are  required. While each community has developed its own set of skills and knowledge, they can all  benefit from the competences of the other communities.  Furthermore, the 2020 report on CSIRT and LE cooperation also concluded that despite the  initiatives that are already in place to facilitate training within each community, or joint trainings  engaging two communities (e.g. CSIRTs and LE, or LE and the Judiciary), it seems that there is  a need for more training and exercises addressing the three communities together.  3 Aspects of Cooperation between CSIRT and LE - Toolset, Document for trainees,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/online-training-material/legal- cooperation#Aspects  4 ENISA, 2020 Report on CSIRT-LE Cooperation - A study of the roles and synergies among selected EU Member  States/EFTA countries, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/2020-report-on-csirt-le-cooperation (published on 26  January 2021).  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/online-training-material/legal-cooperation#Aspects https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/online-training-material/legal-cooperation#Aspects  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  5  This training material, as mentioned, is an updated version of the ENISA training material  Aspects of Cooperation between CSIRT and LE - Toolset, Document for trainees published in  January 20215. The updates have been made based on the feedback received during the two  training sessions organised by ENISA to pilot the training material. These pilot sessions took  place as virtual events in August and in October 2021 and representatives from CSIRTs, LE,  Judiciary and some EU Agencies participated in these pilots.  Finally, the 2020 report on CSIRT and LE, the handbook and this toolset are a set of  deliverables complementing each other as follows:  • The report analyses roles, duties, competences, synergies and potential interferences  across the three communities (CSIRTs, LE and Judiciary).  • The handbook helps the trainer explain these concepts through scenarios.  • The toolset contains exercises for trainees based on these scenarios.  1.2 LEARNING OUTCOMES  As a result of attending this training, the trainee should be able to:  • demonstrate knowledge of interactions across the three communities (CSIRTs, LE and  Judiciary); synergies, interferences and challenges  • use the Segregation of Duties (SoD) matrix to collect the data to identify the key  responsibilities for their communities (CSIRTs, LE, and Judiciary) and link them with  the skills required to fulfil these duties  • better understand the legal and organisational framework defining the competences of  CSIRTs, LE, and the Judiciary, in their activities related to fighting cybercrime  • understand different decision-making processes among the communities  • capture potential synergies and possible overlaps  • overcome possible interferences of cooperation between CSIRTs and LE and their  interaction with the Judiciary  • ensure structured integration of liaison officers for coordination between the different  communities  • perform uniform and effective communication between CSIRTs, LE and the Judiciary  toward victim and relevant stakeholders  • coordinate basic first responder actions at victim site (collecting evidence without  tampering it, informing partners of which evidence is gathered)  • explain technical terms to non-technical participants, e.g. to the Judiciary  • better translate legal constraints to CSIRTs  • identify appropriate approaches and tools to help support effective collaboration  • identify and develop a common plan to enhance cooperation  1.3 COURSE DURATION AND TRAINING OUTLINE  3 hours and 5 minutes, including one break.  1.4 COURSE CONTENTS  The training includes three scenarios where trainees learn when and how CSIRT members  cooperate with LE when dealing with cyber security incidents. The three scenarios cover:  -  Theft of confidential data  -  Ransomware  -  Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and malware blended attack  5 Aspects of Cooperation between CSIRT and LE - Toolset, Document for trainees,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/online-training-material/legal- cooperation#Aspects  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/online-training-material/legal-cooperation#Aspects https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/online-training-material/legal-cooperation#Aspects  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  6  The use case 1 (theft of confidential data) and use case 2 (ransomware) are updated with the  feedback from the pilot sessions. The use case 3 is added as a supplementary case.  Training sessions should cover only one-use case and use the material from the other use  case to steer further discussion or re-iterate on certain topics.  The training agenda consists of  • An introduction to the training (25')  • Explanation of the frameworks and models used in the training (25')  • Introduction to the use cases (15')  • Study of one-use case (85')  • The closure and overview of the learning outcomes (10')  • A final section with room for questions and feedback (10')  One break of 15' is foreseen before the start of the study of the use case. The trainer can  optionally add additional breaks. The total course duration is 185 minutes, including one break.  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  7  2. USE CASES  2.1 USE CASE 1: THEFT OF CONFIDENTIAL DATA  Figure 1: Overview of use case 1  Overview of the use case 1  Targeted Audience  This exercise is useful for incident responders and members of Law  Enforcement of all experience levels. It is particularly helpful for national  CSIRT members and Law Enforcement officers involved in cybercrime  investigations  Total Duration 85 minutes  Scenario  This is a group exercise. Each trainee is a member of CSIRT, LE or the  Judiciary who is involved in the prevention, mitigation and investigation of the  cybersecurity incident/crime. Their goals are to address key ramifications  resulting from the theft of confidential data, identify synergies that could be  exploited by cooperating with the other communities, and potential  interferences in case of lack of cooperation/coordination  Task 1 Identify and describe the organisational profile  Task 2  Describe measures that CSIRT and/or LE can take to prevent the  incident/crime  Task 3  Use the SoD Matrix to analyse possible duties (tasks), synergies and potential  interferences between CSIRT, LE and the Judiciary  Task 4  List possible measures that CSIRT and/or LE can take during the incident  response/crime investigation while performing different duties  Task 5  Group discussion on balancing the incident mitigation (asset protection) and  criminal investigation (evidence collection and preservation)  2.1.1 Objectives  In this exercise, the trainees will learn when and how CSIRT, LE, and Judiciary representatives  can cooperate. In particular, the objectives of the exercise are to:  • Understand and appreciate the specifics of CSIRT/LE activities  • Analyse roles of different actors and how they can cooperate  • Identify synergies that can be exploited  • Grasp the complexity of cooperation  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  8  2.1.2 Scenario  2.1.2.1 Setting the stage  This scenario describes an incident where carefully selected individuals working for different  Member States (MS A, MS B, and MS C) subscribe to a fake event. The event website mimics  an event organized by an EU Commissioner and contains malicious documents. Once installed  on the victim’s computer, the malware included in the document exfiltrates domain, Virtual  Private Network (VPN) access login credentials and selected documents with sensitive  information. The credentials and the sensitive information are then monetized by the attacker  via a semi-public website.  The internal security team of the Ministry of Education of MS A, to which one of the victims  belongs, detects the incident. The internal security team of the Ministry of Education of MS A  notifies the MS A national CSIRT, which in turn contacts Law Enforcement (of MS A).  The location where the exfiltration of data took place is in European MS D - whereas the  website making the exfiltrated data available is located in Country Z, a non-EU/EFTA country.  In this use case, we use the concept of lanes to describe two distinct events that are part of the  same security incident. The concept of lanes is used to demonstrate to the students that  different security events which at first seem unrelated, can in fact be related to the same  security incident. It is an opportunity for students to understand that separate investigations,  started from different security events, will eventually merge because they deal with the same  security incident. Students should cover both lanes to grasp the full details of the security  incident.  Figure 2: Graphical representation of scenario 1 – Attack  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  9  2.1.2.2 Before the breach  Reconnaissance  The attackers in this scenario spent a considerable amount of time on the reconnaissance of  their potential new victim. They used online research of the Ministry of Education of MS A to find  individuals of interest. They mapped out with whom these individuals typically collaborate, in  particular with individuals at other ministries in MS A but also at Ministries of Education in other  countries and with the European Commission. The attackers supplemented this information with  the publicly available calendar information from the Commissioner.  The attackers used the following tactics and techniques:  Tactic  TA0017 - Organizational  Information Gathering6  “Organizational information gathering consists of the process of identifying critical  organizational elements of intelligence an adversary will need about a target in order to best  attack.  Similar to competitive intelligence, organisational intelligence gathering focuses on  understanding the operational tempo of an organization and gathering a deep understanding of  the organization and how it operates, in order to best develop a strategy to target it.”  Tactic  TA0016 - People  Information Gathering7  “People Information Gathering consists of the process of identifying critical personnel elements  of intelligence an adversary will need about a target in order to best attack.  People intelligence  gathering focuses on identifying key personnel or individuals with critical accesses in order to  best approach a target for attack.  It may involve aspects of social engineering, elicitation,  mining social media sources, or be thought of as understanding the personnel element of  competitive intelligence.”  6 MITRE Corporation, Organizational Information Gathering, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0017/ (retrieved on 13  October 2020).  7 MITRE Corporation, People Information Gathering, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0016/ (retrieved on 13 October  2020).

Technique  T1283 – Identify  business relationships11  \"Business relationship information may be used by an adversary to shape social engineering  attempts (exploiting who a target expects to hear from) or to plan for technical actions such as  exploiting network trust relationship\"  Technique  T1295 - Analyze social  and business  relationships, interests,  and affiliations12  “Social media provides insight into the target's affiliations with groups and organizations.  Certification information can explain their technical associations and professional associations.  Personal information can provide data for exploitation or even blackmail.”  Technique  T1296 – Assess  targeting options  'OPSEC'13  \"An adversary may assess a target's operational security (OPSEC) practices in order to  identify targeting options. A target may share different information in different settings or be  more of less cautious in different environments.\"  Technique  T1269 – Identify people  of interest14  \"The attempt to identify people of interest or with an inherent weakness for direct or indirect  targeting to determine an approach to compromise a person or organization. Such targets may  include individuals with poor OPSEC practices or those who have a trusted relationship with  the intended target.\"  Technique  T1274 – Vulnerable  sensitive personnel  information15  \"An adversary may identify sensitive personnel information not typically posted on a social  media site, such as address, marital status, financial history, and law enforcement infractions.  This could be conducted by searching public records that are frequently available for free or at  a low cost online.\"  The attackers then used one of the appointments in the Commissioner’s calendar to set up a  fake round table event to collect future views on a specific topic, hosted by the Ministry of  Education of MS B. The attackers identified which individuals in the Ministry of Education of MS  A would be the most interested in this topic. Then, the attackers set up fake personas to  impersonate representatives of the Ministry of Education of MS B, and they created a website  mimicking the event registration website of the Ministry of Education of MS B.

The event website requested that visitors enter personal information, and it  contained documents, such as a call for proposals or Q&A, which were prepared by the  attackers to include malicious code.  Tactic  TA0001 – Initial Access18  \"Initial Access consists of techniques that use various entry vectors to gain their  initial foothold within a network. Techniques used to gain a foothold include  targeted spearphishing and exploiting weaknesses on public-facing web servers.  Footholds gained through initial access may allow for continued access, like valid  accounts and use of external remote services, or may be limited-use due to  changing passwords.\"  Technique  T1566 - Phishing: Spear phishing  Link19  “Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious link in an attempt  to elicit sensitive information and/or gain access to victim systems.  Spearphishing with a link is a specific variant of spearphishing. It is different from  other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of links to download  malware contained in the email, instead of attaching malicious files to the email  itself, to avoid defenses that may inspect email attachments.”  Execution  The event website included text to lure the visitors into opening the documents because they  contained “essential” information on the event. The malicious documents were Office  documents, with a blurred image and a text stating that to see the content, the user needed to  “Enable Decryption via Enable Content”, which enabled Word macros. Once the macro was  enabled, it downloaded and ran the malicious executable file.  Technique  T1204 - User Execution20  “An adversary may rely upon specific actions by a user in order to gain execution.  Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to execute malicious  code by, for example, opening a malicious document file or link. These user  actions will typically be observed as follow-on behaviour from forms of Phishing.”  Credential access and collection  The malicious executable was, in fact, a variant of a well-known keylogger specifically designed  to collect credentials entered by a user when starting a VPN client. The captured credentials  were regularly sent out to an external website. Apart from a keylogger, the malware was also  able to collect files on the local system of the victim. It searched for specific types of files with  particular names which were sent out to an external website.  Technique  T1056 – Input Capture21  “Adversaries may use methods of capturing user input to obtain credentials or collect  information. During normal system usage, users often provide credentials to different  locations, such as login pages/portals or system dialog boxes. Input capture  mechanisms may be transparent to the user (e.g. Credential API Hooking) or rely on  deceiving the user into providing input into what they believe to be a genuine service  (e.g. Web Portal Capture).”  Technique  T1567 – Exfiltration Over Web  Service22  “Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service to exfiltrate data  rather than their primary command and control channel. Popular Web services acting  as an exfiltration mechanism may give a significant amount of cover due to the  likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to  the compromise.

Their initial investigation showed that the internal source of the traffic  was on a network segment used by individuals working on sensitive material.  The security team of the Ministry of Education of MS A alerted its internal CSIRT and started  collecting information on the affected assets.  Lane 2  At the same time, the CSIRT team of the Ministry of Education of MS A got an alert from one of  their public crawlers. The team received an internal notification from the Analysis Information  Leak framework (AIL) framework26 showing that there was a hit on the name of the Ministry of  Education of MS A for a website located on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) in Country Z. The  website was protected with a password and required payment to access it. It provided some  screenshots and extracts of texts to show what type of information was available for potential  “customers”.  Upon inspection of the screenshot of the alert, the CSIRT of the Ministry of Education  immediately spotted that the document contained sensitive information which should not be  publicly accessible.  The response of the CSIRT  The CSIRT handler on duty for the Ministry of Education of MS A classified the incidents  according to the ENISA Reference Security Incident Taxonomy (RSIT)27 as “Information  Content Security”, “Leak of confidential information”.  The CSIRT requested the security operations team to safeguard the logs of the affected assets  in their Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and use Endpoint Detection and  Response (EDR) tooling to capture live system memory and collect important system artefacts.  23 MITRE Corporation, Scheduled Transfer, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1029/ (retrieved on 2 December 2021).  24 MITRE Corporation, Archive Collected Data, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1560/ (retrieved on 2 December 2021).  25 MITRE Corporation, Data from Local System, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1005/ (retrieved on 2 December 2021).  26 GitHub, CIRCL  / AIL-framework, https://github.com/CIRCL/AIL-framework (retrieved on 13 October 2020).  27 GitHub, enisaeu  / Reference-Security-Incident-Taxonomy-Task-Force, https://github.com/enisaeu/Reference-Security-Incident-Taxonomy- Task-Force (retrieved on 13 October 2020).  https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1029/ https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1560/ https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1005/ https://github.com/CIRCL/AIL-framework https://github.com/enisaeu/Reference-Security-Incident-Taxonomy-Task-Force https://github.com/enisaeu/Reference-Security-Incident-Taxonomy-Task-Force  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  13  Unfortunately, the EDR had not been deployed to all assets. In the meantime, the security  operations team was able to isolate the system process responsible for the exfiltration of the  data. Additionally, they still saw active network activity to the external website. This activity  meant that the exfiltration was ongoing.  The CSIRT notified the CISO and the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Education of MS A of  the possible security incident. A crisis team was formed, including the Press Officer, the legal  department, the HR department and a representative of the General Secretariat of the Ministry  of Education of MS A.  At this stage, it was unknown which type of data was exfiltrated. Still, because of the volume of  data already exfiltrated and the type of assets (workstations and individuals involved), the  CSIRT of the Ministry of Education of MS A suggested filtering traffic to the IP in MS D until  further investigation. Additionally, according to the representative of the Ministry of Education of  MS A, the screenshot in the AIL alert was of a document which had not been published and  which was processed on one of the affected assets.  The CSIRT of the Ministry of Education of MS A immediately instructed the network team to  filter all traffic to and from the IP in MS D.  The CISO of the Ministry of Education of MS A, together with the head of CSIRT of the Ministry  of Education of MS A, contacted the national CSIRT of MS A to report the incident and LE of  MS A to file a complaint.  Criminal investigation in MS A  LE officials of MS A were informed of the case details, including the fact that this concerned  sensitive information and that there was a very high suspicion that data had been exfiltrated to a  server in MS D.  LE conducted an investigation and went on-site to the Ministry of Education of MS A to review  the available log material.  The CSIRT of the Ministry of Education of MS A provided LE with their collected reports on  network traffic, together with the screenshots and information of the leaked documents on the  server in Country Z, a non-EU/EFTA country.  The CSIRT of the Ministry of Education of MS A informed LE that the activity was still ongoing  and that they implemented a network filter.  Investigation analysis  Because of the network filter, the malware was unable to contact the server in MS D. This  triggered a failsafe mechanism, and it started encrypting all the files on the workstation.  The CSIRT of the Ministry of Education of MS A informed LE that the evidence on the  workstation was most likely no longer usable. The logs in the SIEM were still available.  Lane 1  LE analysed the network traffic with support from the national CSIRT of MS A. The logs clearly  showed the volume of traffic to the server in MS D.  LE of MS A reached out to their contacts in MS D (with the support of Europol) requesting to  seize the server and collect the evidence. Unfortunately, the hosting company, a bulletproof  hoster, did not respond to the request. LE then attempted to get a warrant for the server.  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  14  Together with the information from the MS A national CSIRT, the LE created a timeline of  events.  Lane 2  Based on the alert data of the CSIRT of the Ministry of Education of MS A, LE identified the  hosting company where the website was offering the sensitive information. LE contacted their  peers in Country Z (with the support of INTERPOL) to formally request the server be seized and  investigated. They used the evidence received from the agency to support their case.  Criminal investigation in MS D  Lane 1  LE in MS D was able to identify the individuals that registered and set up the website and VPS.  An investigation of the activity on the server showed that it was accessed multiple times via IP  addresses belonging to VPN nodes, but also included one residential IP address from MS D.  This most likely occurred after a glitch of the VPN killswitch exposed the IP of the user behind  the VPN. The activity on the server corresponded with the victim’s VPN login attempts of stolen  credentials.  Most of the logs included VPN node accesses, but also had one residential IP address from MS  D, most likely after a glitch of the VPN service which exposed the IP of the user behind the  VPN. The activity on the server corresponded with VPN login attempts of stolen credentials.  The server also had temporary copies of some of the sensitive documents, sorted according to  the collection date.  The server in MS D, however, did not show any activity related to the server in the Country Z.  Lane 2  LE was unable to collect the server in Country Z because, by the time the hosting company  received the request, the owners of the server had destroyed their VPS server.  However, LE was able to identify the individuals that purchased the VPS at the hosting  company.  LE investigation did take different screenshots of the website before the server’s destruction.  These screenshots showed the nature of the site’s documents, along with the methods used to  request money to access the website.  LE / Prosecutor requested a warrant and seizure of the electronic devices of this individual.  LE investigation of the computers of the individuals in MS D showed that their devices contained  traces of the sensitive documents. An examination of the Secure Shell (SSH) history, browser  and e-mail activity also revealed frequent access to the server in Country Z.  The investigation also showed frequent open-source IM (instant messaging) conversations with  another individual in MS D, not linked to the website in MS D but seemingly with a form of  control on the server in Country Z.  The forensic investigation of these electronic devices showed that this individual had configured  and set up the server in Country Z. The e-mail conversation stored on the devices showed an  exchange of the content of the documents and methods of payment.

Figure 7: Duty/suggested measure template  Duty (task) Suggested measure Comments  2.1.3.5 Task 5: Discussion on lessons learned from this scenario  Discuss the issue of balancing the incident mitigation (asset protection) and the criminal  investigation (evidence collection and preservation) with reference to the scenario.  One of the responses of the CSIRT of the Ministry of Education of MS A involves filtering  outgoing network activity to the attackers, effectively preventing the further exfiltration of  sensitive information. This filtering is an understandable activity, certainly as a short-term  containment measure. The side-effect of this measure, however, triggers the malware and  results in encrypted workstations, and as such a loss of evidence.  Discuss the pros and cons of short-term containment actions to protect the victim, but which  might alert the attacker that they have been detected. In general, this depends on the type of  incident and the victim.  As a reference, the courses of action matrix from Lockheed Martin28 can be use. This action  matrix includes two significant categories of actions:  -  passive (Discover and Detect)  28 Eric M. Hutchins E. M., Clopperty M. J., Amin R.

Although for training purposes the scenario is presented as less complicated than real cases  might be, it still allows each party to understand the complexities in terms of actors involved,  roles played, duties (tasks) performed, synergies to exploit, and risks of interference.  2.2 USE CASE 2: RANSOMWARE  Figure 8: Overview of use case 2  Overview of use case 2  Targeted Audience This exercise is useful for incident responders and members of Law  Enforcement of all experience levels. It is particularly helpful for national  CSIRT members and Law Enforcement officers involved in cybercrime  investigations.  Total Duration 85 minutes  Scenario This is a group exercise. Each trainee is a member of either a CSIRT team  and/or Law Enforcement that is involved in the prevention, mitigation and  investigation of cybersecurity incidents. Their goal is to address the key  ramification of a ransomware attack against the municipal hospital.

In  particular, the objectives of the exercise are to:  • Explain CSIRT and LE cooperation in a health sector-related ransomware scenario  • Raise the trainees’ awareness regarding the differences between the legal systems of  various countries and the consequences of these differences  • Understand and appreciate the specifics of CSIRT/LE activities  • Practice setting up and coordinating a task force for dealing with large scale attacks  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  18  • Provide information on how to cooperate and share information  • Practice how to identify and propose post-incident reactive and preventive measures  2.2.2 Scenario  2.2.2.1 Setting the stage  A ransomware attack has been discovered in a large municipal hospital on the hospital patient  records servers. All computers are locked and display a message indicating that the files have  been encrypted; the hacker is demanding 11 bitcoins (approx. €100,000) to provide the  decryption key. The image on the computer screens also states that if the payment is not  received within five days, the price will increase. Within ten days, the patient data will be erased  on the servers and leaked to a public website, and a notification will be sent to the national data  privacy agency.  You are a member of a task force established to help the hospital’s network and information  security team to deal with the incident. You have been assembled; it is now 05:45. It appears  that all significant servers are affected. An initial assessment shows that the hospital email  system and patient record systems are inaccessible, and the hospital intranet sites are also  unavailable.  Figure 9: Graphical representation of scenario 2 – Attack  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  19  2.2.2.2 Organisational profile  The hospital is the largest municipal hospital in your area. Last year the hospital took care of  almost 1 million patients and had about 5,000 employees. As such, the hospital relies on a  network with up to 10,000 connected devices, which includes workstations, diagnostic tools and  servers storing patients’ data. In recent years, hospital management was somewhat reluctant to  invest in cybersecurity, and even though most computers are relatively well taken care of, some,  especially that operating specialised equipment, are running legacy systems like Windows XP,  due to compatibility issues. The network is not segmented, and critical systems are in the same  network as specialised equipment, as well as all workstations. The hospital has no clear rules  on data management and backup. Patient data that are stored in the hospital’s information  systems are backed up and protected from ransomware. Still, a lot of relevant data about  currently hospitalised and treated patients are not stored in the information systems, but on the  doctors’ workstations, which are not being backed up.  2.2.2.3 Before the breach  The COVID-19 pandemic is still very much going on, which leads to heavy pressure on your  country’s hospital system. Some cybercriminals decided to take advantage of this situation and  started targeting medical facilities with their ransomware campaigns. The hospital’s security  team issued and distributed a directive that explained this threat to the employees and informed  them how to be cautious and prevent their devices from getting infected with malware.  Reconnaissance  The attackers in this scenario spent a considerable amount of time on the reconnaissance of  their potential new victim. They researched the online available information of the hospital to  Figure 10: Graphical representation of scenario 2 – Overview of interactions  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  20  find out its departments and individuals of interest. None of this required any specific access.  This type of research is also typically called OSINT, Open-source intelligence. The attackers  used the following tactics and techniques:  Tactic  TA0017 - Organizational  Information Gathering29  “Organizational information gathering consists of the process of identifying critical  organizational elements of intelligence an adversary will need about a target in order to best  attack.  Similar to competitive intelligence, organisational intelligence gathering focuses on  understanding the operational tempo of an organization and gathering a deep understanding of  the organization and how it operates, in order to best develop a strategy to target it.”  Tactic  TA0016 - People  Information Gathering30  “People Information Gathering consists of the process of identifying critical personnel elements  of intelligence an adversary will need about a target in order to best attack.  People intelligence  gathering focuses on identifying key personnel or individuals with critical accesses in order to  best approach a target for attack.  It may involve aspects of social engineering, elicitation,  mining social media sources, or be thought of as understanding the personnel element of  competitive intelligence.”  Tactic  TA0015 – Technical  Information Gathering31  \"Technical information gathering consists of the process of identifying critical technical  elements of intelligence an adversary will need about a target in order to best attack.  Technical intelligence gathering includes, but is not limited to, understanding the target's  network architecture, IP space, network services, email format, and security procedures.\"  Tactic  TA0018 – Technical  Weakness  Identification32  \"Technical weakness identification consists of identifying and analysing weaknesses and  vulnerabilities collected during the intelligence gathering phases to determine best approach  based on technical complexity and adversary priorities (e.g., expediency, stealthiness).\"  The attackers compiled a detailed picture of the hospital infrastructure based on the information  from:  - The hospital public website, with the full names and roles of the medical staff;  - IT security job descriptions, disclosing the type of security devices that are in use;  - Procurement documents, disclosing details on the current network infrastructure and  network layout as well as information for maintenance framework contracts for legacy  medical equipment.  The identification of the legacy medical equipment gave the attackers opportunity to compile a  set of default access credentials, potential vulnerabilities of these devices as well as a list of  typically network exposed services. Note that they did not take the approach of using for  example, Shodan to look up vulnerable Internet exposed medical systems, although this would  most likely have given them an easier access into the hospital network.  The attackers identified which individuals in the hospital would be the most interested to target  with initial infection. Then, the attackers created the malware mimicking a tool for the analysis of  the diseases symptoms and setup a website to distribute the malware. Afterwards the link to this  website was distributed via phishing e-mails, specifically send to the targeted individuals.

Spearphishing with  a link is a specific variant of spearphishing. It is different from other forms of  spearphishing in that it employs the use of links to download malware contained in  the email, instead of attaching malicious files to the email itself, to avoid defences  that may inspect email attachments.”  2.2.2.4 Initial response  Breach notification  When a receptionist in the X-ray department tried to log in at the start of her shift, she could not  open the files and a message indicating that the files have been encrypted appeared on her  screen. She notified a supervisor who then called the hospital’s IT helpdesk to report what  happened, who in turn notified the hospital’s network and information security team.  The response of the CSIRT team  The hospital’s network and information security team handler received the alert from the  hospital staff and identified it as a high priority threat. The handler classified it according to the  ENISA RSIT35 as an incident of “Information Content Security”, “Unauthorised modification of  information”, caused by the ransomware.  From an initial analysis, it appeared that the ransomware was called UnluckyLocky, a new type  of ransomware with limited online information. Therefore, it was assumed that there was no  known decryption key. The handler uncovered a news report online that described another  hospital that seemed to have been infected by a similar attack with ransomware named Gotcha.  The news article suggested that the response to the incident was slow and that almost all the  computers and servers were infected. Additionally, the public was made aware of the incident  as it had a significant impact on the hospital not being able to offer essential services. The  incident went on for six days during which time even the hospital’s most basic functionality was  forced to stop.  The handler then attempted to identify the source of the ransomware with the limited publicly  available information on UnluckyLocky published by the respected security company.  The handlers analysed the activity that was related to the affected system and user, and used  the logs from the web proxy server and e-mail server to further investigate the source of this  problem.  They were able to find out that the source was a malicious website that informed about the  COVID-19 pandemic and offered for download a tool for analysis of the decease symptoms.  The handler was able to download a sample of the malware.  The malware was executed by the user who downloaded it from the website, after clicking a link  received via a phishing e-mail.  Technique  T1204 - User Execution36  “An adversary may rely upon specific actions by a user to gain execution. Users  may be subjected to social engineering to get them to execute malicious code by,  for example, opening a malicious document file or link. These user actions will  typically be observed as follow-on behaviour from forms of Phishing.”  34 MITRE Corporation, Phishing:Spearphishing Link, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1566/002/ (retrieved on 13  October 2020).  35 GitHub, enisaeu  / Reference-Security-Incident-Taxonomy-Task-Force, https://github.com/enisaeu/Reference-Security-Incident- Taxonomy-Task-Force (retrieved on 13 October 2020).  36 MITRE Corporation, User Execution, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1204/ (retrieved on 13 October 2020).  https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1566/002/ https://github.com/enisaeu/Reference-Security-Incident-Taxonomy-Task-Force https://github.com/enisaeu/Reference-Security-Incident-Taxonomy-Task-Force https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1204/  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  22  Upon execution, the malware first enumerated and encrypted the data within the target  computer system and any connected storages. This rendered most of the data unavailable to  the user while still allowing the user to operate the essential functions of the computer system.  The malware also regularly prompted a window warning the user that the system was encrypted  and decryption keys would be provided upon payment of the ransom.  Technique  T1486 - Data Encrypted for Impact37  “Adversaries may encrypt data on target systems or on large numbers of systems  in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources. They can  attempt to render stored data inaccessible by encrypting files or data on local and  remote drives and withholding access to a decryption key. This may be done to  extract monetary compensation from a victim in exchange for decryption or a  decryption key (ransomware) or to render data permanently inaccessible in cases  where the key is not saved or transmitted. In the case of ransomware, it is typical  that common user files like Office documents, PDFs, images, videos, audio, text,  and source code files will be encrypted. In some cases, adversaries may encrypt  critical system files, disk partitions, and the MBR.”  The malware also regularly launched a task that attempted to spread the malicious code via  email messages sent to stored addresses and through executing software on remote computers  via legitimate network tool (psexec). For the latter the attackers made use of the default  credentials of the legacy systems, as well as abusing misconfigurations in these systems.  Technique  T1053 - Scheduled Task/Job38  “Adversaries may abuse task scheduling functionality to facilitate initial or  recurring execution of malicious code. Utilities exist within all major operating  systems to schedule programs or scripts to be executed at a specified date and  time. A task can also be scheduled on a remote system, provided the proper  authentication is met (ex: RPC and file and printer sharing in Windows  environments). Scheduling a task on a remote system typically requires being a  member of an admin or otherwise privileged group on the remote system.”  Technique  T1021/002 - Remote Services:  SMB/Windows Admin Shares39  \"Adversaries may use Valid Accounts to interact with a remote network share  using Server Message Block (SMB). The adversary may then perform actions as  the logged-on user.  SMB is a file, printer, and serial port sharing protocol for Windows machines on  the same network or domain. Adversaries may use SMB to interact with file  shares, allowing them to move laterally throughout a network. Linux and macOS  implementations of SMB typically use Samba.  Windows systems have hidden network shares that are accessible only to  administrators and provide the ability for remote file copy and other administrative  functions. Example network shares include C$, ADMIN$, and IPC$. Adversaries  may use this technique in conjunction with administrator-level Valid Accounts to  remotely access a networked system over SMB, to interact with systems using  remote procedure calls (RPCs), transfer files, and run transferred binaries  through remote Execution. Example execution techniques that rely on  authenticated sessions over SMB/RPC are Scheduled Task/Job, Service  Execution, and Windows Management Instrumentation. Adversaries can also use  NTLM hashes to access administrator shares on systems with Pass the Hash and  certain configuration and patch levels.\"  The handler proceeded to analyse the extent of the issue by randomly checking workstations  within the hospital for signs of the malware. He found out that the malware managed to spread  across the whole hospital, rendering some of the critical data and equipment unavailable.  The hospital’s network and information security team was overwhelmed by the attack, so they  reached out to the national CSIRT, part of the national cybersecurity authority.  37 MITRE Corporation, Data Encrypted for Impact, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1486/ (retrieved on 13 October 2020).  38 MITRE Corporation, Scheduled Task/Job, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1053/ (retrieved on 13 October 2020).  39 MITRE Corporation, Remote Services, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1021/002/ (retrieved on 13 October 2020).  https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1486/ https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1053/ https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1021/002/  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  23  Note: In this scenario, you are a member of the national CSIRT that is helping the hospital with  this security breach.  Criminal investigation  The hospital notified40 this attack to the national CSIRT, which contacted the national  cybersecurity authority who then reported this incident to Law Enforcement. The Police cyber  unit started the investigation. They immediately contacted the national CSIRT, which provided  general information, a sample of the ransomware and a link to the source website. A sample  was sent to Europol through the Europol Malware Analysis Solution (EMAS) sandbox for  crossmatching.  The Police found out that the website was hosted by a web hosting provider based in one of the  EU MSs. The Police ordered the provider, via European investigation order, to provide stored  subscriber and traffic data related to the relevant account.  Provided data revealed that the malicious content was uploaded from a country outside the EU.  Even though the Police immediately requested legal assistance (including Europol), based on  past experiences with this particular country, it was virtually impossible to get any cooperation in  such cases from the official authorities.  Note that in this use case we do not focus on investigations on the C&C (command and control)  servers that are typically used by ransomware. Information found on these servers can be used  during incident response, for example to decrypt the data, as well as to identify the other  potential victims and the criminals behind the attack.  Information sharing  Even though it was unlikely that LE would get assistance through official channels, in the third  country there is a well-functioning CSIRT community which is regularly and openly sharing  information. The national CSIRT involved in dealing with the incident offered to help the LE by  requesting traffic data.  2.2.3 Tasks  2.2.3.1 Task 1: Notification of the incident  As stated above, the hospital’s network and information security team notified the national  CSIRT, part of the cybersecurity authority of the incident. Who else should be notified within and  outside of the hospital? Are there any legal obligations for the hospital to report such incidents  to public institutions? Use the template below to list individuals, authorities and other parties that  should be informed about the incident. Column 1 should be used to list the parties to be notified  and column 2 to identify whether the notification is required or recommended. Column 3 can be  used for comments.  Figure 11: Notification list – Template  Who to notify Required / recommended Comments  Within the organisation  40 The exact flow of notification varies depending on the Member State legislation.  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  24  Outside the organisation  2.2.3.2 Task 2: Setting up the task force, division of duties  The national cybersecurity authority decided that a task force should be established to  deal with the crisis. Who should be involved in this task force (e.g. which organisations or  [inter]national authorities, the expertise level of members of the task force)? Are there any  rules on this in your country?  Use the template below to list individuals/organisations that should be involved in the task  force. Column 1 should be used to list the parties to be involved, column 2 to identify what  kind of expertise can they contribute and column 3 to identify which tasks they can be  involved in and what role should they play. Column 4 can be used for comments.  Afterwards, discuss whether there are any relevant rules or best practices on this in your  country.  Figure 12: Task force members list - template  Organisation Expertise Tasks/role Comments  While in some Members States the victim is part of the task force, in some other Member  States not. Discuss this point and how it works in your country.  The university that cooperates with the hospital offered their volunteer ICT experts  (students and employees) who can help to deal with the crisis. Can they be involved? In  which activities (e.g. reinstallation of hospitals computers, incident handling, attempting to  break the encryption, track the source of the attack, etc.)?  Explain which activities related to the incident handling can volunteers be involved and  how. Column 1 should be used to name the activity and column 2 to describe the  involvement.

Figure 15: Duties, synergies and potential interferences – Template  Duty (task) Synergies and potential interferences  Comments  2.2.3.4 Task 4: Incident handling, evidence collection, coordination  Experts in the task force found out by using sandbox analysis that the ransomware is not only  encrypting data from the information systems but is also exfiltrating patient data outside the  organisation. CSIRT members immediately proposed to block communication to the C&C server  to prevent further disclosure of sensitive information. LE, however, suggested to wait with this  measure and try to track the data in an attempt to locate the attacker, since they’re suspecting  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  26  that the attacker is based in the EU even though s/he used servers located in third countries to  disseminate the malware.  Explain, how you would deal with this issue, what should have priority – protection of sensitive  data or locating the attacker, and whether there are any official rules on this in your country?  The template below can be used by listing the duties (tasks) in column 1 (to be taken from  column 1 of the SoD matrix in Annex B) and the measures to be taken to deal with the issue in  column 2. The last column of the template below, column 3, can be used to add comments.  Figure 16: List of suggested measures to deal with mutual interferences – Template  Duty  (task)  Suggested  measure Comments  2.2.3.5 Task 5: International cooperation and information sharing  As stated above, the CSIRT can provide support to the LE, they can for instance ask the third  country network operators to unofficially provide traffic data that could help to identify the  attacker.  Explain whether LE would be able to provide the CSIRT with necessary identifiers and traffic  data acquired from the web hosting provider for this purpose. Also, whether the unofficial data  collected by the third country network operator that leads to identifying the attacker would be  usable as evidence in court by LE.  Figure 17: Information sharing and use – Template  Information sharing and use  Sharing information with the CSIRT  Use of the data unofficially obtained by the CSIRT  2.2.3.6 Task 6: Post incident preventive measures  Explain based on information you have about the incident and hospitals systems, what kinds of  post incident preventive measures would you recommend to the Network and Information  Security Team to implement.  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  27  The template below can be used to categorise proposed measures in column 1 (whether these  measures are organisational, technical or legal by nature), and list and describe the proposed  measures in column 2 and 3. The last column of the template below, column 4, can be used to  identify who should implement these suggested measures.  Figure 18: List of preventive post-incident security measures – Template  Category (e.g.  organisational,  technical, legal)  Measure Description To be implemented by  2.2.4 Lessons Learned  Ransomware cases are rather complex and demand many different skills, including technical  and legal, as well as the ability for other communities to share information and cooperate.  Although for training purposes the scenario is presented as less complicated than real cases  might be, it still allows each party to understand the complexities in terms of actors involved,  roles played, duties (tasks) performed, synergies to exploit, and risks of interference.

v2.0, March 2022  30  A ANNEX:  SUPPLEMENTAL USE CASE  USE CASE 3: DDOS AND MALWARE BLENDED ATTACK  Figure 19: Overview of use case 3  This use case should be conducted in groups so that different results and approaches of each  group can be compared. Then, the advantages and disadvantages of individual solutions should  be discussed.  Objectives  The current exercise scenario aims to familiarize the trainees with technical, procedural and  legal aspects of incident management. In particular, the objectives are to:  • Raise awareness about what types of cyber incidents might affect an airport and what  can be the impact of such incidents  • Learn about the role of the CSIRT, Law Enforcement, and National Cybersecurity  Authority  • Understand the importance of efficient coordination between main stakeholders during  a large scale/high impact incident  Overview of use case 3  Targeted Audience  This exercise is useful for incident responders and members of the Law  Enforcement of all experience levels. It is particularly helpful for national  CSIRT members and Law Enforcement officers involved in cybercrime  investigations  Total Duration  30 minutes  Note that this use case is a supplemental use case and not directly covered in  a training session.  Scenario  This is a group exercise. Each trainee is a member of either the CSIRT team  and/or Law Enforcement who is involved in the prevention, mitigation and  investigation of cybersecurity incidents. Their goal is to address the key  ramification of a DDoS and malware blended attack against a large size airport  in a European capital city  Task 1 Notification of the incident  Task 2  Setting up task force, division of duties  Task 3  Possible duties (tasks), synergies and potential interferences between CSIRT,  LE and the Judiciary  Task 4 International cooperation and information sharing  Task 5 Post incident preventive measures  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  31  • Practice setting up and coordinating task force for dealing with large scale attack  • Understand the importance of information sharing during cybersecurity attacks  • Practice how to identify and propose post-incident reactive and preventive measures  • Learn about preventive measures against such type of incidents  Scenario  Setting the stage  A large size airport in a European capital city is under massive DDoS attack, combined with a  malware attack, causing key systems outages and malfunctioning (i.e. systems assuring  functions like flight scheduling, passengers’ check-in, baggage routing, etc.).  Already the situation has had significant adverse effects on the airport’s operations and safety.  Undetected attacks resulted in the change of the flight plans provoking delays and influencing  the aircrafts cleaning and fuelling process, as well as the time required to load the luggage,  affecting the world-wide traffic.  You are a member of a task force established to help the airport company to deal with the  incident. An initial assessment shows that the IT team has yet to come up with a course of  action for stopping the attack and restoring the services. The pressure from the media,  authorities, and passengers is rapidly growing.  Figure 20: Graphical representation of scenario 3 – Attack  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  32  Organisational profile  The affected airport is one of the biggest air traffic hubs in Europe, with an average of more than  100,000 passengers passing through per day.  The management of the airport invested only in perimetral security in recent years (firewalls,  gateways, etc.). At the same time, internal network suffers from lack of proper segmentation,  and some of the critical systems are running old operating systems due to legacy and  compatibility constraints.  The airport is running its own on-prem data centre doubled by a disaster recovery site, but the  Business Continuity Plan (BCP) plan wasn’t tested in the last two years.  Before the breach  The attackers gathered information online about the airport company and identified useful data:  the IP addresses space, systems and applications, management and key personnel names and  contact details, etc.  Reconnaissance was also done at the physical perimeter of the airport by attackers disguised  as passengers.  Attackers managed to plant a rogue 3G Raspberry Pi device in the airport network. The device  is used to sniff the network traffic for systems discovery and credentials extraction (plain-text  credentials sent over the network or easy-to-crack hashes).  Figure 21: Graphical representation of scenario 3 – Overview of interactions  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  33  While the attacker created a diversion with the DDoS attack, some of the internal systems of the  airport were infected with a customized malware delivered using two different infection vectors:  spear-phishing emails sent from the rogue device to avoid email gateway filtering, and Windows  SMB exploits launched from the same device.  Technique  TA0015 – Technical information  gathering41  “Technical information gathering consists of the process of identifying critical  technical elements of intelligence an adversary will need about a target in order  to best attack.  Technical intelligence gathering includes, but is not limited to,  understanding the target's network architecture, IP space, network services,  email format, and security procedures”.  Technique  T1566.001 – Spearphishing  attachment42  “Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious attachment in an  attempt to elicit sensitive information and/or gain access to victim systems.  Spearphishing attachment is a specific variant of spearphishing. Spearphishing  attachment is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the  use of malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically  delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or  industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and  usually rely upon User Execution to gain execution”.  Technique  T1210 - Exploitation of Remote  Services43  “Adversaries may exploit remote services to gain unauthorized access to internal  systems once inside of a network. Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs  when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program,  service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute  adversary-controlled code. A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of  remote services is for lateral movement to enable access to a remote system.”  Initial response  Breach notification  A lot of people are reporting at the check-in desks that their flights seem to have disappeared  from the schedule display systems or they have long delays. At the same time, people can’t  obtain information from other online sources because the internet is inaccessible from the  airport Wi-Fi network and even if they use their 3G/4G/5G connection the airport website and  other related platforms are unavailable.  It becomes clear that the IT infrastructure and applications are affected by an incident, and a  cyber-attack is suspected. The network team starts to investigate, and they report that a huge  DDoS attack is conducted against the airport’s internet-facing systems.  The security team is also reporting that a high number of database operations were executed in  a short interval of time using credentials of a user that is claiming to know nothing about the  situation.  The airport management board decides to notify the aviation sectorial CSIRT and to file a  complaint to the Police. The sectoral CSIRT share the information with the other relevant  CSIRTs, in particular the national CSIRT, which is part of the national cybersecurity authority.  Technique  T1498 – Network Denial of Service44  “Adversaries may perform Network Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to degrade or  block the availability of targeted resources to users.

Adversaries have been observed conducting network DoS attacks  for political purposes[1] and to support other malicious activities, including  distraction[2], hacktivism, and extortion”.  Technique  TA0006 – Credential Access45  “Credential Access consists of techniques for stealing credentials like account  names and passwords. Techniques used to get credentials include keylogging or  credential dumping. Using legitimate credentials can give adversaries access to  systems, make them harder to detect, and provide the opportunity to create more  accounts to help achieve their goals”  Response of the CSIRT team  The CSIRT Team uses lessons learned from recent similar attacks against airports and starts  the Incident Response process with actions meant to contain the incident as much as possible.  The user account responsible for altering the airport databases is disabled, and the user  workstation is isolated from the network and sent to the digital forensics laboratory. All recent  activity of the user is tracked because there’s plausible suspicion that the user was the victim of  a spear-phishing attack which resulted in his workstation being infected with malware.  Additionally, the CSIRT team is working with the airport IT personnel, the ISP, airport IT  vendors, and international partners to try to come up with a mitigation plan for the DDoS attack.  Multiple scenarios are studied, but for the moment it is decided to ask the ISP to filter the traffic  coming from outside of the country the airport is located in.  Next, the technical investigation of the incident is started:  • Analysis of logs from perimeter security solutions (firewall, web and email gateway,  proxy, etc.)  • Analysis of the recent activity of the user causing the malicious actions of the database  and conduction of a forensically-sound investigation of his/her workstation  • Try to identify rogue devices in the network  Criminal investigation  The national cybersecurity authority informed the LE of this incident. The local Police cyber unit  started the investigation by:  • Analysing security video cameras from the airport in the last month to try to identify  attackers planting rogue devices  • LE/Prosecutor requesting a warrant and seizure of the electronic devices of the  possible suspects  To be complete, in real cases such visual identification might take some time and is not always  that straightforward, but we now just assume this happened for the good flow of the use case.  Information sharing  The CSIRT is conducting an information exchange about the incident with other CSIRTs  (especially the ones in the aviation sector/sectorial CSIRTs), trying to find out if similar attacks  were conducted recently and gather information about investigation results and mitigation  measures.  In cooperation with the airport management, the CSIRT will share the gathered information with  the national LE and will offer their further support to continue the investigations and facilitate  information exchange nationally and internationally.  45 MITRE Corporation, Credential Access, https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0006/ (retrieved on 2 December 2021).  https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/11/operation-poisoned-handover-unveiling-ties-between-apt-activity-in-hong-kongs-pro-democracy-movement.html https://www.ic3.gov/media/2012/FraudAlertFinancialInstitutionEmployeeCredentialsTargeted.pdf https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0006/  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  35  Tasks  Task 1: Notification of the incident  The airport security team needs to quickly do an initial assessment of the situation and notify the  incident according to existing procedures and legal framework.  As previously mentioned, the National Competent Cybersecurity Authority or the National  CSIRT is notified.  To whom else and when should the incident be reported?  Figure 22: Notification list – Template  Who to notify Required /  recommended Comments  Within the organisation  Outside the organisation  Task 2: Setting up the task force, division of duties  While in the context of a criminal investigation the prosecutor/judge is in charge of assigning the  roles for dealing with the investigation of the cybercrime, the national CSIRT may establish a  task force to respond to the incident and deal with the crisis generated by the incident.  Analyse the legal and organisational framework by defining the competences of CSIRTs, LE,  and the Judiciary in their activities related to fighting cybercrime, and capture potential synergies  and possible overlaps. Analyse the possible interferences in the cooperation between CSIRTs  and LE and their interaction with the Judiciary. To collect data and roles and duties, use the  SoD matrix in ANNEX B.  The role of the IT contractors of the airport should be decided: will they be part of the task  force?  Figure 23: Task force template  Organisation Expertise Tasks/role Comments  Task 3: Possible duties (tasks), synergies and potential interferences between  CSIRT, LE and Judiciary  Select some of the duties from column 1 of the SoD in Annex B and with some of these duties,  briefly describe the measures to that could be taken by each community in the scenario.  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  36  The template below can be used by listing the phase (e.g. during the incident/crime) in column  1, the duties (tasks) in column 2 (to be taken from column 1 of the SoD matrix in Annex B), and  the synergies and potential interferences in column 3. The last column of the template below,  column 4, can be used to add comments.  Figure 24: Duties, synergies and potential interferences – Template  Phase Duty (task) Synergies and potential  interferences Comments  Task 4: International cooperation and information sharing  Briefly explain how Interpol, Europol and Eurocontrol can collaborate with CSIRTs/LE/Judiciary  during the international criminal investigation.  The template below can be used to list the name of the organisation in column 1, the name of  the organisation it collaborates with in column 2 and the kind of collaboration they have in  column 3.  Figure 25: Information sharing and use – Template  Name of the organisation Names of the organisation it  collaborates with Kind of collaboration  Task 5: Post-incident preventive measures  Explain based on information you have about the incident, what kinds of post-incident  preventive measures you would recommend to the airport information security team to  implement and how you would formulate the outcome as a gap analysis and a remediation  roadmap.  The template below can be used by listing the duties (tasks) in column 1 (to be taken from  column 1 of the SoD matrix in Annex B), and the proposed preventive security measures in  column 2.  ASPECTS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  Toolset - v2.0, March 2022  37  Figure 26: Suggestion on preventive security measures – Template  Duty (Task) Proposed preventive security measures  Lessons Learned  DDoS and malware blended attack cases are rather complex and sophisticated. They demand  many skills as it’s not easy to identify what is the primary attack vector or what is the ultimate  target of the attacker. The scenario allows each party to understand its role under the legal  framework of each member state.  Although for training purposes the scenario is presented as less complicated than real cases  might be, it still allows each party to understand the complexities in terms of actors involved,  roles played, duties (tasks) performed, synergies to exploit, and risks of interference.

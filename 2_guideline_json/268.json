Almost everybody has heard of cybersecurity and its  importance; however, the behaviour of citizens does not always reflect a high level of  awareness. Cybersecurity is essential for individuals and for public and non-public  organisations, yet observing security practices often proves to be difficult.  This report seeks to assist EU Member States in further building their cybersecurity  capacities by analysing best practices on raising citizens’ awareness of cybersecurity. It  offers recommendations about ways for better communicating cybersecurity.  The need for cybersecurity awareness and skills is becoming increasingly urgent due to our  dependence on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) across all aspects of our  society. Recent technological advances and the introduction of smart devices have forced both  government and private organisations to create awareness of cyber threats and cybersecurity.  The coronavirus pandemic has further complicated the cyber threat landscape. In March 2020,  the COVID-19 pandemic led to social distancing measures and travel restrictions. The global  effort to slow down infection rates caused a rapid shift to remote working. In a short amount of  time, IT security professionals had to respond to the challenges introduced by working from  home arrangements, such as enterprise data movements whenever employees use their home  Internet to access cloud-based apps, corporate software, videoconferencing, and file sharing.1  Even though the hardware and software solutions may have been in place to secure the  organisation’s data, there were often no established policies to help employees through the  jungle of threats and vulnerabilities they were to face when moving their workplace out of the  traditional office environment.2  With a lack of appropriate guidelines, training and cybersecurity awareness, adapting to such a  ‘digital by default’ normal is difficult, and remote workers may inadvertently act in ways that  expose the business to cyber threats. Frequently reported examples of these kinds of mistakes  are connecting work devices to public Wi-Fi networks, sharing corporate devices with family  members without authorisation, connecting work devices to personal equipment without  permission and using personal devices to access work applications and downloading  unauthorised applications contrary to organisational policies. All such frequent habits increase  the risk of data exposure.  In short, communication about cybersecurity issues is a complicated endeavour. In this report,  we have collected information and evaluated the intensity, regularity and diversity of different  cybersecurity awareness practices and processes in EU Member States. We present ways in  which Member States have achieved better cybersecurity awareness in society and have  incorporated cybersecurity awareness into their national cybersecurity strategies (NCSS). In  addition, we provide recommendations in the following four areas: building capacities for  cybersecurity awareness, regular assessments of trends and challenges, measuring  cybersecurity behaviour and planning cybersecurity awareness campaigns.  1 ENISA Threat Landscape “The Year in Review.

INTRODUCTION  1.1 AIM, SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES  The aim of this work on cybersecurity awareness raising was first to analyse the ability of EU  Member States to build their national capacities to raise citizens’ awareness regarding  cybersecurity issues. Then, based on the results of an analysis of best practices on raising  citizens’ awareness of cybersecurity, this work aims to assist EU Member States in further  building their cybersecurity capacities. This report offers recommendations about ways to better  communicate cybersecurity. The study covers the practices of EU Member States from 2018  until 2021.  The specific objectives of this study were to:  • Analyse existing methods for raising cybersecurity awareness at a national level.  • Identify stakeholders and their roles in the organisation associated with implementing  and monitoring awareness raising activities.  • Identify EU Member States’ good practices on how to organise, measure effectiveness  and ensure appropriate outreach of the awareness raising activities.  • Identify a set of metrics before designing awareness raising activities in order to follow  up on effectiveness and reach out both in the short- and long-term perspective.  • Identify the behavioural aspects that may influence awareness campaigns.  • Highlight challenges and lessons learnt from the design of such activities.  • Propose recommendations for improving awareness in society, considering all the  above elements.  1.2 APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY  This report proposes recommendations to increase the effectiveness of national awareness  raising activities, based on the research into existing NCSS, interviewing stakeholders involved  in cybersecurity awareness raising in Member States, and identifying good practices, challenges  and lessons learnt.  The intensity, regularity and diversity of different cybersecurity awareness practices and  processes in EU Member States has been evaluated based on collected information.  Throughout the study, we have examined the following indicators:  • The amount and sequence of information provided to citizens on cyber threats and on  cybersecurity by national authorities.  • The level of accessibility of threat-related information provided by national authorities to the  society.  • Quantitative data and metrics for monitoring public cybersecurity behaviour.  Additionally, the connection between quantitative metrics and operational perspectives in  carrying out possible awareness campaigns is analysed. The work is based on a substantial  analysis of Member States’ awareness campaign methodologies, including carrying out their  planning processes, the way they meet challenges and how they measure success and impact.  Based on a pre-defined questionnaire, 20 structured interviews were conducted with the  relevant national authorities during May–July 2021. The collected evidence was synthesised to  identify overarching patterns, the perceived quality of awareness raising activities and the  campaign’s success in achieving the specified goals and objectives. The evaluation of the  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  7  awareness raising activities was based on the analytical data gathered from desktop research,  interviews with subject matter Member State authorities and questionnaire results.

Furthermore, the report targets policymakers who are aiming to improve the security awareness  of society, professionals and, more generally, IT end-users. The report could also prove useful  3 In August 2021, the National Cybersecurity Agency (NCA) was established, responsible for the development of a national  cybersecurity culture in Italy.  4 The name was changed from National Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) in September 2021.  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  8  to the different stakeholders in the international development community, who provide  assistance in cybersecurity.  1.4 DEFINITIONS  Cybersecurity Preservation of confidentiality, integrity and availability of information  in the cyberspace.5  Cybersecurity awareness Level of appreciation, understanding or knowledge of cybersecurity  aspects. Such aspects include cognizance of cyber risks and threats,  but also appropriate protection measures.6 We maintain that  awareness is not training; the purpose of awareness presentations is  simply to focus attention on security. Awareness presentations are  intended to allow individuals to recognise IT security concerns and  respond accordingly.7 Through awareness raising, individual and  corporate users can learn how to behave in the online world and  protect themselves from potential risks and threats.8  Good practices Activities that have been shown to work well and proven to succeed  in achieving objectives and could be recommended as a model.  They are activities oriented towards providing guidance to the  different stakeholders.  1.5 STRUCTURE  The report is divided into five parts. Firstly, it provides definitions and describes the  methodologies followed in the development of this report. Secondly, an overview of building  national capacities towards national cybersecurity awareness is provided, showcasing best  practices from a number of EU Member States. Then, the importance of periodic assessments  of cybersecurity trends and challenges is presented, followed by an analysis of the collection  metrics used to measure the behavioural aspects of cybersecurity. In the fifth chapter, an  examination of the actual cybersecurity awareness campaigns conducted in practice is  provided. Each chapter has an outline of overarching patterns, followed by good practices from  selected Member States and a conclusion. The last chapter provides a number of  recommendations to increase the effectiveness of national awareness raising activities.  5 ISO/IEC 27032:2012  6 Nurse J.R.C. (2021) Cybersecurity Awareness.

BUILDING CAPACITIES TO  RAISE CYBERSECURITY  AWARENESS  In 2020, ENISA published a national capabilities assessment framework9 that aims to provide  Member States with a self-assessment of their level of maturity. To achieve this goal, it enables  the assessment of NCSS objectives, such as raising user awareness by providing KPIs on five  maturity levels. The aim of the framework is to help EU Member States enhance and build  cybersecurity capabilities both at strategic and operational levels.  The purpose of the study was to provide an overview and analysis of EU Member States’  capacities to raise cybersecurity awareness among their general population through the  organisation of national activities and plans. The results of interviews with and surveys  completed by experts who conduct awareness building in Member States highlight the different  approaches that countries follow to support cybersecurity awareness in the context of their  NCSS.  Desk research and interviews revealed that Member States with a cybersecurity strategy which  includes a clear vision about national cybersecurity awareness raising are in a stronger starting  position when building their cybersecurity capacities. Member States are on even firmer ground  if the objective of society-level cybersecurity awareness in their national cybersecurity strategies  is supported by concrete measures, tasks, and deliverables specified in the strategy  implementation plan.  Throughout the years, the importance of cybersecurity awareness raising has been recognised  in the NCSS of Member States. While earlier strategies sometimes addressed the issue  superficially or declaratively, there is now an evident trend to describe the aims of awareness  raising as well as relevant activities in more detail.  A number of Member States claim that more efficient awareness raising is conducted when  there exists a clearly defined national agency coordinating or overseeing cybersecurity  awareness efforts. However, there were some successful cases of horizontally spread tasks,  such as in Finland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, where the activities are carried out by a  number of different ministries and agencies. The underlying factor to ensure accountability and  progress was identified as all parties involved having a clear understanding of their respective  roles and responsibilities.  The majority of countries studied recognise the importance of close interagency cooperation in  conducting awareness raising activities. The interviews with EU Member States also verified a  need for public and private actors to engage together at national and regional levels for  efficiency in raising awareness. Ensuring cybersecurity requires synergistic actions in the legal,  organisational, technical and educational areas.  Despite acknowledging the need for joint engagement, guaranteeing the ongoing budget  required remains challenging. This stems from the fact that resources are allocated by  government entity, rather than by task or objective. Only three Member States out of twenty  9 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/national-capabilities-assessment-framework  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  10  could confirm that established and regular national funding for cybersecurity awareness  activities is guaranteed. For some Member States, European Union funds are used for such  activities.  Regarding cooperation between the relevant cybersecurity agencies and the media, Belgium,  Czech Republic, Finland, Luxembourg and Slovakia demonstrate good practice on how to  maintain constructive connections with the media and create an open atmosphere that enables  the provision of more information to journalists.  2.1 NCSS WITH A CLEAR VISION ABOUT AWARENESS  Cybersecurity awareness raising is more likely to be successful when the corresponding vision  is spelled out in the NCSS to help all stakeholders understand what is at stake and why  cybersecurity awareness raising is needed (context), what is to be accomplished (objectives),  as well as what is it about and to whom it applies (scope). The clearer the vision, the easier it is  for key stakeholders to ensure a comprehensive, consistent and coherent approach. A clear  vision also facilitates coordination, cooperation and implementation.10  Desk research and an analysis of surveys and interviews revealed the following good practices  of selected EU Member States:  Croatia is currently updating its NCSS. Awareness raising is embedded in three areas:  electronic communication, critical information infrastructure and cybercrime. The Croatian  national Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-HR) which implements cybersecurity  awareness raising activities, is a department within the Croatian Academic and Research  Network with a separate strategy (2019–2022)11 that prioritises digital transformation of the  educational system and cybersecurity awareness raising as part of that.  The NCSS of the Czech Republic 2021–202512 was published in December 2020, with a  separate chapter titled “Resilient Society 4.0” addressing education and awareness raising of  the overall population.  The Estonian NCSS 2019–202213 along with the Estonian Cybersecurity Act (2018) task the  Estonian Information System Authority to raise awareness among citizens, to prevent  cybersecurity incidents and to notify citizens about possible threats.  The Finnish Cybersecurity Strategy from 201914 focuses, inter alia, on the need to increase  public cybersecurity competence: “Finnish society needs cybersecurity competence both in  public administration and in the business community. … At the national level, it must be ensured  that everyone has sufficient capacity to operate safely in a digital environment.”15 In addition,  the Government Resolution on digital security in the public sector aims to improve the digital  security skills and awareness of public sector staff as well as the personnel of business and  non-governmental organisations.  The awareness raising objectives of the Latvian Cybersecurity Strategy 2019–202216 focus on  building an information society that include raising cybersecurity awareness amongst teachers,  students, governmental employees, and society in general by promoting safe use of hardware,  10 https://www.itu.int/pub/D-STR-CYB_GUIDE.01-2018  11 https://www.carnet.hr/en/  12 https://www.nukib.cz/en/cyber-security/strategy-action-plan/  13 https://www.mkm.ee/sites/default/files/kyberturvalisuse_strateegia_2022_eng.pdf  14 https://julkaisut.valtioneuvosto.fi/handle/10024/162265  15 https://turvallisuuskomitea.fi/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kyberturvallisuusstrategia_A4_ENG_WEB_031019.pdf  16 https://www.mod.gov.lv/en/nozares-politika/cybersecurity  https://julkaisut.valtioneuvosto.fi/handle/10024/162265 https://turvallisuuskomitea.fi/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kyberturvallisuusstrategia_A4_ENG_WEB_031019.pdf https://www.mod.gov.lv/en/nozares-politika/cybersecurity  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  11  software and the Internet. These objectives are divided into specific tasks that are assigned to  various institutions.  Luxembourg’s upcoming NCSS IV (2021–2025) approaches the issue of awareness raising  from the perspective of “Building trust in the digital world and protection of human rights online”.  Amongst various strategy objectives, cybersecurity education and vocational training focuses on  awareness raising. An action plan of the strategy defines concrete tasks and deliverables.  Malta’s 2016 NCSS17 has six goals, one of which is “cybersecurity awareness and education”.  With this goal, Malta aims to target academia, the public and private sector and citizens to  “sensitize” awareness, knowledge as well as capabilities and expertise in cybersecurity. Specific  measures under this goal include a “Strategic, target-oriented national awareness and advice  campaign” and “Encouragement of ‘cyber hygiene’ and personal responsibility”.  For the first time, Norway in 2019 launched a separate National Strategy for Cybersecurity  Competence,18 because competence and knowledge about cyber threats, vulnerable areas, and  effective measures are a precondition for the ability to protect digital systems against cyber  incidents. Developed by the Norwegian Ministry of Justice and Public Security and the Ministry  of Education and Research, the Competence Strategy addresses cybersecurity from the  perspective of a general challenge to society. While drafting the strategy, the ministries were in  close dialogue with both universities and research funding agencies to guarantee an open and  inclusive process. They also involved stakeholders from the public and private sector. The goal  of the strategy is to improve cybersecurity competence in accord with the needs of society. The  strategy sets out conditions for long-term competence building, encompassing national capacity  building in the fields of research, development and education, and measures designed to raise  awareness in the business community and among the general public.  Poland’s Cybersecurity Strategy for 2019–2024 has as its main objective to increase the level  of resilience to cyber threats and to strengthen data protection. It includes the issues of raising  awareness in cybersecurity.  Portugal’s latest Cybersecurity Strategy 2019–202319 expands on cybersecurity awareness  under a special axis called “prevention, education and awareness” which foresees a number of  specific action points such as, for example, to promote robust and cross-cutting cybersecurity  training programs for all organisations and the average citizen, to strengthen cyberspace  security skills and knowledge in education and to promote digital education and literacy.  Slovakia’s Cybersecurity Strategy 2021–202520 prioritises a well-educated public and well-  educated professionals. It includes not only reference to regulations but also practical activities,  such as risk management, detection and cybersecurity incident handling, system recovery,  education, dissemination of security awareness and, last but not least, research and  development of cybersecurity tools and processes.  For the National Strategy and its objectives to be feasible, specific tasks and activities must be  identified, together with clear responsibilities. To this end, the Government of Slovakia adopted  in July 2021 an Action Plan for the implementation of the National Cyber Security Strategy for  2021 to 2025, which defines specific tasks and activities, identifies responsible entities and also  time horizons for fulfilling individual tasks and activities. The aim of the Action Plan is to create a  17 https://cybersecurity.gov.mt/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Mita-_Malta-Cyber-Security-Strategy-Book.pdf  18 https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/nasjonal-strategi-for-digital-sikkerhetskompetanse/id2627189/  19 https://www.cncs.gov.pt/docs/cncs-ensc-2019-2023.pdf  20 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/national-cyber-security-strategies-  interactive-map?selected=Slovakia  1 Please use footnotes for providing additional or explanatory information and/or relevant links.

Slovenia is working on a new version of its NCSS that is expected to be ready by June 2022.  The current version, the 2016 NCSS21 does address cybersecurity awareness raising.  Furthermore, the 2018 Information Security Act22 provides a legal basis for awareness-raising  activities. It gives the mandates for the awareness-raising tasks to the Government Information  Security Office.  In conclusion, Member States with a NCSS that includes a clear vision about national  cybersecurity awareness raising are in a stronger starting position when building their  cybersecurity capacities. They are on even firmer ground if the objective of the society-level  cybersecurity awareness in their NCSS is further supported with concrete measures, tasks and  deliverables specified in the strategy implementation plan. Throughout years, the importance of  cybersecurity awareness raising has been recognised in cybersecurity strategies. While earlier  strategies sometimes addressed the issue superficially or declaratively, there is now an evident  trend to describe the aims of the awareness raising as well as relevant activities in more detail.  2.2 COORDINATION OF AWARENESS ACTIVITIES AND INTERAGENCY  COOPERATION  In a number of Member States –11 Member States out of the 20 observed – cybersecurity  awareness raising activities are coordinated by a single, competent authority. This dedicated  and competent cybersecurity authority is a leading entity that provides direction, coordinates  actions, and monitors the implementation of cybersecurity awareness activities. The lead  agency also identifies an initial set of stakeholders to be involved in the development and  implementation of the awareness activities, clarifies the roles of different stakeholders and  outlines how they should collaborate in order to manage expectations throughout the process.  In turn, these entities are responsible and accountable for the implementation of each specific  initiative assigned to them and are expected to coordinate their efforts with other relevant  stakeholders as part of the implementation process.  An example of a coordination mechanism would be conducting periodic meetings with all  relevant stakeholders for a joint review of action plans. An example of a cooperation mechanism  would be the creation of an intra-sectoral task force to address a particular issue.  Desk research and interviews revealed that coordination models vary country by country.  In Belgium, the central coordinator is the Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium (CCB). The CCB  works with the Cybersecurity Coalition, a national cooperation that brings together  representatives of the private, academic and administration sectors. The Cybersecurity Coalition  has created a task force on awareness raising which collaborates with the CCB. They prepare  materials together and encourage partners to use them all year around.  In Czech Republic, the National Cybersecurity Centre is the executive section of the National  Cyber and Information Security and Agency. Amongst other tasks, the National Cybersecurity  Centre oversees awareness and educational activities concerning cybersecurity. Nevertheless,  it is the responsibility of every organisation’s management to raise the cybersecurity awareness  of their employees.  The Estonian Information System Authority is the coordinator of cybersecurity awareness  raising in Estonia. It gathers data to assess the level of awareness, analyses incident statistics  21 https://www.gov.si/assets/ministrstva/MJU/DID/Cyber_Security_Strategy_Slovenia.pdf  22 http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO7707  https://www.gov.si/assets/ministrstva/MJU/DID/Cyber_Security_Strategy_Slovenia.pdf http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO7707  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  13  and organises activities based on the collected data. Under the coordination of the Information  System Authority, multiple actors are engaged in awareness raising. For example, the police  have online “Web-Constables” – police officers who respond to notifications and letters  submitted by people via the internet and train children as well as adults about issues of internet  security. PhD candidates specialising in cybersecurity at the Tallinn University of Technology  work with children in the schools. The Information System Authority also cooperates with civil  society organisations like the Estonian Union for Child Welfare that targets activities towards  children. Communication companies run their own campaigns, for example, Telia has  conducted a campaign for kids countering cyberbullying.  Finland has a distributed model instead of a centralised agency that is responsible for  everything related to cyberspace. There are a number of different agencies that work in different  areas. The Finnish Cybersecurity Strategy (2019) explains this as follows: “National  cybersecurity will be built in cooperation among the authorities, the business community,  organisations and citizens, when everyone can contribute to our shared cybersecurity. Each  individual is therefore an important cybersecurity actor who can improve cybersecurity through  his or her actions on a daily basis and thus impact his or her own cybersecurity and that of  others.” In the appendix to the publication Digital Security in the Public Sector,23 the  responsibilities of different agencies in relation to cybersecurity are described.  In Germany, the Federal Office for Information Security shapes information security in  digitalisation through prevention, detection and response for government, business, and society.  The document that guides national cybersecurity awareness raising is the “Act on the Federal  Office for Information Security”.24 Since 2018, a separate citizens’ awareness unit team  “Cybersecurity for citizens and society” has existed in the Federal Office for Information  Security.  In Italy, the Law Decree n. 82 of 14 June 2021, converted into Law n. 109 on 4 August 2021,  established the National Cybersecurity Agency (NCA) which also carries out activities related to  the communication and promotion of cybersecurity awareness to contribute to the development  of a national culture. The Agency includes the National Cybersecurity Cell (NCSC) – an inter-  ministerial body meant for coordinating preventive measures and reacting to national  cybersecurity crises – that replaced the one operating within the Security Intelligence  Department (DIS).25  Ireland has established a cybersecurity education working group within the National Council for  the Curriculum and Assessment, Computer and Education Society of Ireland (which is a group  of teachers at elementary, middle, and high-school levels) and Cyber Ireland.  In Latvia, CERT.LV is tasked with informing the society of cyber threats, but they do not play a  single leading role and are not the main coordinator among all the institutions for cybersecurity  awareness campaigns. The Ministry of Environmental Protection and Regional Development,  for example, is responsible for organising events during European Digital Week.  Luxembourg has no single dedicated agency for the coordination of awareness raising. The  inter-ministerial cyber prevention and cybersecurity committee is responsible for ensuring  23 https://julkaisut.valtioneuvosto.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/162265/VM_2020_45.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y  24 https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/BSI/BSI_Act_BSIG.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=1  25 The national cybersecurity ecosystem in Italy was reshaped with the entry into force of the Law Decree n. 82 of 14 June  2021, which created the National Cybersecurity Agency (NCA). To the extent that awareness raising is part of preventive  activities, the National Cybersecurity Cell provides this coordination. The NCSC is chaired by the NCA director general, it  includes the Prime Minister's Military Counsellor, representatives from the Intelligence community (DIS, AISE and AISI), the  Civil Protection Department, as well as from the Ministries represented in the Cybersecurity inter-ministerial Committee  (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Economy and  Finance, Ministry of Economic Development, Ministry of Technological Innovation and Digital Transition, Ministry of  Sustainable Infrastructures and Mobility, Ministry for Ecological Transition and the Ministry of University and Research).  1 Please use footnotes for providing additional or explanatory information and/or relevant links.

The High Commission for National Protection is in charge of  coordinating the drafting and implementation of the NCSS. The “Bee Secure” government  initiative is operated by the National Youth Service and the Kanner-Jugendtelefon, in  partnership with Securitymadein.lu,26 the Grand-Ducal Police and the Public Prosecutor’s  Office. The ministries involved are the Ministry of National Education, Children and Youth, the  Ministry of the Economy and the Ministry of Family and Integration. Other key players include  the National Institute for Public Administration that raises awareness among civil servants.  Thanks to its field experience and its established network of partners, “Bee Secure” is able to  contribute in a concrete way to the empowerment of the user.  In 2016, the Malta Information and Technology Agency (MITA) was assigned the mandate to  coordinate and oversee citizens’ cybersecurity awareness and education, and the Cyber  Security Malta campaign was launched. MITA cooperates with other stakeholders in the  framework of the National Cybersecurity Committee which also includes the Police, the Armed  Forces, the Critical Infrastructure Directorate, the Communications Authority, the Financial  Services Authority, the Gaming Authority and the Digital Innovation Authority.  In the Netherlands, various ministries have their own policy for cybersecurity awareness  raising. Overall, the Ministry of Security and Justice is responsible for cybersecurity measures  concerning civilians, the Ministry of Economics is responsible for cybersecurity awareness  raising among companies and entrepreneurs, and the Office and Ministry of Security and  Justice deal with municipalities and vital infrastructure. The latter engage in awareness raising  activities to prevent citizens and organisations from becoming victims. They cooperate with the  police and several private sector players such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft and  telecommunication companies.  In Norway, NorSIS is a national coordinator for the European Cybersecurity Month. NorSIS is  an independent body that works in collaboration with public sector, institutions, partly financed  by the Ministry of Justice and Public Security. Its main target groups are the general population,  as well as small and medium enterprises. In the future its activities will be targeted mostly at  private citizens. NorSIS partners with traditional media, the Safer Internet Centre and other  partners depending on the scope of activities, e.g. the National Data Protection Agency, the  Norwegian Cyber Security Centre and the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency. The Centre  organises and provides guidance, advice, case handling and other services free of charge to  the population. The Norwegian National Security Authority is a cross-sectoral professional and  supervisory authority within the protective security services in Norway.  In Poland, in 2020, the Ministry of Digital Affairs was reorganised and incorporated into the  chancellery of the Prime Minister. The role of the Minister of Digital Affairs is performed by the  Prime Minister, and the former Minister of Digital Affairs has taken on the role of Secretary of  State. The Department of Cybersecurity in the Chancellery of the Prime Minister focuses on the  development of the content, guidance and recommendations. Overall, awareness raising  activities in Poland are conducted by the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)  of the National Research Institute (NASK) that deals with a wider audience like academia, the  education sector, the transportation sector, and local administration. The National Research  Institute is promoting the safe use of new technologies and the Internet, providing materials and  best practices for educating society on cybersecurity. The Polish Ministry of Defence Computer  Security Incident Response Team is sometimes also engaged in awareness raising by running  phishing awareness campaigns and providing recommendations.  26 Securitymadein.lu is an economic interest group owned by the state of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and local  governments, see https://securitymadein.lu/agency/  1 Please use footnotes for providing additional or explanatory information and/or relevant links.

Use only the function References/Insert Footnote  https://securitymadein.lu/agency/  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  15  An example of public-private cooperation in Poland is the Cybersecurity Cooperation Program,27  a non-commercial public-private partnership for the National Cybersecurity System where  parties exchange experiences in order to, inter alia, increase the security of digital processes,  products and services. The cooperation agreement covers such areas as: information,  education, training and testing as well as certification with particular emphasis on raising  competencies in the field of awareness of threats and attack methods in cyberspace.  In Romania, the National Cyber Security Directorate (DNSC) as the national competent  authority for the cybersecurity of networks and information systems has the responsibility of the  cybersecurity awareness activities. In this role, DNSC frequently delivers awareness materials  for all types of users both on its website and on social media channels. DNSC fulfils the function  of alerting of issues, prevention, awareness and training.  In Slovakia, according to the Cybersecurity Act, the National Security Authority is responsible  for awareness raising and for preparing legislation in the field of cybersecurity. The  Cybersecurity Competence and Certification Centre within SK-CERT determines the education  programs for building security awareness and professional training. The NSA in Slovakia has  good relationships across the cybersecurity community. They cooperate with the police when it  comes to raising awareness about cybercrime, as well as with academia (e.g. Technical  University in Žilina, the Academy of the Police Forces and other universities). Cooperation  discussion also involves the Slovakian Academy of Sciences. In the future, increased  collaboration is also planned with the Slovakian Cybersecurity Association.  In Slovenia, the Government Information Security Office is the national competent authority and  raising public awareness of information security is one of their tasks. The Government  Information Security Office coordinates training, exercises and education in the field of  information security and is responsible for raising public awareness of information security. The  interagency cooperation includes the national CERT, the police, the cybersecurity section of the  Slovenian Chamber of Commerce, Telecommunications companies (TELCOs Telekom  Slovenia and A1) and the Slovenian Bank Association. The national CERT runs an awareness-  raising programme Safe on internet, and a consortium of the Faculty of Social Sciences, some  non-governmental organisations, the Academic and Research Network of Slovenia (ARNES)  and the Police runs an awareness-raising programme Safer Internet. The Slovenian Bank  Association cooperates with the national CERT.  To sum up, several Member States demonstrate that successful awareness raising is conducted  when there is a clear national agency coordinating or overseeing citizens’ cybersecurity  awareness activities. However, there were some successful cases of horizontally spread tasks,  such as Finland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. To ensure accountability and progress, the  parties involved should have a clear understanding of their respective roles and responsibilities.  Furthermore, all Member States recognise the importance of close interagency cooperation for  awareness raising activities. According to the interviews, for successful cybersecurity  awareness raising, there’s a need for public and private actors engaged together in  cybersecurity awareness raising activities at a national and regional level. Ensuring  cybersecurity requires synergistic actions in the legal, organisational, technical and educational  areas as well as cooperation between public administration and the private sector.  27 https://www.gov.pl/web/cyfryzacja/program-wspolpracy-w-cyberbezpieczenstwie-pwcyber--partnerstwo-publiczno- prywatne-na-rzecz-krajowego-systemu-cyberbezpieczenstwa  https://www.gov.pl/web/cyfryzacja/program-wspolpracy-w-cyberbezpieczenstwie-pwcyber--partnerstwo-publiczno-prywatne-na-rzecz-krajowego-systemu-cyberbezpieczenstwa https://www.gov.pl/web/cyfryzacja/program-wspolpracy-w-cyberbezpieczenstwie-pwcyber--partnerstwo-publiczno-prywatne-na-rzecz-krajowego-systemu-cyberbezpieczenstwa  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  16  2.3 RESOURCE ALLOCATION  Sufficient, consistent and continuous funding provides the foundations for an effective national  cybersecurity posture. For an efficient implementation of cybersecurity awareness raising  activities, Member States should allocate necessary human and financial resources.  Desk research, analysis of surveys and interviews revealed the following good practices based  on selected EU Member States:  In Croatia, the national CERT as a part of the Croatian Academic and Research Network uses  European funding for cybersecurity awareness campaigns. The last campaign was co-financed  by the EU programme “Connecting Europe Facility” under the action GrowCERT.  In Czech Republic, cybersecurity awareness raising activities are financed from an annual  budget that is based on strategic documents and priorities.  In Luxembourg, entities engaged in awareness raising manage their regular annual budgets  allocated to cybersecurity awareness raising campaigns and ongoing initiatives. If necessary,  extraordinary annual financing requirements needed for the implementation of awareness  building objectives of the most recent strategy are defined and negotiated.  In Norway, the grants from the Ministry of Justice and Public Security, make up about half of  the annual budget of NorSIS. This allocation is meant to cover cybersecurity awareness raising  activities towards citizens such as the national cybersecurity month, public information  campaigns etc.  Guaranteeing a stable stream of funding continues to be challenging. However, Member States  with an NCSS and implementation plans that make reference to cybersecurity awareness  raising were in a somewhat stronger position to ensure necessary funding.  For a stable stream of funding, the lead coordinating authority works with the owners of the  specific initiatives to understand what resources (human resources, expertise and funding  needs) are required to accomplish the work, and then identifies and secures the required  resources in accordance with administrative financial structures of the country.  More generally, it is relevant to keep in mind that resources are defined beyond the terms of  money (i.e. dedicated budget); they also include people, material, as well as the relationships  and partnerships and continued political commitment and leadership required for successful  execution.  2.4 COOPERATION WITH MEDIA  Developments in ICT have exposed the media to cybersecurity threats and frauds. Content  security is also at stake: misinformation is a growing threat that damages the confidence the  public has in the media. As the audience is now getting information through multiple platforms,  they don't know how to be sure a piece of news comes from a respected media outlet. In  addition, piracy is damaging legitimate service provider revenues and legitimate service  providers won’t be able to afford to provide high quality services if they continue to lose  consumers to piracy.  Media plays a key role in democracies around the world, acting as a watchdog of the state and  informing citizens about the decisions that affect their everyday life. The media also plays an  important role in raising public awareness of cybersecurity as an amplifier of public messages  and a reminder of the importance of good cybersecurity practices. Cooperation with the media  also raises awareness across the society of the increasing cybersecurity risks.  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  17  Desk research, analysis of surveys and interviews revealed the following good practices based  on selected EU Member States:  The Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium (CCB) has compiled a document called “ABC of the  CCB”28 with 42 most asked questions and answers regularly disseminated to journalists writing  about cybersecurity.  The Czech Republic aims to have one person in every bigger newsroom covering  cybersecurity topics. In the case of cyber incidents, these points of contacts will prove useful in  knowing, for example, what phishing is and they can spread this information further.  In Finland, during elections, special media programs are aired where about half a dozen well-  respected journalists dive deep into cybersecurity matters. In 2018, a public-private partnership  initiative in Finland called Mediapooli published a book titled Editor’s Encryption Guide  (Toimittajan Salausopas)29 which is a “cyber textbook for journalists” that includes guidance for  journalists on how to protect their sources from cyberattacks.  In Latvia, before some major events like elections, CERT-LV organises media briefs.  Slovakia, since January 2021, supports a monthly cybersecurity addition in the newspaper  Hospodárske noviny. This is an attachment with articles and interviews with professionals from  the National Cybersecurity Centre and relevant institutions.  To conclude, cooperation between the relevant cybersecurity agencies and the media in  Belgium, Czech Republic, Finland, Luxembourg and Slovakia demonstrates ways in which to  maintain constructive connections with the media and enable regular practices that provide  journalists with more relevant and timely information about cybersecurity threats and risks.  28 https://ccb.belgium.be/sites/default/files/ABC_CCB_A5_NL.pdf  29 https://www.mediapooli.fi/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/toimittajan-salausopas.pdf  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  18  3.  REGULAR ASSESSMENTS  OF CYBERSECURITY TRENDS  AND CHALLENGES  In the interview process of this study, we collected information about whether EU Member  States regularly provide their citizens with cybersecurity situational awareness data and  information such as assessments, analyses and reports of the threat environment, aside from  daily cyber threat overviews. We focused on assessments with the purpose of raising citizens’  awareness through analysis of evolving threats and providing practical advice. These  publications help citizens to realise how the malicious use of “bits and bytes” in cyberattacks  can have spill-over effects on everyday life.  Traditionally, cybersecurity threat information products are technical in nature, for example, the  information about vulnerabilities in certain ICT products is typically published on the information  channels of the CERT/CSIRT teams.30 Such information prepared for expert groups is not  intended for and remains incomprehensible for the wider, non-technical audiences such as the  general public or managers of organisations. Therefore, it is important that the national cyber  authorities seek to address the wider public as their audience as well.  Desk research, analysis of surveys and interviews revealed the following good practices based  on selected EU Member States:  The Czech National Cyber and Information Security Agency publishes annual reports on the  state of cybersecurity and publishes the trends of the previous year, based on the information  provided by around 200 critical infrastructure institutions.31 It also shares cybersecurity warnings  and recommendations for the general public, such as protecting home devices during the  COVID-19 pandemic.  The Estonian Information Systems Authority publishes monthly, quarterly and annual  cybersecurity assessments.32 The publication of the annual report is always a media event and  news is generated in various media channels based on the report. In addition, the Information  Systems Authority publishes threat alerts intended for the general public and security guidelines  and advisories for both experts and end users. The Estonian Internal Security Service and  Foreign Intelligence Service both publish annual assessments that have a separate chapter on  cybersecurity covering the intelligence angle of cyber threats.  The Finnish Transport and Communications Agency National Cybersecurity Centre publishes a  monthly Cyber Weather report33 along with an annual report. The Cyber Weather report  provides an update on the key information security incidents and phenomena of the month. This  is an overview of cybersecurity trends and cyber incidents in the past month. The Cyber  Weather news items are assigned one of three categories: calm, worrying or serious. The report  is divided into sections about data breaches and leaks, scams and phishing, malware and  vulnerabilities, automation, network performance and spying. When relevant, the Transport and  30 For example, see https://www.cert.europa.eu/cert/filteredition/en/CERT-LatestNews.html  31 https://www.nukib.cz/en/infoservis-en/publications-reports/  32 https://www.ria.ee/en/information-system-authority/publications.html  33 https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/ncsc-news/cyber-weather  1 Please use footnotes for providing additional or explanatory information and/or relevant links.

Use only the function References/Insert Footnote  https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/ncsc-news/cyber-weather  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  19  Communications Agency National Cybersecurity Centre also issues urgent security alerts and  vulnerability notifications that draw the attention of citizens.  The Federal Office for Information Security in Germany annually publishes “The state of IT  security in Germany”, usually in autumn.34 It contains information about cyber threats  concerning general users, however, the key focus is on enterprises and the government. The  Citizen Awareness Unit in the Federal Office for Information Security uses this report to extract  information which is of special interest to general users and translates it to a more illustrative  and easy-to-understand communication style. For example, they may use a series of  infographics to summarise the most important cybersecurity threats for general users (like  phishing, ransomware etc.).35 In addition, the Federal Office publishes guidelines and various  technical papers on a variety of cybersecurity topics throughout the year. In 2020, for example,  they issued several guidelines related to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as recommendations  for a secure home office and secure online shopping. Focus topics also included strong  passwords and two-factor authentication to appropriately protect important data stored in online  accounts.  Ireland’s Department of Environment, Climate and Communications in 2020 issued via their  website over 30 advisories about ransomware attacks on the healthcare sector.  Latvia’s CERT.LV provides public reports annually and quarterly, as well as monthly statistics  on their web page. Following the Finnish example, once a month, the Latvian national CERT  publishes a detailed cyber weather report about past cyber incidents in Latvia on social media.  This has been going on for over a year and it has become very popular. Some people comment  that this is the only weather forecast they read. The Cyber Weather report is divided into five  segments: scams and phishing, malware and vulnerabilities, IoT, data breaches and data leaks,  and network performance. If everything is fine, the weather is sunny, if there are a few incidents  – it is raining, and if there are a lot of incidents or big financial losses – it is a thunderstorm.  In the Netherlands, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) actively publishes high quality  regular assessments, such as the Cyber Security Assessment Netherlands compiled in  collaboration with the National Coordinator for Security and Counterterrorism. The Cyber  Security Assessment Netherlands 2021 provides insight into threats, interests and resilience in  relation to cyber security and the effect these factors have on national security.36 To increase  the digital resilience of companies and organisations, the NCSC has also written the Guide to  Cyber Security Measures,37 which lists eight measures every organisation should take to help  counter cyberattacks. Examples of these measures are logging of server data, implementing a  password policy, making backups and encrypting information.  In Norway, NorSIS has a particular emphasis on collecting, organising, and disseminating  knowledge about cybersecurity information that matters to the target audience. They publish a  threat report once a year, targeted at SMBs, at the request of the Ministry of Justice and public  Security. They also conduct an annual survey on the state of cybersecurity culture within the  population. The main target group for NorSIS is private and public sector organisations. Their  activities are targeted at small and medium-sized private enterprises, local government  authorities and the general public. Also, the Military Intelligence Service and the Norwegian  Cyber Security Centre publish annual reports that give overviews of various threat scenarios,  including cyber space.  34 https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Service-Navi/Publications/SecuritySituation/SecuritySituation_node.html  35 https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/Verbraucherinnen-und-Verbraucher/verbraucherinnen-und-verbraucher_node.html  36 https://english.ncsc.nl/; https://english.ncsc.nl/topics/cybersecurity-assessment-netherlands  37 https://english.ncsc.nl/topics/cybersecurity-assessment-netherlands/documents/publications/2021/august/4/guide-to- cyber-security-measures  1 Please use footnotes for providing additional or explanatory information and/or relevant links.

The Dyzurnet.pl team is a point of  contact that has been functioning within the framework of the National Research Institute since  2005. The team responds to anonymous reports received from Internet users about potentially  illegal material, mainly related to sexual abuse of children. Additionally, information about cyber  threats, expert analyses, and recommendations are also published on the governmental web-  portal managed by the Cybersecurity Department of the Chancellery of the Prime Minister.40  In Romania, the National Cyber Security Directorate provides cybersecurity bulletins weekly,  and an annual report about its comprehensive cybersecurity activity.  The Slovakian National Cybersecurity Centre SK-CERT provides cybersecurity bulletins once a  week and security warnings on ad-hoc basis. Once a year they provide an annual cybersecurity  report.  In Slovenia, the Government Information Security Office twice a year prepares reports on cyber  incidents and attacks, and the national SI-CERT prepares annual reports on cybersecurity.  Based on the threat environment, SI-CERT also publishes regular updates on cybersecurity  threats and prepares awareness-raising materials.  Finally, providing regular analysis and reports of the threat environment is an important step  towards higher cybersecurity awareness. Regular publication of cybersecurity trends and  challenges is important because it promotes public discussion about the possible impact  cyberattacks can have not only on the particular information systems targeted, but also on  national security as a whole.  Regular and accessible assessments also help citizens to realise how each person can  contribute to a better protected cyberspace. Effective cybersecurity can only be achieved via a  comprehensive approach – an effort that requires a contribution from everyone.  Rendering information about cybersecurity trends and challenges accessible and  comprehensible to a non-technical audience enables outreach to wider audiences, including the  general public and decision-makers and decision-shapers at political, organisational and  societal levels.  38 https://en.nask.pl/eng/reports/reports/3835,CERT-2019-Report-PL.html  39 https://en.dyzurnet.pl/publications  40 https://www.gov.pl/web/baza-wiedzy/aktualnosci  Regular publication of  cybersecurity trends  and challenges is  important because it  promotes public  discussion about the  possible impact  cyberattacks can  have not only on the  particular information  systems targeted, but  also on national  security as a whole.  https://en.dyzurnet.pl/publications  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  21  4. MEASURING  CYBERSECURITY  BEHAVIOUR  Organisations cannot control their data, but they can control what they care about, meaning  what kind of data they care to measure. Good data scientists know that analysing data is the  easy part. The key is deciding what data matters.  Gathering data and statistics from public surveys and establishing metrics about the  cybersecurity behavioural aspects is a crucial part of successful awareness raising. Quantitative  measurement of cybersecurity provides background on cybersecurity thinking and behavioural  patterns of people, which gives important guidance for awareness raising activities, in particular  during the preparation phase of cybersecurity awareness campaigns.  The lack of common practice for measurement methodology presents us with uncertainties  regarding what the relevant indicators for cybersecurity culture really are. Motivation to establish  metrics for cybersecurity culture includes providing solid comprehension on how the population  relates to the inevitable digitalisation of their society. General information on how citizens  perceive digital risks, their attitudes and knowledge can help to provide better direction for  choosing measures for protecting the digital environment.  The EU regularly measures the attitudes of Europeans regarding cybersecurity, culminating in a  Special Eurobarometer survey conducted to understand the awareness of its citizens, and their  respective experiences and perceptions of cybersecurity. It brings together the results of the  public opinion surveys regarding cybersecurity in the 27 European Union Member States.  National agencies responsible for cybersecurity awareness raising should use public polls and  work in close cooperation with national statistics offices to identify, understand and incorporate  the opinions of the wide target audience. Collecting relevant data provides an opportunity to get  to know the target group and this helps in deciding what kind of information the target audience  needs to improve their skills and knowledge about cybersecurity. It is also useful to analyse  cyber incident data to better understand what societal groups have been hurt the most and  subsequently analyse what are the best risk mitigation measures.  Desk research, analysis of surveys and interviews revealed the following good practices based  on selected EU Member States:  Belgium Safeonweb.be includes a Digital Health Index41 which is a quick test to determine  whether the respondent’s digital health needs a boost. The index consists of 15 questions  concerning software updates, data back-ups, attacks like phishing, the proper of use anti-virus  software and passwords.  CERT-Croatia admits that more time and funding is needed for good quantitative research.  While they do not conduct surveys, they use other available data, such as the EU kids online  41 https://www.safeonweb.be/en/digital-health-index  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  22  survey and data from member institutions of the national research and education network of  Croatia.  The Czech National Cyber and Information Security and Agency realised during the analysis  process that they lacked statistical data for the analytical part of the awareness raising plan and  initiated close cooperation with the Statistics Office in 2021.  The Estonian State Information Authority acknowledges that using polls is challenging but  extremely useful. The authority uses data from Statistics Estonia, as well as from  Eurobarometer. It highly values its cooperation with Statistics Estonia. Following the example of  Eurobarometer, the two authorities cooperate and some cybersecurity-related questions have  been added to the annual questionnaire of Statistics Estonia, such as what people do online to  ensure cybersecurity (using stronger passwords, using different passwords for different  websites, cautiously check emails with attachments etc.) In short, Estonia successfully  optimised their efforts to be relevant to target audiences via identification of the main areas that  need attention through data gathering from Eurobarometer and Statistics Estonia.  Since November 2020, the Finnish Digital Agency has a personnel barometer for digital  security42 that consists of questions related to competence and training of digital services /  devices from a security perspective, as well as inquiries about what people fear online and what  kind of threats people regard as significant. The barometer measures people’s trust in their own  organisation, public administration and/or private companies to securely handle their data,  including personal data. It also asks about the impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the  work and leisure time of the respondents. Finland also conducts regular organisational polls  regarding information security. During 2017–2018, more than 100 organisations and more than  20,000 persons answered over 40 questions regarding training, competence and the threat  landscape. The survey will be repeated again in 2022.  In Germany, the unit for citizen awareness of the Federal Office for Information Security in  cooperation with the police conducts an annual Digitalbarometer43 survey with 2000 participants  covering qualitative and quantitative aspects of cybersecurity looking at four areas: behavioural  aspects on acquiring information about IT security; personal experience with cybercrime; brand  knowledge of the Federal Office for Information Security; and an annual focus topic (previous  examples include phishing and home office security). Based on the data from this survey in  2019, BSI expanded their materials on emergency cases. For example, they created leaflets  with explanations of what to do in an emergency situation, if a person becomes a victim of  fraud, for example.  Another study on cybersecurity behaviour in Germany is the “DIVSI Milieu Study on Trust and  Security on the Internet” conducted in 2018 by an independent institute.44 The study focuses on  how people in Germany relate to risks in cyberspace. The central findings of the study form a  very broad basis that can be used to identify measures designed to enhance trust and security  on the Internet. The study concluded that people’s behaviour on the Internet and their attitudes  toward trust and security can be divided into seven user types based on their security  awareness and usage of information technology (self-assessment). Whereas one user type is  more likely to be interested in entertainment topics, another user type is interested in news. This  made it possible to position the cybersecurity awareness campaigns accordingly to reach each  user type in their habitat.  Latvia does not use broad public surveys on regular basis but has used polls before the launch  of national cybersecurity campaigns to set the baseline. Polling before the campaign has been  42 https://dvv.fi/-/digiturvabarometri-2-2021  43 https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/Digitalbarometer/Digitalbarometer-ProPK-BSI_2020.html  44 https://www.divsi.de/projekte/unterthemen/milieus/index.html ; https://www.divsi.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DIVSI- U25-Studie-euphorie.pdf.  https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/Digitalbarometer/Digitalbarometer-ProPK-BSI_2020.html https://www.divsi.de/projekte/unterthemen/milieus/index.html https://www.divsi.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DIVSI-U25-Studie-euphorie.pdf https://www.divsi.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DIVSI-U25-Studie-euphorie.pdf  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  23  conducted by a marketing agency as part of the campaign, using questions developed by  CERT-LV, such as “Have you been a victim of cybercrime?”, “How often do you use a  computer?. After the campaign the questions were “Have you seen the ads?”, “Where did you  see the ads?”, “Did you like them?. Alternatively, several interagency meetings were organised  before a campaign with key public and private cybersecurity players, where statistics and  information were shared with the goal to identify causes and potential solutions. One lesson  learnt is the need to measure the change in people’s behaviour, not only whether people have  seen the ads. This is challenging, as the effect is not immediate and behavioural changes can  take years to be established.  Luxembourg is currently evaluating the opportunity to implement a more systematic approach  to evaluating cybersecurity awareness raising requirements and monitoring the effects of  awareness raising campaigns in the context of their most recent NCSS.  In Norway, NorSIS publishes an annual survey about cybersecurity45 where they include a wide  variety of indicators in order to explore them further in the analysis of the data collected. Norway  conducted a comprehensive pilot study in 2015 based on questions seeking to find out, “What  characterises the Norwegian cybersecurity culture?”, “To what degree does cybersecurity  education influence the Norwegian population’s cybersecurity behaviour or awareness?”, “How  does the Norwegian population relate and react to cyber risks?”, “To what degree does the  individual take responsibility for the safety and security of the cyberspace?”.  As a result of the study46, NorSIS found a strong correlation between an interest in technology  and cybersecurity practices. The study concluded that the Norwegian government should take  greater responsibility for cybersecurity education, especially for the young, the old and the  unemployed. Another survey in 2017 discovered that young people did not get enough  organised lessons on cybersecurity compared to employed people. Therefore, based on  capability gaps revealed by the same study, NorSIS prepared materials for students, parents  and teachers and marketed them in collaboration with a local county, the Directorate of  Education and Training and other partners. NorSIS promotes these resources whenever  thematically relevant, for example, on Safer Internet Day.  In Poland, the Minister of Digital Affairs together with the National Research Institute regularly  conducts a quantitative survey called “Monitoring the results of the campaigns for the  dissemination of the benefits of using digital technologies”. The survey covers selected aspects  of cybersecurity and awareness of various types of threats but also studies which security  measures are used by citizens on the Internet. The survey was conducted in 2018 and 2020  and will be held again in 2022. Results from the survey are used to plan communication  activities in campaigns. In addition, all available sources of information such as police, CSIRT  statistics and research carried out by private or public organisations have been considered  when planning the awareness campaigns.  Romania currently does not have a system of metrics and, thus, measures, the activity on the  social media of the National Cyber Security Directorate (DNSC). They are engaged in a  program of improving their management that is supported by the EU funds. One of the topics in  this program is measuring the satisfaction of people using their services. Thus, there are plans  to prepare feedback questionnaires for individuals, private enterprises and public agencies in  the near future.  In Slovakia, national SK-CERT prepares different statistics and reports for its partners as well  as the for the public. These are constantly supplemented and expanded as SK-CERT’s  information resources grow. Three basic groups of statistics are currently being prepared: an  45 https://norsis.no/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/The-Norwegian-Cybersecurity-culture-web.pdf  46 Ibid.  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  24  overview of detected events (events, alarms) and resolved incidents over time; automatically  generated statistics on various areas of the primarily Slovak Internet (Slovak IP address range);  and ad-hoc reports and statistics. Some of these statistics are published in the Annual report on  Cyber Security in the Slovak Republic.  The Slovenian SI-CERT and the Government Information Security Office are planning public  awareness campaigns based on incident data from the national CERT and data from the  Statistics Office published once a year. For example, in 2019 in Slovenia many people were  targeted with love scams from Africa with the scammers pretending to be soldiers on a mission.  SI-CERT designed a targeted media campaign, after which the number of incidents declined.  Another example demonstrates how in 2020, e-commerce grew due to the pandemic, along  with an increase in scams in this field. SI-CERT ran a campaign on e-commerce scams and  later a campaign about scams related to cryptocurrencies. The campaigns were based on  incident data and established an understanding of the threat landscape.  In Sweden, the Civil Contingencies Agency has since 2019 been conducting surveys about  people’s cybersecurity competencies. Annual surveys enable them to compare behavioural  patterns. In 2020, the survey included additional questions about the COVID-19 situation, but  the main part of it remained unchanged.  In conclusion, collecting quantitative data on cybersecurity behaviour (including via public  surveys and statistics) across the whole of society provides useful and necessary insight for  planning more targeted and effective awareness raising activities, thus facilitating more  successful outcomes.  Existing regular public opinion surveys such as the Eurobarometer can serve as a useful  starting point for nations striving to connect data with awareness raising activities. In addition to  data from Eurobarometer, drawing on systematically collected aggregate data from national  CERTs and the law enforcement agencies about cyber incidents and cybercrimes can highlight  trends and be used to build situational awareness. That data, in turn, helps to identify and tailor  the awareness campaigns.  An important success factor in raising citizens’ awareness is to connect the operational and  societal perspectives of awareness raising. The best way to combine those perspectives is to  make the governmental entities that are responsible for the operational perspective also  responsible for raising cybersecurity awareness, such as has been done in the case of the  Federal Office for Information Security in Germany, the Information System Authority in Estonia  or the Centre for Information Security in Norway.  Using public polls and fostering close cooperation with national statistics offices helps to better  identify, understand and reach specific target audiences.  Using public polls  and fostering close  cooperation with  national statistics  offices helps to better  identify, understand  and reach specific  target audiences.  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  25  5. PLANNING FOR  CYBERSECURITY  AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS  To identify good practices for planning cybersecurity awareness campaigns, we studied the  following questions:  • What are the best ways to reach target audiences?  • What were the goals and objectives that these cybersecurity awareness  campaigns aspired to achieve?  • How did they identify target audiences?  • What were the specific topics covered by the campaigns?  • How did they connect the messages to the target groups?  5.1 MAIN CHALLENGES AND LESSONS LEARNT ABOUT EFFECTIVE  CAMPAIGNING  Changing people’s attitude takes time so it is important to have strategic patience. It is useful to  keep in mind that it took ten years to make people use seatbelts in cars. Cybersecurity  awareness campaigns also require a careful balance to both highlight threats that are present in  cyberspace, while at the same time establishing capacity to keep personal data safe and  maintain trust in digital services.  It is important to identify all target groups to ensure no-one gets left behind. Some target  groups, however, may be notoriously difficult to reach, such as the elderly, as well as people  with lower education and socioeconomic wellbeing. Regarding finding the right ways to  approach various audiences in the general public, Member States underline the significance of  using a variety of different channels, such as games, videos, seminars and social media. Note  that to effectively engage with users on various social media platforms such as Facebook,  Twitter and Instagram may require further knowledge about content creation.  Moreover, lack of resources remains a challenge. There should be a whole-society approach  towards cybersecurity, but often, there are not enough resources to address every group, which  limits the scope of outreach. To overcome the problem, attempts to cooperate with different  entities who are willing to help amplify the cybersecurity awareness raising content in their  communities can be helpful.  Throughout the campaign, Member States underline the usefulness of defining key performance  indicators, as well as conducting market research before and during each media campaign to  measure the marketing effectiveness. In addition, regular monitoring reports show the  development of the campaign effects online and in social media networks.  It is worth noting that Member States generally recognise the usefulness of the European  Cybersecurity Month as an amplifier of cybersecurity awareness activities.  Desk research, analysis of surveys and interviews revealed the following good practice  regarding planning awareness campaigns from select EU Member States:  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  26  The Centre for Cybersecurity in Belgium organises tenders for a three-year contract period to  guarantee continuity in creative concept and visual style. The On Safe on Web website Belgium  gathers links to commonly used websites like Facebook and Amazon that redirect users to the  pages on those sites where people can set up the two-factor authentication. Before the COVID-  19 pandemic, a federal awareness raising truck drove around the country to meet people in  small towns. These meetings revealed that some people knew shockingly little about  cybersecurity. In order to reach the widest audience, the Safe on Web website is intentionally  kept simple.  Croatia links awareness activities outside campaigns to a particular day, for example: Safer  Internet Day, Password Day, Consumer Rights Day, or Data Protection Day. When developing  a communication strategy and the creative concept of the campaign, the goal was not to create  fear, but rather to try to impact the way people think and behave. The message “Think how you  use personal data on the Internet” was based on the profile of an average overly confident and  naïve user who does not care too much about online safety. This is where the name “Great  Croatian Naives” comes from. Seven profiles of cybercrime victims were created with central  topics including safe passwords, phishing sites, personal data, scams, ID theft etc.  The Czech Republic developed mandatory courses addressing cybersecurity threats for civil  servants for the 2022 EU Council Presidency of the Czech Republic. These courses can be  adjusted for other sectors such as healthcare, police, education and other civil servants. A  special outreach was organised for the elderly based on a study of 500 senior people, which  illustrated their online activity. Under the cybersecurity Framework Educational Program, Czech  schools organised cybersecurity campaigns promoting the topic among high-school students  and their teachers.  Estonia’s Information System Authority admits that finding resources for conducting polls is  challenging. When running a campaign and organising a procurement for partners, the Estonian  authority asks a procurement partner to conduct either quantitative or qualitative research about  a particular target group. For example, when organising a campaign for the elderly, the  procurement partner conducted an online poll asking how citizens behaved online and  discovered that people under 55 were much more aware of best practices for secure online  behaviour than those over 55. The discovery resulted in the 2019 campaign focusing on the  elderly. In 2020, the data from Statistics Estonia showed that 2–3% of enterprises experienced  cyber incidents, but small and medium-sized businesses did not know how to deal with them,  because of their insufficient IT and information security practices. An awareness campaign for  small and medium enterprises followed. During that campaign, prior work with a focus group of  Russian and Estonian speaking entrepreneurs revealed that knowledge about how to deal with  insider threats was essential for entrepreneurs.  In Finland, a recent campaign focus has been on new kinds of threats related to the use of  social media services and fraud phone calls, SMSs, email messages and web-services. In  2020, in a spontaneous pop-up campaign mode, a cybersecurity expert from the Digital and  Population Data Services Agency (DVV) recorded a Microsoft technical scam call and exposed  it on his personal LinkedIn and Twitter pages. Within a few days, the recorded scam call  became one of the major news items and an estimated 1.5 to 2 million people learnt about it.  Another occasion that attracted media attention was the March 2021 Facebook data breach  which exposed the data of 1.2 million Finnish users. Over one million people learnt about the  event. A combination of social media and traditional media seems to be the best way to get the  attention of the Finnish public. Unfortunately, mostly negative news attracts the media attention.  Germany selected five topics after an analysis of the publicly assessable studies, surveys and  reports. The main framing campaign (published in March 2021) started raising awareness of five  main topics in general: Home Office, Smart Home (Smart TV), Social Media, Gaming, and  Online-Shopping. Each advertisement shows the main message to the audience in a hashtag  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  27  slogan format (e.g. #einfachaBSIchern “#simplysecured”) and is linked to the Federal Office for  Information Security (BSI) website. Each topic has its own teaser page to allow people who are  more interested to look for further information.  Ireland is working on developing national curriculum courses for children between the ages of  12 and 15, such as a computer science course, coding and digital media literacy. One of the  three key aspects is cybersecurity hygiene. The goal is to attract young people from both  genders and from diverse social backgrounds with the goal of encouraging them to study more  science, technology, engineering and mathematics.  Italy launched an awareness campaign about ransomware targeting CISOs and IT  administrators and consisting of guidelines detailing mitigation measures and in-depth analysis  about ransomware attacks: Netwalker and Egregor. Furthermore, during the cybersecurity  attacks related to Solarwinds and Microsoft Exchange, the Italian National CyberSecurity Cell  (NCSC) and the CSIRT Italia launched a specific awareness campaign on their website, as well  as set in motion point-to-point alerts containing updates, mitigations and best practices for the  users of Facebook, Microsoft and Solarwinds. More recently, as a consequence of ransomware  attacks, the CSIRT Italia published additional guidance and published a dedicated section on  their website containing all the relevant documentation.  In Norway, one of the largest campaigns was prepared in parallel to drafting the NCSS, when a  group with experts from both the public and private sector brainstormed to come up with the ten  most important basic pieces advice about cybersecurity to give all companies in Norway. A  recent survey has shown the advice had a large impact on the audiences that received it.  The government in Poland, to counter the problem of kids’ online abuse and YouTube showing  highly violent content, swearing, heavy drinking and other inappropriate behaviour to children,  produced a campaign for parents titled “Do Not Lose Your Child Online”. They launched it  before a summer vacation, because it was noted that during the summer holidays, kids were  often left alone to browse in the net. The government also alerted parents about the  inappropriate type of content and encouraged them to use solutions from Google and Microsoft  for parental controls. A dedicated guide to be “Be Safe on Social Media” was published which  gave details of how to configure security settings to help keep children safe. Another campaign  for kids in Poland was “Be From a Different Fairy Tale” which targeted toddlers going to primary  school with their first tablets and consisted of customised movies related to fairy tales like  Frozen, Red Hat, Gold Fish along with messages and movies for parents teaching them to  introduce the content to their kids.  Portugal had a campaign for raising the cybersecurity awareness of girls. It was meant to  reduce the gender gap in cybersecurity awareness and to motivate girls to study that field. It  was hard to find the best approach to reach these women and girls. In the future, Instagram  could be a possible channel. Underlining specific content for awareness and training, like  password use, available contacts after a cyberattack, and ICT security policies in organisations  works better than promoting fear and highlighting risks. Via feedback from quality assessment  surveys after training if was found that citizens were eager to have more technical and practical  knowledge about cybersecurity.47  In Romania, the most recent outstanding campaign from 2021 was the National Antifraud  Campaign, organised by the National Cyber Security Directorate (DNSC) in collaboration with  the Romanian Police and the Romanian National Banks Association. It involved a mock attack  and explaining to regular users how the attacks work and how to avoid them. It was targeted  47 For a list for of cybersecurity awareness campaigns in Portugal, see https://www.cncs.gov.pt/docs/relatorio- sociedade2020-observatoriociberseguranca-cncs-1.pdf, p. 106.  https://www.gov.pl/web/niezagubdzieckawsieci/ https://www.gov.pl/web/cyfryzacja/bezpieczni-w-mediach-spolecznosciowych--praktyczne-wskazowki https://www.gov.pl/web/badz-z-innej-bajki https://www.cncs.gov.pt/docs/relatorio-sociedade2020-observatoriociberseguranca-cncs-1.pdf https://www.cncs.gov.pt/docs/relatorio-sociedade2020-observatoriociberseguranca-cncs-1.pdf  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  28  towards all credit cards users, because the DNSC observes a lot of criminal activities related to  extracting money from credit cards.  In Slovakia, the Cyber Security Competence and Certification Centre is responsible for  organising training, educational events and security awareness campaigns. The Competence  Centre, together with SK-CERT and the NSA, participates in the preparation of events aimed at  raising awareness in the cybersecurity space. Such events include the ITAPA, a large  conference on digitisation and new technologies, the annual GLOBSEC security conference etc.  In conclusion, to achieve successful cybersecurity awareness campaigns, public communication  and marketing experts should be involved for appropriate message framing. Message framing is  the strategy for communicating a complex societal problem in such a way that the main  arguments are clearly understandable and cannot be easily challenged.  The EU-wide practice of organising campaigns during the European Cybersecurity month of  October is a good practice but it is not sufficient. The awareness raising activities and  campaigns to engage EU residents should be carried out throughout the year.  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  29  6. RECOMMENDATIONS  This report proposes recommendations to increase the effectiveness of national awareness  raising activities, based on the research of existing NCSS, and from information provided by  identified stakeholders who were interviewed for this study. This report provides good practices,  challenges, lessons learnt and a set of recommendations for further improvement.  The recommendations are divided into four areas:  1. building capacities for cybersecurity awareness,  2. regular assessments of cybersecurity trends and challenges,  3. measuring cybersecurity behaviour, and  4. planning for cybersecurity awareness campaigns.  6.1 BUILDING CAPACITIES FOR CYBERSECURITY AWARENESS  • Develop within the NCSS a clear vision for national cybersecurity awareness raising,  assigning clear roles and responsibilities to the different stakeholders involved. This will help  in developing further national cybersecurity capacities and establish a better outlook on the  topic.  • Develop specified concrete measures, tasks, and deliverables to address the objective of  society’s cybersecurity awareness within the implementation plan of the NCSS. This will  help to establish a firmer foundation to achieve success in raising awareness.  • Back the mission and mandate of the entities involved in the building of cybersecurity  awareness with legal acts, where possible. This will help in justifying actions and addressing  any practical details that might be vague and unclear.  • Consider assigning the central coordination role for awareness raising activities to a single  institution. This can be helpful, however, there are also some successful exceptions that  represent a horizontal spread of tasks. It can be concluded that ensuring accountability and  progress requires that all parties involved should have a clear understanding of their  respective roles and responsibilities, which can be more straightforward to achieve with  central coordination but does not exclude horizontal governance models.  • Engage public and private actors together in awareness raising activities both at a national  and regional level to ensure synergistic actions in all areas: legal, organisational, technical  and educational, as well as cooperation between public administration and the private  sector. This can help to achieve efficient cybersecurity awareness raising campaigns.  • Cover awareness-raising objectives by financing. This is an important factor for the  successful implementation of public awareness activities. Sufficient, consistent and  continuous funding provides the foundations for an effective national cybersecurity posture.  6.2 REGULAR ASSESSMENTS OF CYBERSECURITY TRENDS AND  CHALLENGES  • Provide regular analysis and reports of the threat environment. This is an important step  towards higher awareness. Regular analysis and reports aim to inform citizens and ICT  experts, decision-makers and society in general, to create cybersecurity awareness. They  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  30  promote common understanding of threats and foster the concept of cybersecurity being a  joint contribution, requiring efforts at state, organisational and individual level.  • ender information about cybersecurity trends and challenges that will be accessible and  comprehensible to a non-technical audience. This will enable outreach to wider audiences  including decision-makers and decision-shapers at political, organisational and societal  levels.  6.3 MEASURING CYBERSECURITY BEHAVIOUR  • Collect quantitative data across the whole of society on cybersecurity behaviour.  Quantitative measurement of cybersecurity provides background on the cybersecurity  thinking and behavioural patterns of people. This gives important guidance for awareness  raising activities. Public surveys and statistics can provide useful and necessary insights for  planning more targeted and effective awareness raising activities facilitating successful  outcomes.  • Utilise existing regular EU-wide public opinion cybersecurity surveys, such as the  Eurobarometer, as a helpful starting point for nations striving to connect data with  awareness raising activities. Eurobarometer is the polling instrument used by EU institutions  and agencies to regularly monitor the state of public opinion in Europe on attitudes on  subjects of political or social nature. The aim of the Eurobarometer is to provide quality and  relevant data for experts in public opinion and the general public alike. Eurobarometer data  on cybersecurity reveals what concerns Europeans have about internet interactions. It  uncovers whether concern about security issues has made people change the way they use  the Internet. The combination of the wide range of topics covered, the regularity of  publications and the geographical coverage makes the Eurobarometer a unique source of  knowledge about what Europeans think.  • Draw on systematically collected aggregated data from national CERTs and law  enforcement agencies about cyber incidents and cybercrimes to help identify trends and to  build situational awareness. That data, in turn, helps to better understand which specific  societal groups have been hurt the most and subsequently determine the best risk mitigation  measures to use. It also helps to target and tailor the awareness campaigns.  • Use public polls and foster close cooperation with national statistics offices to better identify,  understand and reach target audiences. Understanding how people perceive risks is critical  to create effective awareness campaigns. Collecting relevant data provides a basis to get to  know the target group and decide what kind of information the target audience needs to  improve their skills and knowledge about cybersecurity.  6.4 PLANNING FOR CYBERSECURITY AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS  • Involve public communications and marketing experts for appropriate message framing, that  is, in the strategy of communicating a complex societal problem in such a way that the main  arguments are clearly understandable and cannot be easily challenged. Professional  message framing in cybersecurity awareness campaigns helps to build a greater  understanding of cybersecurity communication to address human factors in cybersecurity.  This can assist in creating successful cybersecurity awareness campaigns.  • To release awareness campaigns during the European Cybersecurity month of October, an  EU-wide practice, is a good practice but that alone is not sufficient. The awareness raising  activities and campaigns to engage EU citizens should be carried out throughout the year in  every Member State. This is important as improving information security practices and  promoting a sustainable society requires efforts that extend beyond one month per year.

Greatest challenge(s) relative to cybersecurity awareness:  • Administration (e.g. agreements and MoUs);  • Complex backend of efforts;  • Multilingualism (i.e. campaigns are in four languages: Dutch, French, German and English)  and the difficulty in finding local alliances with Flemish and German speakers.  Main lesson(s) learnt (to be shared with other Member States):  • Have a lot of partners.  • Learn your target audience: what, why and how they behave.  • Encourage people to do something concrete. Campaigns should be practical. “Static” content  is not very efficient.  • Keep your messages simple and positive. Use humour.  • Don’t scare people.

Main lesson(s) learnt (to be shared with other Member States):  • More effort should be put into recruitment campaigns; there is a need for more  cybersecurity experts, as well as lawyers.  • It is important to go out and talk to people.  • There should be a whole-of-society approach to cybersecurity.  B.4 DENMARK  Institution Interviewed: Danish Agency for Digitisation  General framework: Danish Cyber and Information Security  Strategy 2018-2021  Regular cybersecurity assessments published by: The  Centre for Cyber Security (CFCS)  Existing cybersecurity awareness campaign(s):  Industriens Fond Cyber Effort  European Cyber Security Month  • They were coordinated by Sikker Digital (Secure Digital).  • Prior to the big campaign in October, smaller campaigns are  held (in 2021 they focused on ID theft, strong passwords, fraud  in gaming).  • This year, the campaign has been always-on (non-stop for the whole year).  Greatest challenge(s) relative to cybersecurity awareness:  • Budget, you need a huge budget for advertising;  • Cybersecurity is not something that is in people’s minds; they respond to it only if it becomes a  headache.  Main lesson(s) learnt (to be shared with other Member States):  • Use behaviour-engaging content, humour and irony; if you use engaging content people will  remember.  • Using YouTube has been effective.  B.5 ESTONIA  Institution Interviewed: Information System Authority (RIA)  General framework: Cybersecurity Strategy 2019–2022  Metrics on cybersecurity behaviour published by: Statistics Estonia  Regular cybersecurity assessments published by: Information System Authority (RIA)  https://en.digst.dk/media/17189/danish_cyber_and_information_security_strategy_pdf.pdf https://en.digst.dk/media/17189/danish_cyber_and_information_security_strategy_pdf.pdf https://cfcs.dk/en/ https://cfcs.dk/en/ https://industriensfond.dk/en/node/1401 https://sikkerdigital.dk/national-cybersikkerhedsmaaned https://sikkerdigital.dk/ https://www.ria.ee/en.html https://www.mkm.ee/sites/default/files/kyberturvalisuse_strateegia_2022_eng.pdf https://www.stat.ee/en https://www.ria.ee/en.html  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  40  Existing cybersecurity awareness campaign(s):  Ole IT-vaatlik! (Be IT-Conscious!)  • IT is managed by the RIA.  • In the last two years, two large-scale campaigns were implemented; both  campaigns used the same slogan “SecureIT” and they started in September and  lasted until November.  • The 2019 campaign targeted people over 55 years old and their family and  friends; the 2020 campaign targeted micro, small and medium business leaders.  Greatest challenge(s) relative to cybersecurity awareness:  • Finding a consistent stream of budget;  • Identifying target groups.  Main lesson(s) learnt (to be shared with other Member States):  • If things are written in the Strategy, it is easier to get funding for them.  • People who work in sectors other than IT (such as those selling tires or growing food, for  example) need a lot more attention.  • The most important target groups are usually those who are the most difficult to approach,  and you need to go where your target audience is.  B.6 FINLAND  Institution Interviewed: Digital and Population Data Services Agency  General framework: Finland’s Cyber Security Strategy 2019  Regular cybersecurity assessments published by: National Cyber Security Centre  Existing cybersecurity awareness campaign(s):  • In Finland, there is no centralised agency that is responsible for everything related  to cyberspace; and since there is no central organisation for awareness raising,  other public and private organisations are responsible for training and awareness.  • There aren’t many national campaigns, but many smaller activities are going on  simultaneously.  CYBERDI  Huijarit kuriin! (Scammers Disciplined!)  Greatest challenge(s) relative to cybersecurity awareness:  • It is difficult to find the right ways to approach the citizens.  Main lesson(s) learnt (to be shared with other Member States):  • We need to have different voices to reach a wider audience.  • We have to have games, videos, seminars and other different media because different people  like to learn in different ways.  https://itvaatlik.ee/ https://itvaatlik.ee/ https://itvaatlik.ee/ https://turvallisuuskomitea.fi/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kyberturvallisuusstrategia_A4_ENG_WEB_031019.pdf https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/ https://www.jamk.fi/fi/Tutkimus-ja-kehitys/projektit/CYBERDI/etusivu/ https://www.kuluttajaliitto.fi/hankkeet/huijarit-kuriin/  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  41  B.7 FRANCE  General framework: French National Digital Security Strategy – 2015  Regular cybersecurity assessments published by: CERT-FR  Existing cybersecurity awareness campaign(s):  Cybermalveillance  EDUCNUM  B.8 GERMANY  Institution Interviewed: Federal Office for Information Security (BSI)  General framework: Cyber Security Strategy for Germany 2016 (in German)  Metrics on cybersecurity behaviour published by: Federal Statistical Office, DSiN Security  Index 2020  Regular cybersecurity assessments published by: Federal Office for Information Security  (BIS)  Existing cybersecurity awareness campaign(s):  #einfachaBSIchern (#simplysecured)  • It is managed by the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI)  and the Federal Ministry of Interior, Building and Community (BMI).  • It uses a mix of marketing measurements like Out-of-Home, Digital  and Social Media Ads as well as radio ads to increase awareness  about cybersecurity and information for citizens.  • The campaign aims to reach all citizens in Germany, especially the  audience that is generally not at all or very little self-aware of the  importance for self-help and self-protection using digital  appliances.  Greatest challenge(s) relative to cybersecurity awareness:  • Within marketing activities it is difficult to judge the effectiveness of out-of-home and print  advertisements, as it is uncertain how many people really see these ads; also both kind of  advertisements need a high media budget for a nationwide reach.  • Keeping information and messages on complex issues of cybersecurity very easy to  understand for consumers is challenging.  Main lesson(s) learnt (to be shared with other Member States):  • Send positive messages to emphasise that everyone can to improve their cybersecurity skills  with some easy steps. Make a niche topic more interesting with a humorous approach.  • When planning marketing activities:  o Use very short video ads to capture the user’s attention.  o Focus on digital advertisements and plan out-of-home, print and radio ads selectively  according to certain topics or phases of the campaign, to diversify your marketing  approach.  https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2015/10/strategie_nationale_securite_numerique_en.pdf https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/ https://www.cybermalveillance.gouv.fr/ https://www.educnum.fr/ https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Home/home_node.html https://www.bmi.bund.de/cybersicherheitsstrategie/BMI_CyberSicherheitsStrategie.pdf https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html https://www.sicher-im-netz.de/dsin-sicherheitsindex-2020 https://www.sicher-im-netz.de/dsin-sicherheitsindex-2020 https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Home/home_node.html https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Home/home_node.html https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/Kampagne-einfach-absichern/kampagne_node.html  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  42  o Continue to observe the metrics throughout the years to see the development and to  adjust the campaign(s) where necessary.

For example, a ‘working from home’ themed campaign  evolved based on political needs, the interests of the CSIRT, the  competencies of the NCSC.  • There are volunteer groups, private sector interests and private  CSIRTs that attempt to get the message out there.  Webwise.ie  Be Safe Online  • A governmental initiative that aligns and brings together cross-government activities in a  single site.  • It includes a wide range of topics, for example, alerts parents to the problem of child  exploitation, appropriate use of online tools by teenagers, how to effectively secure your  account or personal device, among others.  Greatest challenge(s) relative to cybersecurity awareness:  • Existing scepticism as to whether awareness campaigns are really changing behaviour; it’s a  question about if we should address this through education, through employers or private  advocates.

Greatest challenge(s) relative to cybersecurity awareness:  • Defining messages: cyberspace provides a lot of opportunities as well as risks, and a balance  must be found when creating cybersecurity awareness messages.  Main lesson(s) learnt (to be shared with other Member States):  • It is important to create the right message for the audience, and to keep it simple and not go  into too much detail so people can understand the technical concepts.  • It is not enough only to pass on information, it is necessary to get people engaged  emotionally.  B.11 LATVIA  Institution Interviewed: National Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT)  General framework: National Cyber Security Strategy 2019–2022 (in Latvian)  Metrics on cybersecurity behaviour published by: Official Statistics Portal  Regular cybersecurity assessments published by: CERT.LV  Existing cybersecurity awareness campaign(s):  Drošs Internets (Safe Internet)  Mana Drošiba (My Safety)  Neuzķeries!

European Digital Week  • Organised by the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Regional  Development of the Republic of Latvia and Latvian Information and  Communications technology association (LIKTA);  • Targets enterprises and the general public.  Esi reāls (Be real)  • Organised by the Consumer Rights Protection Centre;  • Targets users of social networks.  Greatest challenge(s) relative to cybersecurity awareness:  • How to best address and reach the society;  • How to be a good organiser of an awareness raising campaign.  Main lesson(s) learnt (to be shared with other Member States):  • People are not interested in education about prevention, they respond more to the scary and  dangerous things, i.e. real-time warnings about real threats.  • People may understand the message and like it, but at the same time they may not change  their behaviour, at least not immediately; getting people to behave securely online can also  require a lot of time.  • Our statistics showed that peak interest was during the first week of a campaign; several short  campaigns in different seasons might be preferrable to month-long campaigns.

Almost everybody has heard of cybersecurity and its  importance; however, the behaviour of citizens does not always reflect a high level of  awareness. Cybersecurity is essential for individuals and for public and non-public  organisations, yet observing security practices often proves to be difficult.  This report seeks to assist EU Member States in further building their cybersecurity  capacities by analysing best practices on raising citizens’ awareness of cybersecurity. It  offers recommendations about ways for better communicating cybersecurity.  The need for cybersecurity awareness and skills is becoming increasingly urgent due to our  dependence on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) across all aspects of our  society. Recent technological advances and the introduction of smart devices have forced both  government and private organisations to create awareness of cyber threats and cybersecurity.  The coronavirus pandemic has further complicated the cyber threat landscape. In March 2020,  the COVID-19 pandemic led to social distancing measures and travel restrictions. The global  effort to slow down infection rates caused a rapid shift to remote working. In a short amount of  time, IT security professionals had to respond to the challenges introduced by working from  home arrangements, such as enterprise data movements whenever employees use their home  Internet to access cloud-based apps, corporate software, videoconferencing, and file sharing.1  Even though the hardware and software solutions may have been in place to secure the  organisation’s data, there were often no established policies to help employees through the  jungle of threats and vulnerabilities they were to face when moving their workplace out of the  traditional office environment.2  With a lack of appropriate guidelines, training and cybersecurity awareness, adapting to such a  ‘digital by default’ normal is difficult, and remote workers may inadvertently act in ways that  expose the business to cyber threats. Frequently reported examples of these kinds of mistakes  are connecting work devices to public Wi-Fi networks, sharing corporate devices with family  members without authorisation, connecting work devices to personal equipment without  permission and using personal devices to access work applications and downloading  unauthorised applications contrary to organisational policies. All such frequent habits increase  the risk of data exposure.  In short, communication about cybersecurity issues is a complicated endeavour. In this report,  we have collected information and evaluated the intensity, regularity and diversity of different  cybersecurity awareness practices and processes in EU Member States. We present ways in  which Member States have achieved better cybersecurity awareness in society and have  incorporated cybersecurity awareness into their national cybersecurity strategies (NCSS). In  addition, we provide recommendations in the following four areas: building capacities for  cybersecurity awareness, regular assessments of trends and challenges, measuring  cybersecurity behaviour and planning cybersecurity awareness campaigns.  1 ENISA Threat Landscape “The Year in Review.

INTRODUCTION  1.1 AIM, SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES  The aim of this work on cybersecurity awareness raising was first to analyse the ability of EU  Member States to build their national capacities to raise citizens’ awareness regarding  cybersecurity issues. Then, based on the results of an analysis of best practices on raising  citizens’ awareness of cybersecurity, this work aims to assist EU Member States in further  building their cybersecurity capacities. This report offers recommendations about ways to better  communicate cybersecurity. The study covers the practices of EU Member States from 2018  until 2021.  The specific objectives of this study were to:  • Analyse existing methods for raising cybersecurity awareness at a national level.  • Identify stakeholders and their roles in the organisation associated with implementing  and monitoring awareness raising activities.  • Identify EU Member States’ good practices on how to organise, measure effectiveness  and ensure appropriate outreach of the awareness raising activities.  • Identify a set of metrics before designing awareness raising activities in order to follow  up on effectiveness and reach out both in the short- and long-term perspective.  • Identify the behavioural aspects that may influence awareness campaigns.  • Highlight challenges and lessons learnt from the design of such activities.  • Propose recommendations for improving awareness in society, considering all the  above elements.  1.2 APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY  This report proposes recommendations to increase the effectiveness of national awareness  raising activities, based on the research into existing NCSS, interviewing stakeholders involved  in cybersecurity awareness raising in Member States, and identifying good practices, challenges  and lessons learnt.  The intensity, regularity and diversity of different cybersecurity awareness practices and  processes in EU Member States has been evaluated based on collected information.  Throughout the study, we have examined the following indicators:  • The amount and sequence of information provided to citizens on cyber threats and on  cybersecurity by national authorities.  • The level of accessibility of threat-related information provided by national authorities to the  society.  • Quantitative data and metrics for monitoring public cybersecurity behaviour.  Additionally, the connection between quantitative metrics and operational perspectives in  carrying out possible awareness campaigns is analysed. The work is based on a substantial  analysis of Member States’ awareness campaign methodologies, including carrying out their  planning processes, the way they meet challenges and how they measure success and impact.  Based on a pre-defined questionnaire, 20 structured interviews were conducted with the  relevant national authorities during May–July 2021. The collected evidence was synthesised to  identify overarching patterns, the perceived quality of awareness raising activities and the  campaign’s success in achieving the specified goals and objectives. The evaluation of the  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  7  awareness raising activities was based on the analytical data gathered from desktop research,  interviews with subject matter Member State authorities and questionnaire results.

Such aspects include cognizance of cyber risks and threats,  but also appropriate protection measures.6 We maintain that  awareness is not training; the purpose of awareness presentations is  simply to focus attention on security. Awareness presentations are  intended to allow individuals to recognise IT security concerns and  respond accordingly.7 Through awareness raising, individual and  corporate users can learn how to behave in the online world and  protect themselves from potential risks and threats.8  Good practices Activities that have been shown to work well and proven to succeed  in achieving objectives and could be recommended as a model.  They are activities oriented towards providing guidance to the  different stakeholders.  1.5 STRUCTURE  The report is divided into five parts. Firstly, it provides definitions and describes the  methodologies followed in the development of this report. Secondly, an overview of building  national capacities towards national cybersecurity awareness is provided, showcasing best  practices from a number of EU Member States. Then, the importance of periodic assessments  of cybersecurity trends and challenges is presented, followed by an analysis of the collection  metrics used to measure the behavioural aspects of cybersecurity. In the fifth chapter, an  examination of the actual cybersecurity awareness campaigns conducted in practice is  provided. Each chapter has an outline of overarching patterns, followed by good practices from  selected Member States and a conclusion. The last chapter provides a number of  recommendations to increase the effectiveness of national awareness raising activities.  5 ISO/IEC 27032:2012  6 Nurse J.R.C. (2021) Cybersecurity Awareness.

BUILDING CAPACITIES TO  RAISE CYBERSECURITY  AWARENESS  In 2020, ENISA published a national capabilities assessment framework9 that aims to provide  Member States with a self-assessment of their level of maturity. To achieve this goal, it enables  the assessment of NCSS objectives, such as raising user awareness by providing KPIs on five  maturity levels. The aim of the framework is to help EU Member States enhance and build  cybersecurity capabilities both at strategic and operational levels.  The purpose of the study was to provide an overview and analysis of EU Member States’  capacities to raise cybersecurity awareness among their general population through the  organisation of national activities and plans. The results of interviews with and surveys  completed by experts who conduct awareness building in Member States highlight the different  approaches that countries follow to support cybersecurity awareness in the context of their  NCSS.  Desk research and interviews revealed that Member States with a cybersecurity strategy which  includes a clear vision about national cybersecurity awareness raising are in a stronger starting  position when building their cybersecurity capacities. Member States are on even firmer ground  if the objective of society-level cybersecurity awareness in their national cybersecurity strategies  is supported by concrete measures, tasks, and deliverables specified in the strategy  implementation plan.  Throughout the years, the importance of cybersecurity awareness raising has been recognised  in the NCSS of Member States. While earlier strategies sometimes addressed the issue  superficially or declaratively, there is now an evident trend to describe the aims of awareness  raising as well as relevant activities in more detail.  A number of Member States claim that more efficient awareness raising is conducted when  there exists a clearly defined national agency coordinating or overseeing cybersecurity  awareness efforts. However, there were some successful cases of horizontally spread tasks,  such as in Finland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, where the activities are carried out by a  number of different ministries and agencies. The underlying factor to ensure accountability and  progress was identified as all parties involved having a clear understanding of their respective  roles and responsibilities.  The majority of countries studied recognise the importance of close interagency cooperation in  conducting awareness raising activities. The interviews with EU Member States also verified a  need for public and private actors to engage together at national and regional levels for  efficiency in raising awareness. Ensuring cybersecurity requires synergistic actions in the legal,  organisational, technical and educational areas.  Despite acknowledging the need for joint engagement, guaranteeing the ongoing budget  required remains challenging. This stems from the fact that resources are allocated by  government entity, rather than by task or objective. Only three Member States out of twenty  9 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/national-capabilities-assessment-framework  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  10  could confirm that established and regular national funding for cybersecurity awareness  activities is guaranteed. For some Member States, European Union funds are used for such  activities.  Regarding cooperation between the relevant cybersecurity agencies and the media, Belgium,  Czech Republic, Finland, Luxembourg and Slovakia demonstrate good practice on how to  maintain constructive connections with the media and create an open atmosphere that enables  the provision of more information to journalists.  2.1 NCSS WITH A CLEAR VISION ABOUT AWARENESS  Cybersecurity awareness raising is more likely to be successful when the corresponding vision  is spelled out in the NCSS to help all stakeholders understand what is at stake and why  cybersecurity awareness raising is needed (context), what is to be accomplished (objectives),  as well as what is it about and to whom it applies (scope). The clearer the vision, the easier it is  for key stakeholders to ensure a comprehensive, consistent and coherent approach. A clear  vision also facilitates coordination, cooperation and implementation.10  Desk research and an analysis of surveys and interviews revealed the following good practices  of selected EU Member States:  Croatia is currently updating its NCSS. Awareness raising is embedded in three areas:  electronic communication, critical information infrastructure and cybercrime. The Croatian  national Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-HR) which implements cybersecurity  awareness raising activities, is a department within the Croatian Academic and Research  Network with a separate strategy (2019–2022)11 that prioritises digital transformation of the  educational system and cybersecurity awareness raising as part of that.  The NCSS of the Czech Republic 2021–202512 was published in December 2020, with a  separate chapter titled “Resilient Society 4.0” addressing education and awareness raising of  the overall population.  The Estonian NCSS 2019–202213 along with the Estonian Cybersecurity Act (2018) task the  Estonian Information System Authority to raise awareness among citizens, to prevent  cybersecurity incidents and to notify citizens about possible threats.  The Finnish Cybersecurity Strategy from 201914 focuses, inter alia, on the need to increase  public cybersecurity competence: “Finnish society needs cybersecurity competence both in  public administration and in the business community. … At the national level, it must be ensured  that everyone has sufficient capacity to operate safely in a digital environment.”15 In addition,  the Government Resolution on digital security in the public sector aims to improve the digital  security skills and awareness of public sector staff as well as the personnel of business and  non-governmental organisations.  The awareness raising objectives of the Latvian Cybersecurity Strategy 2019–202216 focus on  building an information society that include raising cybersecurity awareness amongst teachers,  students, governmental employees, and society in general by promoting safe use of hardware,  10 https://www.itu.int/pub/D-STR-CYB_GUIDE.01-2018  11 https://www.carnet.hr/en/  12 https://www.nukib.cz/en/cyber-security/strategy-action-plan/  13 https://www.mkm.ee/sites/default/files/kyberturvalisuse_strateegia_2022_eng.pdf  14 https://julkaisut.valtioneuvosto.fi/handle/10024/162265  15 https://turvallisuuskomitea.fi/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kyberturvallisuusstrategia_A4_ENG_WEB_031019.pdf  16 https://www.mod.gov.lv/en/nozares-politika/cybersecurity  https://julkaisut.valtioneuvosto.fi/handle/10024/162265 https://turvallisuuskomitea.fi/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kyberturvallisuusstrategia_A4_ENG_WEB_031019.pdf https://www.mod.gov.lv/en/nozares-politika/cybersecurity  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  11  software and the Internet. These objectives are divided into specific tasks that are assigned to  various institutions.  Luxembourg’s upcoming NCSS IV (2021–2025) approaches the issue of awareness raising  from the perspective of “Building trust in the digital world and protection of human rights online”.  Amongst various strategy objectives, cybersecurity education and vocational training focuses on  awareness raising. An action plan of the strategy defines concrete tasks and deliverables.  Malta’s 2016 NCSS17 has six goals, one of which is “cybersecurity awareness and education”.  With this goal, Malta aims to target academia, the public and private sector and citizens to  “sensitize” awareness, knowledge as well as capabilities and expertise in cybersecurity. Specific  measures under this goal include a “Strategic, target-oriented national awareness and advice  campaign” and “Encouragement of ‘cyber hygiene’ and personal responsibility”.  For the first time, Norway in 2019 launched a separate National Strategy for Cybersecurity  Competence,18 because competence and knowledge about cyber threats, vulnerable areas, and  effective measures are a precondition for the ability to protect digital systems against cyber  incidents. Developed by the Norwegian Ministry of Justice and Public Security and the Ministry  of Education and Research, the Competence Strategy addresses cybersecurity from the  perspective of a general challenge to society. While drafting the strategy, the ministries were in  close dialogue with both universities and research funding agencies to guarantee an open and  inclusive process. They also involved stakeholders from the public and private sector. The goal  of the strategy is to improve cybersecurity competence in accord with the needs of society. The  strategy sets out conditions for long-term competence building, encompassing national capacity  building in the fields of research, development and education, and measures designed to raise  awareness in the business community and among the general public.  Poland’s Cybersecurity Strategy for 2019–2024 has as its main objective to increase the level  of resilience to cyber threats and to strengthen data protection. It includes the issues of raising  awareness in cybersecurity.  Portugal’s latest Cybersecurity Strategy 2019–202319 expands on cybersecurity awareness  under a special axis called “prevention, education and awareness” which foresees a number of  specific action points such as, for example, to promote robust and cross-cutting cybersecurity  training programs for all organisations and the average citizen, to strengthen cyberspace  security skills and knowledge in education and to promote digital education and literacy.  Slovakia’s Cybersecurity Strategy 2021–202520 prioritises a well-educated public and well-  educated professionals. It includes not only reference to regulations but also practical activities,  such as risk management, detection and cybersecurity incident handling, system recovery,  education, dissemination of security awareness and, last but not least, research and  development of cybersecurity tools and processes.  For the National Strategy and its objectives to be feasible, specific tasks and activities must be  identified, together with clear responsibilities. To this end, the Government of Slovakia adopted  in July 2021 an Action Plan for the implementation of the National Cyber Security Strategy for  2021 to 2025, which defines specific tasks and activities, identifies responsible entities and also  time horizons for fulfilling individual tasks and activities. The aim of the Action Plan is to create a  17 https://cybersecurity.gov.mt/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Mita-_Malta-Cyber-Security-Strategy-Book.pdf  18 https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/nasjonal-strategi-for-digital-sikkerhetskompetanse/id2627189/  19 https://www.cncs.gov.pt/docs/cncs-ensc-2019-2023.pdf  20 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/national-cyber-security-strategies-  interactive-map?selected=Slovakia  1 Please use footnotes for providing additional or explanatory information and/or relevant links.

Slovenia is working on a new version of its NCSS that is expected to be ready by June 2022.  The current version, the 2016 NCSS21 does address cybersecurity awareness raising.  Furthermore, the 2018 Information Security Act22 provides a legal basis for awareness-raising  activities. It gives the mandates for the awareness-raising tasks to the Government Information  Security Office.  In conclusion, Member States with a NCSS that includes a clear vision about national  cybersecurity awareness raising are in a stronger starting position when building their  cybersecurity capacities. They are on even firmer ground if the objective of the society-level  cybersecurity awareness in their NCSS is further supported with concrete measures, tasks and  deliverables specified in the strategy implementation plan. Throughout years, the importance of  cybersecurity awareness raising has been recognised in cybersecurity strategies. While earlier  strategies sometimes addressed the issue superficially or declaratively, there is now an evident  trend to describe the aims of the awareness raising as well as relevant activities in more detail.  2.2 COORDINATION OF AWARENESS ACTIVITIES AND INTERAGENCY  COOPERATION  In a number of Member States –11 Member States out of the 20 observed – cybersecurity  awareness raising activities are coordinated by a single, competent authority. This dedicated  and competent cybersecurity authority is a leading entity that provides direction, coordinates  actions, and monitors the implementation of cybersecurity awareness activities. The lead  agency also identifies an initial set of stakeholders to be involved in the development and  implementation of the awareness activities, clarifies the roles of different stakeholders and  outlines how they should collaborate in order to manage expectations throughout the process.  In turn, these entities are responsible and accountable for the implementation of each specific  initiative assigned to them and are expected to coordinate their efforts with other relevant  stakeholders as part of the implementation process.  An example of a coordination mechanism would be conducting periodic meetings with all  relevant stakeholders for a joint review of action plans. An example of a cooperation mechanism  would be the creation of an intra-sectoral task force to address a particular issue.  Desk research and interviews revealed that coordination models vary country by country.  In Belgium, the central coordinator is the Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium (CCB). The CCB  works with the Cybersecurity Coalition, a national cooperation that brings together  representatives of the private, academic and administration sectors. The Cybersecurity Coalition  has created a task force on awareness raising which collaborates with the CCB. They prepare  materials together and encourage partners to use them all year around.  In Czech Republic, the National Cybersecurity Centre is the executive section of the National  Cyber and Information Security and Agency. Amongst other tasks, the National Cybersecurity  Centre oversees awareness and educational activities concerning cybersecurity. Nevertheless,  it is the responsibility of every organisation’s management to raise the cybersecurity awareness  of their employees.  The Estonian Information System Authority is the coordinator of cybersecurity awareness  raising in Estonia. It gathers data to assess the level of awareness, analyses incident statistics  21 https://www.gov.si/assets/ministrstva/MJU/DID/Cyber_Security_Strategy_Slovenia.pdf  22 http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO7707  https://www.gov.si/assets/ministrstva/MJU/DID/Cyber_Security_Strategy_Slovenia.pdf http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO7707  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  13  and organises activities based on the collected data. Under the coordination of the Information  System Authority, multiple actors are engaged in awareness raising. For example, the police  have online “Web-Constables” – police officers who respond to notifications and letters  submitted by people via the internet and train children as well as adults about issues of internet  security. PhD candidates specialising in cybersecurity at the Tallinn University of Technology  work with children in the schools. The Information System Authority also cooperates with civil  society organisations like the Estonian Union for Child Welfare that targets activities towards  children. Communication companies run their own campaigns, for example, Telia has  conducted a campaign for kids countering cyberbullying.  Finland has a distributed model instead of a centralised agency that is responsible for  everything related to cyberspace. There are a number of different agencies that work in different  areas. The Finnish Cybersecurity Strategy (2019) explains this as follows: “National  cybersecurity will be built in cooperation among the authorities, the business community,  organisations and citizens, when everyone can contribute to our shared cybersecurity. Each  individual is therefore an important cybersecurity actor who can improve cybersecurity through  his or her actions on a daily basis and thus impact his or her own cybersecurity and that of  others.” In the appendix to the publication Digital Security in the Public Sector,23 the  responsibilities of different agencies in relation to cybersecurity are described.  In Germany, the Federal Office for Information Security shapes information security in  digitalisation through prevention, detection and response for government, business, and society.  The document that guides national cybersecurity awareness raising is the “Act on the Federal  Office for Information Security”.24 Since 2018, a separate citizens’ awareness unit team  “Cybersecurity for citizens and society” has existed in the Federal Office for Information  Security.  In Italy, the Law Decree n. 82 of 14 June 2021, converted into Law n. 109 on 4 August 2021,  established the National Cybersecurity Agency (NCA) which also carries out activities related to  the communication and promotion of cybersecurity awareness to contribute to the development  of a national culture. The Agency includes the National Cybersecurity Cell (NCSC) – an inter-  ministerial body meant for coordinating preventive measures and reacting to national  cybersecurity crises – that replaced the one operating within the Security Intelligence  Department (DIS).25  Ireland has established a cybersecurity education working group within the National Council for  the Curriculum and Assessment, Computer and Education Society of Ireland (which is a group  of teachers at elementary, middle, and high-school levels) and Cyber Ireland.  In Latvia, CERT.LV is tasked with informing the society of cyber threats, but they do not play a  single leading role and are not the main coordinator among all the institutions for cybersecurity  awareness campaigns. The Ministry of Environmental Protection and Regional Development,  for example, is responsible for organising events during European Digital Week.  Luxembourg has no single dedicated agency for the coordination of awareness raising. The  inter-ministerial cyber prevention and cybersecurity committee is responsible for ensuring  23 https://julkaisut.valtioneuvosto.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/162265/VM_2020_45.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y  24 https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/BSI/BSI_Act_BSIG.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=1  25 The national cybersecurity ecosystem in Italy was reshaped with the entry into force of the Law Decree n. 82 of 14 June  2021, which created the National Cybersecurity Agency (NCA). To the extent that awareness raising is part of preventive  activities, the National Cybersecurity Cell provides this coordination. The NCSC is chaired by the NCA director general, it  includes the Prime Minister's Military Counsellor, representatives from the Intelligence community (DIS, AISE and AISI), the  Civil Protection Department, as well as from the Ministries represented in the Cybersecurity inter-ministerial Committee  (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Economy and  Finance, Ministry of Economic Development, Ministry of Technological Innovation and Digital Transition, Ministry of  Sustainable Infrastructures and Mobility, Ministry for Ecological Transition and the Ministry of University and Research).  1 Please use footnotes for providing additional or explanatory information and/or relevant links.

Use only the function References/Insert Footnote  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  14  national coordination in the field of cyber prevention and cybersecurity and as such also at a  high level for awareness raising. The High Commission for National Protection is in charge of  coordinating the drafting and implementation of the NCSS. The “Bee Secure” government  initiative is operated by the National Youth Service and the Kanner-Jugendtelefon, in  partnership with Securitymadein.lu,26 the Grand-Ducal Police and the Public Prosecutor’s  Office. The ministries involved are the Ministry of National Education, Children and Youth, the  Ministry of the Economy and the Ministry of Family and Integration. Other key players include  the National Institute for Public Administration that raises awareness among civil servants.  Thanks to its field experience and its established network of partners, “Bee Secure” is able to  contribute in a concrete way to the empowerment of the user.  In 2016, the Malta Information and Technology Agency (MITA) was assigned the mandate to  coordinate and oversee citizens’ cybersecurity awareness and education, and the Cyber  Security Malta campaign was launched. MITA cooperates with other stakeholders in the  framework of the National Cybersecurity Committee which also includes the Police, the Armed  Forces, the Critical Infrastructure Directorate, the Communications Authority, the Financial  Services Authority, the Gaming Authority and the Digital Innovation Authority.  In the Netherlands, various ministries have their own policy for cybersecurity awareness  raising. Overall, the Ministry of Security and Justice is responsible for cybersecurity measures  concerning civilians, the Ministry of Economics is responsible for cybersecurity awareness  raising among companies and entrepreneurs, and the Office and Ministry of Security and  Justice deal with municipalities and vital infrastructure. The latter engage in awareness raising  activities to prevent citizens and organisations from becoming victims. They cooperate with the  police and several private sector players such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft and  telecommunication companies.  In Norway, NorSIS is a national coordinator for the European Cybersecurity Month. NorSIS is  an independent body that works in collaboration with public sector, institutions, partly financed  by the Ministry of Justice and Public Security. Its main target groups are the general population,  as well as small and medium enterprises. In the future its activities will be targeted mostly at  private citizens. NorSIS partners with traditional media, the Safer Internet Centre and other  partners depending on the scope of activities, e.g. the National Data Protection Agency, the  Norwegian Cyber Security Centre and the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency. The Centre  organises and provides guidance, advice, case handling and other services free of charge to  the population. The Norwegian National Security Authority is a cross-sectoral professional and  supervisory authority within the protective security services in Norway.  In Poland, in 2020, the Ministry of Digital Affairs was reorganised and incorporated into the  chancellery of the Prime Minister. The role of the Minister of Digital Affairs is performed by the  Prime Minister, and the former Minister of Digital Affairs has taken on the role of Secretary of  State. The Department of Cybersecurity in the Chancellery of the Prime Minister focuses on the  development of the content, guidance and recommendations. Overall, awareness raising  activities in Poland are conducted by the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)  of the National Research Institute (NASK) that deals with a wider audience like academia, the  education sector, the transportation sector, and local administration. The National Research  Institute is promoting the safe use of new technologies and the Internet, providing materials and  best practices for educating society on cybersecurity. The Polish Ministry of Defence Computer  Security Incident Response Team is sometimes also engaged in awareness raising by running  phishing awareness campaigns and providing recommendations.  26 Securitymadein.lu is an economic interest group owned by the state of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and local  governments, see https://securitymadein.lu/agency/  1 Please use footnotes for providing additional or explanatory information and/or relevant links. References should be listed  in a dedicated section. Use only the function References/Insert Footnote  https://securitymadein.lu/agency/  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  15  An example of public-private cooperation in Poland is the Cybersecurity Cooperation Program,27  a non-commercial public-private partnership for the National Cybersecurity System where  parties exchange experiences in order to, inter alia, increase the security of digital processes,  products and services. The cooperation agreement covers such areas as: information,  education, training and testing as well as certification with particular emphasis on raising  competencies in the field of awareness of threats and attack methods in cyberspace.  In Romania, the National Cyber Security Directorate (DNSC) as the national competent  authority for the cybersecurity of networks and information systems has the responsibility of the  cybersecurity awareness activities. In this role, DNSC frequently delivers awareness materials  for all types of users both on its website and on social media channels. DNSC fulfils the function  of alerting of issues, prevention, awareness and training.  In Slovakia, according to the Cybersecurity Act, the National Security Authority is responsible  for awareness raising and for preparing legislation in the field of cybersecurity. The  Cybersecurity Competence and Certification Centre within SK-CERT determines the education  programs for building security awareness and professional training. The NSA in Slovakia has  good relationships across the cybersecurity community. They cooperate with the police when it  comes to raising awareness about cybercrime, as well as with academia (e.g. Technical  University in Žilina, the Academy of the Police Forces and other universities). Cooperation  discussion also involves the Slovakian Academy of Sciences. In the future, increased  collaboration is also planned with the Slovakian Cybersecurity Association.  In Slovenia, the Government Information Security Office is the national competent authority and  raising public awareness of information security is one of their tasks. The Government  Information Security Office coordinates training, exercises and education in the field of  information security and is responsible for raising public awareness of information security. The  interagency cooperation includes the national CERT, the police, the cybersecurity section of the  Slovenian Chamber of Commerce, Telecommunications companies (TELCOs Telekom  Slovenia and A1) and the Slovenian Bank Association. The national CERT runs an awareness-  raising programme Safe on internet, and a consortium of the Faculty of Social Sciences, some  non-governmental organisations, the Academic and Research Network of Slovenia (ARNES)  and the Police runs an awareness-raising programme Safer Internet. The Slovenian Bank  Association cooperates with the national CERT.  To sum up, several Member States demonstrate that successful awareness raising is conducted  when there is a clear national agency coordinating or overseeing citizens’ cybersecurity  awareness activities. However, there were some successful cases of horizontally spread tasks,  such as Finland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. To ensure accountability and progress, the  parties involved should have a clear understanding of their respective roles and responsibilities.  Furthermore, all Member States recognise the importance of close interagency cooperation for  awareness raising activities. According to the interviews, for successful cybersecurity  awareness raising, there’s a need for public and private actors engaged together in  cybersecurity awareness raising activities at a national and regional level. Ensuring  cybersecurity requires synergistic actions in the legal, organisational, technical and educational  areas as well as cooperation between public administration and the private sector.  27 https://www.gov.pl/web/cyfryzacja/program-wspolpracy-w-cyberbezpieczenstwie-pwcyber--partnerstwo-publiczno- prywatne-na-rzecz-krajowego-systemu-cyberbezpieczenstwa  https://www.gov.pl/web/cyfryzacja/program-wspolpracy-w-cyberbezpieczenstwie-pwcyber--partnerstwo-publiczno-prywatne-na-rzecz-krajowego-systemu-cyberbezpieczenstwa https://www.gov.pl/web/cyfryzacja/program-wspolpracy-w-cyberbezpieczenstwie-pwcyber--partnerstwo-publiczno-prywatne-na-rzecz-krajowego-systemu-cyberbezpieczenstwa  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  16  2.3 RESOURCE ALLOCATION  Sufficient, consistent and continuous funding provides the foundations for an effective national  cybersecurity posture. For an efficient implementation of cybersecurity awareness raising  activities, Member States should allocate necessary human and financial resources.  Desk research, analysis of surveys and interviews revealed the following good practices based  on selected EU Member States:  In Croatia, the national CERT as a part of the Croatian Academic and Research Network uses  European funding for cybersecurity awareness campaigns. The last campaign was co-financed  by the EU programme “Connecting Europe Facility” under the action GrowCERT.  In Czech Republic, cybersecurity awareness raising activities are financed from an annual  budget that is based on strategic documents and priorities.  In Luxembourg, entities engaged in awareness raising manage their regular annual budgets  allocated to cybersecurity awareness raising campaigns and ongoing initiatives. If necessary,  extraordinary annual financing requirements needed for the implementation of awareness  building objectives of the most recent strategy are defined and negotiated.  In Norway, the grants from the Ministry of Justice and Public Security, make up about half of  the annual budget of NorSIS. This allocation is meant to cover cybersecurity awareness raising  activities towards citizens such as the national cybersecurity month, public information  campaigns etc.  Guaranteeing a stable stream of funding continues to be challenging. However, Member States  with an NCSS and implementation plans that make reference to cybersecurity awareness  raising were in a somewhat stronger position to ensure necessary funding.  For a stable stream of funding, the lead coordinating authority works with the owners of the  specific initiatives to understand what resources (human resources, expertise and funding  needs) are required to accomplish the work, and then identifies and secures the required  resources in accordance with administrative financial structures of the country.  More generally, it is relevant to keep in mind that resources are defined beyond the terms of  money (i.e. dedicated budget); they also include people, material, as well as the relationships  and partnerships and continued political commitment and leadership required for successful  execution.  2.4 COOPERATION WITH MEDIA  Developments in ICT have exposed the media to cybersecurity threats and frauds. Content  security is also at stake: misinformation is a growing threat that damages the confidence the  public has in the media. As the audience is now getting information through multiple platforms,  they don't know how to be sure a piece of news comes from a respected media outlet. In  addition, piracy is damaging legitimate service provider revenues and legitimate service  providers won’t be able to afford to provide high quality services if they continue to lose  consumers to piracy.  Media plays a key role in democracies around the world, acting as a watchdog of the state and  informing citizens about the decisions that affect their everyday life. The media also plays an  important role in raising public awareness of cybersecurity as an amplifier of public messages  and a reminder of the importance of good cybersecurity practices. Cooperation with the media  also raises awareness across the society of the increasing cybersecurity risks.  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  17  Desk research, analysis of surveys and interviews revealed the following good practices based  on selected EU Member States:  The Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium (CCB) has compiled a document called “ABC of the  CCB”28 with 42 most asked questions and answers regularly disseminated to journalists writing  about cybersecurity.  The Czech Republic aims to have one person in every bigger newsroom covering  cybersecurity topics. In the case of cyber incidents, these points of contacts will prove useful in  knowing, for example, what phishing is and they can spread this information further.  In Finland, during elections, special media programs are aired where about half a dozen well-  respected journalists dive deep into cybersecurity matters. In 2018, a public-private partnership  initiative in Finland called Mediapooli published a book titled Editor’s Encryption Guide  (Toimittajan Salausopas)29 which is a “cyber textbook for journalists” that includes guidance for  journalists on how to protect their sources from cyberattacks.  In Latvia, before some major events like elections, CERT-LV organises media briefs.  Slovakia, since January 2021, supports a monthly cybersecurity addition in the newspaper  Hospodárske noviny. This is an attachment with articles and interviews with professionals from  the National Cybersecurity Centre and relevant institutions.  To conclude, cooperation between the relevant cybersecurity agencies and the media in  Belgium, Czech Republic, Finland, Luxembourg and Slovakia demonstrates ways in which to  maintain constructive connections with the media and enable regular practices that provide  journalists with more relevant and timely information about cybersecurity threats and risks.  28 https://ccb.belgium.be/sites/default/files/ABC_CCB_A5_NL.pdf  29 https://www.mediapooli.fi/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/toimittajan-salausopas.pdf  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  18  3.  REGULAR ASSESSMENTS  OF CYBERSECURITY TRENDS  AND CHALLENGES  In the interview process of this study, we collected information about whether EU Member  States regularly provide their citizens with cybersecurity situational awareness data and  information such as assessments, analyses and reports of the threat environment, aside from  daily cyber threat overviews. We focused on assessments with the purpose of raising citizens’  awareness through analysis of evolving threats and providing practical advice. These  publications help citizens to realise how the malicious use of “bits and bytes” in cyberattacks  can have spill-over effects on everyday life.  Traditionally, cybersecurity threat information products are technical in nature, for example, the  information about vulnerabilities in certain ICT products is typically published on the information  channels of the CERT/CSIRT teams.30 Such information prepared for expert groups is not  intended for and remains incomprehensible for the wider, non-technical audiences such as the  general public or managers of organisations. Therefore, it is important that the national cyber  authorities seek to address the wider public as their audience as well.  Desk research, analysis of surveys and interviews revealed the following good practices based  on selected EU Member States:  The Czech National Cyber and Information Security Agency publishes annual reports on the  state of cybersecurity and publishes the trends of the previous year, based on the information  provided by around 200 critical infrastructure institutions.31 It also shares cybersecurity warnings  and recommendations for the general public, such as protecting home devices during the  COVID-19 pandemic.  The Estonian Information Systems Authority publishes monthly, quarterly and annual  cybersecurity assessments.32 The publication of the annual report is always a media event and  news is generated in various media channels based on the report. In addition, the Information  Systems Authority publishes threat alerts intended for the general public and security guidelines  and advisories for both experts and end users. The Estonian Internal Security Service and  Foreign Intelligence Service both publish annual assessments that have a separate chapter on  cybersecurity covering the intelligence angle of cyber threats.  The Finnish Transport and Communications Agency National Cybersecurity Centre publishes a  monthly Cyber Weather report33 along with an annual report. The Cyber Weather report  provides an update on the key information security incidents and phenomena of the month. This  is an overview of cybersecurity trends and cyber incidents in the past month. The Cyber  Weather news items are assigned one of three categories: calm, worrying or serious. The report  is divided into sections about data breaches and leaks, scams and phishing, malware and  vulnerabilities, automation, network performance and spying. When relevant, the Transport and  30 For example, see https://www.cert.europa.eu/cert/filteredition/en/CERT-LatestNews.html  31 https://www.nukib.cz/en/infoservis-en/publications-reports/  32 https://www.ria.ee/en/information-system-authority/publications.html  33 https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/ncsc-news/cyber-weather  1 Please use footnotes for providing additional or explanatory information and/or relevant links.

Use only the function References/Insert Footnote  https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/ncsc-news/cyber-weather  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  19  Communications Agency National Cybersecurity Centre also issues urgent security alerts and  vulnerability notifications that draw the attention of citizens.  The Federal Office for Information Security in Germany annually publishes “The state of IT  security in Germany”, usually in autumn.34 It contains information about cyber threats  concerning general users, however, the key focus is on enterprises and the government. The  Citizen Awareness Unit in the Federal Office for Information Security uses this report to extract  information which is of special interest to general users and translates it to a more illustrative  and easy-to-understand communication style. For example, they may use a series of  infographics to summarise the most important cybersecurity threats for general users (like  phishing, ransomware etc.).35 In addition, the Federal Office publishes guidelines and various  technical papers on a variety of cybersecurity topics throughout the year. In 2020, for example,  they issued several guidelines related to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as recommendations  for a secure home office and secure online shopping. Focus topics also included strong  passwords and two-factor authentication to appropriately protect important data stored in online  accounts.  Ireland’s Department of Environment, Climate and Communications in 2020 issued via their  website over 30 advisories about ransomware attacks on the healthcare sector.  Latvia’s CERT.LV provides public reports annually and quarterly, as well as monthly statistics  on their web page. Following the Finnish example, once a month, the Latvian national CERT  publishes a detailed cyber weather report about past cyber incidents in Latvia on social media.  This has been going on for over a year and it has become very popular. Some people comment  that this is the only weather forecast they read. The Cyber Weather report is divided into five  segments: scams and phishing, malware and vulnerabilities, IoT, data breaches and data leaks,  and network performance. If everything is fine, the weather is sunny, if there are a few incidents  – it is raining, and if there are a lot of incidents or big financial losses – it is a thunderstorm.  In the Netherlands, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) actively publishes high quality  regular assessments, such as the Cyber Security Assessment Netherlands compiled in  collaboration with the National Coordinator for Security and Counterterrorism. The Cyber  Security Assessment Netherlands 2021 provides insight into threats, interests and resilience in  relation to cyber security and the effect these factors have on national security.36 To increase  the digital resilience of companies and organisations, the NCSC has also written the Guide to  Cyber Security Measures,37 which lists eight measures every organisation should take to help  counter cyberattacks. Examples of these measures are logging of server data, implementing a  password policy, making backups and encrypting information.  In Norway, NorSIS has a particular emphasis on collecting, organising, and disseminating  knowledge about cybersecurity information that matters to the target audience. They publish a  threat report once a year, targeted at SMBs, at the request of the Ministry of Justice and public  Security. They also conduct an annual survey on the state of cybersecurity culture within the  population. The main target group for NorSIS is private and public sector organisations. Their  activities are targeted at small and medium-sized private enterprises, local government  authorities and the general public. Also, the Military Intelligence Service and the Norwegian  Cyber Security Centre publish annual reports that give overviews of various threat scenarios,  including cyber space.  34 https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Service-Navi/Publications/SecuritySituation/SecuritySituation_node.html  35 https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/Verbraucherinnen-und-Verbraucher/verbraucherinnen-und-verbraucher_node.html  36 https://english.ncsc.nl/; https://english.ncsc.nl/topics/cybersecurity-assessment-netherlands  37 https://english.ncsc.nl/topics/cybersecurity-assessment-netherlands/documents/publications/2021/august/4/guide-to- cyber-security-measures  1 Please use footnotes for providing additional or explanatory information and/or relevant links.

The Dyzurnet.pl team is a point of  contact that has been functioning within the framework of the National Research Institute since  2005. The team responds to anonymous reports received from Internet users about potentially  illegal material, mainly related to sexual abuse of children. Additionally, information about cyber  threats, expert analyses, and recommendations are also published on the governmental web-  portal managed by the Cybersecurity Department of the Chancellery of the Prime Minister.40  In Romania, the National Cyber Security Directorate provides cybersecurity bulletins weekly,  and an annual report about its comprehensive cybersecurity activity.  The Slovakian National Cybersecurity Centre SK-CERT provides cybersecurity bulletins once a  week and security warnings on ad-hoc basis. Once a year they provide an annual cybersecurity  report.  In Slovenia, the Government Information Security Office twice a year prepares reports on cyber  incidents and attacks, and the national SI-CERT prepares annual reports on cybersecurity.  Based on the threat environment, SI-CERT also publishes regular updates on cybersecurity  threats and prepares awareness-raising materials.  Finally, providing regular analysis and reports of the threat environment is an important step  towards higher cybersecurity awareness. Regular publication of cybersecurity trends and  challenges is important because it promotes public discussion about the possible impact  cyberattacks can have not only on the particular information systems targeted, but also on  national security as a whole.  Regular and accessible assessments also help citizens to realise how each person can  contribute to a better protected cyberspace. Effective cybersecurity can only be achieved via a  comprehensive approach – an effort that requires a contribution from everyone.  Rendering information about cybersecurity trends and challenges accessible and  comprehensible to a non-technical audience enables outreach to wider audiences, including the  general public and decision-makers and decision-shapers at political, organisational and  societal levels.  38 https://en.nask.pl/eng/reports/reports/3835,CERT-2019-Report-PL.html  39 https://en.dyzurnet.pl/publications  40 https://www.gov.pl/web/baza-wiedzy/aktualnosci  Regular publication of  cybersecurity trends  and challenges is  important because it  promotes public  discussion about the  possible impact  cyberattacks can  have not only on the  particular information  systems targeted, but  also on national  security as a whole.  https://en.dyzurnet.pl/publications  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  21  4. MEASURING  CYBERSECURITY  BEHAVIOUR  Organisations cannot control their data, but they can control what they care about, meaning  what kind of data they care to measure. Good data scientists know that analysing data is the  easy part. The key is deciding what data matters.  Gathering data and statistics from public surveys and establishing metrics about the  cybersecurity behavioural aspects is a crucial part of successful awareness raising. Quantitative  measurement of cybersecurity provides background on cybersecurity thinking and behavioural  patterns of people, which gives important guidance for awareness raising activities, in particular  during the preparation phase of cybersecurity awareness campaigns.  The lack of common practice for measurement methodology presents us with uncertainties  regarding what the relevant indicators for cybersecurity culture really are. Motivation to establish  metrics for cybersecurity culture includes providing solid comprehension on how the population  relates to the inevitable digitalisation of their society. General information on how citizens  perceive digital risks, their attitudes and knowledge can help to provide better direction for  choosing measures for protecting the digital environment.  The EU regularly measures the attitudes of Europeans regarding cybersecurity, culminating in a  Special Eurobarometer survey conducted to understand the awareness of its citizens, and their  respective experiences and perceptions of cybersecurity. It brings together the results of the  public opinion surveys regarding cybersecurity in the 27 European Union Member States.  National agencies responsible for cybersecurity awareness raising should use public polls and  work in close cooperation with national statistics offices to identify, understand and incorporate  the opinions of the wide target audience. Collecting relevant data provides an opportunity to get  to know the target group and this helps in deciding what kind of information the target audience  needs to improve their skills and knowledge about cybersecurity. It is also useful to analyse  cyber incident data to better understand what societal groups have been hurt the most and  subsequently analyse what are the best risk mitigation measures.  Desk research, analysis of surveys and interviews revealed the following good practices based  on selected EU Member States:  Belgium Safeonweb.be includes a Digital Health Index41 which is a quick test to determine  whether the respondent’s digital health needs a boost. The index consists of 15 questions  concerning software updates, data back-ups, attacks like phishing, the proper of use anti-virus  software and passwords.  CERT-Croatia admits that more time and funding is needed for good quantitative research.  While they do not conduct surveys, they use other available data, such as the EU kids online  41 https://www.safeonweb.be/en/digital-health-index  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  22  survey and data from member institutions of the national research and education network of  Croatia.  The Czech National Cyber and Information Security and Agency realised during the analysis  process that they lacked statistical data for the analytical part of the awareness raising plan and  initiated close cooperation with the Statistics Office in 2021.  The Estonian State Information Authority acknowledges that using polls is challenging but  extremely useful. The authority uses data from Statistics Estonia, as well as from  Eurobarometer. It highly values its cooperation with Statistics Estonia. Following the example of  Eurobarometer, the two authorities cooperate and some cybersecurity-related questions have  been added to the annual questionnaire of Statistics Estonia, such as what people do online to  ensure cybersecurity (using stronger passwords, using different passwords for different  websites, cautiously check emails with attachments etc.) In short, Estonia successfully  optimised their efforts to be relevant to target audiences via identification of the main areas that  need attention through data gathering from Eurobarometer and Statistics Estonia.  Since November 2020, the Finnish Digital Agency has a personnel barometer for digital  security42 that consists of questions related to competence and training of digital services /  devices from a security perspective, as well as inquiries about what people fear online and what  kind of threats people regard as significant. The barometer measures people’s trust in their own  organisation, public administration and/or private companies to securely handle their data,  including personal data. It also asks about the impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the  work and leisure time of the respondents. Finland also conducts regular organisational polls  regarding information security. During 2017–2018, more than 100 organisations and more than  20,000 persons answered over 40 questions regarding training, competence and the threat  landscape. The survey will be repeated again in 2022.  In Germany, the unit for citizen awareness of the Federal Office for Information Security in  cooperation with the police conducts an annual Digitalbarometer43 survey with 2000 participants  covering qualitative and quantitative aspects of cybersecurity looking at four areas: behavioural  aspects on acquiring information about IT security; personal experience with cybercrime; brand  knowledge of the Federal Office for Information Security; and an annual focus topic (previous  examples include phishing and home office security). Based on the data from this survey in  2019, BSI expanded their materials on emergency cases. For example, they created leaflets  with explanations of what to do in an emergency situation, if a person becomes a victim of  fraud, for example.  Another study on cybersecurity behaviour in Germany is the “DIVSI Milieu Study on Trust and  Security on the Internet” conducted in 2018 by an independent institute.44 The study focuses on  how people in Germany relate to risks in cyberspace. The central findings of the study form a  very broad basis that can be used to identify measures designed to enhance trust and security  on the Internet. The study concluded that people’s behaviour on the Internet and their attitudes  toward trust and security can be divided into seven user types based on their security  awareness and usage of information technology (self-assessment). Whereas one user type is  more likely to be interested in entertainment topics, another user type is interested in news. This  made it possible to position the cybersecurity awareness campaigns accordingly to reach each  user type in their habitat.  Latvia does not use broad public surveys on regular basis but has used polls before the launch  of national cybersecurity campaigns to set the baseline. Polling before the campaign has been  42 https://dvv.fi/-/digiturvabarometri-2-2021  43 https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/Digitalbarometer/Digitalbarometer-ProPK-BSI_2020.html  44 https://www.divsi.de/projekte/unterthemen/milieus/index.html ; https://www.divsi.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DIVSI- U25-Studie-euphorie.pdf.  https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/Digitalbarometer/Digitalbarometer-ProPK-BSI_2020.html https://www.divsi.de/projekte/unterthemen/milieus/index.html https://www.divsi.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DIVSI-U25-Studie-euphorie.pdf https://www.divsi.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DIVSI-U25-Studie-euphorie.pdf  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  23  conducted by a marketing agency as part of the campaign, using questions developed by  CERT-LV, such as “Have you been a victim of cybercrime?”, “How often do you use a  computer?. After the campaign the questions were “Have you seen the ads?”, “Where did you  see the ads?”, “Did you like them?. Alternatively, several interagency meetings were organised  before a campaign with key public and private cybersecurity players, where statistics and  information were shared with the goal to identify causes and potential solutions. One lesson  learnt is the need to measure the change in people’s behaviour, not only whether people have  seen the ads. This is challenging, as the effect is not immediate and behavioural changes can  take years to be established.  Luxembourg is currently evaluating the opportunity to implement a more systematic approach  to evaluating cybersecurity awareness raising requirements and monitoring the effects of  awareness raising campaigns in the context of their most recent NCSS.  In Norway, NorSIS publishes an annual survey about cybersecurity45 where they include a wide  variety of indicators in order to explore them further in the analysis of the data collected. Norway  conducted a comprehensive pilot study in 2015 based on questions seeking to find out, “What  characterises the Norwegian cybersecurity culture?”, “To what degree does cybersecurity  education influence the Norwegian population’s cybersecurity behaviour or awareness?”, “How  does the Norwegian population relate and react to cyber risks?”, “To what degree does the  individual take responsibility for the safety and security of the cyberspace?”.  As a result of the study46, NorSIS found a strong correlation between an interest in technology  and cybersecurity practices. The study concluded that the Norwegian government should take  greater responsibility for cybersecurity education, especially for the young, the old and the  unemployed. Another survey in 2017 discovered that young people did not get enough  organised lessons on cybersecurity compared to employed people. Therefore, based on  capability gaps revealed by the same study, NorSIS prepared materials for students, parents  and teachers and marketed them in collaboration with a local county, the Directorate of  Education and Training and other partners. NorSIS promotes these resources whenever  thematically relevant, for example, on Safer Internet Day.  In Poland, the Minister of Digital Affairs together with the National Research Institute regularly  conducts a quantitative survey called “Monitoring the results of the campaigns for the  dissemination of the benefits of using digital technologies”. The survey covers selected aspects  of cybersecurity and awareness of various types of threats but also studies which security  measures are used by citizens on the Internet. The survey was conducted in 2018 and 2020  and will be held again in 2022. Results from the survey are used to plan communication  activities in campaigns. In addition, all available sources of information such as police, CSIRT  statistics and research carried out by private or public organisations have been considered  when planning the awareness campaigns.  Romania currently does not have a system of metrics and, thus, measures, the activity on the  social media of the National Cyber Security Directorate (DNSC). They are engaged in a  program of improving their management that is supported by the EU funds. One of the topics in  this program is measuring the satisfaction of people using their services. Thus, there are plans  to prepare feedback questionnaires for individuals, private enterprises and public agencies in  the near future.  In Slovakia, national SK-CERT prepares different statistics and reports for its partners as well  as the for the public. These are constantly supplemented and expanded as SK-CERT’s  information resources grow. Three basic groups of statistics are currently being prepared: an  45 https://norsis.no/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/The-Norwegian-Cybersecurity-culture-web.pdf  46 Ibid.  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  24  overview of detected events (events, alarms) and resolved incidents over time; automatically  generated statistics on various areas of the primarily Slovak Internet (Slovak IP address range);  and ad-hoc reports and statistics. Some of these statistics are published in the Annual report on  Cyber Security in the Slovak Republic.  The Slovenian SI-CERT and the Government Information Security Office are planning public  awareness campaigns based on incident data from the national CERT and data from the  Statistics Office published once a year. For example, in 2019 in Slovenia many people were  targeted with love scams from Africa with the scammers pretending to be soldiers on a mission.  SI-CERT designed a targeted media campaign, after which the number of incidents declined.  Another example demonstrates how in 2020, e-commerce grew due to the pandemic, along  with an increase in scams in this field. SI-CERT ran a campaign on e-commerce scams and  later a campaign about scams related to cryptocurrencies. The campaigns were based on  incident data and established an understanding of the threat landscape.  In Sweden, the Civil Contingencies Agency has since 2019 been conducting surveys about  people’s cybersecurity competencies. Annual surveys enable them to compare behavioural  patterns. In 2020, the survey included additional questions about the COVID-19 situation, but  the main part of it remained unchanged.  In conclusion, collecting quantitative data on cybersecurity behaviour (including via public  surveys and statistics) across the whole of society provides useful and necessary insight for  planning more targeted and effective awareness raising activities, thus facilitating more  successful outcomes.  Existing regular public opinion surveys such as the Eurobarometer can serve as a useful  starting point for nations striving to connect data with awareness raising activities. In addition to  data from Eurobarometer, drawing on systematically collected aggregate data from national  CERTs and the law enforcement agencies about cyber incidents and cybercrimes can highlight  trends and be used to build situational awareness. That data, in turn, helps to identify and tailor  the awareness campaigns.  An important success factor in raising citizens’ awareness is to connect the operational and  societal perspectives of awareness raising. The best way to combine those perspectives is to  make the governmental entities that are responsible for the operational perspective also  responsible for raising cybersecurity awareness, such as has been done in the case of the  Federal Office for Information Security in Germany, the Information System Authority in Estonia  or the Centre for Information Security in Norway.  Using public polls and fostering close cooperation with national statistics offices helps to better  identify, understand and reach specific target audiences.  Using public polls  and fostering close  cooperation with  national statistics  offices helps to better  identify, understand  and reach specific  target audiences.  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  25  5. PLANNING FOR  CYBERSECURITY  AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS  To identify good practices for planning cybersecurity awareness campaigns, we studied the  following questions:  • What are the best ways to reach target audiences?  • What were the goals and objectives that these cybersecurity awareness  campaigns aspired to achieve?  • How did they identify target audiences?  • What were the specific topics covered by the campaigns?  • How did they connect the messages to the target groups?  5.1 MAIN CHALLENGES AND LESSONS LEARNT ABOUT EFFECTIVE  CAMPAIGNING  Changing people’s attitude takes time so it is important to have strategic patience. It is useful to  keep in mind that it took ten years to make people use seatbelts in cars. Cybersecurity  awareness campaigns also require a careful balance to both highlight threats that are present in  cyberspace, while at the same time establishing capacity to keep personal data safe and  maintain trust in digital services.  It is important to identify all target groups to ensure no-one gets left behind. Some target  groups, however, may be notoriously difficult to reach, such as the elderly, as well as people  with lower education and socioeconomic wellbeing. Regarding finding the right ways to  approach various audiences in the general public, Member States underline the significance of  using a variety of different channels, such as games, videos, seminars and social media. Note  that to effectively engage with users on various social media platforms such as Facebook,  Twitter and Instagram may require further knowledge about content creation.  Moreover, lack of resources remains a challenge. There should be a whole-society approach  towards cybersecurity, but often, there are not enough resources to address every group, which  limits the scope of outreach. To overcome the problem, attempts to cooperate with different  entities who are willing to help amplify the cybersecurity awareness raising content in their  communities can be helpful.  Throughout the campaign, Member States underline the usefulness of defining key performance  indicators, as well as conducting market research before and during each media campaign to  measure the marketing effectiveness. In addition, regular monitoring reports show the  development of the campaign effects online and in social media networks.  It is worth noting that Member States generally recognise the usefulness of the European  Cybersecurity Month as an amplifier of cybersecurity awareness activities.  Desk research, analysis of surveys and interviews revealed the following good practice  regarding planning awareness campaigns from select EU Member States:  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  26  The Centre for Cybersecurity in Belgium organises tenders for a three-year contract period to  guarantee continuity in creative concept and visual style. The On Safe on Web website Belgium  gathers links to commonly used websites like Facebook and Amazon that redirect users to the  pages on those sites where people can set up the two-factor authentication. Before the COVID-  19 pandemic, a federal awareness raising truck drove around the country to meet people in  small towns. These meetings revealed that some people knew shockingly little about  cybersecurity. In order to reach the widest audience, the Safe on Web website is intentionally  kept simple.  Croatia links awareness activities outside campaigns to a particular day, for example: Safer  Internet Day, Password Day, Consumer Rights Day, or Data Protection Day. When developing  a communication strategy and the creative concept of the campaign, the goal was not to create  fear, but rather to try to impact the way people think and behave. The message “Think how you  use personal data on the Internet” was based on the profile of an average overly confident and  naïve user who does not care too much about online safety. This is where the name “Great  Croatian Naives” comes from. Seven profiles of cybercrime victims were created with central  topics including safe passwords, phishing sites, personal data, scams, ID theft etc.  The Czech Republic developed mandatory courses addressing cybersecurity threats for civil  servants for the 2022 EU Council Presidency of the Czech Republic. These courses can be  adjusted for other sectors such as healthcare, police, education and other civil servants. A  special outreach was organised for the elderly based on a study of 500 senior people, which  illustrated their online activity. Under the cybersecurity Framework Educational Program, Czech  schools organised cybersecurity campaigns promoting the topic among high-school students  and their teachers.  Estonia’s Information System Authority admits that finding resources for conducting polls is  challenging. When running a campaign and organising a procurement for partners, the Estonian  authority asks a procurement partner to conduct either quantitative or qualitative research about  a particular target group. For example, when organising a campaign for the elderly, the  procurement partner conducted an online poll asking how citizens behaved online and  discovered that people under 55 were much more aware of best practices for secure online  behaviour than those over 55. The discovery resulted in the 2019 campaign focusing on the  elderly. In 2020, the data from Statistics Estonia showed that 2–3% of enterprises experienced  cyber incidents, but small and medium-sized businesses did not know how to deal with them,  because of their insufficient IT and information security practices. An awareness campaign for  small and medium enterprises followed. During that campaign, prior work with a focus group of  Russian and Estonian speaking entrepreneurs revealed that knowledge about how to deal with  insider threats was essential for entrepreneurs.  In Finland, a recent campaign focus has been on new kinds of threats related to the use of  social media services and fraud phone calls, SMSs, email messages and web-services. In  2020, in a spontaneous pop-up campaign mode, a cybersecurity expert from the Digital and  Population Data Services Agency (DVV) recorded a Microsoft technical scam call and exposed  it on his personal LinkedIn and Twitter pages. Within a few days, the recorded scam call  became one of the major news items and an estimated 1.5 to 2 million people learnt about it.  Another occasion that attracted media attention was the March 2021 Facebook data breach  which exposed the data of 1.2 million Finnish users. Over one million people learnt about the  event. A combination of social media and traditional media seems to be the best way to get the  attention of the Finnish public. Unfortunately, mostly negative news attracts the media attention.  Germany selected five topics after an analysis of the publicly assessable studies, surveys and  reports. The main framing campaign (published in March 2021) started raising awareness of five  main topics in general: Home Office, Smart Home (Smart TV), Social Media, Gaming, and  Online-Shopping. Each advertisement shows the main message to the audience in a hashtag  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  27  slogan format (e.g. #einfachaBSIchern “#simplysecured”) and is linked to the Federal Office for  Information Security (BSI) website. Each topic has its own teaser page to allow people who are  more interested to look for further information.  Ireland is working on developing national curriculum courses for children between the ages of  12 and 15, such as a computer science course, coding and digital media literacy. One of the  three key aspects is cybersecurity hygiene. The goal is to attract young people from both  genders and from diverse social backgrounds with the goal of encouraging them to study more  science, technology, engineering and mathematics.  Italy launched an awareness campaign about ransomware targeting CISOs and IT  administrators and consisting of guidelines detailing mitigation measures and in-depth analysis  about ransomware attacks: Netwalker and Egregor. Furthermore, during the cybersecurity  attacks related to Solarwinds and Microsoft Exchange, the Italian National CyberSecurity Cell  (NCSC) and the CSIRT Italia launched a specific awareness campaign on their website, as well  as set in motion point-to-point alerts containing updates, mitigations and best practices for the  users of Facebook, Microsoft and Solarwinds. More recently, as a consequence of ransomware  attacks, the CSIRT Italia published additional guidance and published a dedicated section on  their website containing all the relevant documentation.  In Norway, one of the largest campaigns was prepared in parallel to drafting the NCSS, when a  group with experts from both the public and private sector brainstormed to come up with the ten  most important basic pieces advice about cybersecurity to give all companies in Norway. A  recent survey has shown the advice had a large impact on the audiences that received it.  The government in Poland, to counter the problem of kids’ online abuse and YouTube showing  highly violent content, swearing, heavy drinking and other inappropriate behaviour to children,  produced a campaign for parents titled “Do Not Lose Your Child Online”. They launched it  before a summer vacation, because it was noted that during the summer holidays, kids were  often left alone to browse in the net. The government also alerted parents about the  inappropriate type of content and encouraged them to use solutions from Google and Microsoft  for parental controls. A dedicated guide to be “Be Safe on Social Media” was published which  gave details of how to configure security settings to help keep children safe. Another campaign  for kids in Poland was “Be From a Different Fairy Tale” which targeted toddlers going to primary  school with their first tablets and consisted of customised movies related to fairy tales like  Frozen, Red Hat, Gold Fish along with messages and movies for parents teaching them to  introduce the content to their kids.  Portugal had a campaign for raising the cybersecurity awareness of girls. It was meant to  reduce the gender gap in cybersecurity awareness and to motivate girls to study that field. It  was hard to find the best approach to reach these women and girls. In the future, Instagram  could be a possible channel. Underlining specific content for awareness and training, like  password use, available contacts after a cyberattack, and ICT security policies in organisations  works better than promoting fear and highlighting risks. Via feedback from quality assessment  surveys after training if was found that citizens were eager to have more technical and practical  knowledge about cybersecurity.47  In Romania, the most recent outstanding campaign from 2021 was the National Antifraud  Campaign, organised by the National Cyber Security Directorate (DNSC) in collaboration with  the Romanian Police and the Romanian National Banks Association. It involved a mock attack  and explaining to regular users how the attacks work and how to avoid them. It was targeted  47 For a list for of cybersecurity awareness campaigns in Portugal, see https://www.cncs.gov.pt/docs/relatorio- sociedade2020-observatoriociberseguranca-cncs-1.pdf, p. 106.  https://www.gov.pl/web/niezagubdzieckawsieci/ https://www.gov.pl/web/cyfryzacja/bezpieczni-w-mediach-spolecznosciowych--praktyczne-wskazowki https://www.gov.pl/web/badz-z-innej-bajki https://www.cncs.gov.pt/docs/relatorio-sociedade2020-observatoriociberseguranca-cncs-1.pdf https://www.cncs.gov.pt/docs/relatorio-sociedade2020-observatoriociberseguranca-cncs-1.pdf  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  28  towards all credit cards users, because the DNSC observes a lot of criminal activities related to  extracting money from credit cards.  In Slovakia, the Cyber Security Competence and Certification Centre is responsible for  organising training, educational events and security awareness campaigns. The Competence  Centre, together with SK-CERT and the NSA, participates in the preparation of events aimed at  raising awareness in the cybersecurity space. Such events include the ITAPA, a large  conference on digitisation and new technologies, the annual GLOBSEC security conference etc.  In conclusion, to achieve successful cybersecurity awareness campaigns, public communication  and marketing experts should be involved for appropriate message framing. Message framing is  the strategy for communicating a complex societal problem in such a way that the main  arguments are clearly understandable and cannot be easily challenged.  The EU-wide practice of organising campaigns during the European Cybersecurity month of  October is a good practice but it is not sufficient. The awareness raising activities and  campaigns to engage EU residents should be carried out throughout the year.  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  29  6. RECOMMENDATIONS  This report proposes recommendations to increase the effectiveness of national awareness  raising activities, based on the research of existing NCSS, and from information provided by  identified stakeholders who were interviewed for this study. This report provides good practices,  challenges, lessons learnt and a set of recommendations for further improvement.  The recommendations are divided into four areas:  1. building capacities for cybersecurity awareness,  2. regular assessments of cybersecurity trends and challenges,  3. measuring cybersecurity behaviour, and  4. planning for cybersecurity awareness campaigns.  6.1 BUILDING CAPACITIES FOR CYBERSECURITY AWARENESS  • Develop within the NCSS a clear vision for national cybersecurity awareness raising,  assigning clear roles and responsibilities to the different stakeholders involved. This will help  in developing further national cybersecurity capacities and establish a better outlook on the  topic.  • Develop specified concrete measures, tasks, and deliverables to address the objective of  society’s cybersecurity awareness within the implementation plan of the NCSS. This will  help to establish a firmer foundation to achieve success in raising awareness.  • Back the mission and mandate of the entities involved in the building of cybersecurity  awareness with legal acts, where possible. This will help in justifying actions and addressing  any practical details that might be vague and unclear.  • Consider assigning the central coordination role for awareness raising activities to a single  institution. This can be helpful, however, there are also some successful exceptions that  represent a horizontal spread of tasks. It can be concluded that ensuring accountability and  progress requires that all parties involved should have a clear understanding of their  respective roles and responsibilities, which can be more straightforward to achieve with  central coordination but does not exclude horizontal governance models.  • Engage public and private actors together in awareness raising activities both at a national  and regional level to ensure synergistic actions in all areas: legal, organisational, technical  and educational, as well as cooperation between public administration and the private  sector. This can help to achieve efficient cybersecurity awareness raising campaigns.  • Cover awareness-raising objectives by financing. This is an important factor for the  successful implementation of public awareness activities. Sufficient, consistent and  continuous funding provides the foundations for an effective national cybersecurity posture.  6.2 REGULAR ASSESSMENTS OF CYBERSECURITY TRENDS AND  CHALLENGES  • Provide regular analysis and reports of the threat environment. This is an important step  towards higher awareness. Regular analysis and reports aim to inform citizens and ICT  experts, decision-makers and society in general, to create cybersecurity awareness. They  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  30  promote common understanding of threats and foster the concept of cybersecurity being a  joint contribution, requiring efforts at state, organisational and individual level.  • ender information about cybersecurity trends and challenges that will be accessible and  comprehensible to a non-technical audience. This will enable outreach to wider audiences  including decision-makers and decision-shapers at political, organisational and societal  levels.  6.3 MEASURING CYBERSECURITY BEHAVIOUR  • Collect quantitative data across the whole of society on cybersecurity behaviour.  Quantitative measurement of cybersecurity provides background on the cybersecurity  thinking and behavioural patterns of people. This gives important guidance for awareness  raising activities. Public surveys and statistics can provide useful and necessary insights for  planning more targeted and effective awareness raising activities facilitating successful  outcomes.  • Utilise existing regular EU-wide public opinion cybersecurity surveys, such as the  Eurobarometer, as a helpful starting point for nations striving to connect data with  awareness raising activities. Eurobarometer is the polling instrument used by EU institutions  and agencies to regularly monitor the state of public opinion in Europe on attitudes on  subjects of political or social nature. The aim of the Eurobarometer is to provide quality and  relevant data for experts in public opinion and the general public alike. Eurobarometer data  on cybersecurity reveals what concerns Europeans have about internet interactions. It  uncovers whether concern about security issues has made people change the way they use  the Internet. The combination of the wide range of topics covered, the regularity of  publications and the geographical coverage makes the Eurobarometer a unique source of  knowledge about what Europeans think.  • Draw on systematically collected aggregated data from national CERTs and law  enforcement agencies about cyber incidents and cybercrimes to help identify trends and to  build situational awareness. That data, in turn, helps to better understand which specific  societal groups have been hurt the most and subsequently determine the best risk mitigation  measures to use. It also helps to target and tailor the awareness campaigns.  • Use public polls and foster close cooperation with national statistics offices to better identify,  understand and reach target audiences. Understanding how people perceive risks is critical  to create effective awareness campaigns. Collecting relevant data provides a basis to get to  know the target group and decide what kind of information the target audience needs to  improve their skills and knowledge about cybersecurity.  6.4 PLANNING FOR CYBERSECURITY AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS  • Involve public communications and marketing experts for appropriate message framing, that  is, in the strategy of communicating a complex societal problem in such a way that the main  arguments are clearly understandable and cannot be easily challenged. Professional  message framing in cybersecurity awareness campaigns helps to build a greater  understanding of cybersecurity communication to address human factors in cybersecurity.  This can assist in creating successful cybersecurity awareness campaigns.  • To release awareness campaigns during the European Cybersecurity month of October, an  EU-wide practice, is a good practice but that alone is not sufficient. The awareness raising  activities and campaigns to engage EU citizens should be carried out throughout the year in  every Member State. This is important as improving information security practices and  promoting a sustainable society requires efforts that extend beyond one month per year.

Greatest challenge(s) relative to cybersecurity awareness:  • Administration (e.g. agreements and MoUs);  • Complex backend of efforts;  • Multilingualism (i.e. campaigns are in four languages: Dutch, French, German and English)  and the difficulty in finding local alliances with Flemish and German speakers.  Main lesson(s) learnt (to be shared with other Member States):  • Have a lot of partners.  • Learn your target audience: what, why and how they behave.  • Encourage people to do something concrete. Campaigns should be practical. “Static” content  is not very efficient.  • Keep your messages simple and positive. Use humour.  • Don’t scare people. Empower them with the tools to be safe online.  • Repeat your messages.  https://ccb.belgium.be/fr https://ccb.belgium.be/sites/default/files/BE_NCSS_fr_0.pdf https://ccb.belgium.be/sites/default/files/BE_NCSS_fr_0.pdf https://statbel.fgov.be/en/news/four-belgian-enterprises-out-five-use-ict-security-measures https://statbel.fgov.be/en/news/four-belgian-enterprises-out-five-use-ict-security-measures https://ccb.belgium.be/fr https://ccb.belgium.be/fr https://cert.be/en/ https://cert.be/en/ https://cert.be/en/ https://safeonweb.be/ https://ccb.belgium.be/en  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  38  B.2 CROATIA  Institution Interviewed: National Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT)  General framework: National Cyber Security Strategy – 2015 (in  Croatian)  Regular cybersecurity assessments published by: National CERT  Existing cybersecurity awareness campaign(s): Great Croatian  Naives  • National campaign “2019 Great Croatian Naives”, possible thanks to  the Connecting Europe Facility funding.  • It used TV, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and web banners were placed on youth portals.  • It presented 30-second movies, which were seen by 44.21% of the population within 1.5  months.

Main lesson(s) learnt (to be shared with other Member States):  • More effort should be put into recruitment campaigns; there is a need for more  cybersecurity experts, as well as lawyers.  • It is important to go out and talk to people.  • There should be a whole-of-society approach to cybersecurity.  B.4 DENMARK  Institution Interviewed: Danish Agency for Digitisation  General framework: Danish Cyber and Information Security  Strategy 2018-2021  Regular cybersecurity assessments published by: The  Centre for Cyber Security (CFCS)  Existing cybersecurity awareness campaign(s):  Industriens Fond Cyber Effort  European Cyber Security Month  • They were coordinated by Sikker Digital (Secure Digital).  • Prior to the big campaign in October, smaller campaigns are  held (in 2021 they focused on ID theft, strong passwords, fraud  in gaming).  • This year, the campaign has been always-on (non-stop for the whole year).  Greatest challenge(s) relative to cybersecurity awareness:  • Budget, you need a huge budget for advertising;  • Cybersecurity is not something that is in people’s minds; they respond to it only if it becomes a  headache.  Main lesson(s) learnt (to be shared with other Member States):  • Use behaviour-engaging content, humour and irony; if you use engaging content people will  remember.  • Using YouTube has been effective.  B.5 ESTONIA  Institution Interviewed: Information System Authority (RIA)  General framework: Cybersecurity Strategy 2019–2022  Metrics on cybersecurity behaviour published by: Statistics Estonia  Regular cybersecurity assessments published by: Information System Authority (RIA)  https://en.digst.dk/media/17189/danish_cyber_and_information_security_strategy_pdf.pdf https://en.digst.dk/media/17189/danish_cyber_and_information_security_strategy_pdf.pdf https://cfcs.dk/en/ https://cfcs.dk/en/ https://industriensfond.dk/en/node/1401 https://sikkerdigital.dk/national-cybersikkerhedsmaaned https://sikkerdigital.dk/ https://www.ria.ee/en.html https://www.mkm.ee/sites/default/files/kyberturvalisuse_strateegia_2022_eng.pdf https://www.stat.ee/en https://www.ria.ee/en.html  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  40  Existing cybersecurity awareness campaign(s):  Ole IT-vaatlik! (Be IT-Conscious!)  • IT is managed by the RIA.  • In the last two years, two large-scale campaigns were implemented; both  campaigns used the same slogan “SecureIT” and they started in September and  lasted until November.  • The 2019 campaign targeted people over 55 years old and their family and  friends; the 2020 campaign targeted micro, small and medium business leaders.  Greatest challenge(s) relative to cybersecurity awareness:  • Finding a consistent stream of budget;  • Identifying target groups.  Main lesson(s) learnt (to be shared with other Member States):  • If things are written in the Strategy, it is easier to get funding for them.  • People who work in sectors other than IT (such as those selling tires or growing food, for  example) need a lot more attention.  • The most important target groups are usually those who are the most difficult to approach,  and you need to go where your target audience is.  B.6 FINLAND  Institution Interviewed: Digital and Population Data Services Agency  General framework: Finland’s Cyber Security Strategy 2019  Regular cybersecurity assessments published by: National Cyber Security Centre  Existing cybersecurity awareness campaign(s):  • In Finland, there is no centralised agency that is responsible for everything related  to cyberspace; and since there is no central organisation for awareness raising,  other public and private organisations are responsible for training and awareness.  • There aren’t many national campaigns, but many smaller activities are going on  simultaneously.  CYBERDI  Huijarit kuriin! (Scammers Disciplined!)  Greatest challenge(s) relative to cybersecurity awareness:  • It is difficult to find the right ways to approach the citizens.  Main lesson(s) learnt (to be shared with other Member States):  • We need to have different voices to reach a wider audience.  • We have to have games, videos, seminars and other different media because different people  like to learn in different ways.  https://itvaatlik.ee/ https://itvaatlik.ee/ https://itvaatlik.ee/ https://turvallisuuskomitea.fi/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kyberturvallisuusstrategia_A4_ENG_WEB_031019.pdf https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/ https://www.jamk.fi/fi/Tutkimus-ja-kehitys/projektit/CYBERDI/etusivu/ https://www.kuluttajaliitto.fi/hankkeet/huijarit-kuriin/  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  41  B.7 FRANCE  General framework: French National Digital Security Strategy – 2015  Regular cybersecurity assessments published by: CERT-FR  Existing cybersecurity awareness campaign(s):  Cybermalveillance  EDUCNUM  B.8 GERMANY  Institution Interviewed: Federal Office for Information Security (BSI)  General framework: Cyber Security Strategy for Germany 2016 (in German)  Metrics on cybersecurity behaviour published by: Federal Statistical Office, DSiN Security  Index 2020  Regular cybersecurity assessments published by: Federal Office for Information Security  (BIS)  Existing cybersecurity awareness campaign(s):  #einfachaBSIchern (#simplysecured)  • It is managed by the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI)  and the Federal Ministry of Interior, Building and Community (BMI).  • It uses a mix of marketing measurements like Out-of-Home, Digital  and Social Media Ads as well as radio ads to increase awareness  about cybersecurity and information for citizens.  • The campaign aims to reach all citizens in Germany, especially the  audience that is generally not at all or very little self-aware of the  importance for self-help and self-protection using digital  appliances.  Greatest challenge(s) relative to cybersecurity awareness:  • Within marketing activities it is difficult to judge the effectiveness of out-of-home and print  advertisements, as it is uncertain how many people really see these ads; also both kind of  advertisements need a high media budget for a nationwide reach.  • Keeping information and messages on complex issues of cybersecurity very easy to  understand for consumers is challenging.  Main lesson(s) learnt (to be shared with other Member States):  • Send positive messages to emphasise that everyone can to improve their cybersecurity skills  with some easy steps. Make a niche topic more interesting with a humorous approach.  • When planning marketing activities:  o Use very short video ads to capture the user’s attention.  o Focus on digital advertisements and plan out-of-home, print and radio ads selectively  according to certain topics or phases of the campaign, to diversify your marketing  approach.  https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2015/10/strategie_nationale_securite_numerique_en.pdf https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/ https://www.cybermalveillance.gouv.fr/ https://www.educnum.fr/ https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Home/home_node.html https://www.bmi.bund.de/cybersicherheitsstrategie/BMI_CyberSicherheitsStrategie.pdf https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html https://www.sicher-im-netz.de/dsin-sicherheitsindex-2020 https://www.sicher-im-netz.de/dsin-sicherheitsindex-2020 https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Home/home_node.html https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Home/home_node.html https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/Kampagne-einfach-absichern/kampagne_node.html  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  42  o Continue to observe the metrics throughout the years to see the development and to  adjust the campaign(s) where necessary.

For example, a ‘working from home’ themed campaign  evolved based on political needs, the interests of the CSIRT, the  competencies of the NCSC.  • There are volunteer groups, private sector interests and private  CSIRTs that attempt to get the message out there.  Webwise.ie  Be Safe Online  • A governmental initiative that aligns and brings together cross-government activities in a  single site.  • It includes a wide range of topics, for example, alerts parents to the problem of child  exploitation, appropriate use of online tools by teenagers, how to effectively secure your  account or personal device, among others.  Greatest challenge(s) relative to cybersecurity awareness:  • Existing scepticism as to whether awareness campaigns are really changing behaviour; it’s a  question about if we should address this through education, through employers or private  advocates.  B.10 ITALY  Institution Interviewed: Presidency of the Council of Ministers49  General framework: National Strategic Framework for Cyberspace Security – 2013, 2017  Cybersecurity Action Plan  Metrics on cybersecurity behaviour: National Institute of Statistics – Cittadini e ICT (Citizens  and ICT) - 2019  49 In August 2021, the National Cybersecurity Agency (NCA) was established in Italy, responsible for the development of a  national cybersecurity culture.  https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation-information/about-the-department-of-the-environment-climate-and-communications/ https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation-information/about-the-department-of-the-environment-climate-and-communications/ https://www.ncsc.gov.ie/pdfs/National_Cyber_Security_Strategy.pdf https://www.cso.ie/en/ https://www.ncsc.gov.ie/about/ https://www.webwise.ie/welcome-to-webwise/us/ https://www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/be-safe-online/ https://www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it/sisr.nsf/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/italian-national-strategic-framework-for-cyberspace-security.pdf https://www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it/sisr.nsf/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Italian-cybersecurity-action-plan-2017.pdf https://www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it/sisr.nsf/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Italian-cybersecurity-action-plan-2017.pdf https://www.istat.it/it/archivio/236920 https://www.istat.it/it/archivio/236920  RAISING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  43  Regular cybersecurity assessments published by: CSIRT Italy, CERT-AGID (CERT of the  Italy Digital Agency)  Existing cybersecurity awareness campaign(s):  Generazioni Connesse (Connected Generations)  Be Aware.

Greatest challenge(s) relative to cybersecurity awareness:  • Defining messages: cyberspace provides a lot of opportunities as well as risks, and a balance  must be found when creating cybersecurity awareness messages.  Main lesson(s) learnt (to be shared with other Member States):  • It is important to create the right message for the audience, and to keep it simple and not go  into too much detail so people can understand the technical concepts.  • It is not enough only to pass on information, it is necessary to get people engaged  emotionally.  B.11 LATVIA  Institution Interviewed: National Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT)  General framework: National Cyber Security Strategy 2019–2022 (in Latvian)  Metrics on cybersecurity behaviour published by: Official Statistics Portal  Regular cybersecurity assessments published by: CERT.LV  Existing cybersecurity awareness campaign(s):  Drošs Internets (Safe Internet)  Mana Drošiba (My Safety)  Neuzķeries!

European Digital Week  • Organised by the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Regional  Development of the Republic of Latvia and Latvian Information and  Communications technology association (LIKTA);  • Targets enterprises and the general public.  Esi reāls (Be real)  • Organised by the Consumer Rights Protection Centre;  • Targets users of social networks.  Greatest challenge(s) relative to cybersecurity awareness:  • How to best address and reach the society;  • How to be a good organiser of an awareness raising campaign.  Main lesson(s) learnt (to be shared with other Member States):  • People are not interested in education about prevention, they respond more to the scary and  dangerous things, i.e. real-time warnings about real threats.  • People may understand the message and like it, but at the same time they may not change  their behaviour, at least not immediately; getting people to behave securely online can also  require a lot of time.  • Our statistics showed that peak interest was during the first week of a campaign; several short  campaigns in different seasons might be preferrable to month-long campaigns.

    "abstract": "This report seeks to assist EU Member States in further building their cybersecurity capacities by analysing best practices on raising citizens’ awareness of cybersecurity. We have collected information and evaluated the intensity, regularity and diversity of different cybersecurity awareness practices and processes in EU Member States. We present ways in which Member States have achieved better cybersecurity awareness in society and have incorporated cybersecurity awareness into their national cybersecurity strategies (NCSS). In addition, we provide recommendations in the following four areas: building capacities for cybersecurity awareness, regular assessments of trends and challenges, measuring cybersecurity behaviour and planning cybersecurity awareness campaigns."

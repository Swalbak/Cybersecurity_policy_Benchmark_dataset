On 13 September 2017 the new cybersecurity package, was announced by President Juncker in his State of  the Union speech. The newly proposed package indicates that political leaders are committed to building  the future wealth of the EU by leveraging the opportunities of the digital society.  In the last few years, there have been many new developments in the cyber world, including the  digitalisation of our daily lives, new technologies, new cyber threats, and new cyber stakeholders.  New technologies are changing the cyber landscape. The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly deployed,  with approximately 20 billion devices expected to be deployed before 2020. Robots, Artificial Intelligence  (A.I.), and Blockchain are emerging as disruptive technologies that are beginning to affect our daily lives.  New technologies bring benefits and challenges as is the case with cryptocurrencies, on which the  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) published a paper earlier this year.  As a result, traditional approaches to security have to be revisited to cope with issues of scalability and  modified timelines.  In current perspective, cybersecurity is becoming an increasing challenge for our societies.  This trend is demonstrated by an increase in monetisation of cybercrime, crime as a service, and of  targeted attacks. There is an increasing awareness that our rights online, including democracy, are at risk,  and of the potential of using cyber space for sabotage, espionage, and warfare.  Without significant improvements to cybersecurity in Europe, the risk of a severe negative impact  continues to increase.  However, cybersecurity also presents an opportunity to promote a new of generation products and  services that incorporate security and privacy by design. It is proposed that this goal will be achieved by:   Strengthening ENISA, the EU Cybersecurity Agency by providing it with additional financial and  human resources that better position the Agency to assist Member States, EU institutions,  businesses, and citizens in achieving a higher level of cybersecurity, and to support effective  implementation of the Network and Information Security Directive (NISD).   Developing an EU cybersecurity certification framework as a voluntary framework that builds on  existing national certification schemes and aims to enhance trust and confidence in the digital  products and devices available on the European market.  The Cybersecurity Act proposed by the Commission presents a chance for the European legislator to  increase IT security based on a voluntary and market-driven approach.  Just to say a few words about the Internet of Things:  The onset of IoT presents several challenges to our contemporary societies. Rapid technological  developments are not matched by proactive regulation, certification, or standardisation. Additionally, IoT  entails a market-driven ecosystem, where functionality and low cost rather than security and safety are  Keynote speech at the Digital Society Conference 2017  Berlin, Germany  |  November 2017  03  seen as the main drivers. I believe this is an explosion waiting to happen and, when it does, end users will  cry about the lack of security and privacy by design  ENISA has provided recommendations on:   Smart homes;   Smart cars and autonomous driving;   Smart hospitals and eHealth;   Smart cities and intelligent public transport;   Smart airports;   Smart grids.  Clearly, there is work to be done.  Standard security techniques and practices need to be reconsidered in light of the IoT due to its inherent  particularities. Additionally, the impact of two fundamental pieces of legislation need to be re-visited in the  light of the extraordinary growth in IoT devises including those deployed in our critical infrastructure.  ENISA has contributed to developing IoT solutions in a number of ways.  For example, ENISA set up an IoT Expert Group that aims at giving initial advice before the end of 2017.  Furthermore, the agency drafted a common position paper on cybersecurity with select semiconductor  industry representatives calling for minimum security requirements for the IoT. ENISA has also been active  in developing baseline security measures for the IoT.  However, several outstanding issues remain.  In particular, it is necessary to address the question of legal liability in the context of the IoT. It is also  important to incorporate cyber security in all stages of the lifecycle of products and services. The NISD and  GDPR have to be implemented and interpreted in the light of the IoT development and deployment. IoT  standardisation and certification of products are currently lagging behind demand.  The consideration of ethics by design is a more recent concept that gains importance as technology is  increasingly deployed at closer proximity to humans.  Artificial Intelligence and Robotics will undoubtedly lead to societal changes of great magnitude across the  spectrum of human activities. The TEU (Treaty on European Union) sets the legal framework for our core  values and principles in Europe. Emerging and disruptive technologies are raising new challenges and there  is a need to interpret existing legislation in the context of these new technologies.  This has special relevance considering that software now needs to be programmed to make the same  decisions as humans have made intuitively for centuries.  An example of a possible difficult decision is how an autonomous driving vehicle would be programmed to  react to a potential head on collision with another vehicle.  Will the vehicle maintain its path or will it  swerve to avoid a collision but potentially putting other road users at risk?  Keynote speech at the Digital Society Conference 2017  Berlin, Germany  |  November 2017  04  These technological developments raise questions about software liability and how liability will be  addressed in this type of situation.  It is of vital importance that security by design, privacy by design, and ethics by design are addressed in the  cyber world of today and tomorrow.  ENISA envisages a new way forward for Europe’s digital society, where the security, as well as the  profitability of European digital products and services are ensured.  The EU institutions, MSs, civil society, and industry – all stakeholders – need to work together to address  cyber challenges and ensure that policies are in place that prepare the European economy to embrace  emerging technologies and benefit from the opportunities they provide.  The world of interconnected objects brings with it many new opportunities but also new risks. It is our job  to maximise opportunities while keeping the risks under control.  As the EU cyber security agency, ENISA will work together with policy makers and industry to ensure that  cybersecurity is an enabler of, and not a barrier to, economic progress.

to further explore the cooperation between computer security incident response  teams (CSIRTs) (in particular national and governmental CSIRTs) and law enforcement (LE) by adding the important  dimension of their interaction with the judiciary (prosecutors and judges).  This report follows two reports that ENISA published in 2017: Tools and methodologies to support cooperation  between CSIRTs and law enforcement (ENISA, 2017), which focused on technical aspects and Improving  cooperation between CSIRTs and law enforcement: Legal and organisational aspects (ENISA, 2017a), which focused  on the legal and organisational issues of cooperation; both are available on the ENISA website.  This report aims to support the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE, as well as their interaction with the judiciary  in their fight against cybercrime, by providing information on the legal, organisational, technical and cultural  aspects, identifying current shortcomings and making recommendations to further enhance cooperation. The  geographical coverage is mainly the EU and European Free Trade Association (EFTA).  The data for this report was collected via desk research, interviews with subject-matter experts and an online  survey. The data showed that CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary are characterised by significant differences in roles and  structure. The kind of information to which CSIRTs and LE have access is different, this is one of the primary  reasons why sharing information between them is paramount to respond to cybercrime. Across Member States  different models/frameworks of interaction exist among the three communities (CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary).  Overall CSIRTs interact more with LE rather than with the judiciary. CSIRTs offer support to LE to collect and  analyse different types of evidence. CSIRTs are rarely called as witnesses in courts but the material they collect  during the incident handling might be used to decide on (cyber) crime cases.  Although the cooperation and interaction across the CSIRT, LE and judiciary communities work well in principle,  there are still some challenges to be faced. In particular, some legal aspects are seen as the biggest challenge with  issues such the diversity of the legal frameworks, data retention, the sharing of personal data (including internet  protocol (IP) addresses) and the confidentiality around criminal investigations as well as evidential admissibility of  digital evidence.  Core recommendations to improve the aspects of the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE and their interaction  with the judiciary are as follows.   ENISA, Europol EC3, the European agency for the enhancement of judicial cooperation (Eurojust) and  the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL): to facilitate joint training across  the three communities (CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary) on aspects of their cooperation among the EU and  EFTA addressing CSIRTs, LE and judiciary needs and engaging with designated CSIRTs in the MS and  national police forces beyond the EU, as appropriate.   National/governmental CSIRTs, LE and possibly prosecutor services: to work together towards a  better mutual understanding of the strengths, needs and limitations of the three communities  in  relation to the sharing information, also by using segregation (or separation) of duties (SoD) matrices.   National/governmental CSIRTs, LE and possibly prosecutor services: to appoint liaison officers to  facilitate the cooperation and the interaction.   National/governmental CSIRTs, LE and possibly prosecutor services: to investigate how the tools they  use can be further improved to better receive the information provided by other communities and to  better formulate their request for information addressed to the other communities.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  09  Introduction  Purpose  As stated in the Council of the European Union Final report on the seventh round of mutual evaluations on ‘The  practical implementation and operation of the European policies on prevention and combating cybercrime’  (Council of the European Union, 2017, p. 67), ‘CSIRTs do not have the powers of an LEA (law-enforcement agency)  vis-à-vis private subjects, but regarding attacks of a criminal nature (not all cyber incidents are criminal acts), have  an important role in supporting the investigations, as they can help to provide information and to secure electronic  evidence (e-evidence). It is therefore very important for this purpose that CSIRTs have a good cooperation with the  LE, as obtaining information and evidence effectively is essential for the investigation of cyber-attacks, considering  that data are very dynamic and can be lost easily’.  Collecting knowledge on current cooperation between CSIRTs and LE communities is a key step to enhance it.  While the 2017 ENISA reports on CSIRT and LE cooperation (ENISA, 2017) (ENISA, 2017a) aimed to better  understand in particular the legal/organisational and technical aspects of the cooperation, the purpose of this  report is to further explore this cooperation by adding the important dimension of their interaction with the  judiciary (prosecutors and judges).  Background of the report  In 2017, ENISA published two complementary reports addressing the cooperation between CSIRT and LE to fight  against cybercrime, one on legal and organisational aspects, the other on technical aspects.  The 2017 ENISA report on Improving cooperation between CSIRTs and law enforcement: Legal and organisational  aspects (ENISA, 2017a) confirmed that CSIRTs and LE often exchange information during the incident  handling/investigations both formally and informally and that trust is the key success factor for the cooperation. It  showed that there are challenges related to the variety of legal systems and legal provisions in the different  Member States; adding further complexity is the diversity of communication channels between the various  Member States that represents an issue for effective crime fighting.  The 2017 ENISA report Tools and methodologies to support cooperation between CSIRTs and law enforcement  (ENISA, 2017) also confirmed that CSIRTs and LE exchange information often during incident  handling/investigations both formally and informally and that trust is also the key success factor for the  cooperation. It highlighted that despite CSIRTs and LE having different objectives and methods for collecting and  processing information, there is, between the two communities, an increased reciprocal understanding of needs.  Furthermore, according to the data collected for that report, CSIRTs are more inclined to use open-source tools  (e.g. the malware information-sharing platform (MISP)) and the information sharing between CSIRTs and LE is  more ad hoc than systematic.  As highlighted in the 6th ENISA/EC3 workshop for national and governmental CSIRTs and their LE counterparts  (The Hague, 16-17 October 2017) (ENISA, 6th ENISA/EC3 Workshop, n.a.), the theme of interaction across CSIRTs,  LE and judiciary (prosecutors and judges) is extremely important. In the context of the fight against (cyber) crime,  indeed, it is not sufficient that evidence is collected, but it is also necessary that it is admissible in a criminal trial.  Compliance with technical and legal requirements is needed for the admissibility of evidence, notably adherence  to the criminal procedure requirements is of paramount importance.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  10  The ENISA programming document 2018-2020 includes ‘Objective 4.2. CSIRT and other NIS community building’.  Under this objective, ‘Output O.4.2.2 — Support the fight against cybercrime and collaboration between CSIRTs  and LEA’ has the goal to ‘to build upon the progress ENISA has made in supporting different operational  communities (e.g. CSIRTs, LE, European [Financial Institutes – Information Sharing and Analysis Centre] FI-ISAC) to  enhance mutually satisfactory ways to collaborate and support exchange of good practices among different  stakeholders in operational communities in Europe’ (ENISA, 2017b, p. 43).  This report is a continuation of previous ENISA work and it contributes to the implementation of the ENISA  programming document 2018-2020, Output O.4.2.2, in particular to what is planned for as ‘Current cooperation  between CSIRT and LEA community and on possible ways to further enhance their cooperation’.  Report objectives and scope  1.3.1 Report objectives  The 2017 ENISA reports on CSIRT and LE cooperation as well as previous ENISA work in the area focused only on  these two communities: CSIRT and LE. The objectives of these past ENISA reports were to analyse how these two  communities cooperate and share information both from the legal/organisational and the technical point of view.  They identify challenges to the cooperation (such as limitations in the availability of specialised personnel) and  propose ways to overcome them (such as to place liaison officers at both ends, to build and maintain a centralised  repository of tools and methodologies and to invest further in joint training).  They gather further knowledge on the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE by also looking at the dimension of how  their interaction with the judiciary helps to reach a better and more complete understanding of the dynamics,  synergies and challenges that characterise their cooperation in the fight against cybercrime.  The main objectives of this report are as follows.   Gather further knowledge and discuss the current (1) cooperation between CSIRTs and LE by adding  the dimension of their interaction with prosecutors and judges as far as it concerns their fight  against cybercrime.   Provide information on the relevant legal and policy framework shaping this cooperation and this  interaction.   Provide information on the information flow across the three communities (CSIRTs and LE and the  judiciary).   Provide information on the tools and methods used for the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE and  their interaction with the judiciary.   Identify current challenges to the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE and their interaction with the  judiciary.   Formulate and propose recommendations to improve the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE and  their interaction with the judiciary.  (1) Data collection cut-off date for this report: 28 August 2018.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  11  1.3.2 Report scope  The report focuses on aspects of cooperation between CSIRTs (national/governmental CSIRTs) and LE, and their  cooperation with the judiciary (prosecutors and judges).  The geographical coverage is limited to the EU (European Union, 2017) and EFTA  (EFTA, n.d.) (2). (See also (ENISA,  2015b)). This does not mean however that all these countries are covered in the report and that no reference to  other countries outside the EU and EFTA is made in the report. Possible specific differences among the EU and  EFTA, or between the EU and the United States, or the EU and Asia, also fall outside the scope of this report.  The report does not target a specific sector; considerations made can apply to cooperation between CSIRTs and  LEs and the interaction with the judiciary to fight against cybercrime (which includes crimes where a computer is  an object and crimes where a computer is a tool of crime) in all sectors (from finance to energy, from transport to  health).  Although some considerations might be made incidentally in this report on the general cooperation between LE  and judiciary, this is not the focus of the report, which looks at such aspect only as far as they are relevant for  reaching a better understanding of the cooperation and interaction between the CSIRTs, LE and judiciary  community to respond to cybercrime.  The fight against terrorism, cyberwarfare, cyber espionage by nation states, as well as the enforcement of rights in  civil and administrative courts, are outside the scope of this report, although some of the considerations  developed might be extended to them.  This report does not aim to present an exhaustive set of instantiations of cooperation between CSIRTs and LEs and  of their interaction with the judiciary, rather it seeks to facilitate the drawing of meaningful conclusions for the  purpose of enhancing such cooperation and interaction.  Target audience  The intended target audience are CSIRTs (mainly national and governmental CSIRTs but not limited to them) LE,  prosecutors, judges, as well as individuals and organisations with an interest in NIS.  Additionally, policy and law makers may benefit from select aspects of analysis as well as the recommendations of  this report, as they prepare policies and legislation for enhancing the cooperation between CSIRTs and LEs and  their interaction with the judiciary.

Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  12  Methodology  The methodology chosen for this report and the way this methodology is presented in this chapter are largely  inspired by Chapter 2 of the 2017 ENISA reports on Improving cooperation between CSIRTs and law enforcement:  Legal and organisational aspects (ENISA, 2017a) and on Tools and methodologies to support cooperation between  CSIRTs and law enforcement (ENISA, 2017).  In keeping with these two 2017 ENISA reports, data for this report was collected by desk research, interviews with  subject-matter experts and an online survey. A qualitative methodological approach has mainly been used due to  the rather new field addressed; however, some quantitative data were also collected: an online survey was  conducted to validate and complement the findings from the desk research and the interviews.  Information collection instruments used  2.1.1 Desk research  A first desk research was conducted based on publicly available information sources, including ENISA publications.  The findings from this desk research were particularly useful for the scoping of the report and for drafting the  questionnaire to support the interviews.  Supplementary desk research was conducted to address certain specific topics that the project team deemed  appropriate to examine in more depth following the analysis of the data collected via the interviews. These  included topics such as the recent discussion on access to the WHOIS database (DB) by LE.  Concerning the legal research, legal material (including some case-law) for instance fundamental principles of  criminal procedure, comparative criminal law and procedure, and European law, was consulted.  2.1.2 Interviews and written replies to the questionnaire  A total of 21 subject-matter experts from 11 Member States replied to the questionnaire either via structured  interviews or with written replies. Of the respondents, nine were experts from the CSIRTs community (mainly but  not exclusively from national/governmental CSIRTs), seven from the LE community (mainly national police but also  one from a local police force), and five from the judiciary community. This is in addition to the respondents of the  online survey.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  13  Figure 1 — Overview of communities of respondents to the interviews conducted for this report  A questionnaire (see Annex E — Samples of questionnaires to support the interviews) was prepared to support the  interviews. Most questions were open. For all questions, including yes/no questions, interviewees could add  comments and additional information.  The interviews included some questions common to CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary, followed by a specific set of  questions for each community.  A pilot phone interview was conducted in June 2018. In addition, the questions were tested with an additional  respondent to verify its suitability to be answered in writing. In addition to data for the report, the two pilot  interviews served as a means to collect feedback on how the interview was received and avoided, for instance,  unclear or inappropriate questions that might have decreased the willingness of the respondents to provide  answers. The pilot interviews were also useful to verify the time to allocate to the interview.  The interviews were carried out from June to mid-July 2018. They were conducted either face-to-face or via phone  and they lasted around 1 hour each. Interviewees received the questions in advance and in most cases, they had  the opportunity to review the notes taken by the interviewers (project team) with their replies and validate them.  Of the 21 respondents, five asked to reply to the questions in writing as this was more convenient for them.  Some interviewees, or representatives of the same organisation of interviewees, also completed the online survey.  While the questionnaire developed to collect data for the 2017 ENISA reports focused only on CSIRT and LE  cooperation, the questionnaire developed to collect data for this 2018 report addresses also their interaction with  the judiciary and aims to collect more in-depth information on some topics, such as joint training.  The interview questions started with a set of common questions for all participants to answer, followed by three  sets of specific questions for CSIRTs, LE or judiciary to answer respectively. In comparison to the interviews  conducted for the 2017 ENISA reports on CSIRTs and LE cooperation, the interviews for this report covered inter  alia the additional dimension of the interaction with the judiciary.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  14  2.1.3 Online survey  An online survey was conducted to collect additional data to validate and further substantiate some findings. It  was composed of 16 questions (see Annex F — Questions in the online survey), all with closed answers and some  with the possibility to add additional comments and provide more details related to the answers.  The survey was developed using  EUSurvey (3), a survey tool which is ‘supported by the European Commission’s ISA  programme, which promotes interoperability solutions for European public administrations’ (European  Commission, n.d.(b)).  The invitation to complete the survey was disseminated as follows.   A closed ENISA mailing list of European national and governmental CSIRTs, which includes around 60  teams.   Via Europol (Europol, n.d.) to the European Union cybercrime task force (EUCTF), which is ‘composed  of the heads of the designated national cybercrime units throughout the EU Member States and  Europol. The EUCTF (4) is an interagency group formed to allow the heads of cybercrime units,  Europol, [the International Criminal Police Commission] Interpol, the European Commission, Eurojust,  Norway, Switzerland and Iceland to discuss the strategic and operational issues related to cybercrime  investigations and prosecutions within the EU and beyond’ (Council of the European Union, 2017b, p.  13).   Via Eurojust (Eurojust, n.d.) to the judicial authorities of the European judicial cybercrime network,  which is composed by ‘at least one national representative of the judicial authorities with appropriate  expertise to participate in the network’ and was set up to ‘provide a centre of specialised expertise  supporting judicial authorities, i.e. prosecutors and judges dealing with cybercrime, cyber-enabled  crime and investigations in cyberspace” (5) (Council of the European Union, 2016, p. 2).  The survey was launched in July 2018 and was open for around 2 weeks. The data collected via the online survey  was used to validate the data collected through the desk research and the interviews and used to produce some  statistical graphs.  A total of 36 replies were received. Of these, 34 were from EU Member States (European Union, 2017) and EFTA  countries (EFTA, n.d.), one from a non-EU/non-EFTA country and one from another organisation. It must be noted  that the two replies from non-EU/EFTA countries were somewhat in line with the other replies received and have  been used to formulate general considerations; however, the graphs in this report were developed based only on  the 34 replies from EU and EFTA respondents, to ensure full consistency with the geographical scope of the report.  Of the 34 EU and EFTA respondents, seven respondents were from the CSIRT community, 17 from the LE  community, one belonged to both of these communities, and nine were from the judiciary (eight prosecutors and  (3)  https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/home/welcome  (4) In execution of the JHA Council conclusions of 27-28 November 2008 and of the 26 April 2010, Europol together with the European Commission and the  EU Member States have set up the European Union cybercrime task force (EUCTF) composed of the Heads of the designated national cybercrime units  throughout the EU Member States and Europol.

An overview of the composition of the EU and EFTA respondents, based on the community they belong  to, is presented hereinafter in Figure 2.  Figure 2 — Overview of communities of respondents to the online survey conducted for this report  Most respondents replied to all questions, despite most questions not being mandatory. Some respondents used  the comment boxes to provide extra information.  Data used to develop the recommendations  The recommendations in this report (see Chapter 5) have been developed based on research findings of this  report.  Selection and classification of the stakeholders  The project team discussed and agreed on criteria to use to ensure contribution of a wide range of stakeholders.  The following criteria (which were not prioritised but considered as equal) were used for the selections of  interviewees:   CSIRTs/LE/judiciary community   geographical location   size of country (population)   level of maturity in CSIRT-LE cooperation   level of CSIRT maturity (6)   size of the CSIRT   common law/civil law legal tradition.  (6) On CSIRT maturity, see (ENISA, n.d.(a)).  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  16  Contribution by subject-matter experts  ENISA selected eight external subject-matter experts from the list of NIS experts compiled following the ENISA CEI  (Ref. ENISA M-CEI-17-T01) (ENISA, n.d.(b)).  Six of them contributed to this report by supporting the data collection and the drafting while two were reviewers.  The two CEI experts contributing as reviewers reviewed this report in several rounds including the first draft in  April 2018, an intermediate draft in June 2018, the semi-final and the final draft in August 2018. They reviewed it  in addition to ENISA reviewers and other external reviewers.  All eight experts contributed ad personam.  These experts contributed inter alia with their expertise in NIS aspects of cybercrime, including but not limited to  CSIRT and law cooperation, operational cooperation, information sharing to handle incidents and to fight against  cybercrime.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  17  CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary: framework, information flow and tools  This chapter gives an overview of select legal provisions which have an influence on the rules governing the  criminal procedures, including the admissibility of digital evidence. This chapter also discusses in detail the roles,  structures and strengths of CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary and explores the current interaction and the information  flow and the tools used.  Some general remarks  Below some preliminary remarks are made related to the context surrounding the cooperation between CSIRTs  and LE and their interaction and information flow with the judiciary.  3.1.1 Criminal procedures: non-adversarial versus adversarial  ‘The Member State judicial systems are very diverse, reflecting differences in national judicial traditions (European  Justice, n.d.(a)) and the legal traditions have an influence on the various areas of law. Concerning criminal  procedural law, a distinction should be made between the non-adversarial system (also called, inquisitorial  system), typical of civil law tradition, and the adversarial system (also called adversary system), typical of common  law countries, (Delmas Marty & Spencer, 2004).  In an adversarial system (or adversary system) a criminal trial is conceived as a conflict or dispute. Each of the  parties supports a contrary position. In these systems the oral evidence is of fundamental importance and the  method of taking such evidence is based on the so-called cross examination. Although there are exceptions, in  such a system the judge does not tend to play an active role in the collection of evidence. The judge must in fact  guarantee respect for fairness and equality and be neutral with respect to the parties. The decisions of the judge  set precedents.  In a non-adversarial system, the criminal trial is not conceived as a conflict or dispute but is instead conceived as  something like an inquiry. In such a system, the judge sometimes has a more active role in the collection of  evidence and can also interview the witnesses.  These differences between non-adversarial system and adversarial systems may influence the shaping of the  relationships between CSIRTs and LE and the judiciary. Furthermore, the value of e-evidence can also change  between the systems.  3.1.2 Criminal proceedings  Since this report deals with the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE and their interaction with the judiciary, the  focus is on criminal proceedings.  As defined above, by criminal proceedings we refer to proceedings aiming to ascertain whether a crime has been  committed and if so, by whom.  Principles and rules governing criminal proceedings are different from those governing civil, administrative,  disciplinary or other proceedings.  The criminal procedure in each country is governed by the relevant legal provisions, in most cases by the criminal  procedure code or similar. While criminal procedure differs dramatically by jurisdiction, in most cases we can  identify common principles and features.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  18  To ascertain whether a crime has been committed and if so, by whom, it is necessary to carry out a criminal  investigation. This is followed, once there are the conditions for it (e.g. sufficient elements to believe that the  suspect committed the crime), by a criminal charge and a formal criminal trial, which can be either non-adversarial  or adversarial in form (based on the legal system, as discussed above). At the trial, the judge (or the jury) finds the  defendant either guilty or not guilty based on the evidence presented by the prosecutor and the defendant. In a  criminal trial the prosecution bears the burden of proof, which means that the prosecutor must prove beyond  reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the crime.  While most criminal cases are decided before national (or regional, or local) courts, under certain conditions it is  possible that the process is held by a supranational court, such as one of the following.   The European Court of Human Rights (European Court of Human Rights, n.d.), which rules on  individual or state applications alleging violations of the rights set out in the European Convention on  Human Rights. It has its seat in Strasbourg, France. For an overview of case-law of the European Court  of Human Rights in the area of human rights and criminal procedures see (McBride, 2018).   The Court of Justice of the European Union (Court of Justice of the European Union, n.d.), which  ensures compliance with EU law and rules on the interpretation and application of the treaties  establishing the European Union. It has its seat in Luxembourg.   The International Court of Justice (International Court of Justice, n.d.), which is a body of the United  Nations based in The Hague, The Netherlands.  The outcome of most criminal law cases depends upon the admissibility and strength of evidence presented by the  prosecution or the defence. The evidence can take many different forms including physical evidence, testimonies,  documents or e-evidence. While the admissibility of evidence is discussed in the following section, on the strength  of the evidence we can say that the rules and practices for determining it differ from one jurisdiction to another,  but in general, the standard of proof is high in criminal proceedings and therefore high-quality evidence is  expected. Therefore, it is desirable (particularly in the case of electronic evidence) to ensure close cooperation  between public prosecutors and experts to ensure that evidence is collected and handled with professional care.  As mentioned in Section 1.5 — Definitions of key concepts, we can, in general, identify two main categories of  cybercrime.   Cybercrimes in the strict sense, are crimes where the computer is the object and they are normally  also committed by means of information technology (IT) tools. This is the case of illegal access to  information system.   Cybercrimes in a broad sense, which are crimes that are committed by using an IT tool but could also  be committed without the use of IT tools, like in cases when data is instrumentalised, e.g. homicide of  a patient by manipulating data related to that patient’s health (i.e. the medical treatment  administered according to the manipulated patient details results in the patient’s death).  Except for cases dealt by a supranational court, normally (cyber) crime cases are decided before national (or  regional, or local) courts.  3.1.3 Admissibility of electronic evidence in criminal courts  As highlighted in Council of the European Union Final report on the seventh round of mutual evaluations on ‘The  practical implementation and operation of the European polices on prevention and combating cybercrime’, the  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  19  ‘nature of e-evidence may create issues regarding admissibility that do not arise with other types of evidence. For  this reason, in some Member States there are specific requirements regarding the collection of e-evidence to be  admissible in courts. However, the evaluation has shown that in most Member States, procedural law is mainly  technology-neutral, which means that general rules and principles on gathering of evidence are applied and that  the procedural system does not contain any specific formal rules on admissibility and assessment of e-evidence’  (Council of the European Union, 2017, p. 11). On the topic of e-evidence in court see for instance the AEEC project  (Admissibility of electronic evidence in court (AEEC) project, 2006), a pioneer EU project in the field (see also (Insa,  Fredesvinda , 2007), and the Evidence project (Evidence project).  It is important that the collection of e-evidence complies with all of the relevant principles, such as data integrity,  audit trail, specialist support, appropriate training and legality (ENISA & Anderson, 2014a, p. 5).  E-evidence is fragile by nature and often volatile. Digital data can be easily lost or altered. If e-evidence is collected  in an unsuitable manner, there is a risk that the content of that e-evidence does not correspond to the original  content. There is therefore the risk that e-evidence cannot be used to help establish (or refute) that a crime has  been committed. To avoid this risk, some best practices have been developed internationally. It is important that  all personnel dealing with e-evidence know these best practices. Examples of best practices include the ISO  Guidelines for identification, collection, acquisition, and preservation of digital evidence (International Organisation  for Standardisation (ISO), 2012), the NIST Guide to integrating forensic techniques into incident response (SP-800- 86) (National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), 2006) (in particular, NIST  Chapter 3), Electronic  evidence — A basic guide for first responders (ENISA & Anderson, 2014a), Data acquisition guidelines for  investigation purposes (CERT-EU, 2012), the Guidelines on digital forensic procedures for OLAF staff (EU: European  Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), 2016a)), and the United Kingdom ACPO Good practice guide for digital evidence (The  Association of Chief Police Officers of England, Wales and Northern Ireland (ACPO), 2012).  Applicable legal and policy framework  This section gives an overview of the relevant legal and policy framework that shapes the cooperation and  interaction between CSIRTs, LE and their interaction with the judiciary. The section goes on to discuss recent  developments that may impact or influence this cooperation and interaction such as the recent introduction of the  General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016b).  3.2.1 An Overview of the relevant legal and policy framework  The legal and policy context play an important role in governing and shaping the cooperation between CSIRTs and  LEs and their interaction with the judiciary in the context of fighting against cybercrime. The main legislative and  policy components of this framework are listed below. More information on the legal and policy framework is  available in the 2017 ENISA report Improving cooperation between CSIRTs and law enforcement: Legal and  organisational aspects (ENISA, 2017a).   The national legal and policy framework governs and shapes the cooperation between CSIRTs and LEs  and their interaction with the judiciary. Transposition of the international and European law is an  important component of the national criminal law and criminal procedure law. There might be  however some specificities in legislative provisions depending on the country.   At the international level, the Council of Europe convention on cybercrime (Council of Europe, 2001),  often referred to as the ‘Budapest Convention’, is the first international treaty and remains the most  relevant international treaty on cybercrime and electronic evidence. It is the ‘only binding international  instrument on this issue. It serves as a guideline for any country developing comprehensive national  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  20  legislation against cybercrime and as a framework for international cooperation between state parties  to this treaty’ (Council of Europe, n.d.)   At EU level several legal and policy instruments are particularly relevant when discussing the  cooperation between CSIRTs and LEs, inter alia the following.   Directive on attack against information systems (European Parliament and Council of the European  Union, 2013a).   NIS Directive (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016e).   Cybersecurity strategy of the European Union (CSS)(European Commission and High  Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, 2013).   Joint Communication on resilience, deterrence and defence: Building strong cybersecurity for the  EU (European Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affiairs and Security  Policy, 2017).   Commission recommendation on coordinated response to large scale cybersecurity incidents and  Crises (‘Blueprint’) (European Commission, 2017a).   Commission communication on strengthening Europe’s cyber resilience system (European  Commission, 2016).   European Investigation Order (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2014).   EU data protection legislation, including the GDPR (European Parliament and Council of the  European Union, 2016b), Directive on privacy and electronic communications (European  Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2002), law enforcement data protection directive  (LEA DP Directive) (Council of the European Union, 2008) (GDPR is addressed in this report in more  detail in Section 3.2.2.1.)   Proposal for a Regulation on European production and preservation orders for electronic evidence  (European Commission, 2018) (Addressed in more detail in Section 3.2.2.2.)   Proposal for a directive laying down harmonised rules on the appointment of legal representatives  for the purpose of gathering evidence in criminal proceedings (European Commission, 2018a)  (Addressed in more detail in Section 3.2.2.2.)   ENISA regulation (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2013b).   In addition, there are some EU instruments that play a role in support of the cybersecurity  collaboration at international scale, such Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace (IcSP)  (European Commission, n.d.(e)), European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) (European Union  External Action Service, 2017) and Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) (European  Commission, n.d.(f)).  Some of the most significant recent developments in the legal and policy framework shaping the CSIRT and LE  cooperation and the interaction with the judiciary concern these two areas.   The GDPR (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016b) and data protection law  enforcement directive (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016).   The proposals for a regulation and for a directive to improve cross-border access to e-evidence  (European Commission, 2018) (European Commission, 2018a).  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  21  3.2.2 Some recent developments  3.2.2.1 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the data protection law enforcement directive  The GDPR (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016b)  strengthens the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free  movement of such data. It came into force on 24 May 2016 and applied from 25 May 2018. Some Member States  have already adopted this legislation, others are working on its preparation, but this does not affect the binding  nature of the regulation itself.  The Data Protection Law Enforcement Directive (Directive (EU) 2016/680) ‘protects citizens’ fundamental right to  data protection whenever personal data are used by criminal-law-enforcement authorities. It will ensure that the  personal data of victims, witnesses, and suspects of crime are duly protected and will facilitate cross-border  cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism’ (European Parliament and Council of the European Union,  2016). It entered into force on 5 May 2016 and EU countries had to transpose it into their national law by  6 May 2018. Currently (status: 26 October 2018, see (EUR-lex, n.d.)), only 16 Member States (Belgium,  Czech  Republic, Germany, Ireland, France, Croatia, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, Austria, Portugal,  Slovakia, Sweden and the United Kingdom) reported adoption of transposition measures in relation to this  Directive.  The GDPR and the data protection law enforcement directive have different scopes.   Article 1.1 of the GDPR provides that ‘this regulation lays down rules relating to the protection of  natural persons regarding the processing of personal data and rules relating to the free movement of  personal data’ (7);   Article 1 of the data protection law enforcement directive ‘lays down the rules relating to the  protection of natural persons regarding the processing of personal data by competent authorities for  the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the  execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to  public security’.  Due to the respective field of application of the GDPR and the data protection law enforcement directive, it can be  said that in principle, both the GDPR and data protection law enforcement directive may apply to the CSIRTs when  they deal with (including storing) personal data. However, it depends on the case.  Under Article 6.1 a) of the GDPR, the processing of personal data, including IP addresses, is permitted for a  specific, necessary and proportionate purpose (purpose of legitimate interest pursued by the CSIRTs, as specified  on Article 6.1 f) if the data subject (the person concerned, the person whose personal data are processed) gives  consent. In the event of an IT incident, there is no consent from the data subject (e.g. IP address holder) who  caused the incident. However, according to the GDPR (see Article 13.3) and to Recital 49 it can be considered that  the personal information, under certain circumstances, can be processed by the CSIRT even without consent.  Recital 49 indeed provides that ‘The processing of personal data to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate  for the purposes of ensuring network and information security, i.e. the ability of a network or an information  system to resist, at a given level of confidence, accidental events or unlawful or malicious actions that compromise  (7) The first judgment on Regulation (EU) 2016/679 was issued on 29 May 2018. This is a German ruling, specifically, of the Court Order of the Regional Court  of Bonn, 10 O 171/18, on the principle of data minimisation (ICANN v. EPAG Domainservices GmbH, 2018). Non-official translation to English (ICANN v.  EPAG Domainservices GmbH, 2018b).  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  22  the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored or transmitted personal data, and the security  of the related services offered by, or accessible via, those networks and systems, by public authorities, by  computer emergency response teams (CERTs), CSIRTs, by providers of electronic communications networks and  services and by providers of security technologies and services, constitutes a legitimate interest of the data  controller concerned. This could, for example, include preventing unauthorised access to electronic  communications networks and malicious code distribution and stopping “denial of service” [DoS] attacks and  damage to computer and electronic communication systems.’  If a CSIRT processes personal information, including IP address, on the basis of a specific mandate or delegation  from competent authorities (e.g. by a police officer or by the prosecutor) for the purposes of the prevention,  investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences, the GDPR does not apply, the data protection law  enforcement directive will apply to CSIRT instead.  As explained in Recital 11 of the data protection law enforcement directive ‘competent authorities [for the  purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of  criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security, respecting  the specific nature of those activities] may include not only public authorities such as the judicial authorities, the  police or other law-enforcement authorities but also any other body or entity entrusted by Member State law to  exercise public authority and public powers for the purposes of this directive’ (European Parliament and Council of  the European Union, 2016). Therefore, if the CSIRT is bound by contract/legal act to collect and process personal  data solely for the purposes mentioned in the directive, GDPR does not apply. The application of the GDPR on the  other hand remains unaffected for the processing of personal data by the CSIRTs outside the scope of this  directive.  The data protection law enforcement directive applies to LEA if the directive has been implemented in the  Member State (a Directive, unlike a Regulation, is not directly applicable). This directive does not require the  consent of the data subject, depending on the particular purposes for which the data are processed.  According to Article 2 par. 2 (d), the GDPR does not apply to the processing of personal data ‘by competent  authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the  execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security’.  Although the GDPR does not apply in these cases, the data protection law enforcement directive applies instead8.  Article 45 par. 2 of the data protection law enforcement directive stipulates the conditions of control by the  supervisory authority and it states that ‘Each Member State shall provide for each supervisory authority not to be  competent for the supervision of processing operations of courts when acting in their judicial capacity’.  3.2.2.2 Proposals for a regulation and a directive to improve cross-border access to electronic  evidence  As stated in the European Communication of April 2018 in the Fourteenth progress report towards an effective and  genuine security Union, ‘Electronic evidence has become relevant in a large majority of criminal investigations and  increasingly often, judicial authorities need to make a request in another jurisdiction to obtain necessary evidence  8 See art. 1 Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of  natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention,  investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and on the free movement  of such data, and repealing Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  23  from service providers. Making it easier and quicker to obtain this evidence across borders is therefore of crucial  importance for investigating and prosecuting crime, including terrorism or cybercrime’ (European Commission,  2018b, p. 1).  Currently the cross-border requests for e-evidence are processed through the mutual legal assistance (MLA)  instruments, through the European Investigation Order or based on voluntary cooperation. However, the current  framework does ‘Not fit for today’s volume of requests’ and there is a ‘Lack of connection with the receiving state’  (European Commission, 2018c).  Therefore, the European Commission proposed a new legislative package with measures to improve cross-border  gathering of electronic evidence, in particular the following.   The proposal for a regulation on European production and preservation orders for e-evidence in  criminal matters (European Commission, 2018).   The proposal for a directive laying down harmonised rules on the appointment of legal  representatives for the purpose of gathering evidence in criminal proceedings (European Commission,  2018a).  These proposals should enable LE to order any service provider offering services in the EU to produce or preserve  electronic evidence, regardless of the location of data or the service provider. European production and  preservation orders should be based on mutual recognition (9), which means that it should be directly binding and  enforceable to both the service provider and relevant enforcing authority. These orders should therefore allow for  an effective and fast response of the LE to reported incidents and cybercrimes and effective collection of volatile e- evidence. CSIRTs might help the LE with the correct targeting of the orders and may also benefit from the data  collected by the LE using the orders. On the other hand, (private) CSIRTs might also be in the position of the service  providers and therefore be required to comply with the order.  CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary: roles, structures and strengths  This section provides an overview of roles, structures and strengths of the three communities (CSIRTs, LE and  judiciary).  3.3.1 The role of CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary  This section provides an explanation of the roles of CSIRTs, LEs and the judiciary (prosecutor and judges).  3.3.1.1 The role of the CSIRTs  The main role of the CSIRT is to protect their constituency by preventing and containing IT incidents, primarily from  a technical point of view.  Annex I of the NIS Directive (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016e), in addition to the  requirements, lists the tasks of the CSIRTs, which includes at least: ‘(i) monitoring incidents at a national level; (ii)  providing early warning, alerts, announcements and dissemination of information to relevant stakeholders about  (9) Mutual recognition in criminal proceedings means that a specific judicial decision from one Member State should be directly enforceable in any other  Member State without further formalities or validation. This mechanism should be, in comparison with traditional mutual legal assistance, far more  effective and efficient.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  24  risks and incidents; (iii) responding to incidents; (iv) providing dynamic risk and incident analysis and situational  awareness; (v) participating in the CSIRTs network.’  CSIRTs deal with incident management (IM), including incident handling. The figure below provides an overview of  IM and incident handling stages.  Figure 3 — Incident management and incident handling stages (Source: (ENISA, 2010, p. 10)  It must be noted that ‘CSIRTs do not have the powers of [law enforcement] LE vis-à-vis private subjects, but as  regards attacks of a criminal nature (not all the cyber incidents are criminal acts), have an important role in  supporting the investigations, as they can help to provide information and to secure e-evidence’ (Council of the  European Union, 2017, p. 67). CSIRTs play an important role and ‘have to work closely with law enforcement [LE]  and other authorities’ (ENISA, 2015c, p. 9). Additionally, CSIRT have an ongoing need to collaborate and  communicate within their constituency and across other communities they interact with such as LE and the  judiciary (ENISA, 2018, p. 16).  During the incident management  and handling process, CSIRTs acquire, store and process data and they need to  be aware that the data they process and retain can be crucial for the investigation and the prosecution of a crime  in a criminal trial, it is important that their role, in responding to cybercrime too, is recognised.  As mentioned in Recital 62 of the NIS directive (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016e)  indeed ‘Incidents may be the result of criminal activities the prevention, investigation and prosecution of which is  supported by coordination and cooperation between operators of essential services [see Annex II of the NIS  directive], digital service providers, competent authorities and law-enforcement authorities [LEAs]. Where it is  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  25  suspected that an incident is related to serious criminal activities under Union or national law, Member States  should encourage operators of essential services and digital service providers to report incidents of a suspected  serious criminal nature to the relevant law-enforcement authorities. Where appropriate, it is desirable that  coordination between competent authorities and law-enforcement authorities of different Member States be  facilitated by the European cybercrime centre (EC3) and ENISA’.  3.3.1.2 The role of the LE  The role of the LE in carrying out investigations is aimed at collecting information and evidence on whether a crime  has been committed (or is going to be committed) and by whom. LE needs to collect evidence in compliance with  the law and according to the powers conferred on them. In some occasions, LE has the possibility to collect the  evidence directly, but in many cases the evidence is provided by others involved. It is of paramount importance to  remark that if the evidence collected has been tampered with or partially deleted by the first responders, the  future value of that evidence to support a criminal case during the indictment10 will be significantly or even totally  affected.  3.3.1.3 The role of the judiciary  The role of the judiciary is variable depending on the specificities of the legal system considered; however, it is  possible to identify three main functions of the judiciary.   The judiciary (namely prosecutors) supervises investigations (normally conducted by the LE).   The judiciary acts as body for the protection of fundamental rights.   The judiciary (namely judges) decides whether a crime has been committed and by whom.  Some further details are provided below on the role of the prosecutors and judges. It must be noted that  differences exist between legal systems and the particularities of each legal system cannot be covered in this  report.  3.3.1.4 The role of the prosecutors  ‘The public prosecutors’ office or prosecution service, which is regarded as part of the judiciary in most Member  States [and for this report], plays an essential role in criminal proceedings. The responsibilities and status of public  prosecutors vary considerably among Member States’ (European Commission (run by), n.d.(b)).  The prosecutor normally coordinates and supervises criminal investigations and formulates the charge (when  there are sufficient elements for it).  3.3.1.5 The role of the judges  The judge plays a central role in the criminal proceedings. Judges issue orders to perform procedural measures and  to collect evidence, decide on the admissibility and relevance of the evidence, determine the facts, interpret the  law and decide the case by sentencing the criminal defendants or by dismissing the case. Most important of all,  judges are impartial decision-makers in the pursuit of justice.  The judge is in charge to guarantee that the whole investigation and trial is in compliance with civil liberties and  the rights of persons charged with a criminal offence. Article 6 par. 2 of European Convention on Human Rights  10 An indictment is a formal charge of a serious crime.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  26  (Council of Europe, 1950) affirms the right to a fair trial, including that ‘Everyone charged with a criminal offence  shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law’. Also, the civil liberties and the rights of the other  parties participating in a trial must be complied with (for example, witnesses).  3.3.2 The structure of CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary  This section provides an outline of the structures of CSIRTs, LE and judiciary.  3.3.2.1 The structure of the CSIRTs  A CSIRT is a team of IT security experts whose main business is to respond to computer security incidents,  providing the necessary tools and services to handle them and support their constituents to mitigate the incidents.  Also, most CSIRTs provide preventative and educational services for their constituency, issuing warnings on  vulnerabilities, and also providing awareness to users about threats and scams taking advantage of these flaws.  Based on their duties and area of responsibility (constituency), there could be national, governmental, sectoral and  private CSIRTs. The NIS Directive (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016e) does not make  any reference to this categorisation of CSIRTs, and only states that Member States are to designate one or more  CSIRTs to cover certain industry sectors. Usually national and governmental CSIRTs are designated by the Member  States as CSIRTs under the NIS Directive.  National and governmental CSIRTs play a key role in coordinating Incident Management with the relevant  stakeholders at national level. In addition, they bear responsibility for cooperation with the national and  governmental teams in other countries, and also as part of the CSIRTs network established by the NIS directive.  3.3.2.2 The structure of the LE  The LE structure has been designed to comply with both their stated missions and their legal framework of  intervention. Although the structure differs among Member States, generally LE is hierarchically organised to  identify each level’s responsibility and accountability. Normally each level is dedicated to a certain level of  decision-making and should be accountable for any action taken. LE usually fulfils the following missions: general  policing, prevention, investigating, public order and security purposes.  Depending on the countries’ institutional landscape, the history and the legal systems, LE have different structures  and may be organised in a more centralised way. At national level, again depending on the Member State, LE  might be organised as a two-layer system: central entities that host the most specialised teams (organised crime,  terrorism, intelligence, support units) and regional services which provide a service closer to the population.  Central units normally deal with the nationwide and transnational crime, while regional units tend to lead  investigations in their jurisdiction only.  At international level, international entities provide coordination support among LE. Europol is the LE coordinating  the European Member State police forces. It provides them with intelligence, analysis capacities (analysts and  tools) as well as coordination support for joint operations. Europol is competent to support and strengthen action  taken by MS authorities in preventing and combating organised crime, terrorism and other forms of serious  crime affecting two or more Member States only. Each MS has competent authorities which are the single point  of contact for any operational and strategic communication between them. When an MS LE needs cooperation  from another MS LEA, it needs to have a clear and identified point of contact to deal with, without necessarily  having to be informed on the operational model of each police force.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  27  The Europol Liaison Bureaux (ELB) (11) and the joint cybercrime action taskforce (J-CAT) (12) serve as liaison officers  focused on strengthening operational cooperation in fighting cybercrime. ELB support the law-enforcement  activities of the Member States against cybercrime by facilitating the exchange of information between Europol  and its liaison officers; ELB are also a Point of Contact (PoC) as are Europol National Units (ENUs) to provide  information and advice in the analysis of information concerning their seconding state.  (Hillebrand, 2012). J-CAT is  a country-led innovative framework that includes both EU and non-EU countries that operates from Europol’s  headquarters and it is supported by Europol’s European cybercrime centre (EC3). The objective of J-CAT is to drive  intelligence-led, coordinated action against key cybercrime threats and targets by facilitating the joint  identification, prioritisation, preparation and initiation of cross-border investigations and operations by its  partners.  Interpol is the global police organisation. With 190 members, it is the second largest international organisation  after the United Nations. The organisation works with a network of Interpol national central bureaus (NCBs) which  are also single PoCs in each country (Interpol, n.d.a), like the Europol ENUs. Both the NCBs and ENUs are LE-only  entities — the information sharing is not authorised to non-LE third parties.  The Interpol spectrum covers all EU Member States as well as countries outside the EU. While Europol and Interpol  are two separate organisations they cooperate on a day-to-day basis (13).  3.3.2.3 The structure of the judiciary  ‘While the judicial systems of the Member States differ significantly in detail, there is a set of common principles  which apply to all of them, as well as to the EU as such. One of these common principles is that the courts must be  impartial and independent of the government and the legislating institution (i.e. the institution(s) passing the law).  This principle of independence of the judiciary is one of the values on which the EU is founded: the rule of law and  respect for freedom, equality and fundamental rights. It is expressly mentioned in Article 47 of the Charter of  Fundamental Rights of the EU, and in Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights’ (European  Commission (run by), n.d.d).  As for the structure of the CSIRTs and the LE, the actual structure of the prosecution office and of the courts vary  from country to country. However, there are certain similarities as described below.  3.3.2.4 The structure of the prosecution service  Normally the prosecution service is organised in a hierarchical way: each prosecutor reports to the respective  superior prosecutor and there is a prosecutor-general who heads the entire prosecutor’s office.  Depending on the country, the prosecution office might have a more centralised structure or a more decentralised  one.  Generally, the structure of the prosecution service mirrors that of the court system or it is even part of it (e.g. in  countries where prosecutors and judges are part of the same structure while performing different roles).

Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  28  3.3.2.5 The structure of the courts  The national court systems are normally divided into branches (e.g. ordinary civil and criminal, administrative,  military, etc.). The ordinary criminal court systems are generally organised into first-, second- (e.g. courts of  appeal) and third-instance courts (e.g. supreme courts), and their centralised/decentralised structure depends on  the governmental or constitutional structure of the country.  Normally the ministry of justice is responsible for matters related to court organisation, including budget. In some  countries a supreme council of the judiciary is established as a central body responsible for guaranteeing the  independence of the judiciary.  Eurojust has been set up with the aim of supporting the MS competent national authorities (including prosecutors  and judges) when they deal with serious cross-border and organised crime. Eurojust is ‘composed of national  prosecutors, magistrates, or police officers of equivalent competence, detached from each Member State  according to their own legal systems’ (Eurojust, n.d.).  The European Council, in its Conclusion 46, agreed that a  unit (Eurojust) should be set up, composed of national prosecutors, magistrates, or police officers of equivalent  competence, detached from each Member State according to their own legal systems (Eurojust, 2018).  3.3.2.6 The Role of CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary along with the workflow of responding to cybercrime  According to the data collected, the role of each community (CSIRTs, LE and judiciary) along the workflow of  responding to cybercrime can be described as follows.   Discovery of the crime: LE can receive a crime report (e.g. from the victim) or discover a suspicious  activity by itself. The CSIRT can discover a suspicious activity during incident handling and, depending  on the legal system may have/has an obligation to inform LE of the activity. In some Member States,  at least under certain circumstances, CSIRT (the focus of this report is national and/or governmental  CSIRTs) in certain circumstances national or governmental CSIRTS must inform the prosecutor of any  activity that might be considered criminal.   Criminal investigation: normally LE conducts the criminal investigation while the prosecutor defines  the strategy of the case, sets the evidence threshold and supervises it. The judiciary ensures that the  investigation is conducted in compliance with civil liberties and guarantees (14) and defines the limits  of protection of the rights of the persons investigated.. Depending on the severity of the crime and  the complexity of the case, the investigation means used (undercover police investigation, use of  wiretaping technology, etc.) vary. CSIRT may play a role in the investigation by providing technical  expertise and supporting the evidence collection (and preservation) by sharing information they have,  or they have access to. As stated in the 2017 ENISA reports on CSIRT and LE cooperation (ENISA,  2017a) (ENISA, 2017) and confirmed during the interviews conducted for this report, CSIRTs and LE  indeed often exchange information (both formally and informally) related to cybercrime cases, for  instance to avoid interference in their actions. CSIRTs can support the investigations by providing LE  with useful information for the investigations. When a more formal involvement of CSIRTs is required  during the criminal investigations, the prosecutor usually needs to be consulted and give consent for  the involvement of CSIRT in digital evidence acquiring, handling and analysis. This is because CSIRTs  are not operating under the strict LE rules.  (14) On common minimum rules concerning certain aspects of the presumption of innocence in criminal proceedings and the right to be present at the trial  in criminal proceedings see (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016a). For an overview of case-law of the European Court of  Human Rights in the area of human rights and criminal procedures see (McBride, 2018).  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  29   Prosecution either press charges or suspend/archive the case: a criminal proceeding normally starts  after the formal criminal charge (i.e. the formal accusation), usually made either by the prosecutor or  by the police; it ends with the conviction or acquittal of the defendant. If the evidence collected  support a charge then the competent authority (normally the prosecutor) formulates the charge and  the suspect (normally from this point onwards called ‘the defendant’) is brought to court. If the  amount and quality of the evidence collected during the criminal investigation is not sufficient to  proceed or if the evidence collected shows that the facts do not have the elements to constitute a  crime, in several states the prosecutor can discard the case. This however does not mean that the  CSIRT must discard the eradication and the recovery phase (ENISA, 2016d, p. 10); an important phase  of the incident response and that still needs to be performed from the incident handling process  (SANS, 2011, p. 8).   Trial: although (according to the data collected) this happens in general very rarely, a member of the  CSIRT may be called to play a role in the process before a criminal court aiming to decide whether a  person (after the formal charge, ‘the defendant’) has committed a crime. At least in some Member  States a CSIRT expert can be called to testify as an (expert) witness in computer crime cases. The  CSIRT experts testify based on the general rules of testimony normally set out in the criminal  procedural codes. However, according to the data collected via interviews and the online survey, the  cases where CSIRT experts are called as witnesses in criminal proceeding are not frequent at all. Some  interviewees stated that in some cases, detailed reports from CSIRTs are also used in criminal  proceedings to support the decision on the conviction or the acquittal of the defendant. Furthermore,  CSIRTs can also provide other forms of evidence (for instance, a cloned image of a hard disk) to be  used in criminal proceedings. CSIRTs have a long history of cooperation across the EU and they  coordinate by means of a CSIRT secretariat function provided for in the network and information  security directive (NISD).  All of the examples given above of course vary depending on the legal systems and on the specificities of the  crime, including its severity.  Based on the data collected via the online survey and the literature research, it is clear that LE and/or prosecutors  take the lead in criminal investigations.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  30  Figure 4 — Replies to question 10 of the online survey conducted for this report  3.3.3 Strengths of the three communities  The main strengths of the CSIRT and LE communities identified by the data collected via the online survey (see  Figures 5 and 6) include the following.   For the CSIRTs: the use of agile processes, the technical skills and the technical tools used, as well as  the well-established cooperation they have within and outside the CSIRT community (e.g. security  companies and internet service providers (ISPs)).   For the LE: the ability to draft detailed reports to be used in criminal proceedings, the knowledge of  the chain of custody and the requirements for admissibility of evidence in court as well as the  detective skills and well-defined roles which are easy to understand by all parties.  Figure 5 — Replies to question 15 of the online survey conducted for this report  Q10: In your country who takes the  lead in criminal investigations?  Q15 - What are the  strengths that  national/governmental  CSIRT in your country has  and you would wish to see  more in the law  enforcement?  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  31  Figure 6 — Replies to question 16 of the online survey conducted for this report  No specific data were collected via the online survey on the strengths of the judiciary. However, from some  statements made by the subject-matter experts interviewed it can be derived that prosecutors and judges  (because of their role, experience and background) have a deep knowledge of matters related to admissibility of  evidence and the delicate balance between the need for collection and preservation of e-evidence to prosecute  crime and the protection of the fundamental rights.  The interaction and the information flow across CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary  This section addresses the interaction and information flow across CSIRTs, LEs and the judiciary, in particular  focusing on LE’s direct and indirect interactions during investigations, the duties of CSIRTs followed by an in-depth  discussion on the types of information that is exchanged.  Cooperation between CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary can be mutually beneficial. This is also illustrated by examples  from practice. One of these examples can be the cooperation between a national/governmental CSIRT or another  CSIRT (e.g. a university CSIRT) and the police in the case of attempted hacker attacks on a computer system, as  illustrated in the example in the box.  Q16: What are the strengths that law  enforcement in your country has and  you would wish to see more in the  national/governmental CSIRT?  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  32  Example of cooperation between CSIRTs, LEs and the judiciary  A CSIRT detects an incident likely to be a crime (e.g. an attack against an information system)  and informs the police/files a complaint with the police, which in turn ask for the details about  the incident and possible evidence.  Thanks to the close cooperation and the police instructions, the CSIRT is able to collect relevant  traffic and localisation data in a way that allows it to be used as evidence in court. Further  investigation reveals that the incident was of a larger scale than initially estimated and that  further data are needed from other service providers. Therefore, using the police procedural  tools and the expertise of the CSIRT staff, additional data are requested from the operator of  the network, through which the communication traces of the attacker are identified, and other  victim organisations are identified.  The data obtained reveal that the attacker’s communication in several cases was led through  servers in a different jurisdiction. Thanks to the involvement of the CSIRT and the CSIRT  community, additional necessary operational data from a CSIRT in a different country are  obtained and then made available to the police. Obtaining these data following the standard  measures of international police and judicial cooperation in criminal cases would have taken  much longer. At the stage of analysing, processing and applying the evidence in court, the police  can also use advanced forensic tools and CSIRT personnel’s expertise.  Following this positive experience of cooperation, both the police and the CSIRT are able to  identify problematic areas of cooperation that they can then streamline. For example, within  the CSIRT, internal processes for informing the police/filing complaints with the police and for  collecting evidence or passing it on to LE are established. On the part of the police, means for  securing the electronic transfer of digital evidence are implemented, as well as procedural  measures for cooperation with security teams, including measures that allow secure two-way  sharing of sensitive information. On the part of the court, the possibility of using a CSIRT  employee as an expert witness, who is able to explain to the court the technical details of the  case and the specifics of the individual pieces of evidence, is verified.  3.4.1 Indirect v. direct interaction between CSIRTs and prosecutor and judge  The default approach for an investigation is that LE undertakes the investigative aspects of an incident and the  prosecutor supervises the investigation. The leads to follow, the targets to work on and the legal framework are  decided by the prosecutor. While it is normally done through cooperation, where there is any disagreement the  final say is with the prosecutor and, in some case, with the judge. In several EU Member States, when a crime is  ongoing, or the incident has just occurred (e.g. within 24 hours), LE can undertake immediate actions such as  searches, arrests and warrants without the prosecutor’s prior agreement (although a validation of the measures  taken is then needed) and only for as long as a prosecutor has not been assigned to or not taken the lead in the  investigation yet.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  33  As an investigation unfolds, LE and prosecutors continually make decisions to adapt to the circumstances of the  events. In this situation, the CSIRTs can be formally asked to cooperate by providing their technical expertise or  data that they may have e.g. in their own systems or via their channels.  CSIRTs normally interact with LE much more rarely do they engage directly with the prosecutor. Several  interviewees described the normal information flow as ‘linear’, in other words CSIRT > LE > prosecutor (> judge).  That means that normally the CSIRT informs LE and then LE informs the prosecutor.  However, under certain circumstances (namely for emergency cases) the CSIRT has a direct channel (email, phone)  to the prosecutor e.g. when LE is not available, the CSIRT can report a crime directly to the prosecutor. In addition,  the prosecutor can directly request the CSIRT for instance to explain to the prosecutor a specific technical point  which will inform the next stages of the investigation. In this situation, the prosecutor can directly engage with the  CSIRT, but the LE might still act as a facilitator.  Some interviewees stated that there are also formal and informal ways of communication and that sometimes  official requests for information (e.g. from CSIRT to LE or from LE to CSIRTs) are preceded by some informal  discussion between CSIRT and LE personnel working on the incident/case.  CSIRTs (like any witness) can be requested to provide testimony during a trial. Either the prosecutor or the defence  can summon CSIRT personnel who provided evidence. In this case, the CSIRT personnel are normally in the same  situation as the private expert when giving testimony. As expert witnesses, CSIRTs personnel have to outline their  skills and knowledge and explain to the court how the evidence was handled. The defence might aim to challenge  not the evidence as such but how that evidence was collected and handled (e.g. searched for, collected and  preserved). It must be noted that while LE personnel are generally prepared to testify in Court, CSIRT personnel  may be reluctant or ill-prepared to serve as expert witnesses in Court as they might be less familiar with trial  sessions.  To summarise, CSIRTs normally interact with the judiciary via LE and do not have direct interaction with  prosecutors: they have even less frequent direct interaction with judges. There are however cases where CSIRT  and prosecutors and judges have direct contact, for instance when the CSIRT is asked to provide technical input  directly to the prosecutor on a case or where the CSIRT is asked to testify in court. Nonetheless, the contact is  normally facilitated by the LE, especially in the case of interaction between the CSIRT and the prosecutor.  According to the data collected both via the interviews and the online survey, where the CSIRTs have a duty to  report cybercrime (whether CSIRTs have this duty is discussed below in the report), normally the CSIRT report to LE  although there are cases (depending on the legal systems) where they report it directly to the prosecutor. The  results from the online survey on this matter are represented in Figure 7.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  34  Figure 7 — Replies to question 9A of the online survey conducted for this report  3.4.2 CSIRTs and their duty (or not) to inform law enforcement or prosecutor and/or to report a  crime and the coordination of actions  From data collected via interviews it emerged that whether a national/governmental CSIRT has a duty to inform or  report to the LE or to the prosecutor varies considerably from country to country. However, even considering this  differentiating factor, it seems that there is a lack of common understanding on when CSIRTs have a duty to report  an alleged criminal act: the data collected appears indeed rather heterogeneous. It may also be the case that CSIRTs  require continuous support and legal guidance to be better able to determine when an incident can be considered  a crime.  Figure 8 — Replies to question 9 of the online survey conducted for this report  Q9A: To whom does the  national/governmental  CSIRT in your country  report cybercrime?  Q9: Have the national/governmental CSIRTs in your  country a duty to report cybercrime to the law  enforcement?  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  35  Concerning the duty of the CSIRTs to inform the victims, as shown in Figure 9, according to most respondents to  the online survey, CSIRTs have this duty only under certain circumstances (not much more additional data were  gathered on such circumstances).  Figure 9 — Replies to question 8 of the online survey conducted for this report  However, whether or not CSIRTs have a duty to inform LE (or the prosecutor) and/or the victim, one of the most  important aspects to consider is the coordination process between CSIRTs, LE and the prosecutor.  As mentioned, CSIRTs are more focused on preventing and reacting to cyber incidents, but some CSIRT actions may  affect criminal investigations (in most countries conducted by the police and coordinated/supervised by the  prosecution service). An example is the case when a CSIRT might notify a web domain owner or the host about a  command and control server and request shut down. But at the same time that command and control server  might be under investigation by an LE. That is why the coordination and escalation process between different  entities must be in place and clear to all parties (CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary).  Proper coordination in the cyber field does require proper mechanisms and tools, including the usage of a  dedicated platform where different types of data can be properly marked (e.g. a specific domain is sinkholed (15)  and cannot be the subject of a takedown). However, it must be noted that CSIRTs and LE are already using their  own platforms for information storing, processing and exchange (e.g. the ‘MeliCERTes facility [in the CSIRT  community that] aims to facilitate swift and effective operational cooperation for the CSIRT network’ (European  Commission, 2017b). A new platform might lead to the duplication of efforts.  (15) ‘DNS sinkholing is a mechanism aimed at protecting users by intercepting DNS request attempting to connect to known malicious or unwanted domains  and returning a false, or rather controlled IP address. The controlled IP address points to a sinkhole server defined by the DNS sinkhole administrator.’  (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/glossary/dns-sinkhole).  Q8: In your country,  have the  national/governmental  CSIRTs a duty to inform  the victim of a  suspected cybercrime?  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  36  3.4.3 The kind of information exchanged and the related information flow  According to the results from the online survey shown in Figure 10 as well as those from the subject-matter expert  interviews, the CSIRT-provided data most often used for criminal investigations are indicators of compromise  (IOCs), IP addresses, information on modus operandi and timeline.  Figure 10 — Replies to question 5 of the online survey conducted for this report  Also, according to several subject-matter experts interviewed, the CSIRTs normally share with the police and  (whether directly or via the police) with the prosecutor any type of information that is related to the incident and  that might be relevant for the investigation. This information includes IPs addresses, web domains, email details  (addresses, headers, content) and IOCs.  LE shares mainly IP addresses with CSIRTs, while sharing all information needed to decide on criminal prosecution  with the prosecutors and judges. The judges share with judges all (digital) evidence useful to prosecute the  suspect. Digital evidence sharing between judges belonging to different Member States can be either direct or  indirect. This depends on what is provided for in bilateral or multilateral agreements between the states, if they  exist, and on the cooperation in criminal matters that can be used in the specific case.  Almost any kind of data might be relevant and thus can be exchanged between CSIRTs and LEAs. They are still  using the comma separated value (csv) format which can be converted into any human- or machine-processable  format of events.  Similar replies were given in the online survey to the question on what kind of CSIRT-provided data are most often  used as evidence in criminal proceedings in court. However, the number of ‘no answer provided’ received in  response to this question was higher; this might be since the respondents (especially from the CSIRT community)  have less visibility on the actual use of the information they provide in court.  Q5: In your experience what kind of  data provided by CSIRT is most often  used for criminal investigations?  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  37  Figure 11 — Replies to question 6 of the online survey conducted for this report  3.4.4 Frequency of the information exchange and of the usage of information provided by CSIRTs in  criminal investigations and as evidence in criminal proceedings  Several interviewees noted that the information sharing between CSIRTs and LE may be very frequent (on a daily  basis or more than once a day), but it depends on the incident and on the severity of the incident. Some other  interviewees stated that the information sharing is much less frequent, e.g. once per month.  In principle information sharing takes place immediately where there is an emergency and around once a week for  minor incidents (as some interviewees highlighted, it not possible to send information immediately for minor  incidents and therefore a list of minor incidents is sent to LE or to the prosecution office (depending on the  country) e.g. once per week).  CSIRTs share information with LE also for intelligence purposes and there are regular bulletins (e.g. once per  month) sent.  Some interviewees noted that when there is an emergency (and LE is not available), the national/governmental  CSIRT has a direct channel to the prosecutor (e.g. phone). This provision, of course, does not undermine the 24/7  PoC service available in each MS.  On the usage of information provided by CSIRTs, it must be noted that according to the answers received via the  online survey, most respondents replied that it is used occasionally for criminal investigation while rarely as  evidence in criminal proceeding. See Figure 12.  Q6: In your experience what  kind of data provided by CSIRT  is most often used as evidence  in criminal proceedings in  court?  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  38  Figure 12 — Replies to question 1 of the online survey conducted for this report  Figure 13 — Replies to question 2 of the online survey conducted for this report  Further, Figures 14 and 15 show that, according to the replies received from the online survey, CSIRTs are hardly  ever called either to write detailed expert reports to use in criminal proceedings or to be witnesses in criminal  courts.  Q1 - How often in your country is  information provided by CSIRTs - in  particular national/governmental CSIRTs -  used for criminal investigations?  Q2 - How often in your  country is information  provided by CSIRTs - in  particular  national/governmental  CSIRTs - used as evidence in  criminal proceedings in  court?  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  39  Figure 14 — Replies to question 3 of the online survey conducted for this report  Figure 15 — Replies to question 4 of the online survey conducted for this report  3.4.5 A graphical representation of the information flow  Although the information flow across CSIRTs, LE and judiciary varies from legal system to legal system it also  depends on the specific case being dealt with (e.g. the severity of the case and whether it’s considered an  emergency might have an impact on the information flow), a graphical representation of this flow of information is  presented in Figure 16 based on an abstraction and generalisation of the data collected for this report (especially  the responses from the subject-matter expert interviews and the online survey). The broken lines in it represent  information provided, as opposed to the arrows which represent actions taken. This graphical representation (with  all the usual limitations due to abstraction and generalisation) aims to describe what the information flow might  look like and shows the complexity of such information flow.  Q3 - In your country, how often are  national/governmental CSIRTs called to  write detailed expert reports to use in  criminal proceedings in court?  Q4 - In your country, how often  national/governmental CSIRT is  called as witness in criminal  proceedings in court?  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  40  Figure 16 — Graphical representation of the flow of information across CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary  Responses to Question 11 on the online survey (see Figure 18), ‘agree’ or ‘partially agree’ on the interaction and  the information flow across CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary working well. This gives a clear indication that when  information is exchanged then the process does work but perhaps there is room for improvement.  Figure 17 — Replies to question 11 of the online survey conducted for this report  Some interviewees noted that the information flow is largely one-way (from CSIRTs to LEs/prosecutor) and this is  mainly due to the prosecution and LE not being allowed to share information/evidence collected within the  criminal proceedings (see Section 4.1.2 on the secrecy of criminal investigations in the report). The information  flow from LE/prosecutor to CSIRTs takes place only to prevent further damage or in emergency situations. Other  respondents highlighted that police can only officially share with the CSIRT a specific portion of the information as  aprecautionary measure, i.e. all information not classified as ‘secrecy’; clearly the public prosecutor that directs  the investigation can order the sharing of additional pieces of information.  Q11 - Does the interaction and the  information flow across CSIRTs,  law enforcement and judiciary  (prosecutors and judges) work  well?  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  41  Other interviewees noted that the distribution of authority and formalities sometimes make the  cooperation/interaction less smooth, but that this might also be so due to the need to comply with certain legal  requirements.  What has also emerged from data collected is that cooperation and interaction depends on interpersonal relations:  if the interpersonal relations are good, the cooperation/interaction works well. This finding further confirmed one  of the findings of the 2017 ENISA reports on CSIRTs and law-enforcement cooperation (ENISA, 2017) (ENISA, 2017a),  i.e. that trust is paramount for the cooperation among the three communities.  The tools and the common taxonomy for CSIRTs and law enforcement  This section provides a detailed overview of the tools and taxonomies used for data sharing.  3.5.1 Tools  This section gives an overview of the tools for normal communication and information sharing within the CSIRTs and  within the LE community for cooperation between the two communities.  As mentioned above, the CSIRTs interact with the prosecutors generally via LE; they interact rarely with judges  (only seldom they are called as expert witnesses in court). For this reason, the tools used by the prosecutors and  judges for their internal communication and information sharing or for communication with the CSIRTs are not  addressed in this report.  3.5.1.1 Overview of tools used within the CSIRTs community and within the law-enforcement  community  Secure email is a common tool in the cybersecurity community and is used by LE to communicate and share  information with other police forces and with independent or private-sector experts, as well as with CSIRT  personnel. LE tends to use the pretty good privacy (PGP) cryptography system more and more, this allows LE to  protect the data in exchanges with other police forces (also in international exchanges) in an easy manner. MS  competent authorities (e.g. LE) also use other secured email systems to exchange non-structured data very quickly,  e.g. the secure information exchange network application (SIENA), the Europol platform for experts (EPE) for non- operational exchange of information for Europol or the Interpol PoC for Interpol.  For more structured data the only family of tools comprises police files: the wanted or signalled person or objects  stored in the national and EU databases. This tool seems to fit better to certain types of data, such as IOCs or other  pure cybercrime data. The analysis projects, (previously called focal points (16)) also are important tools: each piece  of data is analysed stored in Europol databases to then be shared in order to identify common cases among  several countries.  The malware information-sharing platform (MISP) platform is a widely used and well-established tool within the  CSIRT community. The MISP’s main use and its strong point is its sharing capability: a user of the platform can very  easily share routine structured data with other entities through push and pull. MISP is ingreasingly becoming a  standard among the CSIRT community in the EU and EFTA. A new trend in LE is to implement MISP (Computer  Incident Response Center (CIRCL) Luxembourg, 2018). The MISP tool is also fit for storing IOCs and for sharing  (16) https://www.europol.europa.eu/crime-areas-trends/europol-analysis-projects  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  42  them in an automated and structured way. It is a good first place for LE to discover threat intelligence: the MISP  instances automatically share the feeds at each update.  Within the LE community, in addition to MISP, the use of other new tools is increasing for cybercrime-oriented  information sharing. Europol malwares analysis system (EMAS) for instance allows LE to share malware samples:  each malware submitted is analysed. The IOC obtained are then crossmatched in Europol databases. The EPE is a  portal full of information and tools. Among them can be found technical developments for IT forensic  investigations, best practices or WHOIS legal considerations. It is one of the communication tools of Europol’s EC3  with the LE community alongside EPE that allows private parties, LEA and others to exchange information. It uses  secured connections and closed networks. Working with outside partners creates new habits and new systems  such as interconnecting networks that were isolated before.  LE use investigation graph tools which crawl into any kind of dataset to make connections and provide a graphical  representation of them. Some of the tools can be fed with any type of data, such as blockchain (17), Structured  Query Language (SQL) database (DB), in-house files and so on.  More generally, LE are entering into the threat-intelligence area with tools able to manage and crosscheck large  datasets for further identification of perpetrators. It is usually based on the Elasticsearch framework (18) with a lot  of in-house programing to fit LE needs: graph visualisation, indexing of seized hacker forums, etc.  3.5.1.2 Overview of tools used for information sharing between the CSIRT and LE communities  Basic standard tooling such as secure email and telephone are used for communication and information sharing  between CSIRTs and LE. As also highlighted in 2017 ENISA report on Tools and methodologies to support  cooperation between CSIRTs and law enforcement (ENISA, 2017, p. 28), in ‘several Member States there is an  already established and secure (and sometimes segregated) government network that can be used for secure  communication. These types of network could be used as a communication path for exchanging information’.  Since the use of MISP is already widespread in the CSIRT community and there is an ongoing increase in the use of  MISP by LE, it seems to be or likely to be one of the most suitable tools for the exchange of information between  CSIRTs and LE. ‘It is important to note that a separate community (or even better a separate MISP instance) can be  used for information exchange between CSIRT and LEA. This way, there is no risk for potentially disclosing sensitive  information with parties that should not [have it]’ (ENISA, 2017, p. 30).  Whenever needed, also face-to-face meetings, even in particularly secure locations if required, take place between  CSIRTs and law enforcement.  3.5.2 Common taxonomy for CSIRTs and law enforcement  Although CSIRTs and LE might have their own taxonomy to deal with incidents/cybercrime, a common taxonomy  for CSIRTs and LE enforcement has been developed to facilitate their cooperation. The ‘common taxonomy for LE  and CSIRTs, which was set up to simplify CSIRT and LEA cooperation. This taxonomy resulted from collaboration  initiatives such as the annual ENISA/EC3 workshop which involved CSIRTs, LEAs, ENISA, and EC3’ (ENISA, 2018). The  (17) Blockchain is a public ledger consisting of all transactions taken place across a peer-to-peer network. It is a data structure consisting of linked  blocks of data, e.g. confirmed financial transactions with each block pointing/referring to the previous one forming a chain in linear and chronological order.

This common taxonomy has been already implemented and  imported in MISP (GitHub, n.d. a).  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  44  Challenges in cooperation and interaction  This chapter outlines the legal, cultural, technical and organisational challenges faced in the cooperation between  CSIRTs and LEs and their interaction with the judiciary.  The challenges faced  According to the data collected for this report, there are challenges related to the cooperation between CSIRTs  and LE (which is line also to the findings from 2017 ENISA reports (ENISA, 2017) (ENISA, 2017a), and their  interaction with the judiciary. In particular, these challenges seem to be first legal, then cultural, technical and  organisational. See Figure 18 which illustrates these findings.  Figure 18 — Replies to question 12 of the online survey conducted for this report  Legal challenges  This section presents some legal challenges faced in the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE and their interaction  with the judiciary as identified from the data collected for this report.  4.2.1 Data retention  An important challenge is the need to find a balance between two opposing requirements. The first requirement is  the investigative need to preserve the greatest amount of traffic data (19) for as long as possible. However, such  (19) Article 1, letter d) of the Convention on Cybercrime (Council of Europe, 2001) states that ‘Traffic data’ ‘means any computer data relating to a  communication by means of a computer system, generated by a computer system that formed a part in the chain of communication, indicating the  communication’s origin, destination, route, time, date, size, duration, or type of underlying service’. These data, e.g. the IP address, can be very important  in criminal investigations. For this reason, the legislation of many Member States requires that ‘traffic data’ be kept for a certain time for the purpose of  the investigation, the detection and the prosecution of crime. This storage activity of ‘traffic data’ is called ‘data retention’.  Q12: Are there any  challenges hindering  the interaction and  information flow  across CSIRTs, law  enforcement and  judiciary  (prosecutors and  judges)?  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  45  data retention inevitably interferes with some fundamental rights, in particular the right to privacy and the right to  erasure (or the right to be forgotten). Consequently, there is a second requirement, related to the principle that a  level of government must not take any action that exceeds that necessary to carry out its assigned  tasks (‘proportionality’): the fundamental rights can be violated for investigative purposes without exceeding the  limits of what is strictly necessary.  Finding a balance between these two needs is not easy. The no-longer-in-force Directive 2006/24/EC (20) (European  Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2006) provided some rules on this topic. However, the judgment of  the grand chamber in Joined Case C-293/12 and C-594/12 Digital Rights Ireland Ltd v minister for communications,  marine and natural resources and others and Kärntner Landesregierung and others (Court of Justice of the  European Union, 2014) , of 8 April 2014 took the view that ‘Directive 2006/24 does not lay down clear and precise  rules governing the extent of the interference with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles 7 and 8 of the  Charter. It must therefore be held that Directive 2006/24 entails a wide-ranging and particularly serious  interference with those fundamental rights in the legal order of the EU, without such an interference being  precisely circumscribed by provisions to ensure that it is actually limited to what is strictly necessary’ (see par. 65).  Accordingly, the judgment of the grand chamber declared Directive 2006/24/EC invalid because of a violation of  the principle of proportionality. For an overview of amendments to national data retention laws in 2016 after the  Digital Rights Ireland judgment see (FRA). On case-law related to the concept of personal data, jurisprudence on IP  addresses and data retention relevant for CSIRT and LE cooperation, see also the ENISA report Improving  cooperation between CSIRTs and law enforcement: Legal and organisational aspects (ENISA, 2017a, pp. 30-31).  4.2.2 Secrecy of criminal investigations and the ‘need to know’  Data exchange between CSIRTs and law enforcement represents a challenge in two ways: from CSIRT to LE and  from LE to CSIRT.  For the information flow from LE to CSIRT, if the information originated from an investigation, the secret of the  investigation applies, and law enforcement are not in a position to share the information they have with the  CSIRTs. However, it must be noted that the prosecutor can exceptionally authorise a police officer to share and  ‘release’ that person of this obligation to secrecy. In such cases, information sharing is then allowed, usually for  impelling remediation motives or if it concerns information that is not sensitive for the investigation.  As emerged from the interviews, one of the most challenging aspects is the balance between the need to maintain  the secrecy and the ‘need to know’: both CSIRTs and LE might work on the same incident/case and if there is no  coordination they might interfere in a detrimental way in each other’s work. In addition, for instance, if LE cannot  share some information during the investigations, then it is difficult for the CSIRT to understand LE needs.  As far as it concerns the information flow from CSIRT to LE, it is important to consider how the LE can receive and  use data from outside sources. Usually, data transferred by CSIRTs are for intelligence purposes. Should any of the  data be used to identify and arrest a person, a stringent set of rules must be followed (see Section 4.1.6 — Chain of  custody). Data collected to be used for judicial purposes must follow evidence rules. The problem arises in this  context when CSIRT information handling and transmission channels might not be well fitted to this situation.  (20) Directive concerned the retention of data generated or processed in connection with providing publicly available electronic communications services or  of public communications networks and amending Directive 2002/58/EC.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  46  4.2.3 Sharing of personal data, including IP addresses  One of the current challenges is to maintain and, where possible and needed, to increase the data sharing  between CSIRTs and LEAs while remaining in line with the personal data legal framework provisions. Based on  applicable legislation and the common interpretation, in principle IP addresses are considered personal data. Not  only IP addresses but any online identifier that may be connected to natural persons (e.g. domain names, URLs, or  email addresses) is personal data. In addition, sometimes the threat/incident data or intelligence may contain not  only metadata but also content data.  It is therefore important to see to what extent IP addresses and other personal information related to the incident  are allowed to be shared between CSIRTs and LEAs. On LEAs, it is clearly marked in Article 2 d) of the GDPR that  there is no limitation, and in Recital 49, allows CSIRTs to process that information.  The Data Protection Law Enforcement Directive (Directive (EU) 2016/680) (European Parliament and Council of the  European Union, 2016) is an important point of reference on the subject. It clarifies that when the processing of  personal data by competent authorities is carried out for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection  or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, consent by the owner of these personal  data is not required. However, there might be other cases where the sharing of personal data between CSIRTs and  LE takes place and the related data process (including the sharing) must have a different legal ground, which could  be, for instance, the protection of public interest or the consent of the data owner.  4.2.3.1 An Introduction to the WHOIS registry/service  The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is ‘a not-for-profit, public-benefit  organisation’ that operates ‘the internet’s domain name system [DNS], coordinates allocation and assignment of  the internet’s unique identifiers, such as internet protocol [IP] addresses, accredits generic top-level domain (gTLD)  name registrars, and helps facilitate the voices of volunteers worldwide who are dedicated to keeping the internet  secure, stable and interoperable’ (ICANN, 2018a, p. 2).  WHOIS (21) is ‘the system that asks the question, who is responsible for a domain name or an IP address?’ (ICANN,  2018b) The WHOIS data may include ‘name, address, email, phone number, and administrative and technical  contacts’. WHOIS is a query and response protocol with data stored in a decentralised way; in other words, ‘the  (21) What is the domain WHOIS?   Publicly available database of registration information on registrants of a domain name.   Maintained by ICANN and its contracted registries and registrars.  What information?   Domain names details:   Domain name, IP address, Name server, creation/expiry date, domain status.   Information on Registrar   Registrar’s URL, registrar’s abuse email, phone number.   Information on registrants (domain name holder)   Registrant email, postal address, fax and telephone number.   Administration contact and technical details  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  47  WHOIS service is not a single, centrally-operated database’: the data are managed by independent entities known  as ‘registrars’ and ‘registries’. (ICANN, 2018c).  The registrar is ‘An organisation that verifies availability and reserves domain names on behalf of a registrant.  Domain names ending with .aero, .biz, .com, .coop, .info, .museum, .name, .net, .org, and .pro can be registered  through many different companies (known as ‘registrars’) that compete with one another. A listing of these  companies appears in the accredited registrar directory’ (ICANN, 2018a). ‘Any entity that wants to become a  registrar must earn ICANN accreditation’ (ICANN, 2018b).  The registry is an entity that ‘keeps the master database and also generates the ‘zone file’ which allows computers  to route Internet traffic to and from top-level domains anywhere in the world. Internet users do not interact  directly with the registry operator; users can register names in top-level domains (TLDs).  including.biz,.com,.info,.net,.name,.org by using an ICANN-accredited registrar’ (ICANN, 2018a, p. 23)  4.2.4 Fundamental rights  CSIRTs and LE handle various types of data. ‘All categories of data may be personal data’, e.g. content data but also  subscriber data; however, ‘they have a different level of interference with fundamental rights’ (European  Commission, 2018c). Based on the data dealt with, appropriate conditions and safeguards apply to their collection  and preservation and it is necessary to find a balance between the needs for collection and preservation of e- evidence and the protection of the fundamental rights of the suspect; this to guarantee the rights of third parties  (including the victim) and also the rights of the suspect during the criminal investigations and the right of the  accused to a fair trial.  It must be also noted that both LE and judiciary should request from CSIRTs only the information that is strictly  necessary. This is also imposed by Article 52 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights or the European Union  (European Parliament, Council and Commission, 2000), which provides that ‘Any limitation on the exercise of the  rights and freedoms recognised by this charter must be provided for by law and respect the essence of those rights  and freedoms. Subject to the principle of proportionality, limitations may be made only if they are necessary and  genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the [European] Union or the need to protect the rights  and freedoms of others’. For an overview of case-law of the European Court of Human Rights in the area of human  rights and criminal procedures see (McBride, 2018).  4.2.5 Chain of custody and evidence admissibility  Compliance with the chain of custody plays a fundamental role in the criminal trial, since it is not only the type of  data that has been collected that is important, but also the fact that the data are stored with continuity according  to certain technical rules (in addition to the guidelines mentioned in Section 3.1.4 — Admissibility of electronic  evidence in criminal courts, see Identification and handling of electronic evidence handbook, Document for  teachers, (ENISA, 2013b); Digital forensics. Toolset, document for students (ENISA, 2013a); Mobile threats incident  handling: Handbook, Document for teachers (ENISA, 2014); Methodologies for the identification of critical  information infrastructure assets and services. Guidelines for charting electronic data communication networks  (ENISA, 2015d); Forensic analysis. Webserver analysis handbook, Document for teachers (ENISA, 2018); and  Exploring cloud incidents (ENISA, 2016c)).  ‘The chain of custody through appropriate policy frameworks can be used in order to assess the quality of the  collected data. […] Chain of custody investigations may also help in establishing the hierarchical structure that  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  48  prevailed at the time that the acts under investigations were committed’ (Mitrakas & Zaich, 2009, p. 164 and 173 ).  The chain of custody aims to guarantee that the data has not be tampered with between its creation and its usage  in court. The main objective is to prove the data are directly connected to the suspect, so that the court can judge  based on reliable evidence, this means evidence is collected in a manner that protects civil liberties. To avoid  issues, evidence must be safeguarded at all times from the moment of the collection to the trial.  The chain of custody is relevant for the purpose of the admissibility of evidence, although how this admissibility is  regulated and dealt with may vary from Member State to Member State and depend on the different kinds of  data. For instance, in some Member States compliance with the chain of custody in the case of flow metadata is  only important for the evaluation of evidence, however in the case of content data to be used for forensic  examination compliance with the chain of custody is relevant for the admissibility of evidence (Home Office, 2014).  It should be noted that, in the latter case, there is usually no specific rule of inadmissibility for the violation of the  chain of custody. The inadmissibility of the evidence derives from the fact that the violation of the chain of custody  can be traced back to one of the general causes of inadmissibility of the evidence provided by the rules of a state.  4.2.6 Diversity of legal frameworks between Member States and the timing of the investigative  cooperation between Member States  In cross-border cases, the investigative cooperation between the different Member States is characterised by  some challenges due to the variety of legal system and legal provisions. In addition, the instruments made  available for such cooperation might not yet be sufficient to respond in a timely way to a request for a prompt  collection of the e-evidence that, as mentioned, is volatile and by nature easy to manipulate and destroy. There is  also the European Investigation Order (Directive 2014/41/EU), which can be issued by any Member State: the  receiving Member State is required to execute the order. It can also be used for the collection of electronic  evidence. There is also a proposal for the regulation on European production and preservation orders for  electronic evidence in criminal matters, which would allow any Member State judiciary to request e-evidence  directly from service providers (electronic communication providers, providers of information society services and  IP and domain registries).  Cultural challenges  From the online survey and from the interviews conducted for this report it emerged that cultural challenges also  impact the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE and their interaction with the judiciary. Some interviewees  affirmed for instance that the main difficulty is to make some judiciary personnel understand the technical  language of the CSIRT and to make the CSIRT understand the legal importance of some technical aspects. It seems  that the three communities have different approaches to problems and modus operandi and they speak different  ‘languages’: CSIRTs have a technical approach to problems, while judiciaries have a legal approach. The LEAs have  to relate with these two different mentalities and languages and ‘mediate’. Other interviewees highlighted that  the cultural challenges related to how an organisation deals with other organisations; for instance, statements  such as ‘my job is more important than yours’, ‘you have to share because I am the authority’ do not help the  cooperation, while having a liaison officer (even better with a physical desk available in the other organisation)  helps a great deal.  Also, the level and focus of training vary and the opportunities for CSIRT-LE-judiciary joint training are limited.  Nevertheless, training provides insights to other disciplines that might be required in interdisciplinary  environments, such as when there are interactions across technical and legal domains. Building on the  development of this capability can be seen as a suitable approach (ENISA, 2018, p. 26).  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  49  An ENISA report on Cybersecurity culture guidelines: Behavioural aspects of cybersecurity is currently under  preparation and expected to be published on the ENISA website by end of 2018 or beginning of 2019.  Technical challenges  Some technical challenges faced in the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE and their interaction with the judiciary  are discussed below.  4.4.1 Validation of the digital forensic tools  Digital forensics encompasses tools and techniques aiming to recover any element of data on a device, whether it  has been deleted or not. Digital forensics was introduced in police investigation with the advent of the  digitalisation of enterprises in financial cases to recover deleted evidence such as accounting documents and data.  It is a specialised field that not all IT personnel might be familiar with (IT staff are not always familiar with the  requirements on acquiring the evidence). Digital forensics is mainly linked with the system and network fields at a  very basic level: the inner structure of a hard-drive or the artefacts left by network operation in the core of the  operating system or live physical memory.  The tools and methodologies that digital forensic experts use need to be validated. The forensic tools fall under  national standards in order to produce evidence that is likely to be admissible in court, such a standard was  developed by NIST and was the first to be designed, using a testing protocol for hardware and software (NIST,  2018). The philosophy behind the validation of a tool belongs to the scientific experimentation field. To be  validated, a tool must provide results that are repeatable and reproducible. ‘Repeatable’ means using the same  method(s), on the same item(s), using the same equipment, by the same operator, within a short interval of time,  must lead to the same results. ‘Reproductible’ means that using the same method, on the same items, in a  different laboratory, by a different operator, utilising different equipment, must lead to the same results. An  indicative example is the Cyber Observable eXpression (CybOX TM) (22) that has helped with standardising, storing  and sharing digital forensic information; CybOX TM represents objects and relationships that are common in  forensic investigations.  No international standard is currently in place and each country has discretion as to what is admissible in court and  what is not. What is at stake for the Member States is to have evidence admissibility in computer forensics,  therefore a validation system for forensic methods and tools that are adapted to the each legal framework is  needed.  4.4.2 Different technical maturity levels across different communities  As of today, the level of technical maturity differs from country to country and across the judiciary. For resource  reasons, some LEAs might still lack the automation level that would allow for information to be processed and  exchanged more efficiently. LE and the judiciary are gradually engaging in digitalising their processes and bringing  them to a higher level of technical expertise.  (22) Cyber Observable eXpression (CybOX): https://cybox.mitre.org/  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  50  4.4.3 Lack of common tools, tools for automated or semi-automated transfer of the data, and  coordination tools  Arguably the most important challenge is the cybersecurity aspect: LE IT networks tend to be isolated ones. This is  due to the critical nature of the information stored in the LE system. To avoid taking too many risks, LE IT  management tend to choose to have very limited channels with the outside network. LE use isolated networks that  simply prevent them sharing information with the outside world due to technical restrictions (proxy, lack of open  IPs). This however makes information exchange, from a technical point of view, very difficult.  While the need for information sharing between the CSIRT and LE communities has started to be addressed by  tools such as MISP, there is no one tool in place, other than email, to help the coordination between the two when  dealing with a case (LEAs) or an incident (CSIRTs). For example,  a structured data and automation inducing tool  could be used by LE to mark specific resources (IP addresses, web domains, etc.) as being under investigation and  therefore CSIRTs would know to avoid interference with those resources in the incident-resolution phase.  4.4.4 Taxonomy-related challenges  It must be noted that ‘creating’ a taxonomy is not a simple task. When dealing with topics such as security  incidents, there can be different ways in which to classify them, and it is not always easy or possible to determine  which is the best or the most correct classification. Organisations defining  taxonomies are usually driven by  different needs, and since different CSIRTs have different expectations, teams often end up developing their own  incident classifications for internal use. In fact, the common taxonomy for LE and CSIRTs is itself an adaptation of  the Portuguese National Cybersecurity Centre’s CERT.PT (CERT.PT, 2018) taxonomy, which is itself an adaptation of  the European CSIRT Network eCSIRT.net movie taxonomy (Stikvoort, 2012). One main advantage of the common  taxonomy for LE and CSIRTs for its use in the context of cybercrime is that it has been extended to include the  mapping of the incident classifications with a legal framework. Similarly, there have been a number of taxonomies  that are in essence a branch or modification of another (GitHub, n.d. a) (ENISA, 2018). With the goal of reaching a  consensus on a reference security incident classification taxonomy, ‘ENISA and the European computer security  incident response team (CSIRT) community have jointly set up a task force’ (GitHub, n.d.). Taxonomies are  generally seen by national CSIRTs, LE and competent authorities as the most suitable way to deal with cybercrime  classification matters; this view has also been supported by an ENISA study (23).  LE and prosecutors need to associate the incidents with the provisions and typology of crimes in their legal  framework. It is essential for them to assess whether a fact (e.g. a cyber incident) can be qualified as a crime. The  judicial system normally does not use any taxonomy: at this stage, the event will have to fit into the criminal code  provisions. Choices will be made on a legal basis and investigation strategy. It is essential for CSIRT personnel to be  trained to identify cyber incidents that qualify as a crime and have the ability and be duly authorised to report to  the judiciary and/or LE in view of a potential investigation. A common taxonomy can become purposeful in this  regard as it is relatively easy to understand by CSIRTs (because they can just look at the incident from a technical  standpoint) while allowing LE and the prosecutors and judges to make the appropriate associations with the  provisions in the criminal code.  Some CSIRTs have developed a taxonomy which connects categories of incidents to the offences in the criminal  code and that help and support the interaction across the three communities. Indeed, such taxonomies propose a  (23) Common taxonomy for law enforcement and the national network of CSIRTs: https://www.europol.europa.eu/publications-documents/common- taxonomy-for-law-enforcement-and-csirts  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  51  way of handling each incident, specify the evidence that may be relevant and therefore should be preserved by the  CSIRT and provide additional information about procedural measures that can be used by LE and judiciary to  request and obtain relevant evidence. Also the common taxonomy for law enforcement (21) is linked with the main  international and European legislations: ‘any incident categorised in this taxonomy can be matched to the relevant  and appropriate legislative framework and subsequently mapped to relevant national legislation’ (Europol:  European Cybercrime Centre and ENISA, 2017, p. 5).  A common taxonomy has added a lot in efficiency and to the extent that it also covers internal processes of CSIRTs,  LEAs and the judiciary, all parties could better familiarise themselves with the language used by the other  collaborating communities. This is likely to increase the rate of adoption across all communities.  Organisational challenges  Some organisational challenges faced in the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE and their interaction with the  judiciary are presented here as identified according to the data collected for this report  4.5.1 Need for reciprocal understanding of the structures, roles and strengths  CSIRTs, LE and judiciary have different structures and roles. If CSIRTs have a light hierarchical system based on  operational matters, LE and judiciary organisations in comparison are much more hierarchical.  Although with some simplification we can say that; the CSIRT role is to mitigate an incident and get the system  back on track, the LE role is to find who committed the crime and collect the evidence, the prosecutor role is to  coordinate the investigations and bring the suspect to court if there are the conditions for it, the judge role is to  decide on whether the accused has committed the crime and the sanction based on the evidence provided.  Different structures and different roles might create some friction between those involved: LE might want to wait  and collect as much evidence as possible when the CSIRT might want to clean the system as quickly as possible and  get it back up and running. CSIRTs might want quick responses, while LE and the judiciary need to be in a position  to take certain formal steps to provide a response and comply with certain legal requirements whose fulfilment  might take some time.  What could also help enhance the cooperation and the interaction is a reciprocal understanding of strengths.  There is therefore a need for a reciprocal understanding across the CSIRT, LE and the judiciary communities. This is  a necessary element for a better cooperating and interaction.  4.5.2 Digital forensics expertise and the digital forensics training  ‘The exponential growth of digital traces, as well as the expansion of cybercrime, and digitisation of investigative  methods represent significant changes to society and lead to a broadening horizon of digital investigation (Casey E.  , 2017)’ (Henseler & van Loenhout, 2018, p. 78).  The digital forensics activities require expertise in: ‘data collection, data examination and data analysis. Data  collection involves the correct preservation and copying of digital data sources. Data examination relates to the  investigation of copies of digital data sources to find files, fragments etc. without interpreting the resultant  findings in the context of the case. Data analysis involves the analysis, reconstruction, interpretation and  qualification of the evidence which is obtained from the digital data sources’ (Henseler & van Loenhout, 2018).  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  52  There are, of course, police officer specialists in digital forensic investigations who are trained (24) and well- prepared to conduct digital investigations. However, since there are multiple areas that need to be covered in  digital investigations it is unlikely that all of those areas are known to a single expert or to a team of experts:  Windows forensics, Linux/Unix forensics, OS X forensics, mobile forensics, virtualisation/containerisation etc.  While police forces cooperate and exchange expertise, in some cases there is a need to request some expert  external support. CSIRTs are sometime therefore called to provide this technical expertise on some specific cases.  Although the use of concepts of (factual) witnesses, expert witnesses and forensic experts in different legal  cultures vary. For the purpose of this study, we can understand a factual witness as an individual who knows  specific facts about the case that could be important for the purpose of the criminal investigation. So, a factual  witness could be a CSIRT member who knows what happened in the CSIRT constituency. An expert witness, on the  other hand, is a specialist on a particular body of knowledge, who can provide valuable expert information to LE  and the judiciary. So, the expert witness could be, for example, a member of a CSIRT who knows nothing about the  case at hand, but can explain to the investigator, prosecutor or the court what specific digital evidence proves or  does not prove. From the perspective of the procedural criminal law, the status of the factual witness and the  expert witness is generally no different. The difference is in the nature and quality of the testimony provided.  Any specialist in a particular body of knowledge may become an expert who fulfils the established criteria and,  depending on the country, gets enrolled in the official register of forensic experts in given scientific fields. The  nature of these criteria varies considerably across countries. In some jurisdictions, only the court decides whether  or not the expert meets the criteria, in others the expert must be accredited or must hold a licence granted by an  independent body, elsewhere the expert must be a member of a professional organisation. In any case, only  forensic experts can provide expert opinions which serve as specific evidence in court. Expert opinions and their  processing also have a much more formal character compared with expert witness testimonies, and the  responsibility of the forensic expert for the quality of their opinion is higher and usually specifically legally  regulated.  Experts need to be chosen based on their skills and experience. Depending on the legal system, different levels of  verification of the expert’s skills maybe needed. In some systems CSIRTs might need to be accredited and included  in a specific register of digital forensics experts or a register of court experts to be in the position to provide  support during  criminal investigations and  criminal proceedings (judges and/or the prosecutor may also appoint  one or more digital forensics expert to evaluate some aspects of digital evidence). In addition, sometimes it seems  that there is some confusion regarding the skills and the role of digital forensics: an engineer or a computer  scientist is not always an expert in digital forensics.  The difference in education (mainly technical education for CSIRTs, mainly technical/legal education for LE and  predominantly legal education for the judiciary) might represent a challenge in their communication and way of  approaching the same matter. However, what might be seen as a challenge should also be seen as an enabling  factor and an element of enrichment especially in the context of the expertise exchange and joint training.  In addition, the recent rise in cybercrime has shown the limits of the forensic training: cybercrime requires  knowledge in almost all IT fields: systems, networks, programming, live memory, and electronics (the Internet of  Things (IoT). Digital forensics training for CSIRTs personal, LE and the judiciary needs to address these new  (24) Police officer training might mix internal and external/private courses. Depending on the country and the recruitment policy, these courses can begin  from scratch to train neophytes or be opened only to selected officers who already have a solid background in the subject.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  53  challenges, but sometimes the resources available for training are not sufficient to respond to needs which are in  constant development.  As emerged from the online survey, it seems that to have joint training for CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary is  considered as important or very important.  Figure 19 — Replies to question 13A of the online survey conducted for this report  According to the data collected, the joint training should address inter alia cooperation between CSIRT, LE and the  judiciary, digital collection, evidence analysis, digital evidence handling and the drafting of detailed reports to be  used in criminal courts.  Figure 20 — Replies to question 14 of the online survey conducted for this report  It is important that the CSIRTs are adequately trained to also handle the kinds of information that are usually not  useful for responding to an incident, but that could become e-evidence in a criminal trial.  Q14: Which topics  should joint training  for CSIRT, law  enforcement and  judiciary cover?  Q13A: How important is/would be to have  joint training for CSIRTs, law enforcement and  judiciary?  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  54  The digital forensics experts, including CSIRTs when they are called to support criminal investigations (and  evidence evaluation in criminal proceedings), must normally fulfil specific legal conditions and guidelines while  collecting or assisting in the collection of evidence (see below).  Figure 21 - Replies to question 7 of the online survey conducted for this report  In some countries there are codes of practice from the forensic regulators that stipulate that all providers of digital  forensics services to the criminal justice system must be accredited according to certain standards (on registration  requirements for forensic experts see also: (Henseler & van Loenhout, 2018, p. 80). In some countries, the  validation process however appears to be rather complicated. For instance, forensic experts may be required by  law to demonstrate professional qualifications, but it might happen that there is no official body to set or examine  these qualifications. The president of each court therefore decides what the necessary qualifications are for  forensic experts, and so the quality of experts in each court may vary. Also, due to strict requirements on  qualifications, in some countries, it might be complicated or even impossible for members of CSIRTs to become  forensic experts. In these cases, the only way would be to call the member of the CSIRT as a witness instead of as a  forensic expert.  The duties, powers and function of the forensic expert are often different from those of the witness. The  differences vary from one Member State to another. For example, there may be cases of incapacity and  incompatibility or even conditions of abstention or disqualification of witness when the requirements are different  from those provided for the forensics expert.  Investigators must carry out investigations in full compliance with various legal guarantees. Some of them are also  important in the context of CSIRT involvement. In particular, they are: the presumption of innocence (Council of  Europe, n.d., p. 9), the impartiality in the conduct of investigations (on this topic, see for instance (OLAF  Supervisory Committee, 2010), the reasonable duration for investigations, and the confidentiality of investigations.  From the online survey and from the interviews conducted for this report it emerged that cultural challenges also  impact the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE and their interaction with the judiciary. Some interviewees  affirmed for instance that the main difficulty is to make judiciary understand the technical language of the CSIRT  Q7 – Do personnel of CSIRTs - in particular of national/governmental CSIRTs - need  to adhere to specific legal conditions and guidelines while collecting or assisting in  the collection of evidence in support of an investigation?  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  55  and to make the CSIRT understand the legal importance of some technical aspects. It seems that the three  communities have different approaches to problems and modus operandi and they speak different ‘languages’.  Without resorting into generalisations, it could be simply stated that CSIRTs have a prevalent technical approach to  problems, while the judiciary obviously have a strict legal approach. The LE have to relate with these two  approaches and even languages used.  Also, the level and focus of training vary and the opportunities for CSIRT-LE-judiciary joint training are limited (25).  (25) Cybersecurity culture guidelines: Enhancing CSIRT/LEA community (provisional title) is currently under preparation and expected to be published on the  ENISA website by end of 2018 or beginning of 2019.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  56  Conclusions and recommendations  Conclusions  Using the analysis of the results collected from the desk research, the interviews with subject-matter experts, and  the online survey, the conclusions summarised below were drawn.  5.1.1 CSIRTs interact much more with LE than with the prosecutors and they interact very rarely with  the judiciary  Usually, CSIRTs interact with LE that, in turn, interact with prosecutors. The CSIRT rarely interacts directly with  prosecutors. Even more rarely the CSIRT interacts directly with judges. As a result, LE often act as a link between  CSIRTs and judiciary. CSIRTs and LE mainly have technical training while the judiciary has legal training. LE also  plays a fundamental role of link between subjects who have different training and use different languages.  5.1.2 CSIRTs support law enforcement (as well as prosecutor and judge) in a criminal investigation  The CSIRT technical background can provide a valuable support to criminal investigations, CSIRTs often have the  tools and experience of incidents that allow them to quickly deal with these incidents more efficiently. In addition,  CSIRTs can have data (e.g. IP addresses, web domains) that may be very important for the investigations.  Therefore, the CSIRT support activity for LE and/or prosecutors can be fundamental to identify who committed or  is going to commit a crime. Moreover, depending on the national legal system, the CSIRT personnel can sometimes  play the role of forensic expert or witness during a criminal trial.  5.1.3 There are legal provisions on CSIRTs and LE cooperation and their interaction with the judiciary  The diversity of legal systems is likely to shape the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE as well as their interaction  with the judiciary. However, the implementation of European Directives and the application of European  regulations are helping to reduce these differences between states. Regardless of the differences between legal  systems, the data collected via the interviews show that mutual trust is still a key factor for effective cooperation  between CSIRTs and LE and for effective interaction with the judiciary.  5.1.4 The understanding of whether CSIRTs have to report to/inform LE and/or prosecutor of  suspicious criminal activities could be improved  Depending on the Member State, the CSIRTs may be obliged or not obliged to report an event. In any case, CSIRTs  usually report crimes to LE and only rarely to prosecutors. From the data collected it emerged that overall the  understanding of whether CSIRTs have to report to/inform LE and/or prosecutor of suspicious criminal activities  could be improved. However, it seems that the practical experience and good relations between CSIRTs and LE  help CSIRTs comply with their legal obligations.  5.1.5 There is need for a more extensive usage of information from CSIRTs in criminal investigations  and as evidence in court  As emerged from the desk research and from the interviews, CSIRTs can play an important role in fighting  cybercrime; however, (at least as emerged from the results of the online survey) the frequency of usage of  information from CSIRT for criminal investigations and proceeding is low. It seems therefore that the usage of the  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  57  information that CSIRTs have and that might be key for responding to (cyber) crime could be extended at least in  frequency.  5.1.6 There is need to collect data in order to support cooperation in a data driven approach  As emerged during the desk research, the data available at the moment in area of CSIRT, LE and judiciary  cooperation are still quite limited. No evidence was found during the data collection for instance of the existence  of a central repository of data associated with investigations that involve all three communities.  It is important to collect more data in order to support the cooperation and the decision-making processes at  supranational and national level, but also at the level of the CSIRT, LE and judiciary teams involved in the  cooperation. On evidence-based policymaking see (Commission on evidence-based policymaking, 2017).  Having central repositories of data associated with investigations that involve all three communities, if based on  suitable metrics, could break new ground in the understanding of the interactions and priorities and possibly make  the investigation and prosecution more effective.  5.1.7 Cultural limitations can be noted in the cooperation across the three communities and an  interdisciplinary approach might help  Cultural differences across the three communities exist. If these cultural differences are factored in, the  information flow is hindered, and the cooperation becomes more difficult. While a data driven approach is quite  desirable, understanding the human and cultural aspects is important as well in order to gain appropriate insight  (ENISA, 2016, p. 18).  Sometimes the differences in culture are due to the fact that most of the members of the three communities  (CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary) have different backgrounds. For this reason, an interdisciplinary approach that values  all relevant fields of knowledge (namely legal and technical) is key to enhance cooperation this can also be  addressed through training and experience building.  Sharing experiences and looking at the information flow from all three community perspectives helps understand  potential, needs and priorities across the three communities.  Recommendations  According to the data collected via the online survey, joint training, regular meetings and feedback on the  information provided/shared are suggested to be the best ways to improve the information flow and interaction  across the three communities. See Figure 22.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  58  Figure 22 — Replies to question 13 of the online survey conducted for this report  Some recommendations have been formulated based on the data collected for this report (see below).  5.2.1 Collect data on cooperation and interaction across CSIRT, LE and the judiciary  The data available on the cooperation and interaction across CSIRT, LE and judiciary communities are quite  limited. Such data are key to enhancing the cooperation and interaction and to support related decision- making processes.  While the Member States, and in particular national/governmental CSIRTs, LE and judiciary, would collect  the data at national level, ENISA, EC3 and Eurojust could support this data collection by suggesting data  collection methodologies and methods, providing samples of questions and some common definitions of  key concepts, proposing metrics, indexes and data report templates. Data collected at national level could  be then aggregated by ENISA at EU/EFTA level.  Recommendations   National/governmental CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary: to collect data on cooperation across the three  communities.   ENISA, EC3 and Eurojust: to support the data collection.   ENISA: to aggregate at EU/EFTA level the data collected at national level.  5.2.2 Build on shared experience at strategic cooperation level  To have at national and EU/EFTA level, even possibly beyond, a common plan for the cooperation may help  enhance the cooperation. Sharing experience at strategic cooperation can be a first step towards this.  Recommendations   National/governmental CSIRTs, national LE and the judiciary: to share at national as well as at  EU/EFTA level their experience at strategic cooperation.   ENISA, Europol EC3 and possibly Eurojust: to facilitate, within the EU/EFTA and beyond, the sharing of  experience at strategic cooperation across the three communities.  Q13: What are your  suggestions to improve  the information flow and  the interaction across the  CSIRT, law enforcement  and judiciary  communities?  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  59  5.2.3 Invest in CSIRT/LE/judiciary joint training and skills development  Joint training across CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary would help share existing practices but would also allow the  development of collaborative approaches for the future.  Good training plays a central role in improving the cooperation, including communication of CSIRTs, LE and the  judiciary; joint training should therefore be facilitated.  There should be common understanding of legal and technical matters, including of the challenges faced by one or  more than one of the three communities. An example of topics is provided in Annex D — Examples of topics for  csirt/le/judiciary joint training.  There should be joint exercises based on real-life scenarios and hands-on sessions, where CSIRTs, LE and the  judiciary can practice jointly fighting cybercrime in order to better know each other’s objectives and needs,  especially what type of information each of them needs to do their job. The joint training might be also an  opportunity to further understand the potential that CSIRTs have (e.g. information, contacts, expertise) for the  criminal investigations.  Organising training at a regional level (e.g. for countries with similar legal systems or with other commonalities) as  well as engagement, for the joint training, with leading CSIRTs and national police forces beyond the EU could be  considered.  It is important to develop the awareness that such training is necessary. Therefore, CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary  should provide training to their personnel and joint training should not be perceived as occasional, but instead  scheduled at regular intervals. In addition, it is important to ensure the quality of training through the involvement  of highly qualified individuals and the use of suitable material (some freely accessible material is for instance  available on the ENISA site (ENISA, n.d.c).  Recommendations   National/governmental CSIRTs and national LE training centres: to organise CSIRT-LE-judiciary joint  training.   ENISA, Europol EC3, Eurojust and CEPOL: to facilitate joint training at EU and EFTA national level for  CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary and engage with leading CSIRTs and national police forces beyond the EU,  as appropriate.   CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary: to provide the training requirements to the facilitators of the joint  training.  5.2.4 To reach a better mutual understanding of the other communities and develop memoranda of  understanding to facilitate cooperation/interaction  Mutual understanding of roles, strengths but also of needs and limitations is key for the cooperation and  interaction across the CSIRT, LE and judiciary communities.  Communication and regular meetings between the three communities help reach this mutual understanding. Also  feedback on the information provided and shared or on how the requests for information have been formulated  would help to further enhance the mutual understanding.  In order to support the three communities to reach a better understanding of each other duties assigned by the  roles each community plays, a SoD matrix (see an example in Annex E — Example of segregation of duties matrix)  could be drafted at national level. The aim of this matrix is to highlight conflicting or overlapping duties performed  by one community or more. As shown in the SoD template in Annex E, the CSIRTs, LE, judges and prosecutors have  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  60  to identify the key responsibilities for their communities and then link them with the skills required to fulfil these  duties. SoD matrices are usually used to ensure compliance with laws and regulations.  In some Member States there are memoranda between LE and CSIRTs and, in some cases, also between the three  communities (CSIRT, LE and the judiciary). Based on these memoranda of understanding, for instance LE and the  judiciary are immediately notified by CSIRTs of IT incidents (especially more severe ones) and can immediately  coordinate their actions with the CSIRTs. This coordination activity reduces the risk that CSIRTs may erase  significant data just because they are unaware that such data may be critical for the solution of a criminal case.  Developing memoranda of understanding might also help manage expectations in the cooperation/interaction and  clarify the strengths, need for information sharing of the different communities and limitations they might have in  sharing the information.  Recommendations   National/governmental CSIRTs, LE and possibly prosecutor services: to work together towards a  better mutual understanding of strengths, needs and limitations of the three  communities (CSIRTs, LE  and the judiciary) in relation to the sharing information, also by using SoD matrices.   National/governmental CSIRTs, LE and possibly prosecutor services: to develop memoranda of  understanding to facilitate their cooperation/interaction.  5.2.5 Place liaison officers  To establish liaison officers (e.g. national/governmental CSIRT personnel to LE and to prosecutor and vice versa)  would be beneficial not only for trust-building knowledge but also for reaching a better reciprocal understanding  of the three communities and for facilitating the information flow.  Also providing that they liaise within the other organisation(s) from an allocated physical space (an office that the  liaison officer can use if needed) could help not only from the practical side but also to clearly affirm and recognise  this role.  Recommendation   National/governmental CSIRTs, LE and possibly prosecutor services: to appoint liaison officers to  facilitate the cooperation and the interaction.  5.2.6 Use (common) tools to facilitate cooperation and interaction  CSIRTs, LEs and the judiciary use different types of tools and this is natural given the differences in the roles of  these communities. One suggestion would be that the CSIRTs and LE (which could then feed the information to the  prosecutors when needed) have access to a common platform where they can share information about threats  and those involved in threats, cybersecurity incidents, cyber-attacks and associated tactics, techniques and  procedures (TTPs).  CSIRTs are rarely called as a witnesses in criminal proceedings; however, when this does occur, court information  systems to support cybercrime trials by means of presenting digital evidence may help CSIRTs better fulfil their  role.  Recommendations  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  61   National/governmental CSIRTs, LE and possibly prosecutor services: to investigate the possibility of  having a common platform to share information about threats and those involved in threats,  cybersecurity incidents, cyber-attacks and associated TTPs.   National/governmental CSIRTs, LE and possibly prosecutor services: to investigate how the tools they  use can be further improved to better receive the information provided by other communities and to  better formulate their requests for information addressed to the other communities.

Challenges can be legal, organisational, technical, cultural, etc.   Communication in most cases refers to the information sharing between different parties, in  particular CSIRTs, LEs and judiciary. Sometimes the term ‘communication’ is also used in its legal sense  of ‘policy document with no mandatory authority’ (European Commission (run by), n.a.c), such as the  Commission Communication on Strengthening Europe’s Cyber Resilience System (European  Commission, 2016). In a few cases it refers to the transmitted information or — especially when in  plural — to a system used to transmit the information. Communication is an essential component of  the cooperation between CSIRTs and LEs.   Computer security incident response team (CSIRT) or computer emergency response team (CERT) is  ‘an organisation that studies computer and network security to provide incident response services to  victims of attacks, publish alerts concerning vulnerabilities and threats, and […] offer other  information to help improve computer and network security’. At present, ‘both terms (CERT and  CSIRT) are used in a synonymous manner, with CSIRT being the more precise term’ (ENISA, 2015b, p.  7) (ENISA, 2015a, p. 12) (ENISA, 2016b, p. 10).   Cooperation and collaboration are synonymous in this report. They refer to the joint work —  especially of CSIRTs and LEs — in their coordination of actions, their reciprocal help and their joining  efforts to fight against cybercrime.   Criminal courts are courts in which criminal cases are tried and determined in order to appropriately  punish offenders.   Criminal investigation or crime investigation refers to the process of collecting (and preserving)  evidence to be used to ascertain a fact that might be considered as a criminal activity and determine  who is responsible for it. Normally this process starts when the suspected criminal activity is reported  to the LE (or to the prosecutor depending on the country), or when the LE or the prosecutor become  otherwise aware that such fact has been or is going to be committed and/or closed. The definition of  criminal investigation might somehow vary from country to country; a definition of crime  investigation can be found in (United Nations Office and Drugs and Crime, 2006, p. 1).   Criminal proceedings refer to proceedings aiming to ascertain if a crime has been committed and who  committed it. The adjective ‘criminal’ is used to distinguish them from other kinds of proceedings,  such as civil, administrative and disciplinary, which have different aims and are governed by different  rules.   CSIRTs network is the network established by the Article 12 of the NIS directive (European Parliament  and Council of the European Union, 2016e) ‘to contribute to the development of confidence and trust  between the Member States and to promote swift and effective operational cooperation’. It is  composed of EU Member States’ appointed CSIRTs and CERT-EU. The European Commission  participates in the network as an observer. ENISA is tasked to actively support the CSIRTs cooperation,  provide the secretariat and active support for incident coordination upon request.   Cybercrime is an umbrella term. An unequivocal definition of cybercrime does not exist. In general,  we refer by it to ‘Any offence where the modus operandi or signature [which refers to ‘the mental and  emotional motivations” (Geberth, 1995)] involves the use of a computer network in any way’ (Casey E.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  75  , 2004, p. 667). Cybercrime includes both crimes where computer is an object (e.g. illegal access to an  information system) or a tool (e.g. storage of illegal images on a computer device or usage of a  computer to plan a murder) of crime. It must be noted that ‘While many aspects of cybercrime are  firmly established, other areas of cybercrime have witnessed a striking upsurge in activity, including  attacks on an unprecedented scale, as cybercrime continues to take new forms and new directions’  (Europol, 2017).   Cultural aspects refer to the dimensions of the CSIRT-LE cooperation and their interaction with  judiciary that relate to culture. ‘Culture shapes our identities, aspirations and how we relate to others  and the world’. ‘The challenges are significant. Cultural diversity is an asset for the EU, but linguistic  and cultural differences lead to (…) fragmentation’ (European Commission, 2014a, p. 3).   EFTA: the European Free Trade Association (EFTA, n.d.) is the intergovernmental organisation of  Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.   Electronic evidence (or e-evidence) refers to ‘evidence stored in electronic form […] consisting in  stored subscriber data, access data, transactional data and content data’ (European Commission,  2018, p. 38).   EU Member States are the states that are part of the European Union. At present (status: 26 October  2018), there are 28 Member States (EU-28). In alphabetical order, they are: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria,  Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy,  Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia,  Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom (Europe Union, 2018).   Governmental CSIRTs are teams whose constituency are the public administration networks.  Currently ‘in the EU, governmental CSIRTs are typically used to protect the cyberspace of  governmental institutions including critical infrastructure [- more precisely, following NIS Directive  (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016e) and its Annex 2, the Operator of  Essential Services -] as well as to ensure cyber-crisis management” (ENISA, 2015c, p. 9).  ‘Governmental CSIRTs [indeed] mainly manage crisis and provide response to cyber threats and  incidents concerning the public sector, but in many cases also the critical infrastructures, and in  limited cases also the private domain, which however is usually within the remits of other CSIRTs in  the private sector. […] In some Member States, governmental CSIRTs have coordinating and  supervision functions for other relevant stakeholders, which proves to be a useful practice, especially  in those Member States where the response mechanism to cyber- attacks is quite complex, and/or a  significant number of different CSIRTs both in the public and the private sector co-exist in parallel”  (Council of the European Union, 2017, p. 66).   Information sharing refers to ‘the exchange of a variety of network and information security related  information such as risks, vulnerabilities, threats and internal security issues as well as good practice’  (ENISA, 2010, p. 9).   Incident is ‘any event having an actual adverse effect on the security of network and information  systems’ (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016e).   Incident handling refers to ‘all procedures supporting the detection, analysis and containment of an  incident and the response thereto’ (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016e).   Interaction refers ‘a mutual or reciprocal action or influence’ (Collins Dictionary).   Judges refers to a person who is in charge of a court of law and who makes final decisions.   Judiciary is the ‘entirety of courts and judicial authorities in a state or in another sovereign.  organisation such as the European Union (EU). The main task of the courts is to resolve legal disputes  and to ensure that the law is applied correctly and coherently’ (European Commission, n.d.). Judiciary  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  76  in this report refers both to prosecutors and judges (similar approach taken in (Council of the  European Union, 2017).   Law enforcement (LE), law-enforcement agencies (LEAs), police and police agencies are terms used  in this report are synonymous and used to refer to police and police agencies, also used as  synonymous. For this report, ‘law enforcement’ does not encompass prosecution services and courts,  which are referred to in this report as ‘judiciary’. LE usually fulfil the following missions: general  police, investigation, public order and security state missions (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2018).   Legal aspects refer to the dimensions of the CSIRT-LE cooperation and their interaction with judiciary  that relate to the rules and policies shaping and governing it, including obligations, discretion,  prohibition to share information in their effort to fight against cybercrime.   National CSIRT is a CSIRT that ‘acts as national point of contact (PoC) for information sharing (like  incident reports, vulnerability information and other) with other national […] CSIRTs in the EU  Member States and worldwide. National […] CSIRT can be considered as ‘CERT of last resort’, which is  just another definition of a unique national PoC with a coordinating role. In a lot of cases a national  […] CSIRTs also acts as governmental […] CSIRT. Definitions may vary across the EU Member States’  (ENISA, 2009, p. 8). A ‘crucial role in monitoring and responding to cyber incidents is played by the  national CSIRTs that the majority of the Member States have already established’ (Council of the  European Union, 2017, p. 12). Requirements and tasks for CSIRTs are listed in Annex I of the NIS  Directive (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016e).   Network and information system refers to ‘(a) an electronic communications network […]; (b) any  device or group of interconnected or related devices, one or more of which, under a program,  perform automatic processing of digital data; or (c) digital data stored, processed, retrieved or  transmitted by elements covered under points (a) and (b) for the purposes of their operation, use,  protection and maintenance” (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016e).   Organisational aspects refer to those dimensions of the CSIRT-LE cooperation and their interaction  with judiciary that relate to steps taken, procedures followed, resources available, etc. in their  cooperation to fight against cybercrime.   Practices refers to ‘something that is usually or regularly done, often as a habit, tradition, or custom’  (Cambridge University Press, n.d.).   Prosecutors: refers ‘a legal official who accuses someone of committing a crime, especially in a  [criminal] law court’ (Cambridge Dictionary, n.d.). ‘The public prosecutors’ office or prosecution  service […] is regarded as part of the judiciary in many Member States’ ’ (European Commission (run  by), n.d.(b)). Also, for this report prosecutors are considered as part of the judiciary.   Taxonomy ‘is defined as a classification of terms. Three characteristics define a taxonomy:  o a form of classification scheme to group related things together and to define the relationship  these things have to each other;  o a semantic vocabulary to describe knowledge and information assets; and  o a knowledge map to give users an immediately grasp of the overall structure of the knowledge  domain covered by the taxonomy, which should be comprehensive, predictable and easy to  navigate’ (ENISA, 2016a , p. 7).  ‘There is currently no consensus on concepts and definitions related to taxonomies’ (ENISA, 2016a , p.  5).  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  77   Technical aspects refer to the dimensions of the CSIRT-LE cooperation and their interaction with  judiciary that relate to the tools (e.g. applications, the platforms) and the methodologies used to  share information in their effort to fight against cybercrime.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  78  Annex C: An overview of legal systems, areas of law, and legal  traditions (common law and civil law)  Each Member State has its own laws and rules that govern the various facets of social interaction. The set of all  these laws and rules constitutes a legal system.  A legal system is divided into areas, such as: private law (which includes the civil law in the sense of the law related  to civil wrongs as opposite of criminal law which relates to crimes), public law, international law, European law,  criminal law (the law related to crimes), and criminal procedure. Every legal system has elements that characterise  all areas of law within that system. Depending on the legal system, the same area of law (for example, criminal  procedure) can be disciplined differently. On some specific matters, however, the Member States might have the  same legislation, or a very similar one, either since they come from a similar legal tradition or because the matter  is regulated at EU level.  The national legal systems can be divided into two main groups: the civil law systems (26) and the common law  systems. Some countries have mixed legal systems of civil and common law. Most Member States of the European  Union base their legal system on a codified civil law. Nordic legal tradition is generally consider as belonging to civil  law tradition but with some own characteristics (27). Member States with common law system include United  Kingdom, Ireland and Cyprus and a mixed legal system can be found in Malta. The European Union law is based on  the treaties and mixes civil law with an attachment to the importance of case-law of the European Court of Justice.  As seen in Figure 23, the map provides an overview of the different legal traditions in the EU and in EFTA.  The civil law systems derive from Roman law. These systems represent the legal systems of continental Europe and  those that derive from them. Even though individual civil law systems may vary widely both in procedure and  substantive law, there are common features, the main one being that its core principles are codified into a  referable system, which serve as a primary source of law.  The common law systems derive from the juridical tradition developed in England (United Kingdom) in the  Eleventh Century. Common law systems are English law, the United States law and those derived from them. The  main feature of common law systems is that the body of law is derived mainly from judicial decisions of courts. The  following main two differences should be mentioned between civil law and common law systems:   These two groups of legal systems attribute a different role to judgments. Only in common law  systems a case-law is considered not only as a source of law, but as a source of law of primary  importance. In the common law system, judges therefore have an active role in developing rules.  Instead, in a civil law system a case-law is not a source of law.   In the common law systems, the judge, except cases, must comply with what was decided by previous  judgments. In civil law systems the precedent can be important, but it is never binding for a new  decision and, in any case, it is not a source of law.  (26) The term ‘civil law’ has two meanings. It may refer to the non-criminal branch of law in a common law legal system, and to the continental law originating  in continental Europe and based on Roman law. In this study by ‘civil law system’ we mean the latter, the legal system based on continental legal tradition.  (27) ‘The Nordic countries lack a general civil code and are using a system of less comprehensive statutes supplemented by analogies from statutory  provisions, case-law and legal doctrine filling the gaps’ (Berniz, p. 28).  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  79  The difference between the different legal traditions and legal systems influences considerably the area of criminal  procedural law (described below) and so the interaction and information flow with the different players namely, as  far as concerns this report, the CSIRT, LE and the judiciary.  Figure 23 — Map Showing the Different Legal Traditions in the EU and EFTA (created with mapchart.net)  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  80  Annex D: The WHOIS registry  Most of the 21 subject-matter experts interviewed for this report expressed the opinion that, while the GDPR has  an impact on the publicly availability of certain WHOIS data used for the criminal investigations/incident handling,  in principle this has not impacted the way CSIRTs and LE cooperate. However, several interviewees highlighted that  because of the fact that the GDPR is applicable only as of 25 May 2018, it is difficult to make a complete  assessment of the changes or possible changes that might occur.  One of the WHOIS legitimate use indeed is for criminal investigations and incident managing (ICANN, 2018d).  Domain names are essential for criminals to run their infrastructures and malicious campaigns online. They need  domains for getting sensitive information from internet users (Phishing), to spread malicious software or to send  Spam to internet users. Even though criminals use fake or stolen identities to register domain names most of the  time, these identifiers are invaluable for detecting and preventing internet crime that depends on domain names,  like any legal online business.  On 25 May, the international law-enforcement community and the CSIRT communities have lost direct access to  personal data on registrants of domain names. This is having a very strong negative impact both on criminal  investigations online and on the security and defence of networks in general and represents a challenge for LE and  for the CSIRT community in the performance of their tasks. Therefore, timely access to what is now non-public  WHOIS information (without court order) should be ensured for both the LEA community and the CISRT.  LE now need to initiate formal legal process and MLA to obtain relevant information. This comes with a substantial  administrative burden as well as long delays (28). The delays involved in obtaining WHOIS data from registries,  registrars and lower-level providers through formal legal process may be much longer than the period for which  the data in question is being retained. By the time formal procedures are concluded, the data may therefore no  longer exist. This is significantly harming the public interest and has severe negative consequences for the rule of  law online.  For the CSIRT community the situation is worse because they do not have the mandate to request a court order so  they are dependent on the goodwill of registries and registrars to access the information.  ICANN community is currently trying to agree on a Unified Access Model to non-public WHOIS information for  entities which have a legitimate need (public interest). It is absolutely essential that both LEA and CSIRT have this  direct access because of their function.  Usage of WHOIS for Incident Handling and for Criminal Investigations  The ‘WHOIS is indispensable to the smooth operation of the DNS’ but it also ‘used for many [other] legitimate  purposes, including:   To establish or look into an identity in cyberspace, and as part of an incident response following an  internet or computer attack (security professionals and law-enforcement agents use WHOIS to  identify points of contact for a domain name.)  (28) EJCN statement on WHOIS database reform - WK 6398/2018 INIT – 29 May 2018.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  81   ‘To gather investigative leads (i.e. to identify parties from whom additional information might be  obtained). Law-enforcement agents use WHOIS to find email addresses and attempt to identify the  location of an alleged perpetrator of a crime involving fraud’ (ICANN, 2018d).  WHOIS and GDPR compliance  Some preliminary considerations should be made when addressing the WHOIS and its compliance to the GDPR:   The GDPR has been applicable as of 25 May 2018.   The GDPR builds on existing principles, such as the principle of lawfulness, fairness and transparency,  principle of purpose limitation and the principle of data minimisation.   The GDPR concerns personal data on individuals, not to legal entities.   In the context of the WHOIS some personal data, but not only personal data, are processed.   As discussed above (see Section 3.2.2.1) the GDPR does not apply to the processing of personal data  ‘by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution  of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the  prevention of threats to public security’. The data protection law enforcement directive applies  instead.   The legitimacy and the importance of access to WHOIS data for public policy purposes (firstly LE) is  uncontested.   LEs have a clear interest in having access to data in the WHOIS register when it is necessary for their  investigations; reason why some access procedures should be designed to ensure that LE can obtain  WHOIS data, not publicly available, within an appropriate time frame for the investigation (European  Commission, 2018).   The issue of the WHOIS and its compliance to protection of personal data rules was discussed also  well-before the GDPR has started to become applicable: the ‘EDPB [European Data Protection  Board]’s predecessor, WP29 [Working Party Article 29], has been offering guidance to ICANN on how  to bring WHOIS in compliance with European data protection law since 2003’ (European Data  Protection Board, 2018a).   With the approaching of the GDPR applicability and now that the GDPR is applicable, this discussion  seemed to have become more intensive.  Some recent developments of this discussion include:   A dialogue within ICANN and between ICANN and the main stakeholders to find viable solutions to  have a GDPR-compliant WHOIS while enabling legitimate uses by relevant stakeholders (including LE  and CSIRTs) as well as unpublished WHOIS data. For instance, ‘As work is ongoing within ICANN to  make this database compliant with data protection rules, in particular the general data protection  regulation [GDPR], the Commission sent a letter (European Commission, 2018) to ICANN on the dual  objectives of ensuring quick access to its directories for public interest purposes whilst being fully  compliant with EU data protection rules. The ICANN Government Advisory Committee, in which  national governments and the Commission are represented, voiced its concerns and called on ICANN  to ensure continued access to the WHOIS, including non-public data, for users with a legitimate  purpose.’ (European Comission, 2018). The European Commission in its ‘Technical input on proposed  WHOIS Models on behalf of the European Union.’ (European Commission, 2018) made observations  on the different proposed models to provide access by LE to certain WHOIS is data not publicly but  necessary for them for the performance of their task. Also the EDPB in its letter of 5 July 2018  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  82  provided ICANN with guidance to enable ICANN to develop a GDPR-compliant model for access for  legitimate purposes to personal data that are processed in the context of WHOIS but are not publicly  available (European Data Protection Board, 2018b).   The development of technical solutions (e.g. logging to access non-public WHOIS data) as well as of  accreditation programmes ‘allowing full access to non-public WHOIS data for LE and other legitimate  third parties (IP Rights, cybersecurity, etc.)’ (ICANN, 2018e). See for instance the Draft accreditation &  access model for non-public WHOIS data (ICANN, 2018f).   The recent court case of ICANN before German Courts (29), requesting an injunction against an  accredited registrar to reinstate the collection of all WHOIS data required under the their registrar  accreditation agreement: the registrar had stopped to collect some of these data (e.g. administrative  and technical contact information) when selling new domain name registrations because believing  that the collection of that particular data would be in violation of the GDPR; ICANN with this court  case also aimed to seek assistance on the GDPR interpretation. It must be noted that on  3 August 2018 the Appellate Court has determined that it would not issue such injunction and in  making its ruling, ‘the Appellate Court stated that the interpretation of the GDPR was not material to  its decision, so there was no obligation to refer the matter to the European Court of Justice’ (ICANN,  2018c).  (29)Below are summarised the main steps of this court case (status: 9 August 2018):   17 May 2018: effective as of 25 May 2018 (starting date of GDPR applicability), ICANN adopted Temporary Specification for gTLD  Registration Data (ICANN, 2018g), which ‘establishes temporary requirements to allow ICANN and gTLD registry operators and registrars  to continue to comply with existing ICANN contractual requirements and community-developed policies in light of the GDPR’ (ICANN,  2018g).   25 May 2018: ‘The internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) […] filed injunction proceedings against EPAG, a  Germany-based, ICANN-accredited registrar […]. ICANN has taken this step to ask the court for assistance in interpreting the European  Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in order to protect the data collected in WHOIS. ICANN's \"one-sided filing\" in Bonn,  Germany, seeks a court ruling to ensure the continued collection of all WHOIS data, so that such data remains available to parties  demonstrating legitimate purpose to access it, consistent with the GDPR’ (ICANN, 2018h).   29 May 2018: the Regional Court of Bonn decided that ‘it would not issue an injunction against EPAG. In rejecting the injunctive relief,  the Court ruled that it would not require EPAG to collect the administrative and technical data for new registrations. However, the  Court did not indicate in its ruling that collecting such data would be a violation of the GDPR’ (ICANN, 2018i) (sentence in German:  (ICANN v. EPAG Domainservices GmbH, 2018) - non-official translation to English: (ICANN v. EPAG Domainservices GmbH, 2018b).   13 June 2018: ICANN appealed against the ruling of the Regional Court of Bonn to the Higher Regional Court of Cologne, Germany, and  ‘again asked for an injunction that would require EPAG to reinstate the collection of all WHOIS data required under EPAG's Registrar  Accreditation Agreement with ICANN’ (ICANN, 2018c) (Appeal in German – Appeal in English non-official translation:  https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/litigation-icann-v-epag-immediate-appeal-redacted-13jun18-en.pdf )   21 June 2018: ‘the Regional Court in Bonn, Germany, decided to revisit its ruling in the injunction proceedings, which it has the option  to do upon receipt of an appeal (https://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2-2018-08-03-en)   18 July 2018: ‘the Regional Court [of Bonn] decided not to change its original determination not to issue an injunction against EPAG, and  referred the matter to the Higher Regional Court in Cologne for the appeal’   3 August 2018: ICANN announced that the ‘German appeal court (Appellate Court of Cologne) has issued a decision on the injunction  proceedings ICANN initiated against EPAG, a Germany-based, ICANN-accredited registrar that is part of the Tucows Group. The  Appellate Court has determined that it would not issue an injunction [emphasis added] against EPAG. In making its ruling, the Appellate  Court stated that the interpretation of the GDPR was not material to its decision, so there was no obligation to refer the matter to the  European Court of Justice’ [emphasis added]’ (https://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2-2018-08-03-en)  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  83  Annex E: Questionnaire to support the subject matter expert  Interviews  The questions below have been prepared to support the interviews with subject-matter experts to collect data for  drafting an ENISA report on ‘Current cooperation between CSIRT and LEA community and on possible ways to  further enhance their cooperation’ (provisional title: ‘The Interplay between CSIRTs, Law enforcement and the  judiciary in the fight against cybercrime: Closing the cycle’).

[1]  The data controller of the processing operation is ENISA Core Operations Department.  The legal basis for the processing operation is:  o Article 5(a) of Regulation 45/2001/EC[2] based on Article 3(b)(v) of the Regulation (EU) No 526/2013  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013, repealing Regulation (EC) No 460/2004[3],  stating that one of ENISA’s tasks is: to ‘support voluntary cooperation among competent public bodies,  and between stakeholders’. With the view of contributing to the fulfilment of such task and according to  the ENISA Programming Document 2018-2020 as approved by Management Board in Decision No  MB/2017/11[4], ENISA is drafting a report on ‘Current cooperation between CSIRT and LEA community and  on possible ways to further enhance their cooperation’ (see Output O.4.2.2 — Support the fight against  cybercrime and collaboration between CSIRTs and LEA); or  o Article 5(d) of Regulation 45/2001/EC based on the consent of the data subject.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  87  The purpose of this processing operation is to collect data via an online survey and some subject-matter  interviews for the drafting of the ENISA report on ‘Current cooperation between CSIRT and LEA community  and on possible ways to further enhance their cooperation’.  The following personal data are collected for the respondents of the online survey and of the interviews.  a. Contact data: name, surname, community they belong to (e.g. CSIRT, LE, prosecutors, judges, etc.),  position, affiliation, country, email address, phone number (optional).  b. Knowledge-related data: While participating in the online survey and by replying to the questions  during the interviews a respondent may produce data, for example data related to his or her knowledge  and analysis in the field of information security.  The recipients of the data will be designated ENISA staff involved in the data collection and drafting of the  report, and some external experts, selected by ENISA from the ‘Call for Expressions of Interest — List of  NIS Experts’ [5], supporting ENISA with the data collection and the drafting of the report. Only when explicit  written consent is provided by the data subject, name, surname, affiliation, country, might be included in  the acknowledgements of the report that is expected to be published in December 2018. The data may  also be available to EU bodies charged with compliance monitoring and inspection tasks.  While the online survey will be conducted by using the EU Survey tool [6], the interviews with subject- matter experts will be conducted face-to-face, over the phone, via skype or with other means to be  agreed with the interviewee.  Personal data will be kept up to a maximum period of one year after the publication of the report, expected  to be published in December 2018. After the end of this period, the contact data will be manually deleted.  However, knowledge-related data are kept by ENISA beyond this period in an anonymised form (without  linking to contact data) for future ENISA projects.

to further explore the cooperation between computer security incident response  teams (CSIRTs) (in particular national and governmental CSIRTs) and law enforcement (LE) by adding the important  dimension of their interaction with the judiciary (prosecutors and judges).  This report follows two reports that ENISA published in 2017: Tools and methodologies to support cooperation  between CSIRTs and law enforcement (ENISA, 2017), which focused on technical aspects and Improving  cooperation between CSIRTs and law enforcement: Legal and organisational aspects (ENISA, 2017a), which focused  on the legal and organisational issues of cooperation; both are available on the ENISA website.  This report aims to support the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE, as well as their interaction with the judiciary  in their fight against cybercrime, by providing information on the legal, organisational, technical and cultural  aspects, identifying current shortcomings and making recommendations to further enhance cooperation. The  geographical coverage is mainly the EU and European Free Trade Association (EFTA).  The data for this report was collected via desk research, interviews with subject-matter experts and an online  survey. The data showed that CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary are characterised by significant differences in roles and  structure. The kind of information to which CSIRTs and LE have access is different, this is one of the primary  reasons why sharing information between them is paramount to respond to cybercrime. Across Member States  different models/frameworks of interaction exist among the three communities (CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary).  Overall CSIRTs interact more with LE rather than with the judiciary. CSIRTs offer support to LE to collect and  analyse different types of evidence. CSIRTs are rarely called as witnesses in courts but the material they collect  during the incident handling might be used to decide on (cyber) crime cases.  Although the cooperation and interaction across the CSIRT, LE and judiciary communities work well in principle,  there are still some challenges to be faced. In particular, some legal aspects are seen as the biggest challenge with  issues such the diversity of the legal frameworks, data retention, the sharing of personal data (including internet  protocol (IP) addresses) and the confidentiality around criminal investigations as well as evidential admissibility of  digital evidence.  Core recommendations to improve the aspects of the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE and their interaction  with the judiciary are as follows.   ENISA, Europol EC3, the European agency for the enhancement of judicial cooperation (Eurojust) and  the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL): to facilitate joint training across  the three communities (CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary) on aspects of their cooperation among the EU and  EFTA addressing CSIRTs, LE and judiciary needs and engaging with designated CSIRTs in the MS and  national police forces beyond the EU, as appropriate.   National/governmental CSIRTs, LE and possibly prosecutor services: to work together towards a  better mutual understanding of the strengths, needs and limitations of the three communities  in  relation to the sharing information, also by using segregation (or separation) of duties (SoD) matrices.   National/governmental CSIRTs, LE and possibly prosecutor services: to appoint liaison officers to  facilitate the cooperation and the interaction.   National/governmental CSIRTs, LE and possibly prosecutor services: to investigate how the tools they  use can be further improved to better receive the information provided by other communities and to  better formulate their request for information addressed to the other communities.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  09  Introduction  Purpose  As stated in the Council of the European Union Final report on the seventh round of mutual evaluations on ‘The  practical implementation and operation of the European policies on prevention and combating cybercrime’  (Council of the European Union, 2017, p. 67), ‘CSIRTs do not have the powers of an LEA (law-enforcement agency)  vis-à-vis private subjects, but regarding attacks of a criminal nature (not all cyber incidents are criminal acts), have  an important role in supporting the investigations, as they can help to provide information and to secure electronic  evidence (e-evidence). It is therefore very important for this purpose that CSIRTs have a good cooperation with the  LE, as obtaining information and evidence effectively is essential for the investigation of cyber-attacks, considering  that data are very dynamic and can be lost easily’.  Collecting knowledge on current cooperation between CSIRTs and LE communities is a key step to enhance it.  While the 2017 ENISA reports on CSIRT and LE cooperation (ENISA, 2017) (ENISA, 2017a) aimed to better  understand in particular the legal/organisational and technical aspects of the cooperation, the purpose of this  report is to further explore this cooperation by adding the important dimension of their interaction with the  judiciary (prosecutors and judges).  Background of the report  In 2017, ENISA published two complementary reports addressing the cooperation between CSIRT and LE to fight  against cybercrime, one on legal and organisational aspects, the other on technical aspects.  The 2017 ENISA report on Improving cooperation between CSIRTs and law enforcement: Legal and organisational  aspects (ENISA, 2017a) confirmed that CSIRTs and LE often exchange information during the incident  handling/investigations both formally and informally and that trust is the key success factor for the cooperation. It  showed that there are challenges related to the variety of legal systems and legal provisions in the different  Member States; adding further complexity is the diversity of communication channels between the various  Member States that represents an issue for effective crime fighting.  The 2017 ENISA report Tools and methodologies to support cooperation between CSIRTs and law enforcement  (ENISA, 2017) also confirmed that CSIRTs and LE exchange information often during incident  handling/investigations both formally and informally and that trust is also the key success factor for the  cooperation. It highlighted that despite CSIRTs and LE having different objectives and methods for collecting and  processing information, there is, between the two communities, an increased reciprocal understanding of needs.  Furthermore, according to the data collected for that report, CSIRTs are more inclined to use open-source tools  (e.g. the malware information-sharing platform (MISP)) and the information sharing between CSIRTs and LE is  more ad hoc than systematic.  As highlighted in the 6th ENISA/EC3 workshop for national and governmental CSIRTs and their LE counterparts  (The Hague, 16-17 October 2017) (ENISA, 6th ENISA/EC3 Workshop, n.a.), the theme of interaction across CSIRTs,  LE and judiciary (prosecutors and judges) is extremely important. In the context of the fight against (cyber) crime,  indeed, it is not sufficient that evidence is collected, but it is also necessary that it is admissible in a criminal trial.  Compliance with technical and legal requirements is needed for the admissibility of evidence, notably adherence  to the criminal procedure requirements is of paramount importance.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  10  The ENISA programming document 2018-2020 includes ‘Objective 4.2. CSIRT and other NIS community building’.  Under this objective, ‘Output O.4.2.2 — Support the fight against cybercrime and collaboration between CSIRTs  and LEA’ has the goal to ‘to build upon the progress ENISA has made in supporting different operational  communities (e.g. CSIRTs, LE, European [Financial Institutes – Information Sharing and Analysis Centre] FI-ISAC) to  enhance mutually satisfactory ways to collaborate and support exchange of good practices among different  stakeholders in operational communities in Europe’ (ENISA, 2017b, p. 43).  This report is a continuation of previous ENISA work and it contributes to the implementation of the ENISA  programming document 2018-2020, Output O.4.2.2, in particular to what is planned for as ‘Current cooperation  between CSIRT and LEA community and on possible ways to further enhance their cooperation’.  Report objectives and scope  1.3.1 Report objectives  The 2017 ENISA reports on CSIRT and LE cooperation as well as previous ENISA work in the area focused only on  these two communities: CSIRT and LE. The objectives of these past ENISA reports were to analyse how these two  communities cooperate and share information both from the legal/organisational and the technical point of view.  They identify challenges to the cooperation (such as limitations in the availability of specialised personnel) and  propose ways to overcome them (such as to place liaison officers at both ends, to build and maintain a centralised  repository of tools and methodologies and to invest further in joint training).  They gather further knowledge on the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE by also looking at the dimension of how  their interaction with the judiciary helps to reach a better and more complete understanding of the dynamics,  synergies and challenges that characterise their cooperation in the fight against cybercrime.  The main objectives of this report are as follows.   Gather further knowledge and discuss the current (1) cooperation between CSIRTs and LE by adding  the dimension of their interaction with prosecutors and judges as far as it concerns their fight  against cybercrime.   Provide information on the relevant legal and policy framework shaping this cooperation and this  interaction.   Provide information on the information flow across the three communities (CSIRTs and LE and the  judiciary).   Provide information on the tools and methods used for the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE and  their interaction with the judiciary.   Identify current challenges to the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE and their interaction with the  judiciary.   Formulate and propose recommendations to improve the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE and  their interaction with the judiciary.  (1) Data collection cut-off date for this report: 28 August 2018.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  11  1.3.2 Report scope  The report focuses on aspects of cooperation between CSIRTs (national/governmental CSIRTs) and LE, and their  cooperation with the judiciary (prosecutors and judges).  The geographical coverage is limited to the EU (European Union, 2017) and EFTA  (EFTA, n.d.) (2). (See also (ENISA,  2015b)). This does not mean however that all these countries are covered in the report and that no reference to  other countries outside the EU and EFTA is made in the report. Possible specific differences among the EU and  EFTA, or between the EU and the United States, or the EU and Asia, also fall outside the scope of this report.  The report does not target a specific sector; considerations made can apply to cooperation between CSIRTs and  LEs and the interaction with the judiciary to fight against cybercrime (which includes crimes where a computer is  an object and crimes where a computer is a tool of crime) in all sectors (from finance to energy, from transport to  health).  Although some considerations might be made incidentally in this report on the general cooperation between LE  and judiciary, this is not the focus of the report, which looks at such aspect only as far as they are relevant for  reaching a better understanding of the cooperation and interaction between the CSIRTs, LE and judiciary  community to respond to cybercrime.  The fight against terrorism, cyberwarfare, cyber espionage by nation states, as well as the enforcement of rights in  civil and administrative courts, are outside the scope of this report, although some of the considerations  developed might be extended to them.  This report does not aim to present an exhaustive set of instantiations of cooperation between CSIRTs and LEs and  of their interaction with the judiciary, rather it seeks to facilitate the drawing of meaningful conclusions for the  purpose of enhancing such cooperation and interaction.  Target audience  The intended target audience are CSIRTs (mainly national and governmental CSIRTs but not limited to them) LE,  prosecutors, judges, as well as individuals and organisations with an interest in NIS.  Additionally, policy and law makers may benefit from select aspects of analysis as well as the recommendations of  this report, as they prepare policies and legislation for enhancing the cooperation between CSIRTs and LEs and  their interaction with the judiciary.  (2) In this report ‘n.d.’ stands for ‘no date’ and it is used in the references when no date could be found for the cited source.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  12  Methodology  The methodology chosen for this report and the way this methodology is presented in this chapter are largely  inspired by Chapter 2 of the 2017 ENISA reports on Improving cooperation between CSIRTs and law enforcement:  Legal and organisational aspects (ENISA, 2017a) and on Tools and methodologies to support cooperation between  CSIRTs and law enforcement (ENISA, 2017).  In keeping with these two 2017 ENISA reports, data for this report was collected by desk research, interviews with  subject-matter experts and an online survey. A qualitative methodological approach has mainly been used due to  the rather new field addressed; however, some quantitative data were also collected: an online survey was  conducted to validate and complement the findings from the desk research and the interviews.  Information collection instruments used  2.1.1 Desk research  A first desk research was conducted based on publicly available information sources, including ENISA publications.  The findings from this desk research were particularly useful for the scoping of the report and for drafting the  questionnaire to support the interviews.  Supplementary desk research was conducted to address certain specific topics that the project team deemed  appropriate to examine in more depth following the analysis of the data collected via the interviews. These  included topics such as the recent discussion on access to the WHOIS database (DB) by LE.  Concerning the legal research, legal material (including some case-law) for instance fundamental principles of  criminal procedure, comparative criminal law and procedure, and European law, was consulted.  2.1.2 Interviews and written replies to the questionnaire  A total of 21 subject-matter experts from 11 Member States replied to the questionnaire either via structured  interviews or with written replies. Of the respondents, nine were experts from the CSIRTs community (mainly but  not exclusively from national/governmental CSIRTs), seven from the LE community (mainly national police but also  one from a local police force), and five from the judiciary community. This is in addition to the respondents of the  online survey.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  13  Figure 1 — Overview of communities of respondents to the interviews conducted for this report  A questionnaire (see Annex E — Samples of questionnaires to support the interviews) was prepared to support the  interviews. Most questions were open. For all questions, including yes/no questions, interviewees could add  comments and additional information.  The interviews included some questions common to CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary, followed by a specific set of  questions for each community.  A pilot phone interview was conducted in June 2018. In addition, the questions were tested with an additional  respondent to verify its suitability to be answered in writing. In addition to data for the report, the two pilot  interviews served as a means to collect feedback on how the interview was received and avoided, for instance,  unclear or inappropriate questions that might have decreased the willingness of the respondents to provide  answers. The pilot interviews were also useful to verify the time to allocate to the interview.  The interviews were carried out from June to mid-July 2018. They were conducted either face-to-face or via phone  and they lasted around 1 hour each. Interviewees received the questions in advance and in most cases, they had  the opportunity to review the notes taken by the interviewers (project team) with their replies and validate them.  Of the 21 respondents, five asked to reply to the questions in writing as this was more convenient for them.  Some interviewees, or representatives of the same organisation of interviewees, also completed the online survey.  While the questionnaire developed to collect data for the 2017 ENISA reports focused only on CSIRT and LE  cooperation, the questionnaire developed to collect data for this 2018 report addresses also their interaction with  the judiciary and aims to collect more in-depth information on some topics, such as joint training.  The interview questions started with a set of common questions for all participants to answer, followed by three  sets of specific questions for CSIRTs, LE or judiciary to answer respectively. In comparison to the interviews  conducted for the 2017 ENISA reports on CSIRTs and LE cooperation, the interviews for this report covered inter  alia the additional dimension of the interaction with the judiciary.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  14  2.1.3 Online survey  An online survey was conducted to collect additional data to validate and further substantiate some findings. It  was composed of 16 questions (see Annex F — Questions in the online survey), all with closed answers and some  with the possibility to add additional comments and provide more details related to the answers.  The survey was developed using  EUSurvey (3), a survey tool which is ‘supported by the European Commission’s ISA  programme, which promotes interoperability solutions for European public administrations’ (European  Commission, n.d.(b)).  The invitation to complete the survey was disseminated as follows.   A closed ENISA mailing list of European national and governmental CSIRTs, which includes around 60  teams.   Via Europol (Europol, n.d.) to the European Union cybercrime task force (EUCTF), which is ‘composed  of the heads of the designated national cybercrime units throughout the EU Member States and  Europol. The EUCTF (4) is an interagency group formed to allow the heads of cybercrime units,  Europol, [the International Criminal Police Commission] Interpol, the European Commission, Eurojust,  Norway, Switzerland and Iceland to discuss the strategic and operational issues related to cybercrime  investigations and prosecutions within the EU and beyond’ (Council of the European Union, 2017b, p.  13).   Via Eurojust (Eurojust, n.d.) to the judicial authorities of the European judicial cybercrime network,  which is composed by ‘at least one national representative of the judicial authorities with appropriate  expertise to participate in the network’ and was set up to ‘provide a centre of specialised expertise  supporting judicial authorities, i.e. prosecutors and judges dealing with cybercrime, cyber-enabled  crime and investigations in cyberspace” (5) (Council of the European Union, 2016, p. 2).  The survey was launched in July 2018 and was open for around 2 weeks. The data collected via the online survey  was used to validate the data collected through the desk research and the interviews and used to produce some  statistical graphs.  A total of 36 replies were received. Of these, 34 were from EU Member States (European Union, 2017) and EFTA  countries (EFTA, n.d.), one from a non-EU/non-EFTA country and one from another organisation. It must be noted  that the two replies from non-EU/EFTA countries were somewhat in line with the other replies received and have  been used to formulate general considerations; however, the graphs in this report were developed based only on  the 34 replies from EU and EFTA respondents, to ensure full consistency with the geographical scope of the report.  Of the 34 EU and EFTA respondents, seven respondents were from the CSIRT community, 17 from the LE  community, one belonged to both of these communities, and nine were from the judiciary (eight prosecutors and  (3)  https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/home/welcome  (4) In execution of the JHA Council conclusions of 27-28 November 2008 and of the 26 April 2010, Europol together with the European Commission and the  EU Member States have set up the European Union cybercrime task force (EUCTF) composed of the Heads of the designated national cybercrime units  throughout the EU Member States and Europol. The EUCTF is an interagency group formed to allow the Heads of Cybercrime Units, Europol, the European  Commission and Eurojust to discuss the strategic and operational issues related to cybercrime investigations and prosecutions within the EU and beyond.

An overview of the composition of the EU and EFTA respondents, based on the community they belong  to, is presented hereinafter in Figure 2.  Figure 2 — Overview of communities of respondents to the online survey conducted for this report  Most respondents replied to all questions, despite most questions not being mandatory. Some respondents used  the comment boxes to provide extra information.  Data used to develop the recommendations  The recommendations in this report (see Chapter 5) have been developed based on research findings of this  report.  Selection and classification of the stakeholders  The project team discussed and agreed on criteria to use to ensure contribution of a wide range of stakeholders.  The following criteria (which were not prioritised but considered as equal) were used for the selections of  interviewees:   CSIRTs/LE/judiciary community   geographical location   size of country (population)   level of maturity in CSIRT-LE cooperation   level of CSIRT maturity (6)   size of the CSIRT   common law/civil law legal tradition.  (6) On CSIRT maturity, see (ENISA, n.d.(a)).  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  16  Contribution by subject-matter experts  ENISA selected eight external subject-matter experts from the list of NIS experts compiled following the ENISA CEI  (Ref. ENISA M-CEI-17-T01) (ENISA, n.d.(b)).  Six of them contributed to this report by supporting the data collection and the drafting while two were reviewers.  The two CEI experts contributing as reviewers reviewed this report in several rounds including the first draft in  April 2018, an intermediate draft in June 2018, the semi-final and the final draft in August 2018. They reviewed it  in addition to ENISA reviewers and other external reviewers.  All eight experts contributed ad personam.  These experts contributed inter alia with their expertise in NIS aspects of cybercrime, including but not limited to  CSIRT and law cooperation, operational cooperation, information sharing to handle incidents and to fight against  cybercrime.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  17  CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary: framework, information flow and tools  This chapter gives an overview of select legal provisions which have an influence on the rules governing the  criminal procedures, including the admissibility of digital evidence. This chapter also discusses in detail the roles,  structures and strengths of CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary and explores the current interaction and the information  flow and the tools used.  Some general remarks  Below some preliminary remarks are made related to the context surrounding the cooperation between CSIRTs  and LE and their interaction and information flow with the judiciary.  3.1.1 Criminal procedures: non-adversarial versus adversarial  ‘The Member State judicial systems are very diverse, reflecting differences in national judicial traditions (European  Justice, n.d.(a)) and the legal traditions have an influence on the various areas of law. Concerning criminal  procedural law, a distinction should be made between the non-adversarial system (also called, inquisitorial  system), typical of civil law tradition, and the adversarial system (also called adversary system), typical of common  law countries, (Delmas Marty & Spencer, 2004).  In an adversarial system (or adversary system) a criminal trial is conceived as a conflict or dispute. Each of the  parties supports a contrary position. In these systems the oral evidence is of fundamental importance and the  method of taking such evidence is based on the so-called cross examination. Although there are exceptions, in  such a system the judge does not tend to play an active role in the collection of evidence. The judge must in fact  guarantee respect for fairness and equality and be neutral with respect to the parties. The decisions of the judge  set precedents.  In a non-adversarial system, the criminal trial is not conceived as a conflict or dispute but is instead conceived as  something like an inquiry. In such a system, the judge sometimes has a more active role in the collection of  evidence and can also interview the witnesses.  These differences between non-adversarial system and adversarial systems may influence the shaping of the  relationships between CSIRTs and LE and the judiciary. Furthermore, the value of e-evidence can also change  between the systems.  3.1.2 Criminal proceedings  Since this report deals with the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE and their interaction with the judiciary, the  focus is on criminal proceedings.  As defined above, by criminal proceedings we refer to proceedings aiming to ascertain whether a crime has been  committed and if so, by whom.  Principles and rules governing criminal proceedings are different from those governing civil, administrative,  disciplinary or other proceedings.  The criminal procedure in each country is governed by the relevant legal provisions, in most cases by the criminal  procedure code or similar. While criminal procedure differs dramatically by jurisdiction, in most cases we can  identify common principles and features.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  18  To ascertain whether a crime has been committed and if so, by whom, it is necessary to carry out a criminal  investigation. This is followed, once there are the conditions for it (e.g. sufficient elements to believe that the  suspect committed the crime), by a criminal charge and a formal criminal trial, which can be either non-adversarial  or adversarial in form (based on the legal system, as discussed above). At the trial, the judge (or the jury) finds the  defendant either guilty or not guilty based on the evidence presented by the prosecutor and the defendant. In a  criminal trial the prosecution bears the burden of proof, which means that the prosecutor must prove beyond  reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the crime.  While most criminal cases are decided before national (or regional, or local) courts, under certain conditions it is  possible that the process is held by a supranational court, such as one of the following.   The European Court of Human Rights (European Court of Human Rights, n.d.), which rules on  individual or state applications alleging violations of the rights set out in the European Convention on  Human Rights. It has its seat in Strasbourg, France. For an overview of case-law of the European Court  of Human Rights in the area of human rights and criminal procedures see (McBride, 2018).   The Court of Justice of the European Union (Court of Justice of the European Union, n.d.), which  ensures compliance with EU law and rules on the interpretation and application of the treaties  establishing the European Union. It has its seat in Luxembourg.   The International Court of Justice (International Court of Justice, n.d.), which is a body of the United  Nations based in The Hague, The Netherlands.  The outcome of most criminal law cases depends upon the admissibility and strength of evidence presented by the  prosecution or the defence. The evidence can take many different forms including physical evidence, testimonies,  documents or e-evidence. While the admissibility of evidence is discussed in the following section, on the strength  of the evidence we can say that the rules and practices for determining it differ from one jurisdiction to another,  but in general, the standard of proof is high in criminal proceedings and therefore high-quality evidence is  expected. Therefore, it is desirable (particularly in the case of electronic evidence) to ensure close cooperation  between public prosecutors and experts to ensure that evidence is collected and handled with professional care.  As mentioned in Section 1.5 — Definitions of key concepts, we can, in general, identify two main categories of  cybercrime.   Cybercrimes in the strict sense, are crimes where the computer is the object and they are normally  also committed by means of information technology (IT) tools. This is the case of illegal access to  information system.   Cybercrimes in a broad sense, which are crimes that are committed by using an IT tool but could also  be committed without the use of IT tools, like in cases when data is instrumentalised, e.g. homicide of  a patient by manipulating data related to that patient’s health (i.e. the medical treatment  administered according to the manipulated patient details results in the patient’s death).  Except for cases dealt by a supranational court, normally (cyber) crime cases are decided before national (or  regional, or local) courts.  3.1.3 Admissibility of electronic evidence in criminal courts  As highlighted in Council of the European Union Final report on the seventh round of mutual evaluations on ‘The  practical implementation and operation of the European polices on prevention and combating cybercrime’, the  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  19  ‘nature of e-evidence may create issues regarding admissibility that do not arise with other types of evidence. For  this reason, in some Member States there are specific requirements regarding the collection of e-evidence to be  admissible in courts. However, the evaluation has shown that in most Member States, procedural law is mainly  technology-neutral, which means that general rules and principles on gathering of evidence are applied and that  the procedural system does not contain any specific formal rules on admissibility and assessment of e-evidence’  (Council of the European Union, 2017, p. 11). On the topic of e-evidence in court see for instance the AEEC project  (Admissibility of electronic evidence in court (AEEC) project, 2006), a pioneer EU project in the field (see also (Insa,  Fredesvinda , 2007), and the Evidence project (Evidence project).  It is important that the collection of e-evidence complies with all of the relevant principles, such as data integrity,  audit trail, specialist support, appropriate training and legality (ENISA & Anderson, 2014a, p. 5).  E-evidence is fragile by nature and often volatile. Digital data can be easily lost or altered. If e-evidence is collected  in an unsuitable manner, there is a risk that the content of that e-evidence does not correspond to the original  content. There is therefore the risk that e-evidence cannot be used to help establish (or refute) that a crime has  been committed. To avoid this risk, some best practices have been developed internationally. It is important that  all personnel dealing with e-evidence know these best practices. Examples of best practices include the ISO  Guidelines for identification, collection, acquisition, and preservation of digital evidence (International Organisation  for Standardisation (ISO), 2012), the NIST Guide to integrating forensic techniques into incident response (SP-800- 86) (National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), 2006) (in particular, NIST  Chapter 3), Electronic  evidence — A basic guide for first responders (ENISA & Anderson, 2014a), Data acquisition guidelines for  investigation purposes (CERT-EU, 2012), the Guidelines on digital forensic procedures for OLAF staff (EU: European  Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), 2016a)), and the United Kingdom ACPO Good practice guide for digital evidence (The  Association of Chief Police Officers of England, Wales and Northern Ireland (ACPO), 2012).  Applicable legal and policy framework  This section gives an overview of the relevant legal and policy framework that shapes the cooperation and  interaction between CSIRTs, LE and their interaction with the judiciary. The section goes on to discuss recent  developments that may impact or influence this cooperation and interaction such as the recent introduction of the  General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016b).  3.2.1 An Overview of the relevant legal and policy framework  The legal and policy context play an important role in governing and shaping the cooperation between CSIRTs and  LEs and their interaction with the judiciary in the context of fighting against cybercrime. The main legislative and  policy components of this framework are listed below. More information on the legal and policy framework is  available in the 2017 ENISA report Improving cooperation between CSIRTs and law enforcement: Legal and  organisational aspects (ENISA, 2017a).   The national legal and policy framework governs and shapes the cooperation between CSIRTs and LEs  and their interaction with the judiciary. Transposition of the international and European law is an  important component of the national criminal law and criminal procedure law. There might be  however some specificities in legislative provisions depending on the country.   At the international level, the Council of Europe convention on cybercrime (Council of Europe, 2001),  often referred to as the ‘Budapest Convention’, is the first international treaty and remains the most  relevant international treaty on cybercrime and electronic evidence. It is the ‘only binding international  instrument on this issue. It serves as a guideline for any country developing comprehensive national  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  20  legislation against cybercrime and as a framework for international cooperation between state parties  to this treaty’ (Council of Europe, n.d.)   At EU level several legal and policy instruments are particularly relevant when discussing the  cooperation between CSIRTs and LEs, inter alia the following.   Directive on attack against information systems (European Parliament and Council of the European  Union, 2013a).   NIS Directive (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016e).   Cybersecurity strategy of the European Union (CSS)(European Commission and High  Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, 2013).   Joint Communication on resilience, deterrence and defence: Building strong cybersecurity for the  EU (European Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affiairs and Security  Policy, 2017).   Commission recommendation on coordinated response to large scale cybersecurity incidents and  Crises (‘Blueprint’) (European Commission, 2017a).   Commission communication on strengthening Europe’s cyber resilience system (European  Commission, 2016).   European Investigation Order (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2014).   EU data protection legislation, including the GDPR (European Parliament and Council of the  European Union, 2016b), Directive on privacy and electronic communications (European  Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2002), law enforcement data protection directive  (LEA DP Directive) (Council of the European Union, 2008) (GDPR is addressed in this report in more  detail in Section 3.2.2.1.)   Proposal for a Regulation on European production and preservation orders for electronic evidence  (European Commission, 2018) (Addressed in more detail in Section 3.2.2.2.)   Proposal for a directive laying down harmonised rules on the appointment of legal representatives  for the purpose of gathering evidence in criminal proceedings (European Commission, 2018a)  (Addressed in more detail in Section 3.2.2.2.)   ENISA regulation (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2013b).   In addition, there are some EU instruments that play a role in support of the cybersecurity  collaboration at international scale, such Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace (IcSP)  (European Commission, n.d.(e)), European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) (European Union  External Action Service, 2017) and Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) (European  Commission, n.d.(f)).  Some of the most significant recent developments in the legal and policy framework shaping the CSIRT and LE  cooperation and the interaction with the judiciary concern these two areas.   The GDPR (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016b) and data protection law  enforcement directive (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016).   The proposals for a regulation and for a directive to improve cross-border access to e-evidence  (European Commission, 2018) (European Commission, 2018a).  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  21  3.2.2 Some recent developments  3.2.2.1 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the data protection law enforcement directive  The GDPR (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016b)  strengthens the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free  movement of such data. It came into force on 24 May 2016 and applied from 25 May 2018. Some Member States  have already adopted this legislation, others are working on its preparation, but this does not affect the binding  nature of the regulation itself.  The Data Protection Law Enforcement Directive (Directive (EU) 2016/680) ‘protects citizens’ fundamental right to  data protection whenever personal data are used by criminal-law-enforcement authorities. It will ensure that the  personal data of victims, witnesses, and suspects of crime are duly protected and will facilitate cross-border  cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism’ (European Parliament and Council of the European Union,  2016). It entered into force on 5 May 2016 and EU countries had to transpose it into their national law by  6 May 2018. Currently (status: 26 October 2018, see (EUR-lex, n.d.)), only 16 Member States (Belgium,  Czech  Republic, Germany, Ireland, France, Croatia, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, Austria, Portugal,  Slovakia, Sweden and the United Kingdom) reported adoption of transposition measures in relation to this  Directive.  The GDPR and the data protection law enforcement directive have different scopes.   Article 1.1 of the GDPR provides that ‘this regulation lays down rules relating to the protection of  natural persons regarding the processing of personal data and rules relating to the free movement of  personal data’ (7);   Article 1 of the data protection law enforcement directive ‘lays down the rules relating to the  protection of natural persons regarding the processing of personal data by competent authorities for  the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the  execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to  public security’.  Due to the respective field of application of the GDPR and the data protection law enforcement directive, it can be  said that in principle, both the GDPR and data protection law enforcement directive may apply to the CSIRTs when  they deal with (including storing) personal data. However, it depends on the case.  Under Article 6.1 a) of the GDPR, the processing of personal data, including IP addresses, is permitted for a  specific, necessary and proportionate purpose (purpose of legitimate interest pursued by the CSIRTs, as specified  on Article 6.1 f) if the data subject (the person concerned, the person whose personal data are processed) gives  consent. In the event of an IT incident, there is no consent from the data subject (e.g. IP address holder) who  caused the incident. However, according to the GDPR (see Article 13.3) and to Recital 49 it can be considered that  the personal information, under certain circumstances, can be processed by the CSIRT even without consent.  Recital 49 indeed provides that ‘The processing of personal data to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate  for the purposes of ensuring network and information security, i.e. the ability of a network or an information  system to resist, at a given level of confidence, accidental events or unlawful or malicious actions that compromise  (7) The first judgment on Regulation (EU) 2016/679 was issued on 29 May 2018. This is a German ruling, specifically, of the Court Order of the Regional Court  of Bonn, 10 O 171/18, on the principle of data minimisation (ICANN v. EPAG Domainservices GmbH, 2018). Non-official translation to English (ICANN v.  EPAG Domainservices GmbH, 2018b).  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  22  the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored or transmitted personal data, and the security  of the related services offered by, or accessible via, those networks and systems, by public authorities, by  computer emergency response teams (CERTs), CSIRTs, by providers of electronic communications networks and  services and by providers of security technologies and services, constitutes a legitimate interest of the data  controller concerned. This could, for example, include preventing unauthorised access to electronic  communications networks and malicious code distribution and stopping “denial of service” [DoS] attacks and  damage to computer and electronic communication systems.’  If a CSIRT processes personal information, including IP address, on the basis of a specific mandate or delegation  from competent authorities (e.g. by a police officer or by the prosecutor) for the purposes of the prevention,  investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences, the GDPR does not apply, the data protection law  enforcement directive will apply to CSIRT instead.  As explained in Recital 11 of the data protection law enforcement directive ‘competent authorities [for the  purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of  criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security, respecting  the specific nature of those activities] may include not only public authorities such as the judicial authorities, the  police or other law-enforcement authorities but also any other body or entity entrusted by Member State law to  exercise public authority and public powers for the purposes of this directive’ (European Parliament and Council of  the European Union, 2016). Therefore, if the CSIRT is bound by contract/legal act to collect and process personal  data solely for the purposes mentioned in the directive, GDPR does not apply. The application of the GDPR on the  other hand remains unaffected for the processing of personal data by the CSIRTs outside the scope of this  directive.  The data protection law enforcement directive applies to LEA if the directive has been implemented in the  Member State (a Directive, unlike a Regulation, is not directly applicable). This directive does not require the  consent of the data subject, depending on the particular purposes for which the data are processed.  According to Article 2 par. 2 (d), the GDPR does not apply to the processing of personal data ‘by competent  authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the  execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security’.  Although the GDPR does not apply in these cases, the data protection law enforcement directive applies instead8.  Article 45 par. 2 of the data protection law enforcement directive stipulates the conditions of control by the  supervisory authority and it states that ‘Each Member State shall provide for each supervisory authority not to be  competent for the supervision of processing operations of courts when acting in their judicial capacity’.  3.2.2.2 Proposals for a regulation and a directive to improve cross-border access to electronic  evidence  As stated in the European Communication of April 2018 in the Fourteenth progress report towards an effective and  genuine security Union, ‘Electronic evidence has become relevant in a large majority of criminal investigations and  increasingly often, judicial authorities need to make a request in another jurisdiction to obtain necessary evidence  8 See art. 1 Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of  natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention,  investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and on the free movement  of such data, and repealing Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  23  from service providers. Making it easier and quicker to obtain this evidence across borders is therefore of crucial  importance for investigating and prosecuting crime, including terrorism or cybercrime’ (European Commission,  2018b, p. 1).  Currently the cross-border requests for e-evidence are processed through the mutual legal assistance (MLA)  instruments, through the European Investigation Order or based on voluntary cooperation. However, the current  framework does ‘Not fit for today’s volume of requests’ and there is a ‘Lack of connection with the receiving state’  (European Commission, 2018c).  Therefore, the European Commission proposed a new legislative package with measures to improve cross-border  gathering of electronic evidence, in particular the following.   The proposal for a regulation on European production and preservation orders for e-evidence in  criminal matters (European Commission, 2018).   The proposal for a directive laying down harmonised rules on the appointment of legal  representatives for the purpose of gathering evidence in criminal proceedings (European Commission,  2018a).  These proposals should enable LE to order any service provider offering services in the EU to produce or preserve  electronic evidence, regardless of the location of data or the service provider. European production and  preservation orders should be based on mutual recognition (9), which means that it should be directly binding and  enforceable to both the service provider and relevant enforcing authority. These orders should therefore allow for  an effective and fast response of the LE to reported incidents and cybercrimes and effective collection of volatile e- evidence. CSIRTs might help the LE with the correct targeting of the orders and may also benefit from the data  collected by the LE using the orders. On the other hand, (private) CSIRTs might also be in the position of the service  providers and therefore be required to comply with the order.  CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary: roles, structures and strengths  This section provides an overview of roles, structures and strengths of the three communities (CSIRTs, LE and  judiciary).  3.3.1 The role of CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary  This section provides an explanation of the roles of CSIRTs, LEs and the judiciary (prosecutor and judges).  3.3.1.1 The role of the CSIRTs  The main role of the CSIRT is to protect their constituency by preventing and containing IT incidents, primarily from  a technical point of view.  Annex I of the NIS Directive (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016e), in addition to the  requirements, lists the tasks of the CSIRTs, which includes at least: ‘(i) monitoring incidents at a national level; (ii)  providing early warning, alerts, announcements and dissemination of information to relevant stakeholders about  (9) Mutual recognition in criminal proceedings means that a specific judicial decision from one Member State should be directly enforceable in any other  Member State without further formalities or validation. This mechanism should be, in comparison with traditional mutual legal assistance, far more  effective and efficient.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  24  risks and incidents; (iii) responding to incidents; (iv) providing dynamic risk and incident analysis and situational  awareness; (v) participating in the CSIRTs network.’  CSIRTs deal with incident management (IM), including incident handling. The figure below provides an overview of  IM and incident handling stages.  Figure 3 — Incident management and incident handling stages (Source: (ENISA, 2010, p. 10)  It must be noted that ‘CSIRTs do not have the powers of [law enforcement] LE vis-à-vis private subjects, but as  regards attacks of a criminal nature (not all the cyber incidents are criminal acts), have an important role in  supporting the investigations, as they can help to provide information and to secure e-evidence’ (Council of the  European Union, 2017, p. 67). CSIRTs play an important role and ‘have to work closely with law enforcement [LE]  and other authorities’ (ENISA, 2015c, p. 9). Additionally, CSIRT have an ongoing need to collaborate and  communicate within their constituency and across other communities they interact with such as LE and the  judiciary (ENISA, 2018, p. 16).  During the incident management  and handling process, CSIRTs acquire, store and process data and they need to  be aware that the data they process and retain can be crucial for the investigation and the prosecution of a crime  in a criminal trial, it is important that their role, in responding to cybercrime too, is recognised.  As mentioned in Recital 62 of the NIS directive (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016e)  indeed ‘Incidents may be the result of criminal activities the prevention, investigation and prosecution of which is  supported by coordination and cooperation between operators of essential services [see Annex II of the NIS  directive], digital service providers, competent authorities and law-enforcement authorities [LEAs]. Where it is  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  25  suspected that an incident is related to serious criminal activities under Union or national law, Member States  should encourage operators of essential services and digital service providers to report incidents of a suspected  serious criminal nature to the relevant law-enforcement authorities. Where appropriate, it is desirable that  coordination between competent authorities and law-enforcement authorities of different Member States be  facilitated by the European cybercrime centre (EC3) and ENISA’.  3.3.1.2 The role of the LE  The role of the LE in carrying out investigations is aimed at collecting information and evidence on whether a crime  has been committed (or is going to be committed) and by whom. LE needs to collect evidence in compliance with  the law and according to the powers conferred on them. In some occasions, LE has the possibility to collect the  evidence directly, but in many cases the evidence is provided by others involved. It is of paramount importance to  remark that if the evidence collected has been tampered with or partially deleted by the first responders, the  future value of that evidence to support a criminal case during the indictment10 will be significantly or even totally  affected.  3.3.1.3 The role of the judiciary  The role of the judiciary is variable depending on the specificities of the legal system considered; however, it is  possible to identify three main functions of the judiciary.   The judiciary (namely prosecutors) supervises investigations (normally conducted by the LE).   The judiciary acts as body for the protection of fundamental rights.   The judiciary (namely judges) decides whether a crime has been committed and by whom.  Some further details are provided below on the role of the prosecutors and judges. It must be noted that  differences exist between legal systems and the particularities of each legal system cannot be covered in this  report.  3.3.1.4 The role of the prosecutors  ‘The public prosecutors’ office or prosecution service, which is regarded as part of the judiciary in most Member  States [and for this report], plays an essential role in criminal proceedings. The responsibilities and status of public  prosecutors vary considerably among Member States’ (European Commission (run by), n.d.(b)).  The prosecutor normally coordinates and supervises criminal investigations and formulates the charge (when  there are sufficient elements for it).  3.3.1.5 The role of the judges  The judge plays a central role in the criminal proceedings. Judges issue orders to perform procedural measures and  to collect evidence, decide on the admissibility and relevance of the evidence, determine the facts, interpret the  law and decide the case by sentencing the criminal defendants or by dismissing the case. Most important of all,  judges are impartial decision-makers in the pursuit of justice.  The judge is in charge to guarantee that the whole investigation and trial is in compliance with civil liberties and  the rights of persons charged with a criminal offence. Article 6 par. 2 of European Convention on Human Rights  10 An indictment is a formal charge of a serious crime.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  26  (Council of Europe, 1950) affirms the right to a fair trial, including that ‘Everyone charged with a criminal offence  shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law’. Also, the civil liberties and the rights of the other  parties participating in a trial must be complied with (for example, witnesses).  3.3.2 The structure of CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary  This section provides an outline of the structures of CSIRTs, LE and judiciary.  3.3.2.1 The structure of the CSIRTs  A CSIRT is a team of IT security experts whose main business is to respond to computer security incidents,  providing the necessary tools and services to handle them and support their constituents to mitigate the incidents.  Also, most CSIRTs provide preventative and educational services for their constituency, issuing warnings on  vulnerabilities, and also providing awareness to users about threats and scams taking advantage of these flaws.  Based on their duties and area of responsibility (constituency), there could be national, governmental, sectoral and  private CSIRTs. The NIS Directive (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016e) does not make  any reference to this categorisation of CSIRTs, and only states that Member States are to designate one or more  CSIRTs to cover certain industry sectors. Usually national and governmental CSIRTs are designated by the Member  States as CSIRTs under the NIS Directive.  National and governmental CSIRTs play a key role in coordinating Incident Management with the relevant  stakeholders at national level. In addition, they bear responsibility for cooperation with the national and  governmental teams in other countries, and also as part of the CSIRTs network established by the NIS directive.  3.3.2.2 The structure of the LE  The LE structure has been designed to comply with both their stated missions and their legal framework of  intervention. Although the structure differs among Member States, generally LE is hierarchically organised to  identify each level’s responsibility and accountability. Normally each level is dedicated to a certain level of  decision-making and should be accountable for any action taken. LE usually fulfils the following missions: general  policing, prevention, investigating, public order and security purposes.  Depending on the countries’ institutional landscape, the history and the legal systems, LE have different structures  and may be organised in a more centralised way. At national level, again depending on the Member State, LE  might be organised as a two-layer system: central entities that host the most specialised teams (organised crime,  terrorism, intelligence, support units) and regional services which provide a service closer to the population.  Central units normally deal with the nationwide and transnational crime, while regional units tend to lead  investigations in their jurisdiction only.  At international level, international entities provide coordination support among LE. Europol is the LE coordinating  the European Member State police forces. It provides them with intelligence, analysis capacities (analysts and  tools) as well as coordination support for joint operations. Europol is competent to support and strengthen action  taken by MS authorities in preventing and combating organised crime, terrorism and other forms of serious  crime affecting two or more Member States only. Each MS has competent authorities which are the single point  of contact for any operational and strategic communication between them. When an MS LE needs cooperation  from another MS LEA, it needs to have a clear and identified point of contact to deal with, without necessarily  having to be informed on the operational model of each police force.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  27  The Europol Liaison Bureaux (ELB) (11) and the joint cybercrime action taskforce (J-CAT) (12) serve as liaison officers  focused on strengthening operational cooperation in fighting cybercrime. ELB support the law-enforcement  activities of the Member States against cybercrime by facilitating the exchange of information between Europol  and its liaison officers; ELB are also a Point of Contact (PoC) as are Europol National Units (ENUs) to provide  information and advice in the analysis of information concerning their seconding state.  (Hillebrand, 2012). J-CAT is  a country-led innovative framework that includes both EU and non-EU countries that operates from Europol’s  headquarters and it is supported by Europol’s European cybercrime centre (EC3). The objective of J-CAT is to drive  intelligence-led, coordinated action against key cybercrime threats and targets by facilitating the joint  identification, prioritisation, preparation and initiation of cross-border investigations and operations by its  partners.  Interpol is the global police organisation. With 190 members, it is the second largest international organisation  after the United Nations. The organisation works with a network of Interpol national central bureaus (NCBs) which  are also single PoCs in each country (Interpol, n.d.a), like the Europol ENUs. Both the NCBs and ENUs are LE-only  entities — the information sharing is not authorised to non-LE third parties.  The Interpol spectrum covers all EU Member States as well as countries outside the EU. While Europol and Interpol  are two separate organisations they cooperate on a day-to-day basis (13).  3.3.2.3 The structure of the judiciary  ‘While the judicial systems of the Member States differ significantly in detail, there is a set of common principles  which apply to all of them, as well as to the EU as such. One of these common principles is that the courts must be  impartial and independent of the government and the legislating institution (i.e. the institution(s) passing the law).  This principle of independence of the judiciary is one of the values on which the EU is founded: the rule of law and  respect for freedom, equality and fundamental rights. It is expressly mentioned in Article 47 of the Charter of  Fundamental Rights of the EU, and in Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights’ (European  Commission (run by), n.d.d).  As for the structure of the CSIRTs and the LE, the actual structure of the prosecution office and of the courts vary  from country to country. However, there are certain similarities as described below.  3.3.2.4 The structure of the prosecution service  Normally the prosecution service is organised in a hierarchical way: each prosecutor reports to the respective  superior prosecutor and there is a prosecutor-general who heads the entire prosecutor’s office.  Depending on the country, the prosecution office might have a more centralised structure or a more decentralised  one.  Generally, the structure of the prosecution service mirrors that of the court system or it is even part of it (e.g. in  countries where prosecutors and judges are part of the same structure while performing different roles).  (11) https://www.europol.europa.eu/partners-agreements/member-states  (12) https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/services-support/joint-cybercrime-action-taskforce  (13) In the case of cross-border crime that involves countries outside Europe, or countries with which Europol does not have operational agreements.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  28  3.3.2.5 The structure of the courts  The national court systems are normally divided into branches (e.g. ordinary civil and criminal, administrative,  military, etc.). The ordinary criminal court systems are generally organised into first-, second- (e.g. courts of  appeal) and third-instance courts (e.g. supreme courts), and their centralised/decentralised structure depends on  the governmental or constitutional structure of the country.  Normally the ministry of justice is responsible for matters related to court organisation, including budget. In some  countries a supreme council of the judiciary is established as a central body responsible for guaranteeing the  independence of the judiciary.  Eurojust has been set up with the aim of supporting the MS competent national authorities (including prosecutors  and judges) when they deal with serious cross-border and organised crime. Eurojust is ‘composed of national  prosecutors, magistrates, or police officers of equivalent competence, detached from each Member State  according to their own legal systems’ (Eurojust, n.d.).  The European Council, in its Conclusion 46, agreed that a  unit (Eurojust) should be set up, composed of national prosecutors, magistrates, or police officers of equivalent  competence, detached from each Member State according to their own legal systems (Eurojust, 2018).  3.3.2.6 The Role of CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary along with the workflow of responding to cybercrime  According to the data collected, the role of each community (CSIRTs, LE and judiciary) along the workflow of  responding to cybercrime can be described as follows.   Discovery of the crime: LE can receive a crime report (e.g. from the victim) or discover a suspicious  activity by itself. The CSIRT can discover a suspicious activity during incident handling and, depending  on the legal system may have/has an obligation to inform LE of the activity. In some Member States,  at least under certain circumstances, CSIRT (the focus of this report is national and/or governmental  CSIRTs) in certain circumstances national or governmental CSIRTS must inform the prosecutor of any  activity that might be considered criminal.   Criminal investigation: normally LE conducts the criminal investigation while the prosecutor defines  the strategy of the case, sets the evidence threshold and supervises it. The judiciary ensures that the  investigation is conducted in compliance with civil liberties and guarantees (14) and defines the limits  of protection of the rights of the persons investigated.. Depending on the severity of the crime and  the complexity of the case, the investigation means used (undercover police investigation, use of  wiretaping technology, etc.) vary. CSIRT may play a role in the investigation by providing technical  expertise and supporting the evidence collection (and preservation) by sharing information they have,  or they have access to. As stated in the 2017 ENISA reports on CSIRT and LE cooperation (ENISA,  2017a) (ENISA, 2017) and confirmed during the interviews conducted for this report, CSIRTs and LE  indeed often exchange information (both formally and informally) related to cybercrime cases, for  instance to avoid interference in their actions. CSIRTs can support the investigations by providing LE  with useful information for the investigations. When a more formal involvement of CSIRTs is required  during the criminal investigations, the prosecutor usually needs to be consulted and give consent for  the involvement of CSIRT in digital evidence acquiring, handling and analysis. This is because CSIRTs  are not operating under the strict LE rules.  (14) On common minimum rules concerning certain aspects of the presumption of innocence in criminal proceedings and the right to be present at the trial  in criminal proceedings see (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016a). For an overview of case-law of the European Court of  Human Rights in the area of human rights and criminal procedures see (McBride, 2018).  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  29   Prosecution either press charges or suspend/archive the case: a criminal proceeding normally starts  after the formal criminal charge (i.e. the formal accusation), usually made either by the prosecutor or  by the police; it ends with the conviction or acquittal of the defendant. If the evidence collected  support a charge then the competent authority (normally the prosecutor) formulates the charge and  the suspect (normally from this point onwards called ‘the defendant’) is brought to court. If the  amount and quality of the evidence collected during the criminal investigation is not sufficient to  proceed or if the evidence collected shows that the facts do not have the elements to constitute a  crime, in several states the prosecutor can discard the case. This however does not mean that the  CSIRT must discard the eradication and the recovery phase (ENISA, 2016d, p. 10); an important phase  of the incident response and that still needs to be performed from the incident handling process  (SANS, 2011, p. 8).   Trial: although (according to the data collected) this happens in general very rarely, a member of the  CSIRT may be called to play a role in the process before a criminal court aiming to decide whether a  person (after the formal charge, ‘the defendant’) has committed a crime. At least in some Member  States a CSIRT expert can be called to testify as an (expert) witness in computer crime cases. The  CSIRT experts testify based on the general rules of testimony normally set out in the criminal  procedural codes. However, according to the data collected via interviews and the online survey, the  cases where CSIRT experts are called as witnesses in criminal proceeding are not frequent at all. Some  interviewees stated that in some cases, detailed reports from CSIRTs are also used in criminal  proceedings to support the decision on the conviction or the acquittal of the defendant. Furthermore,  CSIRTs can also provide other forms of evidence (for instance, a cloned image of a hard disk) to be  used in criminal proceedings. CSIRTs have a long history of cooperation across the EU and they  coordinate by means of a CSIRT secretariat function provided for in the network and information  security directive (NISD).  All of the examples given above of course vary depending on the legal systems and on the specificities of the  crime, including its severity.  Based on the data collected via the online survey and the literature research, it is clear that LE and/or prosecutors  take the lead in criminal investigations.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  30  Figure 4 — Replies to question 10 of the online survey conducted for this report  3.3.3 Strengths of the three communities  The main strengths of the CSIRT and LE communities identified by the data collected via the online survey (see  Figures 5 and 6) include the following.   For the CSIRTs: the use of agile processes, the technical skills and the technical tools used, as well as  the well-established cooperation they have within and outside the CSIRT community (e.g. security  companies and internet service providers (ISPs)).   For the LE: the ability to draft detailed reports to be used in criminal proceedings, the knowledge of  the chain of custody and the requirements for admissibility of evidence in court as well as the  detective skills and well-defined roles which are easy to understand by all parties.  Figure 5 — Replies to question 15 of the online survey conducted for this report  Q10: In your country who takes the  lead in criminal investigations?  Q15 - What are the  strengths that  national/governmental  CSIRT in your country has  and you would wish to see  more in the law  enforcement?  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  31  Figure 6 — Replies to question 16 of the online survey conducted for this report  No specific data were collected via the online survey on the strengths of the judiciary. However, from some  statements made by the subject-matter experts interviewed it can be derived that prosecutors and judges  (because of their role, experience and background) have a deep knowledge of matters related to admissibility of  evidence and the delicate balance between the need for collection and preservation of e-evidence to prosecute  crime and the protection of the fundamental rights.  The interaction and the information flow across CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary  This section addresses the interaction and information flow across CSIRTs, LEs and the judiciary, in particular  focusing on LE’s direct and indirect interactions during investigations, the duties of CSIRTs followed by an in-depth  discussion on the types of information that is exchanged.  Cooperation between CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary can be mutually beneficial. This is also illustrated by examples  from practice. One of these examples can be the cooperation between a national/governmental CSIRT or another  CSIRT (e.g. a university CSIRT) and the police in the case of attempted hacker attacks on a computer system, as  illustrated in the example in the box.  Q16: What are the strengths that law  enforcement in your country has and  you would wish to see more in the  national/governmental CSIRT?  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  32  Example of cooperation between CSIRTs, LEs and the judiciary  A CSIRT detects an incident likely to be a crime (e.g. an attack against an information system)  and informs the police/files a complaint with the police, which in turn ask for the details about  the incident and possible evidence.  Thanks to the close cooperation and the police instructions, the CSIRT is able to collect relevant  traffic and localisation data in a way that allows it to be used as evidence in court. Further  investigation reveals that the incident was of a larger scale than initially estimated and that  further data are needed from other service providers. Therefore, using the police procedural  tools and the expertise of the CSIRT staff, additional data are requested from the operator of  the network, through which the communication traces of the attacker are identified, and other  victim organisations are identified.  The data obtained reveal that the attacker’s communication in several cases was led through  servers in a different jurisdiction. Thanks to the involvement of the CSIRT and the CSIRT  community, additional necessary operational data from a CSIRT in a different country are  obtained and then made available to the police. Obtaining these data following the standard  measures of international police and judicial cooperation in criminal cases would have taken  much longer. At the stage of analysing, processing and applying the evidence in court, the police  can also use advanced forensic tools and CSIRT personnel’s expertise.  Following this positive experience of cooperation, both the police and the CSIRT are able to  identify problematic areas of cooperation that they can then streamline. For example, within  the CSIRT, internal processes for informing the police/filing complaints with the police and for  collecting evidence or passing it on to LE are established. On the part of the police, means for  securing the electronic transfer of digital evidence are implemented, as well as procedural  measures for cooperation with security teams, including measures that allow secure two-way  sharing of sensitive information. On the part of the court, the possibility of using a CSIRT  employee as an expert witness, who is able to explain to the court the technical details of the  case and the specifics of the individual pieces of evidence, is verified.  3.4.1 Indirect v. direct interaction between CSIRTs and prosecutor and judge  The default approach for an investigation is that LE undertakes the investigative aspects of an incident and the  prosecutor supervises the investigation. The leads to follow, the targets to work on and the legal framework are  decided by the prosecutor. While it is normally done through cooperation, where there is any disagreement the  final say is with the prosecutor and, in some case, with the judge. In several EU Member States, when a crime is  ongoing, or the incident has just occurred (e.g. within 24 hours), LE can undertake immediate actions such as  searches, arrests and warrants without the prosecutor’s prior agreement (although a validation of the measures  taken is then needed) and only for as long as a prosecutor has not been assigned to or not taken the lead in the  investigation yet.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  33  As an investigation unfolds, LE and prosecutors continually make decisions to adapt to the circumstances of the  events. In this situation, the CSIRTs can be formally asked to cooperate by providing their technical expertise or  data that they may have e.g. in their own systems or via their channels.  CSIRTs normally interact with LE much more rarely do they engage directly with the prosecutor. Several  interviewees described the normal information flow as ‘linear’, in other words CSIRT > LE > prosecutor (> judge).  That means that normally the CSIRT informs LE and then LE informs the prosecutor.  However, under certain circumstances (namely for emergency cases) the CSIRT has a direct channel (email, phone)  to the prosecutor e.g. when LE is not available, the CSIRT can report a crime directly to the prosecutor. In addition,  the prosecutor can directly request the CSIRT for instance to explain to the prosecutor a specific technical point  which will inform the next stages of the investigation. In this situation, the prosecutor can directly engage with the  CSIRT, but the LE might still act as a facilitator.  Some interviewees stated that there are also formal and informal ways of communication and that sometimes  official requests for information (e.g. from CSIRT to LE or from LE to CSIRTs) are preceded by some informal  discussion between CSIRT and LE personnel working on the incident/case.  CSIRTs (like any witness) can be requested to provide testimony during a trial. Either the prosecutor or the defence  can summon CSIRT personnel who provided evidence. In this case, the CSIRT personnel are normally in the same  situation as the private expert when giving testimony. As expert witnesses, CSIRTs personnel have to outline their  skills and knowledge and explain to the court how the evidence was handled. The defence might aim to challenge  not the evidence as such but how that evidence was collected and handled (e.g. searched for, collected and  preserved). It must be noted that while LE personnel are generally prepared to testify in Court, CSIRT personnel  may be reluctant or ill-prepared to serve as expert witnesses in Court as they might be less familiar with trial  sessions.  To summarise, CSIRTs normally interact with the judiciary via LE and do not have direct interaction with  prosecutors: they have even less frequent direct interaction with judges. There are however cases where CSIRT  and prosecutors and judges have direct contact, for instance when the CSIRT is asked to provide technical input  directly to the prosecutor on a case or where the CSIRT is asked to testify in court. Nonetheless, the contact is  normally facilitated by the LE, especially in the case of interaction between the CSIRT and the prosecutor.  According to the data collected both via the interviews and the online survey, where the CSIRTs have a duty to  report cybercrime (whether CSIRTs have this duty is discussed below in the report), normally the CSIRT report to LE  although there are cases (depending on the legal systems) where they report it directly to the prosecutor. The  results from the online survey on this matter are represented in Figure 7.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  34  Figure 7 — Replies to question 9A of the online survey conducted for this report  3.4.2 CSIRTs and their duty (or not) to inform law enforcement or prosecutor and/or to report a  crime and the coordination of actions  From data collected via interviews it emerged that whether a national/governmental CSIRT has a duty to inform or  report to the LE or to the prosecutor varies considerably from country to country. However, even considering this  differentiating factor, it seems that there is a lack of common understanding on when CSIRTs have a duty to report  an alleged criminal act: the data collected appears indeed rather heterogeneous. It may also be the case that CSIRTs  require continuous support and legal guidance to be better able to determine when an incident can be considered  a crime.  Figure 8 — Replies to question 9 of the online survey conducted for this report  Q9A: To whom does the  national/governmental  CSIRT in your country  report cybercrime?  Q9: Have the national/governmental CSIRTs in your  country a duty to report cybercrime to the law  enforcement?  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  35  Concerning the duty of the CSIRTs to inform the victims, as shown in Figure 9, according to most respondents to  the online survey, CSIRTs have this duty only under certain circumstances (not much more additional data were  gathered on such circumstances).  Figure 9 — Replies to question 8 of the online survey conducted for this report  However, whether or not CSIRTs have a duty to inform LE (or the prosecutor) and/or the victim, one of the most  important aspects to consider is the coordination process between CSIRTs, LE and the prosecutor.  As mentioned, CSIRTs are more focused on preventing and reacting to cyber incidents, but some CSIRT actions may  affect criminal investigations (in most countries conducted by the police and coordinated/supervised by the  prosecution service). An example is the case when a CSIRT might notify a web domain owner or the host about a  command and control server and request shut down. But at the same time that command and control server  might be under investigation by an LE. That is why the coordination and escalation process between different  entities must be in place and clear to all parties (CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary).  Proper coordination in the cyber field does require proper mechanisms and tools, including the usage of a  dedicated platform where different types of data can be properly marked (e.g. a specific domain is sinkholed (15)  and cannot be the subject of a takedown). However, it must be noted that CSIRTs and LE are already using their  own platforms for information storing, processing and exchange (e.g. the ‘MeliCERTes facility [in the CSIRT  community that] aims to facilitate swift and effective operational cooperation for the CSIRT network’ (European  Commission, 2017b). A new platform might lead to the duplication of efforts.  (15) ‘DNS sinkholing is a mechanism aimed at protecting users by intercepting DNS request attempting to connect to known malicious or unwanted domains  and returning a false, or rather controlled IP address. The controlled IP address points to a sinkhole server defined by the DNS sinkhole administrator.’  (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/glossary/dns-sinkhole).  Q8: In your country,  have the  national/governmental  CSIRTs a duty to inform  the victim of a  suspected cybercrime?  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  36  3.4.3 The kind of information exchanged and the related information flow  According to the results from the online survey shown in Figure 10 as well as those from the subject-matter expert  interviews, the CSIRT-provided data most often used for criminal investigations are indicators of compromise  (IOCs), IP addresses, information on modus operandi and timeline.  Figure 10 — Replies to question 5 of the online survey conducted for this report  Also, according to several subject-matter experts interviewed, the CSIRTs normally share with the police and  (whether directly or via the police) with the prosecutor any type of information that is related to the incident and  that might be relevant for the investigation. This information includes IPs addresses, web domains, email details  (addresses, headers, content) and IOCs.  LE shares mainly IP addresses with CSIRTs, while sharing all information needed to decide on criminal prosecution  with the prosecutors and judges. The judges share with judges all (digital) evidence useful to prosecute the  suspect. Digital evidence sharing between judges belonging to different Member States can be either direct or  indirect. This depends on what is provided for in bilateral or multilateral agreements between the states, if they  exist, and on the cooperation in criminal matters that can be used in the specific case.  Almost any kind of data might be relevant and thus can be exchanged between CSIRTs and LEAs. They are still  using the comma separated value (csv) format which can be converted into any human- or machine-processable  format of events.  Similar replies were given in the online survey to the question on what kind of CSIRT-provided data are most often  used as evidence in criminal proceedings in court. However, the number of ‘no answer provided’ received in  response to this question was higher; this might be since the respondents (especially from the CSIRT community)  have less visibility on the actual use of the information they provide in court.  Q5: In your experience what kind of  data provided by CSIRT is most often  used for criminal investigations?  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  37  Figure 11 — Replies to question 6 of the online survey conducted for this report  3.4.4 Frequency of the information exchange and of the usage of information provided by CSIRTs in  criminal investigations and as evidence in criminal proceedings  Several interviewees noted that the information sharing between CSIRTs and LE may be very frequent (on a daily  basis or more than once a day), but it depends on the incident and on the severity of the incident. Some other  interviewees stated that the information sharing is much less frequent, e.g. once per month.  In principle information sharing takes place immediately where there is an emergency and around once a week for  minor incidents (as some interviewees highlighted, it not possible to send information immediately for minor  incidents and therefore a list of minor incidents is sent to LE or to the prosecution office (depending on the  country) e.g. once per week).  CSIRTs share information with LE also for intelligence purposes and there are regular bulletins (e.g. once per  month) sent.  Some interviewees noted that when there is an emergency (and LE is not available), the national/governmental  CSIRT has a direct channel to the prosecutor (e.g. phone). This provision, of course, does not undermine the 24/7  PoC service available in each MS.  On the usage of information provided by CSIRTs, it must be noted that according to the answers received via the  online survey, most respondents replied that it is used occasionally for criminal investigation while rarely as  evidence in criminal proceeding. See Figure 12.  Q6: In your experience what  kind of data provided by CSIRT  is most often used as evidence  in criminal proceedings in  court?  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  38  Figure 12 — Replies to question 1 of the online survey conducted for this report  Figure 13 — Replies to question 2 of the online survey conducted for this report  Further, Figures 14 and 15 show that, according to the replies received from the online survey, CSIRTs are hardly  ever called either to write detailed expert reports to use in criminal proceedings or to be witnesses in criminal  courts.  Q1 - How often in your country is  information provided by CSIRTs - in  particular national/governmental CSIRTs -  used for criminal investigations?  Q2 - How often in your  country is information  provided by CSIRTs - in  particular  national/governmental  CSIRTs - used as evidence in  criminal proceedings in  court?  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  39  Figure 14 — Replies to question 3 of the online survey conducted for this report  Figure 15 — Replies to question 4 of the online survey conducted for this report  3.4.5 A graphical representation of the information flow  Although the information flow across CSIRTs, LE and judiciary varies from legal system to legal system it also  depends on the specific case being dealt with (e.g. the severity of the case and whether it’s considered an  emergency might have an impact on the information flow), a graphical representation of this flow of information is  presented in Figure 16 based on an abstraction and generalisation of the data collected for this report (especially  the responses from the subject-matter expert interviews and the online survey). The broken lines in it represent  information provided, as opposed to the arrows which represent actions taken. This graphical representation (with  all the usual limitations due to abstraction and generalisation) aims to describe what the information flow might  look like and shows the complexity of such information flow.  Q3 - In your country, how often are  national/governmental CSIRTs called to  write detailed expert reports to use in  criminal proceedings in court?  Q4 - In your country, how often  national/governmental CSIRT is  called as witness in criminal  proceedings in court?  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  40  Figure 16 — Graphical representation of the flow of information across CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary  Responses to Question 11 on the online survey (see Figure 18), ‘agree’ or ‘partially agree’ on the interaction and  the information flow across CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary working well. This gives a clear indication that when  information is exchanged then the process does work but perhaps there is room for improvement.  Figure 17 — Replies to question 11 of the online survey conducted for this report  Some interviewees noted that the information flow is largely one-way (from CSIRTs to LEs/prosecutor) and this is  mainly due to the prosecution and LE not being allowed to share information/evidence collected within the  criminal proceedings (see Section 4.1.2 on the secrecy of criminal investigations in the report). The information  flow from LE/prosecutor to CSIRTs takes place only to prevent further damage or in emergency situations. Other  respondents highlighted that police can only officially share with the CSIRT a specific portion of the information as  aprecautionary measure, i.e. all information not classified as ‘secrecy’; clearly the public prosecutor that directs  the investigation can order the sharing of additional pieces of information.  Q11 - Does the interaction and the  information flow across CSIRTs,  law enforcement and judiciary  (prosecutors and judges) work  well?  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  41  Other interviewees noted that the distribution of authority and formalities sometimes make the  cooperation/interaction less smooth, but that this might also be so due to the need to comply with certain legal  requirements.  What has also emerged from data collected is that cooperation and interaction depends on interpersonal relations:  if the interpersonal relations are good, the cooperation/interaction works well. This finding further confirmed one  of the findings of the 2017 ENISA reports on CSIRTs and law-enforcement cooperation (ENISA, 2017) (ENISA, 2017a),  i.e. that trust is paramount for the cooperation among the three communities.  The tools and the common taxonomy for CSIRTs and law enforcement  This section provides a detailed overview of the tools and taxonomies used for data sharing.  3.5.1 Tools  This section gives an overview of the tools for normal communication and information sharing within the CSIRTs and  within the LE community for cooperation between the two communities.  As mentioned above, the CSIRTs interact with the prosecutors generally via LE; they interact rarely with judges  (only seldom they are called as expert witnesses in court). For this reason, the tools used by the prosecutors and  judges for their internal communication and information sharing or for communication with the CSIRTs are not  addressed in this report.  3.5.1.1 Overview of tools used within the CSIRTs community and within the law-enforcement  community  Secure email is a common tool in the cybersecurity community and is used by LE to communicate and share  information with other police forces and with independent or private-sector experts, as well as with CSIRT  personnel. LE tends to use the pretty good privacy (PGP) cryptography system more and more, this allows LE to  protect the data in exchanges with other police forces (also in international exchanges) in an easy manner. MS  competent authorities (e.g. LE) also use other secured email systems to exchange non-structured data very quickly,  e.g. the secure information exchange network application (SIENA), the Europol platform for experts (EPE) for non- operational exchange of information for Europol or the Interpol PoC for Interpol.  For more structured data the only family of tools comprises police files: the wanted or signalled person or objects  stored in the national and EU databases. This tool seems to fit better to certain types of data, such as IOCs or other  pure cybercrime data. The analysis projects, (previously called focal points (16)) also are important tools: each piece  of data is analysed stored in Europol databases to then be shared in order to identify common cases among  several countries.  The malware information-sharing platform (MISP) platform is a widely used and well-established tool within the  CSIRT community. The MISP’s main use and its strong point is its sharing capability: a user of the platform can very  easily share routine structured data with other entities through push and pull. MISP is ingreasingly becoming a  standard among the CSIRT community in the EU and EFTA. A new trend in LE is to implement MISP (Computer  Incident Response Center (CIRCL) Luxembourg, 2018). The MISP tool is also fit for storing IOCs and for sharing  (16) https://www.europol.europa.eu/crime-areas-trends/europol-analysis-projects  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  42  them in an automated and structured way. It is a good first place for LE to discover threat intelligence: the MISP  instances automatically share the feeds at each update.  Within the LE community, in addition to MISP, the use of other new tools is increasing for cybercrime-oriented  information sharing. Europol malwares analysis system (EMAS) for instance allows LE to share malware samples:  each malware submitted is analysed. The IOC obtained are then crossmatched in Europol databases. The EPE is a  portal full of information and tools. Among them can be found technical developments for IT forensic  investigations, best practices or WHOIS legal considerations. It is one of the communication tools of Europol’s EC3  with the LE community alongside EPE that allows private parties, LEA and others to exchange information. It uses  secured connections and closed networks. Working with outside partners creates new habits and new systems  such as interconnecting networks that were isolated before.  LE use investigation graph tools which crawl into any kind of dataset to make connections and provide a graphical  representation of them. Some of the tools can be fed with any type of data, such as blockchain (17), Structured  Query Language (SQL) database (DB), in-house files and so on.  More generally, LE are entering into the threat-intelligence area with tools able to manage and crosscheck large  datasets for further identification of perpetrators. It is usually based on the Elasticsearch framework (18) with a lot  of in-house programing to fit LE needs: graph visualisation, indexing of seized hacker forums, etc.  3.5.1.2 Overview of tools used for information sharing between the CSIRT and LE communities  Basic standard tooling such as secure email and telephone are used for communication and information sharing  between CSIRTs and LE. As also highlighted in 2017 ENISA report on Tools and methodologies to support  cooperation between CSIRTs and law enforcement (ENISA, 2017, p. 28), in ‘several Member States there is an  already established and secure (and sometimes segregated) government network that can be used for secure  communication. These types of network could be used as a communication path for exchanging information’.  Since the use of MISP is already widespread in the CSIRT community and there is an ongoing increase in the use of  MISP by LE, it seems to be or likely to be one of the most suitable tools for the exchange of information between  CSIRTs and LE. ‘It is important to note that a separate community (or even better a separate MISP instance) can be  used for information exchange between CSIRT and LEA. This way, there is no risk for potentially disclosing sensitive  information with parties that should not [have it]’ (ENISA, 2017, p. 30).  Whenever needed, also face-to-face meetings, even in particularly secure locations if required, take place between  CSIRTs and law enforcement.  3.5.2 Common taxonomy for CSIRTs and law enforcement  Although CSIRTs and LE might have their own taxonomy to deal with incidents/cybercrime, a common taxonomy  for CSIRTs and LE enforcement has been developed to facilitate their cooperation. The ‘common taxonomy for LE  and CSIRTs, which was set up to simplify CSIRT and LEA cooperation. This taxonomy resulted from collaboration  initiatives such as the annual ENISA/EC3 workshop which involved CSIRTs, LEAs, ENISA, and EC3’ (ENISA, 2018). The  (17) Blockchain is a public ledger consisting of all transactions taken place across a peer-to-peer network. It is a data structure consisting of linked  blocks of data, e.g. confirmed financial transactions with each block pointing/referring to the previous one forming a chain in linear and chronological order.  This decentralised technology enables the participants of a peer-to-peer network to make transactions without the need of a trusted central authority and at  the same time relying on cryptography to ensure the integrity of transactions. (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/glossary/blockchain).  (18) https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  43  common taxonomy for CSIRTs and LE has as an objective ‘to support the CSIRTs a\\nd the public prosecutors in  their dealing with LEAs in cases of criminal investigations, by providing a common taxonomy for the classification  of incidents, named common taxonomy for law enforcement and the national network of CSIRTs’ (Europol:  European Cybercrime Centre and ENISA, 2017). This common taxonomy has been already implemented and  imported in MISP (GitHub, n.d. a).  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  44  Challenges in cooperation and interaction  This chapter outlines the legal, cultural, technical and organisational challenges faced in the cooperation between  CSIRTs and LEs and their interaction with the judiciary.  The challenges faced  According to the data collected for this report, there are challenges related to the cooperation between CSIRTs  and LE (which is line also to the findings from 2017 ENISA reports (ENISA, 2017) (ENISA, 2017a), and their  interaction with the judiciary. In particular, these challenges seem to be first legal, then cultural, technical and  organisational. See Figure 18 which illustrates these findings.  Figure 18 — Replies to question 12 of the online survey conducted for this report  Legal challenges  This section presents some legal challenges faced in the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE and their interaction  with the judiciary as identified from the data collected for this report.  4.2.1 Data retention  An important challenge is the need to find a balance between two opposing requirements. The first requirement is  the investigative need to preserve the greatest amount of traffic data (19) for as long as possible. However, such  (19) Article 1, letter d) of the Convention on Cybercrime (Council of Europe, 2001) states that ‘Traffic data’ ‘means any computer data relating to a  communication by means of a computer system, generated by a computer system that formed a part in the chain of communication, indicating the  communication’s origin, destination, route, time, date, size, duration, or type of underlying service’. These data, e.g. the IP address, can be very important  in criminal investigations. For this reason, the legislation of many Member States requires that ‘traffic data’ be kept for a certain time for the purpose of  the investigation, the detection and the prosecution of crime. This storage activity of ‘traffic data’ is called ‘data retention’.  Q12: Are there any  challenges hindering  the interaction and  information flow  across CSIRTs, law  enforcement and  judiciary  (prosecutors and  judges)?  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  45  data retention inevitably interferes with some fundamental rights, in particular the right to privacy and the right to  erasure (or the right to be forgotten). Consequently, there is a second requirement, related to the principle that a  level of government must not take any action that exceeds that necessary to carry out its assigned  tasks (‘proportionality’): the fundamental rights can be violated for investigative purposes without exceeding the  limits of what is strictly necessary.  Finding a balance between these two needs is not easy. The no-longer-in-force Directive 2006/24/EC (20) (European  Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2006) provided some rules on this topic. However, the judgment of  the grand chamber in Joined Case C-293/12 and C-594/12 Digital Rights Ireland Ltd v minister for communications,  marine and natural resources and others and Kärntner Landesregierung and others (Court of Justice of the  European Union, 2014) , of 8 April 2014 took the view that ‘Directive 2006/24 does not lay down clear and precise  rules governing the extent of the interference with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles 7 and 8 of the  Charter. It must therefore be held that Directive 2006/24 entails a wide-ranging and particularly serious  interference with those fundamental rights in the legal order of the EU, without such an interference being  precisely circumscribed by provisions to ensure that it is actually limited to what is strictly necessary’ (see par. 65).  Accordingly, the judgment of the grand chamber declared Directive 2006/24/EC invalid because of a violation of  the principle of proportionality. For an overview of amendments to national data retention laws in 2016 after the  Digital Rights Ireland judgment see (FRA). On case-law related to the concept of personal data, jurisprudence on IP  addresses and data retention relevant for CSIRT and LE cooperation, see also the ENISA report Improving  cooperation between CSIRTs and law enforcement: Legal and organisational aspects (ENISA, 2017a, pp. 30-31).  4.2.2 Secrecy of criminal investigations and the ‘need to know’  Data exchange between CSIRTs and law enforcement represents a challenge in two ways: from CSIRT to LE and  from LE to CSIRT.  For the information flow from LE to CSIRT, if the information originated from an investigation, the secret of the  investigation applies, and law enforcement are not in a position to share the information they have with the  CSIRTs. However, it must be noted that the prosecutor can exceptionally authorise a police officer to share and  ‘release’ that person of this obligation to secrecy. In such cases, information sharing is then allowed, usually for  impelling remediation motives or if it concerns information that is not sensitive for the investigation.  As emerged from the interviews, one of the most challenging aspects is the balance between the need to maintain  the secrecy and the ‘need to know’: both CSIRTs and LE might work on the same incident/case and if there is no  coordination they might interfere in a detrimental way in each other’s work. In addition, for instance, if LE cannot  share some information during the investigations, then it is difficult for the CSIRT to understand LE needs.  As far as it concerns the information flow from CSIRT to LE, it is important to consider how the LE can receive and  use data from outside sources. Usually, data transferred by CSIRTs are for intelligence purposes. Should any of the  data be used to identify and arrest a person, a stringent set of rules must be followed (see Section 4.1.6 — Chain of  custody). Data collected to be used for judicial purposes must follow evidence rules. The problem arises in this  context when CSIRT information handling and transmission channels might not be well fitted to this situation.  (20) Directive concerned the retention of data generated or processed in connection with providing publicly available electronic communications services or  of public communications networks and amending Directive 2002/58/EC.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  46  4.2.3 Sharing of personal data, including IP addresses  One of the current challenges is to maintain and, where possible and needed, to increase the data sharing  between CSIRTs and LEAs while remaining in line with the personal data legal framework provisions. Based on  applicable legislation and the common interpretation, in principle IP addresses are considered personal data. Not  only IP addresses but any online identifier that may be connected to natural persons (e.g. domain names, URLs, or  email addresses) is personal data. In addition, sometimes the threat/incident data or intelligence may contain not  only metadata but also content data.  It is therefore important to see to what extent IP addresses and other personal information related to the incident  are allowed to be shared between CSIRTs and LEAs. On LEAs, it is clearly marked in Article 2 d) of the GDPR that  there is no limitation, and in Recital 49, allows CSIRTs to process that information.  The Data Protection Law Enforcement Directive (Directive (EU) 2016/680) (European Parliament and Council of the  European Union, 2016) is an important point of reference on the subject. It clarifies that when the processing of  personal data by competent authorities is carried out for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection  or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, consent by the owner of these personal  data is not required. However, there might be other cases where the sharing of personal data between CSIRTs and  LE takes place and the related data process (including the sharing) must have a different legal ground, which could  be, for instance, the protection of public interest or the consent of the data owner.  4.2.3.1 An Introduction to the WHOIS registry/service  The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is ‘a not-for-profit, public-benefit  organisation’ that operates ‘the internet’s domain name system [DNS], coordinates allocation and assignment of  the internet’s unique identifiers, such as internet protocol [IP] addresses, accredits generic top-level domain (gTLD)  name registrars, and helps facilitate the voices of volunteers worldwide who are dedicated to keeping the internet  secure, stable and interoperable’ (ICANN, 2018a, p. 2).  WHOIS (21) is ‘the system that asks the question, who is responsible for a domain name or an IP address?’ (ICANN,  2018b) The WHOIS data may include ‘name, address, email, phone number, and administrative and technical  contacts’. WHOIS is a query and response protocol with data stored in a decentralised way; in other words, ‘the  (21) What is the domain WHOIS?   Publicly available database of registration information on registrants of a domain name.   Maintained by ICANN and its contracted registries and registrars.  What information?   Domain names details:   Domain name, IP address, Name server, creation/expiry date, domain status.   Information on Registrar   Registrar’s URL, registrar’s abuse email, phone number.   Information on registrants (domain name holder)   Registrant email, postal address, fax and telephone number.   Administration contact and technical details  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  47  WHOIS service is not a single, centrally-operated database’: the data are managed by independent entities known  as ‘registrars’ and ‘registries’. (ICANN, 2018c).  The registrar is ‘An organisation that verifies availability and reserves domain names on behalf of a registrant.  Domain names ending with .aero, .biz, .com, .coop, .info, .museum, .name, .net, .org, and .pro can be registered  through many different companies (known as ‘registrars’) that compete with one another. A listing of these  companies appears in the accredited registrar directory’ (ICANN, 2018a). ‘Any entity that wants to become a  registrar must earn ICANN accreditation’ (ICANN, 2018b).  The registry is an entity that ‘keeps the master database and also generates the ‘zone file’ which allows computers  to route Internet traffic to and from top-level domains anywhere in the world. Internet users do not interact  directly with the registry operator; users can register names in top-level domains (TLDs).  including.biz,.com,.info,.net,.name,.org by using an ICANN-accredited registrar’ (ICANN, 2018a, p. 23)  4.2.4 Fundamental rights  CSIRTs and LE handle various types of data. ‘All categories of data may be personal data’, e.g. content data but also  subscriber data; however, ‘they have a different level of interference with fundamental rights’ (European  Commission, 2018c). Based on the data dealt with, appropriate conditions and safeguards apply to their collection  and preservation and it is necessary to find a balance between the needs for collection and preservation of e- evidence and the protection of the fundamental rights of the suspect; this to guarantee the rights of third parties  (including the victim) and also the rights of the suspect during the criminal investigations and the right of the  accused to a fair trial.  It must be also noted that both LE and judiciary should request from CSIRTs only the information that is strictly  necessary. This is also imposed by Article 52 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights or the European Union  (European Parliament, Council and Commission, 2000), which provides that ‘Any limitation on the exercise of the  rights and freedoms recognised by this charter must be provided for by law and respect the essence of those rights  and freedoms. Subject to the principle of proportionality, limitations may be made only if they are necessary and  genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the [European] Union or the need to protect the rights  and freedoms of others’. For an overview of case-law of the European Court of Human Rights in the area of human  rights and criminal procedures see (McBride, 2018).  4.2.5 Chain of custody and evidence admissibility  Compliance with the chain of custody plays a fundamental role in the criminal trial, since it is not only the type of  data that has been collected that is important, but also the fact that the data are stored with continuity according  to certain technical rules (in addition to the guidelines mentioned in Section 3.1.4 — Admissibility of electronic  evidence in criminal courts, see Identification and handling of electronic evidence handbook, Document for  teachers, (ENISA, 2013b); Digital forensics. Toolset, document for students (ENISA, 2013a); Mobile threats incident  handling: Handbook, Document for teachers (ENISA, 2014); Methodologies for the identification of critical  information infrastructure assets and services. Guidelines for charting electronic data communication networks  (ENISA, 2015d); Forensic analysis. Webserver analysis handbook, Document for teachers (ENISA, 2018); and  Exploring cloud incidents (ENISA, 2016c)).  ‘The chain of custody through appropriate policy frameworks can be used in order to assess the quality of the  collected data. […] Chain of custody investigations may also help in establishing the hierarchical structure that  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  48  prevailed at the time that the acts under investigations were committed’ (Mitrakas & Zaich, 2009, p. 164 and 173 ).  The chain of custody aims to guarantee that the data has not be tampered with between its creation and its usage  in court. The main objective is to prove the data are directly connected to the suspect, so that the court can judge  based on reliable evidence, this means evidence is collected in a manner that protects civil liberties. To avoid  issues, evidence must be safeguarded at all times from the moment of the collection to the trial.  The chain of custody is relevant for the purpose of the admissibility of evidence, although how this admissibility is  regulated and dealt with may vary from Member State to Member State and depend on the different kinds of  data. For instance, in some Member States compliance with the chain of custody in the case of flow metadata is  only important for the evaluation of evidence, however in the case of content data to be used for forensic  examination compliance with the chain of custody is relevant for the admissibility of evidence (Home Office, 2014).  It should be noted that, in the latter case, there is usually no specific rule of inadmissibility for the violation of the  chain of custody. The inadmissibility of the evidence derives from the fact that the violation of the chain of custody  can be traced back to one of the general causes of inadmissibility of the evidence provided by the rules of a state.  4.2.6 Diversity of legal frameworks between Member States and the timing of the investigative  cooperation between Member States  In cross-border cases, the investigative cooperation between the different Member States is characterised by  some challenges due to the variety of legal system and legal provisions. In addition, the instruments made  available for such cooperation might not yet be sufficient to respond in a timely way to a request for a prompt  collection of the e-evidence that, as mentioned, is volatile and by nature easy to manipulate and destroy. There is  also the European Investigation Order (Directive 2014/41/EU), which can be issued by any Member State: the  receiving Member State is required to execute the order. It can also be used for the collection of electronic  evidence. There is also a proposal for the regulation on European production and preservation orders for  electronic evidence in criminal matters, which would allow any Member State judiciary to request e-evidence  directly from service providers (electronic communication providers, providers of information society services and  IP and domain registries).  Cultural challenges  From the online survey and from the interviews conducted for this report it emerged that cultural challenges also  impact the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE and their interaction with the judiciary. Some interviewees  affirmed for instance that the main difficulty is to make some judiciary personnel understand the technical  language of the CSIRT and to make the CSIRT understand the legal importance of some technical aspects. It seems  that the three communities have different approaches to problems and modus operandi and they speak different  ‘languages’: CSIRTs have a technical approach to problems, while judiciaries have a legal approach. The LEAs have  to relate with these two different mentalities and languages and ‘mediate’. Other interviewees highlighted that  the cultural challenges related to how an organisation deals with other organisations; for instance, statements  such as ‘my job is more important than yours’, ‘you have to share because I am the authority’ do not help the  cooperation, while having a liaison officer (even better with a physical desk available in the other organisation)  helps a great deal.  Also, the level and focus of training vary and the opportunities for CSIRT-LE-judiciary joint training are limited.  Nevertheless, training provides insights to other disciplines that might be required in interdisciplinary  environments, such as when there are interactions across technical and legal domains. Building on the  development of this capability can be seen as a suitable approach (ENISA, 2018, p. 26).  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  49  An ENISA report on Cybersecurity culture guidelines: Behavioural aspects of cybersecurity is currently under  preparation and expected to be published on the ENISA website by end of 2018 or beginning of 2019.  Technical challenges  Some technical challenges faced in the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE and their interaction with the judiciary  are discussed below.  4.4.1 Validation of the digital forensic tools  Digital forensics encompasses tools and techniques aiming to recover any element of data on a device, whether it  has been deleted or not. Digital forensics was introduced in police investigation with the advent of the  digitalisation of enterprises in financial cases to recover deleted evidence such as accounting documents and data.  It is a specialised field that not all IT personnel might be familiar with (IT staff are not always familiar with the  requirements on acquiring the evidence). Digital forensics is mainly linked with the system and network fields at a  very basic level: the inner structure of a hard-drive or the artefacts left by network operation in the core of the  operating system or live physical memory.  The tools and methodologies that digital forensic experts use need to be validated. The forensic tools fall under  national standards in order to produce evidence that is likely to be admissible in court, such a standard was  developed by NIST and was the first to be designed, using a testing protocol for hardware and software (NIST,  2018). The philosophy behind the validation of a tool belongs to the scientific experimentation field. To be  validated, a tool must provide results that are repeatable and reproducible. ‘Repeatable’ means using the same  method(s), on the same item(s), using the same equipment, by the same operator, within a short interval of time,  must lead to the same results. ‘Reproductible’ means that using the same method, on the same items, in a  different laboratory, by a different operator, utilising different equipment, must lead to the same results. An  indicative example is the Cyber Observable eXpression (CybOX TM) (22) that has helped with standardising, storing  and sharing digital forensic information; CybOX TM represents objects and relationships that are common in  forensic investigations.  No international standard is currently in place and each country has discretion as to what is admissible in court and  what is not. What is at stake for the Member States is to have evidence admissibility in computer forensics,  therefore a validation system for forensic methods and tools that are adapted to the each legal framework is  needed.  4.4.2 Different technical maturity levels across different communities  As of today, the level of technical maturity differs from country to country and across the judiciary. For resource  reasons, some LEAs might still lack the automation level that would allow for information to be processed and  exchanged more efficiently. LE and the judiciary are gradually engaging in digitalising their processes and bringing  them to a higher level of technical expertise.  (22) Cyber Observable eXpression (CybOX): https://cybox.mitre.org/  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  50  4.4.3 Lack of common tools, tools for automated or semi-automated transfer of the data, and  coordination tools  Arguably the most important challenge is the cybersecurity aspect: LE IT networks tend to be isolated ones. This is  due to the critical nature of the information stored in the LE system. To avoid taking too many risks, LE IT  management tend to choose to have very limited channels with the outside network. LE use isolated networks that  simply prevent them sharing information with the outside world due to technical restrictions (proxy, lack of open  IPs). This however makes information exchange, from a technical point of view, very difficult.  While the need for information sharing between the CSIRT and LE communities has started to be addressed by  tools such as MISP, there is no one tool in place, other than email, to help the coordination between the two when  dealing with a case (LEAs) or an incident (CSIRTs). For example,  a structured data and automation inducing tool  could be used by LE to mark specific resources (IP addresses, web domains, etc.) as being under investigation and  therefore CSIRTs would know to avoid interference with those resources in the incident-resolution phase.  4.4.4 Taxonomy-related challenges  It must be noted that ‘creating’ a taxonomy is not a simple task. When dealing with topics such as security  incidents, there can be different ways in which to classify them, and it is not always easy or possible to determine  which is the best or the most correct classification. Organisations defining  taxonomies are usually driven by  different needs, and since different CSIRTs have different expectations, teams often end up developing their own  incident classifications for internal use. In fact, the common taxonomy for LE and CSIRTs is itself an adaptation of  the Portuguese National Cybersecurity Centre’s CERT.PT (CERT.PT, 2018) taxonomy, which is itself an adaptation of  the European CSIRT Network eCSIRT.net movie taxonomy (Stikvoort, 2012). One main advantage of the common  taxonomy for LE and CSIRTs for its use in the context of cybercrime is that it has been extended to include the  mapping of the incident classifications with a legal framework. Similarly, there have been a number of taxonomies  that are in essence a branch or modification of another (GitHub, n.d. a) (ENISA, 2018). With the goal of reaching a  consensus on a reference security incident classification taxonomy, ‘ENISA and the European computer security  incident response team (CSIRT) community have jointly set up a task force’ (GitHub, n.d.). Taxonomies are  generally seen by national CSIRTs, LE and competent authorities as the most suitable way to deal with cybercrime  classification matters; this view has also been supported by an ENISA study (23).  LE and prosecutors need to associate the incidents with the provisions and typology of crimes in their legal  framework. It is essential for them to assess whether a fact (e.g. a cyber incident) can be qualified as a crime. The  judicial system normally does not use any taxonomy: at this stage, the event will have to fit into the criminal code  provisions. Choices will be made on a legal basis and investigation strategy. It is essential for CSIRT personnel to be  trained to identify cyber incidents that qualify as a crime and have the ability and be duly authorised to report to  the judiciary and/or LE in view of a potential investigation. A common taxonomy can become purposeful in this  regard as it is relatively easy to understand by CSIRTs (because they can just look at the incident from a technical  standpoint) while allowing LE and the prosecutors and judges to make the appropriate associations with the  provisions in the criminal code.  Some CSIRTs have developed a taxonomy which connects categories of incidents to the offences in the criminal  code and that help and support the interaction across the three communities. Indeed, such taxonomies propose a  (23) Common taxonomy for law enforcement and the national network of CSIRTs: https://www.europol.europa.eu/publications-documents/common- taxonomy-for-law-enforcement-and-csirts  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  51  way of handling each incident, specify the evidence that may be relevant and therefore should be preserved by the  CSIRT and provide additional information about procedural measures that can be used by LE and judiciary to  request and obtain relevant evidence. Also the common taxonomy for law enforcement (21) is linked with the main  international and European legislations: ‘any incident categorised in this taxonomy can be matched to the relevant  and appropriate legislative framework and subsequently mapped to relevant national legislation’ (Europol:  European Cybercrime Centre and ENISA, 2017, p. 5).  A common taxonomy has added a lot in efficiency and to the extent that it also covers internal processes of CSIRTs,  LEAs and the judiciary, all parties could better familiarise themselves with the language used by the other  collaborating communities. This is likely to increase the rate of adoption across all communities.  Organisational challenges  Some organisational challenges faced in the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE and their interaction with the  judiciary are presented here as identified according to the data collected for this report  4.5.1 Need for reciprocal understanding of the structures, roles and strengths  CSIRTs, LE and judiciary have different structures and roles. If CSIRTs have a light hierarchical system based on  operational matters, LE and judiciary organisations in comparison are much more hierarchical.  Although with some simplification we can say that; the CSIRT role is to mitigate an incident and get the system  back on track, the LE role is to find who committed the crime and collect the evidence, the prosecutor role is to  coordinate the investigations and bring the suspect to court if there are the conditions for it, the judge role is to  decide on whether the accused has committed the crime and the sanction based on the evidence provided.  Different structures and different roles might create some friction between those involved: LE might want to wait  and collect as much evidence as possible when the CSIRT might want to clean the system as quickly as possible and  get it back up and running. CSIRTs might want quick responses, while LE and the judiciary need to be in a position  to take certain formal steps to provide a response and comply with certain legal requirements whose fulfilment  might take some time.  What could also help enhance the cooperation and the interaction is a reciprocal understanding of strengths.  There is therefore a need for a reciprocal understanding across the CSIRT, LE and the judiciary communities. This is  a necessary element for a better cooperating and interaction.  4.5.2 Digital forensics expertise and the digital forensics training  ‘The exponential growth of digital traces, as well as the expansion of cybercrime, and digitisation of investigative  methods represent significant changes to society and lead to a broadening horizon of digital investigation (Casey E.  , 2017)’ (Henseler & van Loenhout, 2018, p. 78).  The digital forensics activities require expertise in: ‘data collection, data examination and data analysis. Data  collection involves the correct preservation and copying of digital data sources. Data examination relates to the  investigation of copies of digital data sources to find files, fragments etc. without interpreting the resultant  findings in the context of the case. Data analysis involves the analysis, reconstruction, interpretation and  qualification of the evidence which is obtained from the digital data sources’ (Henseler & van Loenhout, 2018).  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  52  There are, of course, police officer specialists in digital forensic investigations who are trained (24) and well- prepared to conduct digital investigations. However, since there are multiple areas that need to be covered in  digital investigations it is unlikely that all of those areas are known to a single expert or to a team of experts:  Windows forensics, Linux/Unix forensics, OS X forensics, mobile forensics, virtualisation/containerisation etc.  While police forces cooperate and exchange expertise, in some cases there is a need to request some expert  external support. CSIRTs are sometime therefore called to provide this technical expertise on some specific cases.  Although the use of concepts of (factual) witnesses, expert witnesses and forensic experts in different legal  cultures vary. For the purpose of this study, we can understand a factual witness as an individual who knows  specific facts about the case that could be important for the purpose of the criminal investigation. So, a factual  witness could be a CSIRT member who knows what happened in the CSIRT constituency. An expert witness, on the  other hand, is a specialist on a particular body of knowledge, who can provide valuable expert information to LE  and the judiciary. So, the expert witness could be, for example, a member of a CSIRT who knows nothing about the  case at hand, but can explain to the investigator, prosecutor or the court what specific digital evidence proves or  does not prove. From the perspective of the procedural criminal law, the status of the factual witness and the  expert witness is generally no different. The difference is in the nature and quality of the testimony provided.  Any specialist in a particular body of knowledge may become an expert who fulfils the established criteria and,  depending on the country, gets enrolled in the official register of forensic experts in given scientific fields. The  nature of these criteria varies considerably across countries. In some jurisdictions, only the court decides whether  or not the expert meets the criteria, in others the expert must be accredited or must hold a licence granted by an  independent body, elsewhere the expert must be a member of a professional organisation. In any case, only  forensic experts can provide expert opinions which serve as specific evidence in court. Expert opinions and their  processing also have a much more formal character compared with expert witness testimonies, and the  responsibility of the forensic expert for the quality of their opinion is higher and usually specifically legally  regulated.  Experts need to be chosen based on their skills and experience. Depending on the legal system, different levels of  verification of the expert’s skills maybe needed. In some systems CSIRTs might need to be accredited and included  in a specific register of digital forensics experts or a register of court experts to be in the position to provide  support during  criminal investigations and  criminal proceedings (judges and/or the prosecutor may also appoint  one or more digital forensics expert to evaluate some aspects of digital evidence). In addition, sometimes it seems  that there is some confusion regarding the skills and the role of digital forensics: an engineer or a computer  scientist is not always an expert in digital forensics.  The difference in education (mainly technical education for CSIRTs, mainly technical/legal education for LE and  predominantly legal education for the judiciary) might represent a challenge in their communication and way of  approaching the same matter. However, what might be seen as a challenge should also be seen as an enabling  factor and an element of enrichment especially in the context of the expertise exchange and joint training.  In addition, the recent rise in cybercrime has shown the limits of the forensic training: cybercrime requires  knowledge in almost all IT fields: systems, networks, programming, live memory, and electronics (the Internet of  Things (IoT). Digital forensics training for CSIRTs personal, LE and the judiciary needs to address these new  (24) Police officer training might mix internal and external/private courses. Depending on the country and the recruitment policy, these courses can begin  from scratch to train neophytes or be opened only to selected officers who already have a solid background in the subject.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  53  challenges, but sometimes the resources available for training are not sufficient to respond to needs which are in  constant development.  As emerged from the online survey, it seems that to have joint training for CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary is  considered as important or very important.  Figure 19 — Replies to question 13A of the online survey conducted for this report  According to the data collected, the joint training should address inter alia cooperation between CSIRT, LE and the  judiciary, digital collection, evidence analysis, digital evidence handling and the drafting of detailed reports to be  used in criminal courts.  Figure 20 — Replies to question 14 of the online survey conducted for this report  It is important that the CSIRTs are adequately trained to also handle the kinds of information that are usually not  useful for responding to an incident, but that could become e-evidence in a criminal trial.  Q14: Which topics  should joint training  for CSIRT, law  enforcement and  judiciary cover?  Q13A: How important is/would be to have  joint training for CSIRTs, law enforcement and  judiciary?  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  54  The digital forensics experts, including CSIRTs when they are called to support criminal investigations (and  evidence evaluation in criminal proceedings), must normally fulfil specific legal conditions and guidelines while  collecting or assisting in the collection of evidence (see below).  Figure 21 - Replies to question 7 of the online survey conducted for this report  In some countries there are codes of practice from the forensic regulators that stipulate that all providers of digital  forensics services to the criminal justice system must be accredited according to certain standards (on registration  requirements for forensic experts see also: (Henseler & van Loenhout, 2018, p. 80). In some countries, the  validation process however appears to be rather complicated. For instance, forensic experts may be required by  law to demonstrate professional qualifications, but it might happen that there is no official body to set or examine  these qualifications. The president of each court therefore decides what the necessary qualifications are for  forensic experts, and so the quality of experts in each court may vary. Also, due to strict requirements on  qualifications, in some countries, it might be complicated or even impossible for members of CSIRTs to become  forensic experts. In these cases, the only way would be to call the member of the CSIRT as a witness instead of as a  forensic expert.  The duties, powers and function of the forensic expert are often different from those of the witness. The  differences vary from one Member State to another. For example, there may be cases of incapacity and  incompatibility or even conditions of abstention or disqualification of witness when the requirements are different  from those provided for the forensics expert.  Investigators must carry out investigations in full compliance with various legal guarantees. Some of them are also  important in the context of CSIRT involvement. In particular, they are: the presumption of innocence (Council of  Europe, n.d., p. 9), the impartiality in the conduct of investigations (on this topic, see for instance (OLAF  Supervisory Committee, 2010), the reasonable duration for investigations, and the confidentiality of investigations.  From the online survey and from the interviews conducted for this report it emerged that cultural challenges also  impact the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE and their interaction with the judiciary. Some interviewees  affirmed for instance that the main difficulty is to make judiciary understand the technical language of the CSIRT  Q7 – Do personnel of CSIRTs - in particular of national/governmental CSIRTs - need  to adhere to specific legal conditions and guidelines while collecting or assisting in  the collection of evidence in support of an investigation?  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  55  and to make the CSIRT understand the legal importance of some technical aspects. It seems that the three  communities have different approaches to problems and modus operandi and they speak different ‘languages’.  Without resorting into generalisations, it could be simply stated that CSIRTs have a prevalent technical approach to  problems, while the judiciary obviously have a strict legal approach. The LE have to relate with these two  approaches and even languages used.  Also, the level and focus of training vary and the opportunities for CSIRT-LE-judiciary joint training are limited (25).  (25) Cybersecurity culture guidelines: Enhancing CSIRT/LEA community (provisional title) is currently under preparation and expected to be published on the  ENISA website by end of 2018 or beginning of 2019.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  56  Conclusions and recommendations  Conclusions  Using the analysis of the results collected from the desk research, the interviews with subject-matter experts, and  the online survey, the conclusions summarised below were drawn.  5.1.1 CSIRTs interact much more with LE than with the prosecutors and they interact very rarely with  the judiciary  Usually, CSIRTs interact with LE that, in turn, interact with prosecutors. The CSIRT rarely interacts directly with  prosecutors. Even more rarely the CSIRT interacts directly with judges. As a result, LE often act as a link between  CSIRTs and judiciary. CSIRTs and LE mainly have technical training while the judiciary has legal training. LE also  plays a fundamental role of link between subjects who have different training and use different languages.  5.1.2 CSIRTs support law enforcement (as well as prosecutor and judge) in a criminal investigation  The CSIRT technical background can provide a valuable support to criminal investigations, CSIRTs often have the  tools and experience of incidents that allow them to quickly deal with these incidents more efficiently. In addition,  CSIRTs can have data (e.g. IP addresses, web domains) that may be very important for the investigations.  Therefore, the CSIRT support activity for LE and/or prosecutors can be fundamental to identify who committed or  is going to commit a crime. Moreover, depending on the national legal system, the CSIRT personnel can sometimes  play the role of forensic expert or witness during a criminal trial.  5.1.3 There are legal provisions on CSIRTs and LE cooperation and their interaction with the judiciary  The diversity of legal systems is likely to shape the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE as well as their interaction  with the judiciary. However, the implementation of European Directives and the application of European  regulations are helping to reduce these differences between states. Regardless of the differences between legal  systems, the data collected via the interviews show that mutual trust is still a key factor for effective cooperation  between CSIRTs and LE and for effective interaction with the judiciary.  5.1.4 The understanding of whether CSIRTs have to report to/inform LE and/or prosecutor of  suspicious criminal activities could be improved  Depending on the Member State, the CSIRTs may be obliged or not obliged to report an event. In any case, CSIRTs  usually report crimes to LE and only rarely to prosecutors. From the data collected it emerged that overall the  understanding of whether CSIRTs have to report to/inform LE and/or prosecutor of suspicious criminal activities  could be improved. However, it seems that the practical experience and good relations between CSIRTs and LE  help CSIRTs comply with their legal obligations.  5.1.5 There is need for a more extensive usage of information from CSIRTs in criminal investigations  and as evidence in court  As emerged from the desk research and from the interviews, CSIRTs can play an important role in fighting  cybercrime; however, (at least as emerged from the results of the online survey) the frequency of usage of  information from CSIRT for criminal investigations and proceeding is low. It seems therefore that the usage of the  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  57  information that CSIRTs have and that might be key for responding to (cyber) crime could be extended at least in  frequency.  5.1.6 There is need to collect data in order to support cooperation in a data driven approach  As emerged during the desk research, the data available at the moment in area of CSIRT, LE and judiciary  cooperation are still quite limited. No evidence was found during the data collection for instance of the existence  of a central repository of data associated with investigations that involve all three communities.  It is important to collect more data in order to support the cooperation and the decision-making processes at  supranational and national level, but also at the level of the CSIRT, LE and judiciary teams involved in the  cooperation. On evidence-based policymaking see (Commission on evidence-based policymaking, 2017).  Having central repositories of data associated with investigations that involve all three communities, if based on  suitable metrics, could break new ground in the understanding of the interactions and priorities and possibly make  the investigation and prosecution more effective.  5.1.7 Cultural limitations can be noted in the cooperation across the three communities and an  interdisciplinary approach might help  Cultural differences across the three communities exist. If these cultural differences are factored in, the  information flow is hindered, and the cooperation becomes more difficult. While a data driven approach is quite  desirable, understanding the human and cultural aspects is important as well in order to gain appropriate insight  (ENISA, 2016, p. 18).  Sometimes the differences in culture are due to the fact that most of the members of the three communities  (CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary) have different backgrounds. For this reason, an interdisciplinary approach that values  all relevant fields of knowledge (namely legal and technical) is key to enhance cooperation this can also be  addressed through training and experience building.  Sharing experiences and looking at the information flow from all three community perspectives helps understand  potential, needs and priorities across the three communities.  Recommendations  According to the data collected via the online survey, joint training, regular meetings and feedback on the  information provided/shared are suggested to be the best ways to improve the information flow and interaction  across the three communities. See Figure 22.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  58  Figure 22 — Replies to question 13 of the online survey conducted for this report  Some recommendations have been formulated based on the data collected for this report (see below).  5.2.1 Collect data on cooperation and interaction across CSIRT, LE and the judiciary  The data available on the cooperation and interaction across CSIRT, LE and judiciary communities are quite  limited. Such data are key to enhancing the cooperation and interaction and to support related decision- making processes.  While the Member States, and in particular national/governmental CSIRTs, LE and judiciary, would collect  the data at national level, ENISA, EC3 and Eurojust could support this data collection by suggesting data  collection methodologies and methods, providing samples of questions and some common definitions of  key concepts, proposing metrics, indexes and data report templates. Data collected at national level could  be then aggregated by ENISA at EU/EFTA level.  Recommendations   National/governmental CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary: to collect data on cooperation across the three  communities.   ENISA, EC3 and Eurojust: to support the data collection.   ENISA: to aggregate at EU/EFTA level the data collected at national level.  5.2.2 Build on shared experience at strategic cooperation level  To have at national and EU/EFTA level, even possibly beyond, a common plan for the cooperation may help  enhance the cooperation. Sharing experience at strategic cooperation can be a first step towards this.  Recommendations   National/governmental CSIRTs, national LE and the judiciary: to share at national as well as at  EU/EFTA level their experience at strategic cooperation.   ENISA, Europol EC3 and possibly Eurojust: to facilitate, within the EU/EFTA and beyond, the sharing of  experience at strategic cooperation across the three communities.  Q13: What are your  suggestions to improve  the information flow and  the interaction across the  CSIRT, law enforcement  and judiciary  communities?  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  59  5.2.3 Invest in CSIRT/LE/judiciary joint training and skills development  Joint training across CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary would help share existing practices but would also allow the  development of collaborative approaches for the future.  Good training plays a central role in improving the cooperation, including communication of CSIRTs, LE and the  judiciary; joint training should therefore be facilitated.  There should be common understanding of legal and technical matters, including of the challenges faced by one or  more than one of the three communities. An example of topics is provided in Annex D — Examples of topics for  csirt/le/judiciary joint training.  There should be joint exercises based on real-life scenarios and hands-on sessions, where CSIRTs, LE and the  judiciary can practice jointly fighting cybercrime in order to better know each other’s objectives and needs,  especially what type of information each of them needs to do their job. The joint training might be also an  opportunity to further understand the potential that CSIRTs have (e.g. information, contacts, expertise) for the  criminal investigations.  Organising training at a regional level (e.g. for countries with similar legal systems or with other commonalities) as  well as engagement, for the joint training, with leading CSIRTs and national police forces beyond the EU could be  considered.  It is important to develop the awareness that such training is necessary. Therefore, CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary  should provide training to their personnel and joint training should not be perceived as occasional, but instead  scheduled at regular intervals. In addition, it is important to ensure the quality of training through the involvement  of highly qualified individuals and the use of suitable material (some freely accessible material is for instance  available on the ENISA site (ENISA, n.d.c).  Recommendations   National/governmental CSIRTs and national LE training centres: to organise CSIRT-LE-judiciary joint  training.   ENISA, Europol EC3, Eurojust and CEPOL: to facilitate joint training at EU and EFTA national level for  CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary and engage with leading CSIRTs and national police forces beyond the EU,  as appropriate.   CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary: to provide the training requirements to the facilitators of the joint  training.  5.2.4 To reach a better mutual understanding of the other communities and develop memoranda of  understanding to facilitate cooperation/interaction  Mutual understanding of roles, strengths but also of needs and limitations is key for the cooperation and  interaction across the CSIRT, LE and judiciary communities.  Communication and regular meetings between the three communities help reach this mutual understanding. Also  feedback on the information provided and shared or on how the requests for information have been formulated  would help to further enhance the mutual understanding.  In order to support the three communities to reach a better understanding of each other duties assigned by the  roles each community plays, a SoD matrix (see an example in Annex E — Example of segregation of duties matrix)  could be drafted at national level. The aim of this matrix is to highlight conflicting or overlapping duties performed  by one community or more. As shown in the SoD template in Annex E, the CSIRTs, LE, judges and prosecutors have  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  60  to identify the key responsibilities for their communities and then link them with the skills required to fulfil these  duties. SoD matrices are usually used to ensure compliance with laws and regulations.  In some Member States there are memoranda between LE and CSIRTs and, in some cases, also between the three  communities (CSIRT, LE and the judiciary). Based on these memoranda of understanding, for instance LE and the  judiciary are immediately notified by CSIRTs of IT incidents (especially more severe ones) and can immediately  coordinate their actions with the CSIRTs. This coordination activity reduces the risk that CSIRTs may erase  significant data just because they are unaware that such data may be critical for the solution of a criminal case.  Developing memoranda of understanding might also help manage expectations in the cooperation/interaction and  clarify the strengths, need for information sharing of the different communities and limitations they might have in  sharing the information.  Recommendations   National/governmental CSIRTs, LE and possibly prosecutor services: to work together towards a  better mutual understanding of strengths, needs and limitations of the three  communities (CSIRTs, LE  and the judiciary) in relation to the sharing information, also by using SoD matrices.   National/governmental CSIRTs, LE and possibly prosecutor services: to develop memoranda of  understanding to facilitate their cooperation/interaction.  5.2.5 Place liaison officers  To establish liaison officers (e.g. national/governmental CSIRT personnel to LE and to prosecutor and vice versa)  would be beneficial not only for trust-building knowledge but also for reaching a better reciprocal understanding  of the three communities and for facilitating the information flow.  Also providing that they liaise within the other organisation(s) from an allocated physical space (an office that the  liaison officer can use if needed) could help not only from the practical side but also to clearly affirm and recognise  this role.  Recommendation   National/governmental CSIRTs, LE and possibly prosecutor services: to appoint liaison officers to  facilitate the cooperation and the interaction.  5.2.6 Use (common) tools to facilitate cooperation and interaction  CSIRTs, LEs and the judiciary use different types of tools and this is natural given the differences in the roles of  these communities. One suggestion would be that the CSIRTs and LE (which could then feed the information to the  prosecutors when needed) have access to a common platform where they can share information about threats  and those involved in threats, cybersecurity incidents, cyber-attacks and associated tactics, techniques and  procedures (TTPs).  CSIRTs are rarely called as a witnesses in criminal proceedings; however, when this does occur, court information  systems to support cybercrime trials by means of presenting digital evidence may help CSIRTs better fulfil their  role.  Recommendations  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  61   National/governmental CSIRTs, LE and possibly prosecutor services: to investigate the possibility of  having a common platform to share information about threats and those involved in threats,  cybersecurity incidents, cyber-attacks and associated TTPs.   National/governmental CSIRTs, LE and possibly prosecutor services: to investigate how the tools they  use can be further improved to better receive the information provided by other communities and to  better formulate their requests for information addressed to the other communities.

Challenges can be legal, organisational, technical, cultural, etc.   Communication in most cases refers to the information sharing between different parties, in  particular CSIRTs, LEs and judiciary. Sometimes the term ‘communication’ is also used in its legal sense  of ‘policy document with no mandatory authority’ (European Commission (run by), n.a.c), such as the  Commission Communication on Strengthening Europe’s Cyber Resilience System (European  Commission, 2016). In a few cases it refers to the transmitted information or — especially when in  plural — to a system used to transmit the information. Communication is an essential component of  the cooperation between CSIRTs and LEs.   Computer security incident response team (CSIRT) or computer emergency response team (CERT) is  ‘an organisation that studies computer and network security to provide incident response services to  victims of attacks, publish alerts concerning vulnerabilities and threats, and […] offer other  information to help improve computer and network security’. At present, ‘both terms (CERT and  CSIRT) are used in a synonymous manner, with CSIRT being the more precise term’ (ENISA, 2015b, p.  7) (ENISA, 2015a, p. 12) (ENISA, 2016b, p. 10).   Cooperation and collaboration are synonymous in this report. They refer to the joint work —  especially of CSIRTs and LEs — in their coordination of actions, their reciprocal help and their joining  efforts to fight against cybercrime.   Criminal courts are courts in which criminal cases are tried and determined in order to appropriately  punish offenders.   Criminal investigation or crime investigation refers to the process of collecting (and preserving)  evidence to be used to ascertain a fact that might be considered as a criminal activity and determine  who is responsible for it. Normally this process starts when the suspected criminal activity is reported  to the LE (or to the prosecutor depending on the country), or when the LE or the prosecutor become  otherwise aware that such fact has been or is going to be committed and/or closed. The definition of  criminal investigation might somehow vary from country to country; a definition of crime  investigation can be found in (United Nations Office and Drugs and Crime, 2006, p. 1).   Criminal proceedings refer to proceedings aiming to ascertain if a crime has been committed and who  committed it. The adjective ‘criminal’ is used to distinguish them from other kinds of proceedings,  such as civil, administrative and disciplinary, which have different aims and are governed by different  rules.   CSIRTs network is the network established by the Article 12 of the NIS directive (European Parliament  and Council of the European Union, 2016e) ‘to contribute to the development of confidence and trust  between the Member States and to promote swift and effective operational cooperation’. It is  composed of EU Member States’ appointed CSIRTs and CERT-EU. The European Commission  participates in the network as an observer. ENISA is tasked to actively support the CSIRTs cooperation,  provide the secretariat and active support for incident coordination upon request.   Cybercrime is an umbrella term. An unequivocal definition of cybercrime does not exist. In general,  we refer by it to ‘Any offence where the modus operandi or signature [which refers to ‘the mental and  emotional motivations” (Geberth, 1995)] involves the use of a computer network in any way’ (Casey E.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  75  , 2004, p. 667). Cybercrime includes both crimes where computer is an object (e.g. illegal access to an  information system) or a tool (e.g. storage of illegal images on a computer device or usage of a  computer to plan a murder) of crime. It must be noted that ‘While many aspects of cybercrime are  firmly established, other areas of cybercrime have witnessed a striking upsurge in activity, including  attacks on an unprecedented scale, as cybercrime continues to take new forms and new directions’  (Europol, 2017).   Cultural aspects refer to the dimensions of the CSIRT-LE cooperation and their interaction with  judiciary that relate to culture. ‘Culture shapes our identities, aspirations and how we relate to others  and the world’. ‘The challenges are significant. Cultural diversity is an asset for the EU, but linguistic  and cultural differences lead to (…) fragmentation’ (European Commission, 2014a, p. 3).   EFTA: the European Free Trade Association (EFTA, n.d.) is the intergovernmental organisation of  Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.   Electronic evidence (or e-evidence) refers to ‘evidence stored in electronic form […] consisting in  stored subscriber data, access data, transactional data and content data’ (European Commission,  2018, p. 38).   EU Member States are the states that are part of the European Union. At present (status: 26 October  2018), there are 28 Member States (EU-28). In alphabetical order, they are: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria,  Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy,  Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia,  Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom (Europe Union, 2018).   Governmental CSIRTs are teams whose constituency are the public administration networks.  Currently ‘in the EU, governmental CSIRTs are typically used to protect the cyberspace of  governmental institutions including critical infrastructure [- more precisely, following NIS Directive  (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016e) and its Annex 2, the Operator of  Essential Services -] as well as to ensure cyber-crisis management” (ENISA, 2015c, p. 9).  ‘Governmental CSIRTs [indeed] mainly manage crisis and provide response to cyber threats and  incidents concerning the public sector, but in many cases also the critical infrastructures, and in  limited cases also the private domain, which however is usually within the remits of other CSIRTs in  the private sector. […] In some Member States, governmental CSIRTs have coordinating and  supervision functions for other relevant stakeholders, which proves to be a useful practice, especially  in those Member States where the response mechanism to cyber- attacks is quite complex, and/or a  significant number of different CSIRTs both in the public and the private sector co-exist in parallel”  (Council of the European Union, 2017, p. 66).   Information sharing refers to ‘the exchange of a variety of network and information security related  information such as risks, vulnerabilities, threats and internal security issues as well as good practice’  (ENISA, 2010, p. 9).   Incident is ‘any event having an actual adverse effect on the security of network and information  systems’ (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016e).   Incident handling refers to ‘all procedures supporting the detection, analysis and containment of an  incident and the response thereto’ (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016e).   Interaction refers ‘a mutual or reciprocal action or influence’ (Collins Dictionary).   Judges refers to a person who is in charge of a court of law and who makes final decisions.   Judiciary is the ‘entirety of courts and judicial authorities in a state or in another sovereign.  organisation such as the European Union (EU). The main task of the courts is to resolve legal disputes  and to ensure that the law is applied correctly and coherently’ (European Commission, n.d.). Judiciary  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  76  in this report refers both to prosecutors and judges (similar approach taken in (Council of the  European Union, 2017).   Law enforcement (LE), law-enforcement agencies (LEAs), police and police agencies are terms used  in this report are synonymous and used to refer to police and police agencies, also used as  synonymous. For this report, ‘law enforcement’ does not encompass prosecution services and courts,  which are referred to in this report as ‘judiciary’. LE usually fulfil the following missions: general  police, investigation, public order and security state missions (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2018).   Legal aspects refer to the dimensions of the CSIRT-LE cooperation and their interaction with judiciary  that relate to the rules and policies shaping and governing it, including obligations, discretion,  prohibition to share information in their effort to fight against cybercrime.   National CSIRT is a CSIRT that ‘acts as national point of contact (PoC) for information sharing (like  incident reports, vulnerability information and other) with other national […] CSIRTs in the EU  Member States and worldwide. National […] CSIRT can be considered as ‘CERT of last resort’, which is  just another definition of a unique national PoC with a coordinating role. In a lot of cases a national  […] CSIRTs also acts as governmental […] CSIRT. Definitions may vary across the EU Member States’  (ENISA, 2009, p. 8). A ‘crucial role in monitoring and responding to cyber incidents is played by the  national CSIRTs that the majority of the Member States have already established’ (Council of the  European Union, 2017, p. 12). Requirements and tasks for CSIRTs are listed in Annex I of the NIS  Directive (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016e).   Network and information system refers to ‘(a) an electronic communications network […]; (b) any  device or group of interconnected or related devices, one or more of which, under a program,  perform automatic processing of digital data; or (c) digital data stored, processed, retrieved or  transmitted by elements covered under points (a) and (b) for the purposes of their operation, use,  protection and maintenance” (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016e).   Organisational aspects refer to those dimensions of the CSIRT-LE cooperation and their interaction  with judiciary that relate to steps taken, procedures followed, resources available, etc. in their  cooperation to fight against cybercrime.   Practices refers to ‘something that is usually or regularly done, often as a habit, tradition, or custom’  (Cambridge University Press, n.d.).   Prosecutors: refers ‘a legal official who accuses someone of committing a crime, especially in a  [criminal] law court’ (Cambridge Dictionary, n.d.). ‘The public prosecutors’ office or prosecution  service […] is regarded as part of the judiciary in many Member States’ ’ (European Commission (run  by), n.d.(b)). Also, for this report prosecutors are considered as part of the judiciary.   Taxonomy ‘is defined as a classification of terms. Three characteristics define a taxonomy:  o a form of classification scheme to group related things together and to define the relationship  these things have to each other;  o a semantic vocabulary to describe knowledge and information assets; and  o a knowledge map to give users an immediately grasp of the overall structure of the knowledge  domain covered by the taxonomy, which should be comprehensive, predictable and easy to  navigate’ (ENISA, 2016a , p. 7).  ‘There is currently no consensus on concepts and definitions related to taxonomies’ (ENISA, 2016a , p.  5).  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  77   Technical aspects refer to the dimensions of the CSIRT-LE cooperation and their interaction with  judiciary that relate to the tools (e.g. applications, the platforms) and the methodologies used to  share information in their effort to fight against cybercrime.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  78  Annex C: An overview of legal systems, areas of law, and legal  traditions (common law and civil law)  Each Member State has its own laws and rules that govern the various facets of social interaction. The set of all  these laws and rules constitutes a legal system.  A legal system is divided into areas, such as: private law (which includes the civil law in the sense of the law related  to civil wrongs as opposite of criminal law which relates to crimes), public law, international law, European law,  criminal law (the law related to crimes), and criminal procedure. Every legal system has elements that characterise  all areas of law within that system. Depending on the legal system, the same area of law (for example, criminal  procedure) can be disciplined differently. On some specific matters, however, the Member States might have the  same legislation, or a very similar one, either since they come from a similar legal tradition or because the matter  is regulated at EU level.  The national legal systems can be divided into two main groups: the civil law systems (26) and the common law  systems. Some countries have mixed legal systems of civil and common law. Most Member States of the European  Union base their legal system on a codified civil law. Nordic legal tradition is generally consider as belonging to civil  law tradition but with some own characteristics (27). Member States with common law system include United  Kingdom, Ireland and Cyprus and a mixed legal system can be found in Malta. The European Union law is based on  the treaties and mixes civil law with an attachment to the importance of case-law of the European Court of Justice.  As seen in Figure 23, the map provides an overview of the different legal traditions in the EU and in EFTA.  The civil law systems derive from Roman law. These systems represent the legal systems of continental Europe and  those that derive from them. Even though individual civil law systems may vary widely both in procedure and  substantive law, there are common features, the main one being that its core principles are codified into a  referable system, which serve as a primary source of law.  The common law systems derive from the juridical tradition developed in England (United Kingdom) in the  Eleventh Century. Common law systems are English law, the United States law and those derived from them. The  main feature of common law systems is that the body of law is derived mainly from judicial decisions of courts. The  following main two differences should be mentioned between civil law and common law systems:   These two groups of legal systems attribute a different role to judgments. Only in common law  systems a case-law is considered not only as a source of law, but as a source of law of primary  importance. In the common law system, judges therefore have an active role in developing rules.  Instead, in a civil law system a case-law is not a source of law.   In the common law systems, the judge, except cases, must comply with what was decided by previous  judgments. In civil law systems the precedent can be important, but it is never binding for a new  decision and, in any case, it is not a source of law.  (26) The term ‘civil law’ has two meanings. It may refer to the non-criminal branch of law in a common law legal system, and to the continental law originating  in continental Europe and based on Roman law. In this study by ‘civil law system’ we mean the latter, the legal system based on continental legal tradition.  (27) ‘The Nordic countries lack a general civil code and are using a system of less comprehensive statutes supplemented by analogies from statutory  provisions, case-law and legal doctrine filling the gaps’ (Berniz, p. 28).  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  79  The difference between the different legal traditions and legal systems influences considerably the area of criminal  procedural law (described below) and so the interaction and information flow with the different players namely, as  far as concerns this report, the CSIRT, LE and the judiciary.  Figure 23 — Map Showing the Different Legal Traditions in the EU and EFTA (created with mapchart.net)  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  80  Annex D: The WHOIS registry  Most of the 21 subject-matter experts interviewed for this report expressed the opinion that, while the GDPR has  an impact on the publicly availability of certain WHOIS data used for the criminal investigations/incident handling,  in principle this has not impacted the way CSIRTs and LE cooperate. However, several interviewees highlighted that  because of the fact that the GDPR is applicable only as of 25 May 2018, it is difficult to make a complete  assessment of the changes or possible changes that might occur.  One of the WHOIS legitimate use indeed is for criminal investigations and incident managing (ICANN, 2018d).  Domain names are essential for criminals to run their infrastructures and malicious campaigns online. They need  domains for getting sensitive information from internet users (Phishing), to spread malicious software or to send  Spam to internet users. Even though criminals use fake or stolen identities to register domain names most of the  time, these identifiers are invaluable for detecting and preventing internet crime that depends on domain names,  like any legal online business.  On 25 May, the international law-enforcement community and the CSIRT communities have lost direct access to  personal data on registrants of domain names. This is having a very strong negative impact both on criminal  investigations online and on the security and defence of networks in general and represents a challenge for LE and  for the CSIRT community in the performance of their tasks. Therefore, timely access to what is now non-public  WHOIS information (without court order) should be ensured for both the LEA community and the CISRT.  LE now need to initiate formal legal process and MLA to obtain relevant information. This comes with a substantial  administrative burden as well as long delays (28). The delays involved in obtaining WHOIS data from registries,  registrars and lower-level providers through formal legal process may be much longer than the period for which  the data in question is being retained. By the time formal procedures are concluded, the data may therefore no  longer exist. This is significantly harming the public interest and has severe negative consequences for the rule of  law online.  For the CSIRT community the situation is worse because they do not have the mandate to request a court order so  they are dependent on the goodwill of registries and registrars to access the information.  ICANN community is currently trying to agree on a Unified Access Model to non-public WHOIS information for  entities which have a legitimate need (public interest). It is absolutely essential that both LEA and CSIRT have this  direct access because of their function.  Usage of WHOIS for Incident Handling and for Criminal Investigations  The ‘WHOIS is indispensable to the smooth operation of the DNS’ but it also ‘used for many [other] legitimate  purposes, including:   To establish or look into an identity in cyberspace, and as part of an incident response following an  internet or computer attack (security professionals and law-enforcement agents use WHOIS to  identify points of contact for a domain name.)  (28) EJCN statement on WHOIS database reform - WK 6398/2018 INIT – 29 May 2018.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  81   ‘To gather investigative leads (i.e. to identify parties from whom additional information might be  obtained). Law-enforcement agents use WHOIS to find email addresses and attempt to identify the  location of an alleged perpetrator of a crime involving fraud’ (ICANN, 2018d).  WHOIS and GDPR compliance  Some preliminary considerations should be made when addressing the WHOIS and its compliance to the GDPR:   The GDPR has been applicable as of 25 May 2018.   The GDPR builds on existing principles, such as the principle of lawfulness, fairness and transparency,  principle of purpose limitation and the principle of data minimisation.   The GDPR concerns personal data on individuals, not to legal entities.   In the context of the WHOIS some personal data, but not only personal data, are processed.   As discussed above (see Section 3.2.2.1) the GDPR does not apply to the processing of personal data  ‘by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution  of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the  prevention of threats to public security’. The data protection law enforcement directive applies  instead.   The legitimacy and the importance of access to WHOIS data for public policy purposes (firstly LE) is  uncontested.   LEs have a clear interest in having access to data in the WHOIS register when it is necessary for their  investigations; reason why some access procedures should be designed to ensure that LE can obtain  WHOIS data, not publicly available, within an appropriate time frame for the investigation (European  Commission, 2018).   The issue of the WHOIS and its compliance to protection of personal data rules was discussed also  well-before the GDPR has started to become applicable: the ‘EDPB [European Data Protection  Board]’s predecessor, WP29 [Working Party Article 29], has been offering guidance to ICANN on how  to bring WHOIS in compliance with European data protection law since 2003’ (European Data  Protection Board, 2018a).   With the approaching of the GDPR applicability and now that the GDPR is applicable, this discussion  seemed to have become more intensive.  Some recent developments of this discussion include:   A dialogue within ICANN and between ICANN and the main stakeholders to find viable solutions to  have a GDPR-compliant WHOIS while enabling legitimate uses by relevant stakeholders (including LE  and CSIRTs) as well as unpublished WHOIS data. For instance, ‘As work is ongoing within ICANN to  make this database compliant with data protection rules, in particular the general data protection  regulation [GDPR], the Commission sent a letter (European Commission, 2018) to ICANN on the dual  objectives of ensuring quick access to its directories for public interest purposes whilst being fully  compliant with EU data protection rules. The ICANN Government Advisory Committee, in which  national governments and the Commission are represented, voiced its concerns and called on ICANN  to ensure continued access to the WHOIS, including non-public data, for users with a legitimate  purpose.’ (European Comission, 2018). The European Commission in its ‘Technical input on proposed  WHOIS Models on behalf of the European Union.’ (European Commission, 2018) made observations  on the different proposed models to provide access by LE to certain WHOIS is data not publicly but  necessary for them for the performance of their task. Also the EDPB in its letter of 5 July 2018  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  82  provided ICANN with guidance to enable ICANN to develop a GDPR-compliant model for access for  legitimate purposes to personal data that are processed in the context of WHOIS but are not publicly  available (European Data Protection Board, 2018b).   The development of technical solutions (e.g. logging to access non-public WHOIS data) as well as of  accreditation programmes ‘allowing full access to non-public WHOIS data for LE and other legitimate  third parties (IP Rights, cybersecurity, etc.)’ (ICANN, 2018e). See for instance the Draft accreditation &  access model for non-public WHOIS data (ICANN, 2018f).   The recent court case of ICANN before German Courts (29), requesting an injunction against an  accredited registrar to reinstate the collection of all WHOIS data required under the their registrar  accreditation agreement: the registrar had stopped to collect some of these data (e.g. administrative  and technical contact information) when selling new domain name registrations because believing  that the collection of that particular data would be in violation of the GDPR; ICANN with this court  case also aimed to seek assistance on the GDPR interpretation. It must be noted that on  3 August 2018 the Appellate Court has determined that it would not issue such injunction and in  making its ruling, ‘the Appellate Court stated that the interpretation of the GDPR was not material to  its decision, so there was no obligation to refer the matter to the European Court of Justice’ (ICANN,  2018c).  (29)Below are summarised the main steps of this court case (status: 9 August 2018):   17 May 2018: effective as of 25 May 2018 (starting date of GDPR applicability), ICANN adopted Temporary Specification for gTLD  Registration Data (ICANN, 2018g), which ‘establishes temporary requirements to allow ICANN and gTLD registry operators and registrars  to continue to comply with existing ICANN contractual requirements and community-developed policies in light of the GDPR’ (ICANN,  2018g).   25 May 2018: ‘The internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) […] filed injunction proceedings against EPAG, a  Germany-based, ICANN-accredited registrar […]. ICANN has taken this step to ask the court for assistance in interpreting the European  Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in order to protect the data collected in WHOIS. ICANN's \"one-sided filing\" in Bonn,  Germany, seeks a court ruling to ensure the continued collection of all WHOIS data, so that such data remains available to parties  demonstrating legitimate purpose to access it, consistent with the GDPR’ (ICANN, 2018h).   29 May 2018: the Regional Court of Bonn decided that ‘it would not issue an injunction against EPAG. In rejecting the injunctive relief,  the Court ruled that it would not require EPAG to collect the administrative and technical data for new registrations. However, the  Court did not indicate in its ruling that collecting such data would be a violation of the GDPR’ (ICANN, 2018i) (sentence in German:  (ICANN v. EPAG Domainservices GmbH, 2018) - non-official translation to English: (ICANN v. EPAG Domainservices GmbH, 2018b).   13 June 2018: ICANN appealed against the ruling of the Regional Court of Bonn to the Higher Regional Court of Cologne, Germany, and  ‘again asked for an injunction that would require EPAG to reinstate the collection of all WHOIS data required under EPAG's Registrar  Accreditation Agreement with ICANN’ (ICANN, 2018c) (Appeal in German – Appeal in English non-official translation:  https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/litigation-icann-v-epag-immediate-appeal-redacted-13jun18-en.pdf )   21 June 2018: ‘the Regional Court in Bonn, Germany, decided to revisit its ruling in the injunction proceedings, which it has the option  to do upon receipt of an appeal (https://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2-2018-08-03-en)   18 July 2018: ‘the Regional Court [of Bonn] decided not to change its original determination not to issue an injunction against EPAG, and  referred the matter to the Higher Regional Court in Cologne for the appeal’   3 August 2018: ICANN announced that the ‘German appeal court (Appellate Court of Cologne) has issued a decision on the injunction  proceedings ICANN initiated against EPAG, a Germany-based, ICANN-accredited registrar that is part of the Tucows Group. The  Appellate Court has determined that it would not issue an injunction [emphasis added] against EPAG. In making its ruling, the Appellate  Court stated that the interpretation of the GDPR was not material to its decision, so there was no obligation to refer the matter to the  European Court of Justice’ [emphasis added]’ (https://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2-2018-08-03-en)  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  83  Annex E: Questionnaire to support the subject matter expert  Interviews  The questions below have been prepared to support the interviews with subject-matter experts to collect data for  drafting an ENISA report on ‘Current cooperation between CSIRT and LEA community and on possible ways to  further enhance their cooperation’ (provisional title: ‘The Interplay between CSIRTs, Law enforcement and the  judiciary in the fight against cybercrime: Closing the cycle’). This report contributes to the implementation of  Output O.4.2.2 (Support the fight against cybercrime and collaboration between CSIRTs and LEAs) of the ENISA’s  Programming Document 2018-2020 (link: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa- programming-document-2018-2020). The report is expected to be published by end of 2018.  ENISA selected some external experts from the List of NIS Experts compiled following the ENISA call for expression  of interest (CEI) (Ref. ENISA M-CEI-17-T01) to support the data collection and drafting of this report. In addition to  desk research and an online survey (planned), the data collection is done also via interviews with subject-matter  experts.  The expected duration of the interview is 1 hour.  Some of the questions below are common to CSIRTs, LEAs and judiciary (judges and prosecutor), while others are  tailored to CSIRTs, LEAs and judiciary.

[1]  The data controller of the processing operation is ENISA Core Operations Department.  The legal basis for the processing operation is:  o Article 5(a) of Regulation 45/2001/EC[2] based on Article 3(b)(v) of the Regulation (EU) No 526/2013  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013, repealing Regulation (EC) No 460/2004[3],  stating that one of ENISA’s tasks is: to ‘support voluntary cooperation among competent public bodies,  and between stakeholders’. With the view of contributing to the fulfilment of such task and according to  the ENISA Programming Document 2018-2020 as approved by Management Board in Decision No  MB/2017/11[4], ENISA is drafting a report on ‘Current cooperation between CSIRT and LEA community and  on possible ways to further enhance their cooperation’ (see Output O.4.2.2 — Support the fight against  cybercrime and collaboration between CSIRTs and LEA); or  o Article 5(d) of Regulation 45/2001/EC based on the consent of the data subject.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  November 2018  87  The purpose of this processing operation is to collect data via an online survey and some subject-matter  interviews for the drafting of the ENISA report on ‘Current cooperation between CSIRT and LEA community  and on possible ways to further enhance their cooperation’.  The following personal data are collected for the respondents of the online survey and of the interviews.  a. Contact data: name, surname, community they belong to (e.g. CSIRT, LE, prosecutors, judges, etc.),  position, affiliation, country, email address, phone number (optional).  b. Knowledge-related data: While participating in the online survey and by replying to the questions  during the interviews a respondent may produce data, for example data related to his or her knowledge  and analysis in the field of information security.  The recipients of the data will be designated ENISA staff involved in the data collection and drafting of the  report, and some external experts, selected by ENISA from the ‘Call for Expressions of Interest — List of  NIS Experts’ [5], supporting ENISA with the data collection and the drafting of the report. Only when explicit  written consent is provided by the data subject, name, surname, affiliation, country, might be included in  the acknowledgements of the report that is expected to be published in December 2018. The data may  also be available to EU bodies charged with compliance monitoring and inspection tasks.  While the online survey will be conducted by using the EU Survey tool [6], the interviews with subject- matter experts will be conducted face-to-face, over the phone, via skype or with other means to be  agreed with the interviewee.  Personal data will be kept up to a maximum period of one year after the publication of the report, expected  to be published in December 2018. After the end of this period, the contact data will be manually deleted.  However, knowledge-related data are kept by ENISA beyond this period in an anonymised form (without  linking to contact data) for future ENISA projects.  You have the right to access your personal data, the right to correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal  data and the right to delete your data. Knowledge-related data will be kept in anonymised form (without  linking to contact data).

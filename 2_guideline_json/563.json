The reform, was transposed by most EU Member States halfway 2011.  Article 13a concerns security and integrity of electronic communication networks and services. The  first part of Article 13a requires that providers of networks and services manage security risks and take  appropriate security measures to guarantee the security (paragraph 1) and integrity (paragraph 2) of  these networks and services. The second part of Article 13a (paragraph 3) requires providers to report  about significant security breaches and losses of integrity to competent national authorities, who  should report about these security incidents to ENISA and the European Commission (EC) annually.  In 2010, ENISA, the European Commission (EC), Ministries and Telecommunication National  Regulatory Authorities (NRAs), initiated a series of meetings (workshops, conference calls) to achieve  an efficient and harmonised implementation of Article 13a across the EU. The Article 13a working  group now comprises experts from NRAs of most EU countries, and several EFTA and EU candidate  countries. Meetings (telephonic or physical) are organized and chaired by technical experts from  ENISA. The European Commission participates as an observer in these meetings.  The Article 13a Working Group reached consensus on two non-binding technical guidelines for NRAs:  the “Technical Guideline on Minimum Security Measures” and the “Technical Guideline on Incident  Reporting” (this document).  This document, the Technical Guideline for Incident Reporting, provides guidance to NRAs about the  technical implementation of paragraph 3 of Article 13a: Incident reporting. Paragraph 3 of Article 13a  describes three types of incident reporting: 1) National incident reporting from providers to NRAs, 2)  Ad-hoc incident reporting between NRAs and ENISA, and 3) Annual summary reporting from NRAs to  the EC and ENISA. The focus of this guideline is on the 2nd and 3rd type of reporting: ad-hoc reporting  and annual summary reporting. For example, it provides a reporting structure and thresholds.  In spring 2012 NRAs, from all EU countries and some EFTA and EU candidate countries, implemented  the first annual summary reporting about the 2011 incidents. Subsequently, at the start of each year  NRAs send annual summary reports to ENISA and the EC. Yearly ENISA publishes an aggregate analysis  of the reported incidents in a public report.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports  Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting  Technical guidance on the incident reporting in Article 13a  Version 2.1, October 2014  Page  iv  Table of Contents  Preface iii  1 Introduction 1  2 EU policy context and ENISA’s role and objectives 2  3 Article 13a, scope and terminology 4  4 National incident reporting 7  5 Ad-hoc incident reporting 9  6 Annual summary reporting 10  7 Incident report template 12  8 References 16  Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting  Technical guidance on the incident reporting in Article 13a  Version 2.1, October 2014  Page  1  1 Introduction  In this document, we provide guidance to National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) about paragraph 3  of Article 13a of the Framework directive (Directive 2002/21/EC as amended by Directive  2009/140/EC). It focusses on how to report incidents with ENISA and the EC and between NRAs.  This document is drafted by a working group comprising experts from NRAs and representatives of  the EC, supported by technical experts from ENISA (see Preface): the Article 13a Expert Group.  1.1 Target audience  This document is addressed to national ministries and NRAs in European Member States, the  authorities tasked with the implementation of Article 13a.  This document may be useful also for experts working in the EU’s electronic communications sector  and for experts working in the information security field.  1.2 Goal  This document is published by ENISA to provide guidance to NRA’s about the technical implementation  of the incident reporting described in paragraph 3 of Article 13a.  1.3 Updates  ENISA updates this guideline periodically, when necessary and in agreement with the NRAs.  Version 2.0 is an update of Version 1.0 of the Guideline on Incident Reporting. Besides many smaller  changes, simplifications and (most importantly) clarifications, the main changes are:   Simplified thresholds for annual incident reporting.   Examples of approaches for national incident reporting.   More detail about incident impact and incident causes.  Version 2.1 adds an absolute threshold to the annual summary reporting of 1 million user-hours.  1.4 Structure of this document  In Section 2 we introduce Article 13a. In Section 3 we explain the scope and definitions used in this  document. In Section 4 we show different approaches to national incident reporting. In Section 5 we  describe ad-hoc reporting and in Section 6 we describe how NRAs should implement annual summary  reporting to ENISA and the EC. In Section 7 we describe a incident report template fields, which should  be used by NRAs for ad-hoc reporting and annual summary reporting.  Throughout this text we use as in IETF RFC2119 the terms ‘should’ (or ‘recommended’) for  recommended items, and ‘may’ (or ‘optional’) for optional items. For the sake of explanation we  provide some (non-binding) examples using a blue italic font.  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13 http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt  Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting  Technical guidance on the incident reporting in Article 13a  Version 2.1, October 2014  Page  2  2 EU policy context and ENISA’s role and objectives  In this section we discuss ENISA’s role and objectives and we summarize the EU policy context.  2.1 EU policy context  This guideline concerns Article 13a of the Framework directive (Directive 2002/21/EC as amended by  Directive 2009/140/EC). Besides Article 13a there are a number of other initiatives (legal or otherwise)  addressing the security of public electronic communications networks and services:   In 2006, the EC issued a strategy for a secure information society – dialogue, partnership and  empowerment (COM (2006) 251), which was endorsed the next year by the European Council  (Council Resolution 2007/068/01). One of the main actions of the strategy is a multi- stakeholder dialogue on the security and resilience of networks and information systems: the  European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection (EPCIP).   In 2009, the EC adopted, in March 2009, a communications and action plan on Critical  Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP), called Protecting Europe from Large Scale Cyber- Attacks and Disruptions: Enhancing Preparedness, Security and Resilience (COM (2009) 149).  This communication focuses on “prevention, preparedness, and awareness” and defines an  immediate action plan to strengthen the security and resilience of CIIs.   The Council Conclusion on CIIP issued on May 2011, taking stock of the results achieved since  the adoption of the CIIP action plan in 2009, was launched to strengthen the security and  resilience of vital Information and Communication Technology Infrastructures.  For an overview of several security articles, which address security measures and incident reporting,  we refer to the ENISA paper Cyber incident reporting in the EU which summarizes and compares  Article 13a of the Framework directive, Article 4 of the e-Privacy directive, Article 15 of the proposed  e-Trust/e-ID regulation and the reporting requirements in the proposed data protection reform.  In 2013 the European Commission issued a European Cyber Security Strategy. The strategy and  contains explicit references to Article 13a and the accompanying directive on Network and  Information Security extends the provisions of Article 13a to other critical sectors (see also  References).  2.2 ENISA’s role and objectives  We briefly describe ENISA’s role and objectives in the implementation of the Framework directive  (2002/21/EC as amended by 2009/140/EC) and Article 13a in particular.  ENISA is mentioned in the preambles of the Framework directive:   In preamble 44 of the Framework directive ENISA is asked to contribute to enhancing the level  of security of electronic communications by, among other things, \"providing expertise and  advice, and promoting the exchange of best practice”.   In preamble 44 of the Framework directive also mentions that ENISA should have the means  to carry out the relevant duties and the powers to obtain sufficient information to assess the  level of security of networks and services.   In preamble 46 of the Framework directive ENISA is asked to contribute to the harmonisation  of security measures by providing expert advice.  ENISA is also mentioned in Article 13a of the Framework directive:   Paragraph 3 of Article 13a requires NRAs to, when appropriate, inform NRAs in other Member  States and ENISA.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2006/com2006_0251en01.pdf http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0149:FIN:EN:HTML http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/fight_against_terrorism/l33260_en.htm http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0149:FIN:EN:PDF http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/11/st10/st10299.en11.pdf http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/cyber-incident-reporting-in-the-eu http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security  Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting  Technical guidance on the incident reporting in Article 13a  Version 2.1, October 2014  Page  3   Paragraph 3 of Article 13a requires NRAs to submit annual summary reports of the incidents  to both the European commission and ENISA.   Article 13a mentions that the European commission may decide to adopt technical  implementing measures with a view to harmonisation of the implementation of paragraphs  1, 2, and 3 of Article 13a. Article 13a mentions that in this case the European commission will  take into account the opinion of ENISA.  ENISA’s primary objective is to implement the incident reporting mandated in Article 13a, i.e. to agree  with the Member States on an efficient implementation of ad-hoc incident reporting and annual  summary reporting.  Secondly, ENISA aims to use annual summary reporting for the following purposes.   To give feedback to NRAs about   security incidents that have had significant impact,   root causes of security incidents,   lessons learned from security incidents, and   incident trends.   To provide aggregate (statistical) analysis of incidents for policy makers, the public and the  industry, describing overall frequency and impact of security incidents across the EU. ENISA  published such an aggregate analysis for the first time in 2012, in the first annual report.   To facilitate the exchange of experiences and lessons learned among NRAs, to allow them to  better understand and address security incidents.   Issue recommendations and guidance for NRAs, the private sector and policy makers.   Evaluate the effectiveness of security measures in place.   Develop more realistic incident scenarios for pan-European exercises.  Thirdly, ENISA aims to support NRAs with the implementation of national incident reporting schemes  and in this way support efficient and harmonized incident reporting schemes across the EU.  Harmonized implementation of legislation creates a level playing field and makes it easier for  providers and users to operate across different EU countries.  file:///C:/Users/dekkema/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Word/first%20annual%20report  Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting  Technical guidance on the incident reporting in Article 13a  Version 2.1, October 2014  Page  4  3 Article 13a, scope and terminology  In this section we introduce paragraph 3 of Article 13a and the scope of this guideline.  3.1 Paragraph 3 of Article 13a  For the sake of reference, we reproduce the text of paragraph 3 of Article 13a here.  “3. Member States shall ensure that undertakings providing public communications networks or  publicly available electronic communications services notify the competent national regulatory  authority of a breach of security or loss of integrity that has had a significant impact on the operation  of networks or services.  Where appropriate, the national regulatory authority concerned shall inform the national regulatory  authorities in other Member States and the European Network and Information Security Agency  (ENISA). The national regulatory authority concerned may inform the public or require the  undertakings to do so, where it determines that disclosure of the breach is in the public interest.  Once a year, the national regulatory authority concerned shall submit a summary report to the  Commission and ENISA on the notifications received and the action taken in accordance with this  paragraph.”  Hence Article 13a introduces three types of incident reporting: 1) National incident reporting from  providers to NRAs, 2) Ad-hoc incident reporting between NRAs and ENISA, and 3) Annual summary  reporting from NRAs to the EC and ENISA. The different types of reporting are shown in Figure 1. This  guideline focusses on the latter two.  Member stateMember state  National incident reporting  Ad-hoc reporting  Annual summary reporting  National  authority  Network or  service  provider  Network or  service  provider  Network or  service  provider  Member stateMember state  National  authority  Network or  service  provider  Network or  service  provider  Network or  service  provider  ENISA  EC  Figure 1. Three types of incident reporting in Article 13a  Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting  Technical guidance on the incident reporting in Article 13a  Version 2.1, October 2014  Page  5  3.2 Electronic communication services  This guideline focuses on the following communication services and networks.   Fixed telephony   Mobile telephony   Fixed internet access   Mobile internet access  We stress that this is neither an exhaustive list of electronic communication services defined in the  Directive nor an exhaustive list of services that are being regulated by NRAs.  Other services are not discussed explicitly in this guideline, but many of the concepts in this guideline  should apply to other types of electronic communication services as well.  3.3 Security incidents  Article 13a mentions ‘security incidents’, ‘security breaches’ and ‘integrity losses’:   Paragraph 1 requires “that measures shall be taken to prevent and minimise the impact of  security incidents on users and interconnected networks”   Paragraph 2 requires providers to “take all appropriate steps to guarantee integrity of their  networks, and thus ensure the continuity of supply of services”.   Paragraph 3 requires “to notify the competent national regulatory authority of a breach of  security or loss of integrity that has had a significant impact on the operation of networks or  services”  The use of the term integrity in the article text may be confusing to some readers. We refer to the  definition in technical literature on networks and network interconnections1, which defines integrity  “as the ability of the system to retain its specified attributes in terms of performance and functionality”.  Integrity of networks would be called availability or continuity in most information security literature2.  In this guideline we call these types of incidents simply ‘security incidents’ and we use the following  definition in this document.  Security incident: A breach of security or a loss of integrity that could have an impact on the operation  of electronic telecommunications networks and services.  3.4 Significant impact  Article 13a requires that providers report about a breach of security or a loss of integrity that has had  a significant impact on the operation of networks or services to the NRAs. Annually NRAs should send  summary reports about these security incidents to ENISA and the EC.  Note that it is at the discretion of the NRA to determine what is significant. This ultimately depends  on national circumstances. For example, a security incident affecting just a small number of users in a  specific area could already be considered significant by an NRA.  1 Ward, K, 1995, ‘The Impact of Network Interconnection on Network Integrity’. British Telecommunications  Engineering, 13:296–303.  2 In information security literature the term ‘integrity’ usually refers to the property that data or communications  cannot be altered or tampered with.  Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting  Technical guidance on the incident reporting in Article 13a  Version 2.1, October 2014  Page  6  A security incident can have different types of impact on the operation of services.   Impact on the continuity of supply of services.   Impact on the security of users and interconnected networks  When there is an impact on the continuity of supply of services over the network the incident is often  called ‘outage’ or ‘disruption’. An outage or disruption can be complete (for instance ‘network  completely down’) or partial (‘50% of phone calls dropped in the last 15 minutes’, 50% of internet  bandwidth lost’ ).  It is good to note here that security incidents sometimes lead to personal data breaches. If this is the  case such a security incident would become relevant also in the context of Article 4 of the e-Privacy  directive.  Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting  Technical guidance on the incident reporting in Article 13a  Version 2.1, October 2014  Page  7  4 National incident reporting  Article 13a requires providers to report significant security incidents to the NRA. We call this national  incident reporting in this document. The implementation of national incident reporting is at the  discretion of EU member states and different member states are taking different approaches. In this  section we briefly describe three approaches, based on input from the NRAs implementing Article 13a.  We would like to stress that this section is not intended as guidance, but rather as an illustration of  the range of different national reporting schemes across the EU and to underline the difference  between national reporting and the annual summary reporting at an EU level (between NRAs, ENISA  and the EC).  Example: Country A  In country A the NRA is only required to keep track of large outages. The NRA is not interested in  smaller outages, or in other types of security incidents. The NRA sets thresholds for national  reporting relatively high.  The NRA receives incident reports days after the incident has been resolved. The reporting is  independent from crisis management and other national incident response teams.  The NRA allows providers to report incidents using email (unformatted), fax, phone or paper mail.  The NRA provides guidance on the data that should be reported, but no specific template. Incident  reports, once collected, are archived manually. The NRA keeps an eye on the number of incidents  per provider, but does not feed data into a database for improved search or statistical analysis.  The NRA does not play an active role in improving the security of networks and services. The NRA  only intervenes when there have been very large incidents, or when there is a repetition of serious  incidents involving a particular provider, service or network. The NRA works based on the  assumption that providers will address security of the networks and services without support or  incentives from the NRA. The coarse grained incident reporting allows the NRA to supervise to  some extent the security of networks and services.  Example: Country B  In country B the NRA is required to keep track of major security incidents and to intervene  whenever network and service providers fail to improve on security issues. National incident  reporting includes large security incidents and smaller security incidents.  The NRA receives reports in two steps:  A brief report is sent within hours, describing only basic information about the incident and impact.  If needed, the brief report is updated whenever there are significant developments.  A full report is sent within weeks after the incident is resolved, describing full impact, root causes,  actions taken, lessons learnt, et cetera.  The reporting is independent from crisis management and other incident response teams, but the  NRA receives notifications from crisis management and, vice versa, notifies crisis management, in  case of large incidents. The NRA requires the brief report not for crisis management purposes, but  to be able to brief other government authorities (ministries, or parliament, e.g.).  The NRA requires the provider to inform customers, emergency services, whenever relevant and  plays no role in this.  The NRA requires incident reporting via email or an electronic (online e.g.) form. Emailed reports  must be structured according to a specific template to allow for automated collection and  Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting  Technical guidance on the incident reporting in Article 13a  Version 2.1, October 2014  Page  8  structured storage of incident reports. The NRA performs subsequent analysis on the reports, not  only to understand which providers are underperforming, but also, for example, to understand  common root causes, vulnerable networks, et cetera.  The NRA supervises the security of networks and services. The NRA only intervenes when network  and service providers fail to improve on security issues– for example, because there are few  economic incentives or because these issues require national agreements.  Example: Country C  In country C the NRA is required to monitor the security of networks and services, and to work with  network and service providers to improve security. The NRA is expected to intervene when smaller  providers are underperforming and putting their customers at risk. National incident reporting  includes relatively small security incidents and incidents affecting critical infrastructure even if  there was no actual outage.  Technically incident reporting is implemented similar to country B (in two steps, structured,  electronic). The NRA performs statistical analysis on the received incidents, analysing common root  causes, frequency and impact. Anonimised statistical data about incident reports is shared with  providers in industry working groups.  The NRA implements fine-grained incident reporting, to be able to supervise providers, but also to  be able to help providers in improving security of services and networks. For instance the NRA sets  up specific working groups to address the frequent and high-impact incidents. In other words, the  NRA not only intervenes when needed, but also works pro-actively with the providers to improve  where possible security of networks and services. Fine-grained incident reporting is used to provide  feedback on the effectiveness of security measures and to get feedback about improvements, in  the market as a whole or at single providers.  Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting  Technical guidance on the incident reporting in Article 13a  Version 2.1, October 2014  Page  9  5 Ad-hoc incident reporting  In this section we describe the procedure for ad-hoc incident reporting to other NRAs and ENISA.  5.1 Goal  The goal of ad-hoc reporting is to inform NRAs abroad and ENISA about recent or on-going incidents,  which may be relevant for other NRAs abroad. The purpose of ad-hoc reporting is not incident  response or crisis management.  5.2 Reporting criteria  The NRA should assess whether or not an incident is relevant for NRAs in other countries and in this  case make an ad-hoc report. It is at the discretion of an NRA to determine if an incident is relevant for  other NRAs and ENISA3.  For example, relevant incidents might be:   Incidents affecting networks and services in other countries   Incidents affecting equipment in use in other countries as well   Incidents involving infrastructure in other countries, such as international interconnections.   Natural phenomena, such as storms or earthquakes which span across borders   Large-scale power cuts spanning across borders   Incidents requiring actions which extend across the border, such as international agreements  5.3 Incident report data  Ad-hoc reporting is at the discretion of NRAs and NRAs should determine which information about the  incident is relevant for sharing in ad-hoc reporting.  NRAs may use the incident report template fields for annual summary reporting (see Section 7).  5.4 Reporting modality  ENISA maintains a contact list of email addresses and telephone numbers of contact points at NRAs  to enable ad-hoc incident reporting across borders. The contact list is provided to NRAs upon request  (resilience@enisa.europa.eu). The contact list is updated by the inidivual NRAs when needed. The  contact list can be downloaded from:  Additionally ENISA provides an online tool to support ad-hoc incident reporting – access to the tool is  provided to NRAs upon request (resilience@enisa.europa.eu).  3 Whether or not these incidents should be included in annual reporting depends on the impact of the incident.  mailto:resilience@enisa.europa.eu mailto:resilience@enisa.europa.eu  Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting  Technical guidance on the incident reporting in Article 13a  Version 2.1, October 2014  Page  10  6 Annual summary reporting  In this section we define scope and thresholds for annual summary reporting by NRAs to ENISA and  the EC.  We stress that this section should not be understood as a recommendation about which incidents are  (nationally) significant nor about which incidents should be reported nationally. NRAs should use a  wider scope and stricter thresholds, where relevant, taking into account national circumstances and  requirements.  6.1 Goal  The goal of annual summary reporting to ENISA and the EC is:   to get feedback from NRAs about   security incidents that have had significant impact,   incident trends   root causes of security incidents   to provide policy makers, the public and the industry with aggregate (statistical) analysis of  incidents which explain the overall frequency and impact of security incidents across the EU.  ENISA published such an aggregate analysis for the first time in 2012, in the first annual report.   to facilitate the exchange of experiences and lessons learned among NRAs, to allow them to  better understand and address specific types of security incidents or vulnerabilities.   to evaluate the effectiveness of security measures in place, and to issue recommendations  and guidance for NRAs, the private sector and policy makers, about security measures.  6.2 Scope  For the initial period, the scope of annual reporting to ENISA and the EC is restricted to losses of  integrity, i.e. the security incidents with an impact on the continuity of supply of electronic  communication services.  6.3 National user base  To allow for aggregation at an EU level (one of the goals of annual summary reporting) NRAs should  provide ENISA and the EC with estimates of the total number of users of each service in their country.  NRAs may (optionally) use the following metrics as estimates:   For fixed telephony and fixed internet, NRAs may use the number of subscriber or access lines  in their country.   For mobile telephony, NRAs may use the number of active telephony SIM cards.   For mobile internet, NRAs may sum up4:  1. The number of standard mobile subscriptions, which offer both telephony and internet  access, and which have been used for internet access recently (e.g. in the past 3 months).  2. The number of subscriptions dedicated for mobile internet access, which are purchased  separately, either standalone or on top of an existing voice subscription.  4 Here we follow the definition agreed in the COCOM meetings. In some countries other metrics are used.  file:///C:/Users/dekkema/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Word/first%20annual%20report  Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting  Technical guidance on the incident reporting in Article 13a  Version 2.1, October 2014  Page  11  6.4 Thresholds for annual reporting  In this section we define the thresholds for annual summary reporting by NRAs to ENISA and the EC.  We define two separate thresholds: a relative threshold and an absolute threshold. Both thresholds  should be understood per service (see Section 3.2).  If the incident impact is larger than the relative threshold or the absolute threshold, then it should be  included in annual summary reporting. NRAs may also report incidents which had less impact.  6.4.1 Relative threshold  The relative threshold for annual summary reporting is based on the duration (see Section 7.1.3) and  the number of user connections affected – for a particular service (see Section 7.1.2) as a percentage  of the national user base of that service (see Section 6.3).  NRAs should report incidents, as part of the annual summary reporting, if the incident   lasts more than an hour, and the percentage of users affected is more than 15%,   lasts more than 2 hours, and the percentage of users affected is more than 10%,   lasts more than 4 hours, and the percentage of users affected is more than 5%,   lasts more than 6 hours, and the percentage of users affected is more than 2%, or if it   lasts more than 8 hours, and the percentage of users affected is more than 1%.  1h-2h 2h-4h 4h-6h 6h-8h >8h  1% -  2%  2% -  5%  5% - 10%  10% - 15%  > 15%  Figure 2. Absolute threshold based on the duration and the percentage of the national user base.  6.4.2 Absolute threshold  The absolute threshold for annual summary reporting is based on the product of the duration (see  Section 7.1.3) and the number of user connections affected – for a particular service (see Section  7.1.2).  NRAs should include incidents in the annual summary reporting if the product of the duration of the  incident  and the number of users affected exceeds: 60 Million user minutes, or 1 Million user hours.  Excluded are very small incidents, which affect less than 25.000 user connections, as well as very short  incidents, which last less than 1 hour.  For example, when half a million users are affected for 2 hours, then the incident should be included  in annual summary reporting.  Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting  Technical guidance on the incident reporting in Article 13a  Version 2.1, October 2014  Page  12  7 Incident report template  In this section we describe incident report fields which should be used by NRAs when submitting  incident reports to ENISA and the EC, as part of annual summary reporting.  7.1 Incident impact  7.1.1 Service affected  In the field “service affected” NRAs should provide information about which electronic communication  services where affected, for example, by indicating a selection of one or more from   fixed telephony,   mobile telephony,   fixed internet access,   mobile internet access.  Or alternatively, NRAs may indicate that another type of service was affected.  Optionally NRAs may provide further information about the ‘technology’ or ‘platform’ that was  affected.  For instance, if a storm takes down a set of mobile base stations, causing network outage, the  service affected in this incident would be mobile telephony and mobile internet, and specifically  GSM, GPRS/EDGE, UMTS, to explain the type of technology or platform affected.  7.1.2 Number of users  In the field “number of users” NRAs should indicate the total number of users affected.   For fixed telephony and fixed internet, NRAs should report the number of subscriber or access  lines impacted.   For mobile telephony and mobile internet, NRAs should report an estimate, taking into  account the normal usage of the affected facilities.  For example, if a base station, which serves 1000 users per hour on average, is offline for an hour,  then the impact of such an incident should be estimated to 1000 users.  Note that in many incidents multiple services are affected at the same time, and that the number of  users affected could be different per service. In these cases NRAs should provide separate numbers  per service.  Note also that providers do not always have an exact notion of the number of users affected, because  they deliver services to other providers (often called resellers, or intermediate users). The provider, in  that case, does not always know the exact number of users (or ‘clients’ as referred to in the Directive)  of the latter and consequently may not know the exact number of users affected by an incident. In  these cases NRAs should report estimates.  7.1.3 Duration  In the field “duration” NRAs should indicate the length of time (in hours) there was significant impact  on the operation of the services.  For example, suppose that a storm causes a power outage from midnight to 6 o clock in the  morning, and suppose that the mobile telephony service is affected from 4 o’clock at night (when  backup power runs out) until 7 o’clock in the morning. In this case the duration of the incident is 3  hours.  Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting  Technical guidance on the incident reporting in Article 13a  Version 2.1, October 2014  Page  13  7.1.4 Impact on emergency calls  In the field “impact on emergency calls” NRAs should indicate if there was an impact on the possibility  to call the emergency services, such as ambulances or fire brigades via emergency telephone numbers  (112 in many countries).  For example, suppose that the datacentre of a telecom operator has a blackout, which prevents  large areas of the country to connect to 112. In this case the incident had an impact on emergency  calls.  7.1.5 Impact on interconnections  In the field “Impact on interconnections” NRAs should indicate if there was impact on the national or  international interconnections between providers.  For example, suppose a large internet exchange point is affected by a power cut, causing large- scale internet connection issues. In this case the incident had on impact on interconnections.  7.2 Incident cause  7.2.1 Root cause category  The root cause of an incident is the initial cause of an incident, in other words, the event or factor  that triggered the incident. In the field “root cause category” NRAs should indicate the category of  the root cause of the incident. There are 5 root cause categories5:  7.2.1.1 Human errors  The category “human errors” should be used for incidents caused by human errors during the  operation of equipment or facilities, the use of tools, the execution of procedures, et cetera.  For example, suppose an employee of a provider made an error in following prescribed equipment  maintenance procedures, which causes an outage. In this case the incident would be in the root  cause category ‘Human errors’.  7.2.1.2 System failures  The category “system failures” should be used for incidents caused by failures of a system, for example  hardware failures, software failures or flaws in manuals, procedures or policies.  For example, suppose the provider operates a full maintenance program for its equipment, that  diesel generators are not included on this program, and that a generator fails because of lack of  maintenance. In this case the root cause of the incident would be in the root cause category  ‘System failures’.  7.2.1.3 Natural phenomena  The category “natural phenomena” should be used for incidents caused by severe weather,  earthquakes, floods, pandemic diseases, wildfires, wildlife, and so on.  For example, suppose squirrels caused a cable cut, causing an outage, then the incident would be  in the root cause category ‘natural phenomena’.  5 The root cause categories were derived from secondary legislation issued by FICORA and CESG, the UK National  Technical Authority for Information Assurance.  Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting  Technical guidance on the incident reporting in Article 13a  Version 2.1, October 2014  Page  14  7.2.1.4 Malicious actions  The category “malicious actions” should be used for incidents caused by a deliberate act by someone  or some organisation.  For example, incidents which have a root cause like a fire started by employees as an act of  sabotage, the poisoning of the provider’s DNS systems by criminals, the hacking of the provider’s  computer systems, vandalism directed at street cabinets, and so on.  7.2.1.5 Third party failures  The category “third party failure” should be used for incidents where the root cause is outside the  direct control of the provider, for example, when the root cause occurred at a contractor used for  outsourcing, or at an organization somewhere along the supply chain.  This category should be used in conjunction with one of the other root cause categories.  For example, an outage caused by a cable cut caused by a mistake by the operator of an excavation  machine used for a building a new road, would be categorized in the root cause category ‘human  error’ and ‘third-party failure’.  7.2.2 Initial cause  In the field “initial cause” NRAs may indicate the initial cause of the incident, i.e. the event or factor  that triggered the incident.  For example, initial causes could be software failure, bad change, back-up fuel exhaustion,  overload, power cuts, cyber-attack, and so on.  Note that these detailed causes may fit different root cause categories, depending on the specifics of  the setting. For example, a cable cut may be caused by a human error or by a flaw in a procedure.  7.2.3 Subsequent cause  Often incidents involve a chain of events or factors. In the field “subsequent cause” NRAs may  indicate a cause that subsequently played a role in the incident.  For example, if a storm causes a powercut, which causes an outage, then in this case the initial  cause would be ‘storm’ and the subsequent cause would be ‘powercut’.  7.2.4 Assets affected  NRAs may indicate the assets which were first affected in the incident.  For example, assets affected could be mobile base stations, street cabinets, location register,  switches, international backbone, area network, and so on.  7.3 Incident description and follow-up  7.3.1 Incident description  In the field “incident description” the NRA should provide a description of the incident.  7.3.2 Incident response actions  In the field “incident response actions” the NRA may describe actions taken by the provider to mitigate  the impact of the incident.  Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting  Technical guidance on the incident reporting in Article 13a  Version 2.1, October 2014  Page  15  7.3.3 Post-incident actions taken  In the field “post-incident actions” the NRA may describe the actions taken by the provider to reduce  the likelihood or impact of similar incidents.  7.3.4 Lessons learned  In the field “description of lessons learnt” the NRA may describe the lessons learned from the incidents  or measures which will be implemented on the long-term, by the NRA or providers.

The reform, was transposed by most EU Member States halfway 2011.  Article 13a concerns security and integrity of electronic communication networks and services. The  first part of Article 13a requires that providers of networks and services manage security risks and take  appropriate security measures to guarantee the security (paragraph 1) and integrity (paragraph 2) of  these networks and services. The second part of Article 13a (paragraph 3) requires providers to report  about significant security breaches and losses of integrity to competent national authorities, who  should report about these security incidents to ENISA and the European Commission (EC) annually.  In 2010, ENISA, the European Commission (EC), Ministries and Telecommunication National  Regulatory Authorities (NRAs), initiated a series of meetings (workshops, conference calls) to achieve  an efficient and harmonised implementation of Article 13a across the EU. The Article 13a working  group now comprises experts from NRAs of most EU countries, and several EFTA and EU candidate  countries. Meetings (telephonic or physical) are organized and chaired by technical experts from  ENISA. The European Commission participates as an observer in these meetings.  The Article 13a Working Group reached consensus on two non-binding technical guidelines for NRAs:  the “Technical Guideline on Minimum Security Measures” and the “Technical Guideline on Incident  Reporting” (this document).  This document, the Technical Guideline for Incident Reporting, provides guidance to NRAs about the  technical implementation of paragraph 3 of Article 13a: Incident reporting. Paragraph 3 of Article 13a  describes three types of incident reporting: 1) National incident reporting from providers to NRAs, 2)  Ad-hoc incident reporting between NRAs and ENISA, and 3) Annual summary reporting from NRAs to  the EC and ENISA. The focus of this guideline is on the 2nd and 3rd type of reporting: ad-hoc reporting  and annual summary reporting. For example, it provides a reporting structure and thresholds.  In spring 2012 NRAs, from all EU countries and some EFTA and EU candidate countries, implemented  the first annual summary reporting about the 2011 incidents. Subsequently, at the start of each year  NRAs send annual summary reports to ENISA and the EC. Yearly ENISA publishes an aggregate analysis  of the reported incidents in a public report.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports  Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting  Technical guidance on the incident reporting in Article 13a  Version 2.1, October 2014  Page  iv  Table of Contents  Preface iii  1 Introduction 1  2 EU policy context and ENISA’s role and objectives 2  3 Article 13a, scope and terminology 4  4 National incident reporting 7  5 Ad-hoc incident reporting 9  6 Annual summary reporting 10  7 Incident report template 12  8 References 16  Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting  Technical guidance on the incident reporting in Article 13a  Version 2.1, October 2014  Page  1  1 Introduction  In this document, we provide guidance to National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) about paragraph 3  of Article 13a of the Framework directive (Directive 2002/21/EC as amended by Directive  2009/140/EC). It focusses on how to report incidents with ENISA and the EC and between NRAs.  This document is drafted by a working group comprising experts from NRAs and representatives of  the EC, supported by technical experts from ENISA (see Preface): the Article 13a Expert Group.  1.1 Target audience  This document is addressed to national ministries and NRAs in European Member States, the  authorities tasked with the implementation of Article 13a.  This document may be useful also for experts working in the EU’s electronic communications sector  and for experts working in the information security field.  1.2 Goal  This document is published by ENISA to provide guidance to NRA’s about the technical implementation  of the incident reporting described in paragraph 3 of Article 13a.  1.3 Updates  ENISA updates this guideline periodically, when necessary and in agreement with the NRAs.  Version 2.0 is an update of Version 1.0 of the Guideline on Incident Reporting. Besides many smaller  changes, simplifications and (most importantly) clarifications, the main changes are:   Simplified thresholds for annual incident reporting.   Examples of approaches for national incident reporting.   More detail about incident impact and incident causes.  Version 2.1 adds an absolute threshold to the annual summary reporting of 1 million user-hours.  1.4 Structure of this document  In Section 2 we introduce Article 13a. In Section 3 we explain the scope and definitions used in this  document. In Section 4 we show different approaches to national incident reporting. In Section 5 we  describe ad-hoc reporting and in Section 6 we describe how NRAs should implement annual summary  reporting to ENISA and the EC. In Section 7 we describe a incident report template fields, which should  be used by NRAs for ad-hoc reporting and annual summary reporting.  Throughout this text we use as in IETF RFC2119 the terms ‘should’ (or ‘recommended’) for  recommended items, and ‘may’ (or ‘optional’) for optional items. For the sake of explanation we  provide some (non-binding) examples using a blue italic font.  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13 http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt  Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting  Technical guidance on the incident reporting in Article 13a  Version 2.1, October 2014  Page  2  2 EU policy context and ENISA’s role and objectives  In this section we discuss ENISA’s role and objectives and we summarize the EU policy context.  2.1 EU policy context  This guideline concerns Article 13a of the Framework directive (Directive 2002/21/EC as amended by  Directive 2009/140/EC). Besides Article 13a there are a number of other initiatives (legal or otherwise)  addressing the security of public electronic communications networks and services:   In 2006, the EC issued a strategy for a secure information society – dialogue, partnership and  empowerment (COM (2006) 251), which was endorsed the next year by the European Council  (Council Resolution 2007/068/01). One of the main actions of the strategy is a multi- stakeholder dialogue on the security and resilience of networks and information systems: the  European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection (EPCIP).   In 2009, the EC adopted, in March 2009, a communications and action plan on Critical  Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP), called Protecting Europe from Large Scale Cyber- Attacks and Disruptions: Enhancing Preparedness, Security and Resilience (COM (2009) 149).  This communication focuses on “prevention, preparedness, and awareness” and defines an  immediate action plan to strengthen the security and resilience of CIIs.   The Council Conclusion on CIIP issued on May 2011, taking stock of the results achieved since  the adoption of the CIIP action plan in 2009, was launched to strengthen the security and  resilience of vital Information and Communication Technology Infrastructures.  For an overview of several security articles, which address security measures and incident reporting,  we refer to the ENISA paper Cyber incident reporting in the EU which summarizes and compares  Article 13a of the Framework directive, Article 4 of the e-Privacy directive, Article 15 of the proposed  e-Trust/e-ID regulation and the reporting requirements in the proposed data protection reform.  In 2013 the European Commission issued a European Cyber Security Strategy. The strategy and  contains explicit references to Article 13a and the accompanying directive on Network and  Information Security extends the provisions of Article 13a to other critical sectors (see also  References).  2.2 ENISA’s role and objectives  We briefly describe ENISA’s role and objectives in the implementation of the Framework directive  (2002/21/EC as amended by 2009/140/EC) and Article 13a in particular.  ENISA is mentioned in the preambles of the Framework directive:   In preamble 44 of the Framework directive ENISA is asked to contribute to enhancing the level  of security of electronic communications by, among other things, \"providing expertise and  advice, and promoting the exchange of best practice”.   In preamble 44 of the Framework directive also mentions that ENISA should have the means  to carry out the relevant duties and the powers to obtain sufficient information to assess the  level of security of networks and services.   In preamble 46 of the Framework directive ENISA is asked to contribute to the harmonisation  of security measures by providing expert advice.  ENISA is also mentioned in Article 13a of the Framework directive:   Paragraph 3 of Article 13a requires NRAs to, when appropriate, inform NRAs in other Member  States and ENISA.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2006/com2006_0251en01.pdf http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0149:FIN:EN:HTML http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/fight_against_terrorism/l33260_en.htm http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0149:FIN:EN:PDF http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/11/st10/st10299.en11.pdf http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/cyber-incident-reporting-in-the-eu http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security  Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting  Technical guidance on the incident reporting in Article 13a  Version 2.1, October 2014  Page  3   Paragraph 3 of Article 13a requires NRAs to submit annual summary reports of the incidents  to both the European commission and ENISA.   Article 13a mentions that the European commission may decide to adopt technical  implementing measures with a view to harmonisation of the implementation of paragraphs  1, 2, and 3 of Article 13a. Article 13a mentions that in this case the European commission will  take into account the opinion of ENISA.  ENISA’s primary objective is to implement the incident reporting mandated in Article 13a, i.e. to agree  with the Member States on an efficient implementation of ad-hoc incident reporting and annual  summary reporting.  Secondly, ENISA aims to use annual summary reporting for the following purposes.   To give feedback to NRAs about   security incidents that have had significant impact,   root causes of security incidents,   lessons learned from security incidents, and   incident trends.   To provide aggregate (statistical) analysis of incidents for policy makers, the public and the  industry, describing overall frequency and impact of security incidents across the EU. ENISA  published such an aggregate analysis for the first time in 2012, in the first annual report.   To facilitate the exchange of experiences and lessons learned among NRAs, to allow them to  better understand and address security incidents.   Issue recommendations and guidance for NRAs, the private sector and policy makers.   Evaluate the effectiveness of security measures in place.   Develop more realistic incident scenarios for pan-European exercises.  Thirdly, ENISA aims to support NRAs with the implementation of national incident reporting schemes  and in this way support efficient and harmonized incident reporting schemes across the EU.  Harmonized implementation of legislation creates a level playing field and makes it easier for  providers and users to operate across different EU countries.  file:///C:/Users/dekkema/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Word/first%20annual%20report  Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting  Technical guidance on the incident reporting in Article 13a  Version 2.1, October 2014  Page  4  3 Article 13a, scope and terminology  In this section we introduce paragraph 3 of Article 13a and the scope of this guideline.  3.1 Paragraph 3 of Article 13a  For the sake of reference, we reproduce the text of paragraph 3 of Article 13a here.  “3. Member States shall ensure that undertakings providing public communications networks or  publicly available electronic communications services notify the competent national regulatory  authority of a breach of security or loss of integrity that has had a significant impact on the operation  of networks or services.  Where appropriate, the national regulatory authority concerned shall inform the national regulatory  authorities in other Member States and the European Network and Information Security Agency  (ENISA). The national regulatory authority concerned may inform the public or require the  undertakings to do so, where it determines that disclosure of the breach is in the public interest.  Once a year, the national regulatory authority concerned shall submit a summary report to the  Commission and ENISA on the notifications received and the action taken in accordance with this  paragraph.”  Hence Article 13a introduces three types of incident reporting: 1) National incident reporting from  providers to NRAs, 2) Ad-hoc incident reporting between NRAs and ENISA, and 3) Annual summary  reporting from NRAs to the EC and ENISA. The different types of reporting are shown in Figure 1. This  guideline focusses on the latter two.  Member stateMember state  National incident reporting  Ad-hoc reporting  Annual summary reporting  National  authority  Network or  service  provider  Network or  service  provider  Network or  service  provider  Member stateMember state  National  authority  Network or  service  provider  Network or  service  provider  Network or  service  provider  ENISA  EC  Figure 1. Three types of incident reporting in Article 13a  Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting  Technical guidance on the incident reporting in Article 13a  Version 2.1, October 2014  Page  5  3.2 Electronic communication services  This guideline focuses on the following communication services and networks.   Fixed telephony   Mobile telephony   Fixed internet access   Mobile internet access  We stress that this is neither an exhaustive list of electronic communication services defined in the  Directive nor an exhaustive list of services that are being regulated by NRAs.  Other services are not discussed explicitly in this guideline, but many of the concepts in this guideline  should apply to other types of electronic communication services as well.  3.3 Security incidents  Article 13a mentions ‘security incidents’, ‘security breaches’ and ‘integrity losses’:   Paragraph 1 requires “that measures shall be taken to prevent and minimise the impact of  security incidents on users and interconnected networks”   Paragraph 2 requires providers to “take all appropriate steps to guarantee integrity of their  networks, and thus ensure the continuity of supply of services”.   Paragraph 3 requires “to notify the competent national regulatory authority of a breach of  security or loss of integrity that has had a significant impact on the operation of networks or  services”  The use of the term integrity in the article text may be confusing to some readers. We refer to the  definition in technical literature on networks and network interconnections1, which defines integrity  “as the ability of the system to retain its specified attributes in terms of performance and functionality”.  Integrity of networks would be called availability or continuity in most information security literature2.  In this guideline we call these types of incidents simply ‘security incidents’ and we use the following  definition in this document.  Security incident: A breach of security or a loss of integrity that could have an impact on the operation  of electronic telecommunications networks and services.  3.4 Significant impact  Article 13a requires that providers report about a breach of security or a loss of integrity that has had  a significant impact on the operation of networks or services to the NRAs. Annually NRAs should send  summary reports about these security incidents to ENISA and the EC.  Note that it is at the discretion of the NRA to determine what is significant. This ultimately depends  on national circumstances. For example, a security incident affecting just a small number of users in a  specific area could already be considered significant by an NRA.  1 Ward, K, 1995, ‘The Impact of Network Interconnection on Network Integrity’. British Telecommunications  Engineering, 13:296–303.  2 In information security literature the term ‘integrity’ usually refers to the property that data or communications  cannot be altered or tampered with.  Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting  Technical guidance on the incident reporting in Article 13a  Version 2.1, October 2014  Page  6  A security incident can have different types of impact on the operation of services.   Impact on the continuity of supply of services.   Impact on the security of users and interconnected networks  When there is an impact on the continuity of supply of services over the network the incident is often  called ‘outage’ or ‘disruption’. An outage or disruption can be complete (for instance ‘network  completely down’) or partial (‘50% of phone calls dropped in the last 15 minutes’, 50% of internet  bandwidth lost’ ).  It is good to note here that security incidents sometimes lead to personal data breaches. If this is the  case such a security incident would become relevant also in the context of Article 4 of the e-Privacy  directive.  Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting  Technical guidance on the incident reporting in Article 13a  Version 2.1, October 2014  Page  7  4 National incident reporting  Article 13a requires providers to report significant security incidents to the NRA. We call this national  incident reporting in this document. The implementation of national incident reporting is at the  discretion of EU member states and different member states are taking different approaches. In this  section we briefly describe three approaches, based on input from the NRAs implementing Article 13a.  We would like to stress that this section is not intended as guidance, but rather as an illustration of  the range of different national reporting schemes across the EU and to underline the difference  between national reporting and the annual summary reporting at an EU level (between NRAs, ENISA  and the EC).  Example: Country A  In country A the NRA is only required to keep track of large outages. The NRA is not interested in  smaller outages, or in other types of security incidents. The NRA sets thresholds for national  reporting relatively high.  The NRA receives incident reports days after the incident has been resolved. The reporting is  independent from crisis management and other national incident response teams.  The NRA allows providers to report incidents using email (unformatted), fax, phone or paper mail.  The NRA provides guidance on the data that should be reported, but no specific template. Incident  reports, once collected, are archived manually. The NRA keeps an eye on the number of incidents  per provider, but does not feed data into a database for improved search or statistical analysis.  The NRA does not play an active role in improving the security of networks and services. The NRA  only intervenes when there have been very large incidents, or when there is a repetition of serious  incidents involving a particular provider, service or network. The NRA works based on the  assumption that providers will address security of the networks and services without support or  incentives from the NRA. The coarse grained incident reporting allows the NRA to supervise to  some extent the security of networks and services.  Example: Country B  In country B the NRA is required to keep track of major security incidents and to intervene  whenever network and service providers fail to improve on security issues. National incident  reporting includes large security incidents and smaller security incidents.  The NRA receives reports in two steps:  A brief report is sent within hours, describing only basic information about the incident and impact.  If needed, the brief report is updated whenever there are significant developments.  A full report is sent within weeks after the incident is resolved, describing full impact, root causes,  actions taken, lessons learnt, et cetera.  The reporting is independent from crisis management and other incident response teams, but the  NRA receives notifications from crisis management and, vice versa, notifies crisis management, in  case of large incidents. The NRA requires the brief report not for crisis management purposes, but  to be able to brief other government authorities (ministries, or parliament, e.g.).  The NRA requires the provider to inform customers, emergency services, whenever relevant and  plays no role in this.  The NRA requires incident reporting via email or an electronic (online e.g.) form. Emailed reports  must be structured according to a specific template to allow for automated collection and  Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting  Technical guidance on the incident reporting in Article 13a  Version 2.1, October 2014  Page  8  structured storage of incident reports. The NRA performs subsequent analysis on the reports, not  only to understand which providers are underperforming, but also, for example, to understand  common root causes, vulnerable networks, et cetera.  The NRA supervises the security of networks and services. The NRA only intervenes when network  and service providers fail to improve on security issues– for example, because there are few  economic incentives or because these issues require national agreements.  Example: Country C  In country C the NRA is required to monitor the security of networks and services, and to work with  network and service providers to improve security. The NRA is expected to intervene when smaller  providers are underperforming and putting their customers at risk. National incident reporting  includes relatively small security incidents and incidents affecting critical infrastructure even if  there was no actual outage.  Technically incident reporting is implemented similar to country B (in two steps, structured,  electronic). The NRA performs statistical analysis on the received incidents, analysing common root  causes, frequency and impact. Anonimised statistical data about incident reports is shared with  providers in industry working groups.  The NRA implements fine-grained incident reporting, to be able to supervise providers, but also to  be able to help providers in improving security of services and networks. For instance the NRA sets  up specific working groups to address the frequent and high-impact incidents. In other words, the  NRA not only intervenes when needed, but also works pro-actively with the providers to improve  where possible security of networks and services. Fine-grained incident reporting is used to provide  feedback on the effectiveness of security measures and to get feedback about improvements, in  the market as a whole or at single providers.  Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting  Technical guidance on the incident reporting in Article 13a  Version 2.1, October 2014  Page  9  5 Ad-hoc incident reporting  In this section we describe the procedure for ad-hoc incident reporting to other NRAs and ENISA.  5.1 Goal  The goal of ad-hoc reporting is to inform NRAs abroad and ENISA about recent or on-going incidents,  which may be relevant for other NRAs abroad. The purpose of ad-hoc reporting is not incident  response or crisis management.  5.2 Reporting criteria  The NRA should assess whether or not an incident is relevant for NRAs in other countries and in this  case make an ad-hoc report. It is at the discretion of an NRA to determine if an incident is relevant for  other NRAs and ENISA3.  For example, relevant incidents might be:   Incidents affecting networks and services in other countries   Incidents affecting equipment in use in other countries as well   Incidents involving infrastructure in other countries, such as international interconnections.   Natural phenomena, such as storms or earthquakes which span across borders   Large-scale power cuts spanning across borders   Incidents requiring actions which extend across the border, such as international agreements  5.3 Incident report data  Ad-hoc reporting is at the discretion of NRAs and NRAs should determine which information about the  incident is relevant for sharing in ad-hoc reporting.  NRAs may use the incident report template fields for annual summary reporting (see Section 7).  5.4 Reporting modality  ENISA maintains a contact list of email addresses and telephone numbers of contact points at NRAs  to enable ad-hoc incident reporting across borders. The contact list is provided to NRAs upon request  (resilience@enisa.europa.eu). The contact list is updated by the inidivual NRAs when needed. The  contact list can be downloaded from:  Additionally ENISA provides an online tool to support ad-hoc incident reporting – access to the tool is  provided to NRAs upon request (resilience@enisa.europa.eu).  3 Whether or not these incidents should be included in annual reporting depends on the impact of the incident.  mailto:resilience@enisa.europa.eu mailto:resilience@enisa.europa.eu  Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting  Technical guidance on the incident reporting in Article 13a  Version 2.1, October 2014  Page  10  6 Annual summary reporting  In this section we define scope and thresholds for annual summary reporting by NRAs to ENISA and  the EC.  We stress that this section should not be understood as a recommendation about which incidents are  (nationally) significant nor about which incidents should be reported nationally. NRAs should use a  wider scope and stricter thresholds, where relevant, taking into account national circumstances and  requirements.  6.1 Goal  The goal of annual summary reporting to ENISA and the EC is:   to get feedback from NRAs about   security incidents that have had significant impact,   incident trends   root causes of security incidents   to provide policy makers, the public and the industry with aggregate (statistical) analysis of  incidents which explain the overall frequency and impact of security incidents across the EU.  ENISA published such an aggregate analysis for the first time in 2012, in the first annual report.   to facilitate the exchange of experiences and lessons learned among NRAs, to allow them to  better understand and address specific types of security incidents or vulnerabilities.   to evaluate the effectiveness of security measures in place, and to issue recommendations  and guidance for NRAs, the private sector and policy makers, about security measures.  6.2 Scope  For the initial period, the scope of annual reporting to ENISA and the EC is restricted to losses of  integrity, i.e. the security incidents with an impact on the continuity of supply of electronic  communication services.  6.3 National user base  To allow for aggregation at an EU level (one of the goals of annual summary reporting) NRAs should  provide ENISA and the EC with estimates of the total number of users of each service in their country.  NRAs may (optionally) use the following metrics as estimates:   For fixed telephony and fixed internet, NRAs may use the number of subscriber or access lines  in their country.   For mobile telephony, NRAs may use the number of active telephony SIM cards.   For mobile internet, NRAs may sum up4:  1. The number of standard mobile subscriptions, which offer both telephony and internet  access, and which have been used for internet access recently (e.g. in the past 3 months).  2. The number of subscriptions dedicated for mobile internet access, which are purchased  separately, either standalone or on top of an existing voice subscription.  4 Here we follow the definition agreed in the COCOM meetings. In some countries other metrics are used.  file:///C:/Users/dekkema/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Word/first%20annual%20report  Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting  Technical guidance on the incident reporting in Article 13a  Version 2.1, October 2014  Page  11  6.4 Thresholds for annual reporting  In this section we define the thresholds for annual summary reporting by NRAs to ENISA and the EC.  We define two separate thresholds: a relative threshold and an absolute threshold. Both thresholds  should be understood per service (see Section 3.2).  If the incident impact is larger than the relative threshold or the absolute threshold, then it should be  included in annual summary reporting. NRAs may also report incidents which had less impact.  6.4.1 Relative threshold  The relative threshold for annual summary reporting is based on the duration (see Section 7.1.3) and  the number of user connections affected – for a particular service (see Section 7.1.2) as a percentage  of the national user base of that service (see Section 6.3).  NRAs should report incidents, as part of the annual summary reporting, if the incident   lasts more than an hour, and the percentage of users affected is more than 15%,   lasts more than 2 hours, and the percentage of users affected is more than 10%,   lasts more than 4 hours, and the percentage of users affected is more than 5%,   lasts more than 6 hours, and the percentage of users affected is more than 2%, or if it   lasts more than 8 hours, and the percentage of users affected is more than 1%.  1h-2h 2h-4h 4h-6h 6h-8h >8h  1% -  2%  2% -  5%  5% - 10%  10% - 15%  > 15%  Figure 2. Absolute threshold based on the duration and the percentage of the national user base.  6.4.2 Absolute threshold  The absolute threshold for annual summary reporting is based on the product of the duration (see  Section 7.1.3) and the number of user connections affected – for a particular service (see Section  7.1.2).  NRAs should include incidents in the annual summary reporting if the product of the duration of the  incident  and the number of users affected exceeds: 60 Million user minutes, or 1 Million user hours.  Excluded are very small incidents, which affect less than 25.000 user connections, as well as very short  incidents, which last less than 1 hour.  For example, when half a million users are affected for 2 hours, then the incident should be included  in annual summary reporting.  Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting  Technical guidance on the incident reporting in Article 13a  Version 2.1, October 2014  Page  12  7 Incident report template  In this section we describe incident report fields which should be used by NRAs when submitting  incident reports to ENISA and the EC, as part of annual summary reporting.  7.1 Incident impact  7.1.1 Service affected  In the field “service affected” NRAs should provide information about which electronic communication  services where affected, for example, by indicating a selection of one or more from   fixed telephony,   mobile telephony,   fixed internet access,   mobile internet access.  Or alternatively, NRAs may indicate that another type of service was affected.  Optionally NRAs may provide further information about the ‘technology’ or ‘platform’ that was  affected.  For instance, if a storm takes down a set of mobile base stations, causing network outage, the  service affected in this incident would be mobile telephony and mobile internet, and specifically  GSM, GPRS/EDGE, UMTS, to explain the type of technology or platform affected.  7.1.2 Number of users  In the field “number of users” NRAs should indicate the total number of users affected.   For fixed telephony and fixed internet, NRAs should report the number of subscriber or access  lines impacted.   For mobile telephony and mobile internet, NRAs should report an estimate, taking into  account the normal usage of the affected facilities.  For example, if a base station, which serves 1000 users per hour on average, is offline for an hour,  then the impact of such an incident should be estimated to 1000 users.  Note that in many incidents multiple services are affected at the same time, and that the number of  users affected could be different per service. In these cases NRAs should provide separate numbers  per service.  Note also that providers do not always have an exact notion of the number of users affected, because  they deliver services to other providers (often called resellers, or intermediate users). The provider, in  that case, does not always know the exact number of users (or ‘clients’ as referred to in the Directive)  of the latter and consequently may not know the exact number of users affected by an incident. In  these cases NRAs should report estimates.  7.1.3 Duration  In the field “duration” NRAs should indicate the length of time (in hours) there was significant impact  on the operation of the services.  For example, suppose that a storm causes a power outage from midnight to 6 o clock in the  morning, and suppose that the mobile telephony service is affected from 4 o’clock at night (when  backup power runs out) until 7 o’clock in the morning. In this case the duration of the incident is 3  hours.  Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting  Technical guidance on the incident reporting in Article 13a  Version 2.1, October 2014  Page  13  7.1.4 Impact on emergency calls  In the field “impact on emergency calls” NRAs should indicate if there was an impact on the possibility  to call the emergency services, such as ambulances or fire brigades via emergency telephone numbers  (112 in many countries).  For example, suppose that the datacentre of a telecom operator has a blackout, which prevents  large areas of the country to connect to 112. In this case the incident had an impact on emergency  calls.  7.1.5 Impact on interconnections  In the field “Impact on interconnections” NRAs should indicate if there was impact on the national or  international interconnections between providers.  For example, suppose a large internet exchange point is affected by a power cut, causing large- scale internet connection issues. In this case the incident had on impact on interconnections.  7.2 Incident cause  7.2.1 Root cause category  The root cause of an incident is the initial cause of an incident, in other words, the event or factor  that triggered the incident. In the field “root cause category” NRAs should indicate the category of  the root cause of the incident. There are 5 root cause categories5:  7.2.1.1 Human errors  The category “human errors” should be used for incidents caused by human errors during the  operation of equipment or facilities, the use of tools, the execution of procedures, et cetera.  For example, suppose an employee of a provider made an error in following prescribed equipment  maintenance procedures, which causes an outage. In this case the incident would be in the root  cause category ‘Human errors’.  7.2.1.2 System failures  The category “system failures” should be used for incidents caused by failures of a system, for example  hardware failures, software failures or flaws in manuals, procedures or policies.  For example, suppose the provider operates a full maintenance program for its equipment, that  diesel generators are not included on this program, and that a generator fails because of lack of  maintenance. In this case the root cause of the incident would be in the root cause category  ‘System failures’.  7.2.1.3 Natural phenomena  The category “natural phenomena” should be used for incidents caused by severe weather,  earthquakes, floods, pandemic diseases, wildfires, wildlife, and so on.  For example, suppose squirrels caused a cable cut, causing an outage, then the incident would be  in the root cause category ‘natural phenomena’.  5 The root cause categories were derived from secondary legislation issued by FICORA and CESG, the UK National  Technical Authority for Information Assurance.  Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting  Technical guidance on the incident reporting in Article 13a  Version 2.1, October 2014  Page  14  7.2.1.4 Malicious actions  The category “malicious actions” should be used for incidents caused by a deliberate act by someone  or some organisation.  For example, incidents which have a root cause like a fire started by employees as an act of  sabotage, the poisoning of the provider’s DNS systems by criminals, the hacking of the provider’s  computer systems, vandalism directed at street cabinets, and so on.  7.2.1.5 Third party failures  The category “third party failure” should be used for incidents where the root cause is outside the  direct control of the provider, for example, when the root cause occurred at a contractor used for  outsourcing, or at an organization somewhere along the supply chain.  This category should be used in conjunction with one of the other root cause categories.  For example, an outage caused by a cable cut caused by a mistake by the operator of an excavation  machine used for a building a new road, would be categorized in the root cause category ‘human  error’ and ‘third-party failure’.  7.2.2 Initial cause  In the field “initial cause” NRAs may indicate the initial cause of the incident, i.e. the event or factor  that triggered the incident.  For example, initial causes could be software failure, bad change, back-up fuel exhaustion,  overload, power cuts, cyber-attack, and so on.  Note that these detailed causes may fit different root cause categories, depending on the specifics of  the setting. For example, a cable cut may be caused by a human error or by a flaw in a procedure.  7.2.3 Subsequent cause  Often incidents involve a chain of events or factors. In the field “subsequent cause” NRAs may  indicate a cause that subsequently played a role in the incident.  For example, if a storm causes a powercut, which causes an outage, then in this case the initial  cause would be ‘storm’ and the subsequent cause would be ‘powercut’.  7.2.4 Assets affected  NRAs may indicate the assets which were first affected in the incident.  For example, assets affected could be mobile base stations, street cabinets, location register,  switches, international backbone, area network, and so on.  7.3 Incident description and follow-up  7.3.1 Incident description  In the field “incident description” the NRA should provide a description of the incident.  7.3.2 Incident response actions  In the field “incident response actions” the NRA may describe actions taken by the provider to mitigate  the impact of the incident.  Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting  Technical guidance on the incident reporting in Article 13a  Version 2.1, October 2014  Page  15  7.3.3 Post-incident actions taken  In the field “post-incident actions” the NRA may describe the actions taken by the provider to reduce  the likelihood or impact of similar incidents.  7.3.4 Lessons learned  In the field “description of lessons learnt” the NRA may describe the lessons learned from the incidents  or measures which will be implemented on the long-term, by the NRA or providers.

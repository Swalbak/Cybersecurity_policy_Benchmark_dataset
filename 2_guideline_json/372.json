The need for a strong and effective EU Network and Information Security (NIS)  Industry becomes two-fold; on the one hand the DSM needs NIS protection for commercial  services, critical infrastructure and the everyday life of its citizens, who depend on online  services. On the other hand, the DSM offers opportunities and tools that can facilitate the  growth of the EU NIS Industry. Growth of the NIS industry can occur with direct benefits in terms  of revenue for NIS suppliers, growth of the EU GDP and boost of employment in the  cybersecurity sector; the latter is of particular importance considering that cybersecurity is one  of the faster growing segments of the ICT industry. To achieve this, innovation in cybersecurity  is a key enabler. ENISA supports the efforts aimed to enhance the overall level of cybersecurity  in the Member States (MS) both at a national and EU level. This report supports that effort by  analysing how Member States are approaching innovation as a strategic priority under National  Cyber Security Strategies (NCSS).  The analysis is structured around several aspects of innovation such as: Innovation Priorities,  Industrialisation and Collaboration and Market and Policy. Each of these aspects is at the same  time divided into two dimensions. Innovation priorities can be divided into Innovation in  technologies and services, and into economic incentives and investments. Industrialisation and  collaboration can be divided into industrialisation processes and activities, and stakeholders’  collaboration. Market and Policy can be divided into Market and Technology Alignment and  Market regulation. Each dimension can be supported by several activities and mechanisms.  Moreover, this study identifies a set of challenges and good practices, as experts perceive  them, across the different innovation dimensions. The identification of these challenges may  help in identifying relevant actions for addressing them and also in drafting future innovation  strategic objectives. Finally, this report identifies seven recommendations that can be taken into  account both at National and EU level to support the development of cybersecurity innovation  strategies and enhance their impact:  1. Support and develop sector specific innovation priorities.  2. Support sufficient and adequate level of funding.  3. Involve stakeholders while developing and implementing innovation strategies.  4. Take into account the positive impact of regulatory frameworks on innovation.  5. Support industries in positioning new cybersecurity offerings in the market  6. Promote EU level certification of services/products.  7. Promote NIS training and educational measures.  These recommendations form a roadmap for enhancing innovation on cybersecurity under  NCSS.  Stakeholders who are involved in defining national cybersecurity strategies may take into  account the results of this study, in particular, may take into account the identified challenges,  good practices and suggested recommendations.  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  7  1. INTRODUCTION  According to the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive1, MS are required to develop  National NIS Strategies to meet current and emerging cybersecurity threats. National NIS  Strategies are considered by the MS the same policy documents as National Cyber Security  Strategies (NCSS). The EU Member States need to constantly develop and adapt their  cybersecurity strategies and cooperate effectively to counter network and information security  risks. National cybersecurity strategies (NCSS) are the main documents of nation states to set  strategic principles, guidelines, and important objectives. Key priorities (among others) of a  National Cyber Security Strategy are critical information infrastructure protection, citizen’s  awareness, provision of incentives for the private sector to invest in cybersecurity, research and  development as well as promoting innovation in the field of cybersecurity.  ENISA supports the efforts aimed to enhance the overall level of cybersecurity preparedness of  EU Member States (MS) both at national and EU level. Innovation as a strategic priority under  NCSS is a key enabler to achieve those efforts. The objective of this report is to analyse how  Member States are approaching innovation as a strategic priority in terms of economic  incentives and investments, industrialisation and collaboration activities, implementation  methods, initiatives and all relevant aspects of innovation ecosystem building.  In the Commission proposal for establishing the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology  and Research Competence Centre and the Network of National Coordination Centres, the  Network and Information Security (NIS) industry is among the fastest growing segments of the  ICT market2. In order to optimise the benefits for the EU economy in terms of jobs and  competitiveness, it is necessary to create the right environment and ecosystems for the NIS  industry to grow. The Digital Single Market needs NIS products and services for its own growth.  It also provides opportunities for providers of NIS products and services. However, despite the  presence of NIS technical knowledge, innovative ideas and entrepreneurial spirit in Europe,  various factors may hinder the growth of NIS industry resulting in new companies following an  early exit strategy, or seeking growth opportunities outside the EU.  In an ever-changing cybersecurity environment, EU Member States need to have flexible and  dynamic cybersecurity strategies to meet new, global threats. ENISA is supporting the EU  Member States since 2012 to develop, implement and evaluate their NCSS in order to help the  Member States to enhance their level of cybersecurity preparedness.  1.1 P  OLICY CONTEXT  A NCSS is a plan of actions designed to improve the security and resilience of national  infrastructures and services. It is a high-level top-down approach to cybersecurity that  establishes a range of national objectives and priorities that should be achieved in a specific  timeframe. Currently all countries in the European Union have a NCSS as a key policy feature,  helping them to tackle risks which have the potential to undermine the achievement of economic  and social benefits from cyberspace. Apart from tackling cybersecurity risks, a strategy builds  on collaboration. Some of the most important settings to improve collaboration between  stakeholders is Information Sharing and the creation of Public-Private Partnerships.  1 Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 concerning  measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems across the Union (NIS  Directive) http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/1148/oj  2 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52018PC0630  http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/1148/oj https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52018PC0630  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  8  The NIS Directive reinforces NCSS’s role and states that innovation should be a key element of  a NCSS. The NIS Directive described NCSS as one element of the ‘National Frameworks on  the security of network and information system’. Specifically, Article 7 of the NIS Directive states  that each Member State shall adopt a national strategy on the security of network and  information systems defining the strategic objectives and related measures with a view to  achieving and maintaining a high level of security of network and information systems, covering  at least the Operators of Essential Services and the Digital Service Providers.  The increase in cyber threats and the perception of cyber insecurity is causing a growing  mistrust in citizens, potentially holding back the European economy as it increasingly becomes  digital. Recognising its key importance to growth of the EU’s digital economy, cybersecurity  forms a key component in the European Commission’s Digital Single Market (DSM) strategy.3  The DSM strategy recognises the need to protect the EU’s communication networks and critical  infrastructure and respond effectively to cyber threats, and the need to build on existing national  and EU-level cybersecurity strategies and regulation.  The aim of the EU’s Cybersecurity Strategy is to establish common minimum requirements for  network and information security (NIS) among the Member States; to set up coordinated  prevention, detection, mitigation, and response mechanisms; and to improve the preparedness  and engagement of the private sector. The strategy seeks to stimulate demand for effective NIS  ICT products and to certify these products by establishing a platform to identify good  cybersecurity and by developing security standards for cloud computing.  In particular, the DSM strategy also highlighted one of the key priorities of the Cybersecurity  Strategy, which is to develop industrial and technological resources for cybersecurity,  acknowledging that gaps exist between the rapid development of technologies and solutions for  online network security. It calls for “a more joined-up approach… to step up the supply of more  secure solutions by EU industry and to stimulate their take-up by enterprises, public authorities,  and citizens”.  The Commission is now considering4 key activities to protect the EU against cyber-attacks  covering multiple aspects, such as supporting EU NIS R&D and innovation for increased  competitiveness5, prompting European cooperation for a series of Sectoral Information  Sharing and Analysis Centres (sectoral ISACs), removing barriers that prevent market  participants from sharing event information and more. The European Commission supports the  model by exploring financial programmes such as the Connecting Europe facility6 (CEF),  discussing possibilities for cooperation, and suggesting further investment through procurement.  In terms of Data Privacy and Data Protection, the new General Data Protection Regulation  (GDPR)7  replaces the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC8 effective May 25, 2018. The  GDPR is directly applicable in each member state and will lead to a greater degree of data  protection harmonization across EU nations. The GDPR is an important step forward for  enhancing privacy of EU citizens, harmonizing data protection rules across Member States, and  promoting privacy and security as core aspects of the European industry.  Innovation priorities are also present in other initiatives. For example, the EU Cybersecurity  Act9, part of the Cybersecurity package, sets innovation as one of the priorities of the Digital  3 A Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe {SWD(2015) 100 final}, http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/digital- single-market/docs/dsm-communication_en.pdf  4 Communication on Strengthening Europe's Cyber Resilience System and Fostering a Competitive and  Innovative Cybersecurity Industry, COM(2016) 410 final, 5 July 2016,  http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=16546.  5 http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=16545  6 https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility  7 http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/reform/index_en.htm  8 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/LSU/?uri=celex:31995L0046  9 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/881/oj  http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/digital-single-market/docs/dsm-communication_en.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/digital-single-market/docs/dsm-communication_en.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=16546 http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=16545 https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/reform/index_en.htm http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/LSU/?uri=celex:31995L0046 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/881/oj  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  9  Single Market strategy and mandates ENISA to support Member States in their innovation  activities.  In addition, the Commission has also supported the creation of a European Cybersecurity  Industrial, Technology and Research Centre10, and of a network of Cybersecurity  Competence Centres11 to better target and coordinate available funding for cybersecurity  cooperation, research and innovation. The Competence Centre will facilitate and help  coordinate the work of the Network and foster the Cybersecurity Competence Community,  driving the cybersecurity technological agenda and facilitating common access to the expertise  of national centres. The overall mission of this new proposal is to help the Union retain and  develop the cybersecurity technological and industrial capacities necessary to secure its Digital  Single Market.  1.2 S  COPE AND OBJECTIVES  The main objective of this report is to analyse the landscape of innovation in cybersecurity in the  EU Member States and to present the good practices and the challenges that Member States  are facing when implementing innovation as a strategic priority of their National Cyber Security  Strategies. More specifically, the objectives of this report focus on:   Understanding the current landscape and mechanisms for supporting innovation in  cybersecurity in the EU by mapping regional characteristics as well as sectoral  demands.   Understanding the financial supporting mechanism in each MS from the public sector  (R&D funds) and how research results can end up as products on the market;   Share good practices and propose recommendations to relevant stakeholders to foster  the growth of innovation in cybersecurity in the EU.  1.3 M  ETHODOLOGY  Figure 1 presents the methodology adopted for conducting the study. It consists of five different  steps:  1. Desktop research: during this phase, relevant public documents and literatures have  been collected and taken into account. In particular, the desktop research focuses on  the analysis of the published NCSS. Different concepts, terminologies and usages  provide a characterisation of the different understanding of innovation and of the  different strategies that support innovation in cybersecurity.  2. Collection of experts and stakeholders point of view: Based on preliminary  analyses and findings of the desktop research, this phase identified and invited for  interviews (or online surveys) experts that have experience in relation to the  development and implementation of NCSS and more specific in the implementation of  Innovation as a strategic objective of a NCSS. For this reason, ENISA contacted its  NCSS experts group and National Liaison Officers (NLOs) to find the relevant experts  in each MS.  3. Analysis: The analysis presents an overview of the different dimensions to consider  when EU Member States implement cybersecurity innovation priorities. It also presents  the key practices used by the Member States to support innovation of cybersecurity in  their counties.  4.

EU AND NATIONAL INITIATIVES  This section provides an overview of the EU and National initiatives for innovation in  cybersecurity. In particular, it provides an account of the major EU initiatives supporting  innovation in cybersecurity. The European Commission supports innovation with different  initiatives and dedicated programmes supporting innovation across the European Union. Among  the EU programmes, the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) programme and the Horizon 2020  (H2020) programme regarding EU Research and Innovation support innovation mechanisms  and initiatives across different domains, including cybersecurity. This section also provides an  overview of the key national initiatives supporting innovation in cybersecurity.  2.1 E  U INITIATIVES  The Innovation and Networks Executive Agency (INEA) has been responsible for the  implementation of the CEF programme and parts of H2020 programme. The CEF programme  promotes growth, jobs and competitiveness through targeted infrastructure investment at  European level. The CEF programme covers three sectors: CEF Energy, CEF Telecom and  CEF Transport. Since January 2014, INEA is responsible for the implementation of most of the  CEF programme for a budget of €28.8 billion (out of €30.4 billion): €24.2 billion for Transport,  €4.8 billion for Energy, and €1.5 billion for Telecom. The CEF Telecom has also supported  cybersecurity projects and capability developments. In addition to grants, the CEF offers  financial support to projects through innovative financial instruments such as guarantees and  project bonds. These instruments create significant leverage in their use of EU budget and act  as a catalyst to attract further funding from the private sector and other public sector actors.  INEA has published a report on the achievements of the CEF programme12. The CEF  programme, in alignment with the NIS Directive, supports cooperation among Member States in  order to develop technical capabilities addressing emerging cyber threats, including potential  cross-border and cross-sector propagation of cyberattacks to operators of essential services  and digital service providers. The CEF’s Cybersecurity Digital Service Infrastructure (DSI)  supports the implementation of the Directive by increasing the cybersecurity capabilities of  actors that are fundamental for a State's cybersecurity, such as National Computer Security  Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs), operators of essential services, and national competent  12 INEA (2019): Investing in European Networks.

The Connecting  Europe Facility  (CEF) and the  Horizon 2020  (H2020)  programmes  support different  innovation  mechanisms and  initiatives in  cybersecurity  across sectors  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  13  authorities. The DSI also puts in place cooperation mechanisms for information sharing and  maturity development at the EU level. CEF Telecom has invested €29.4 million for the  Cybersecurity DSI funding 58 different actions (that INEA managed).  H2020, the other major EU programme for cooperative Research and Innovation partially  managed by INEA, has also provided supports to relevant cybersecurity research. H2020 funds  mainly three different types of mechanisms: Research and Innovation Actions (RIA) with EU  funding rate of 100% of the eligible project costs, Innovation Actions (RIA) with EU funding rate  of 70% of the eligible project costs (except non-profit, which are still funded 100%), and  Coordination and Support Actions (CSA). The European Commission maintains a H2020  dashboard, which prides an overview (by countries and beneficiaries) of the funded projects13.  Up to date, H2020 has supported over 24K grants, involved over 116K participants for a total  EU contributions exceeding €44 billion. Among the H2020 beneficiaries, over 23K SMEs have  participated in more than 10K grants receiving an EU contribution of over €7 billion. The  European Commission's proposal for Horizon Europe is an ambitious €100 billion research and  innovation programme to succeed Horizon 2020.  At the European Level, the European Commission has launched four different EU pilot projects  in order to prepare the European Cybersecurity Competence Network14. The Horizon 2020  (H2020), the EU Research and Innovation programme15, is funding the four pilot projects  addressing the overall objective of \"establishing and operating a pilot for a European  Cybersecurity Competence Network and developing a common European Cybersecurity  Research & Innovation Roadmap\". Which summarises key information of the four pilot projects:  CONCORDIA16, ECHO17, SPARTA18 and CyberSec4Europe19. These four EU pilot projects will  support strengthening the EU's cybersecurity capacity and address emerging cybersecurity  challenges for a safer European Digital Single Market20.

They will implement different activities (e.g. trainings,  cybersecurity demonstration cases and cyber ranges in different sectors such as eHealth,  finance, telecommunication, transportation, etc.) in order to address the cybersecurity-skill gab  in EU and to deliver innovative solutions preparing EU for future cross-sector and cross-border  cybersecurity challenges. These projects together with the European cybersecurity ecosystem  will work towards advancing cybersecurity research and innovation in Europe. The projects’  objectives are in alignment with the European Commission proposal for a European Regulation  establishing a European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence  Centre and a Network of National Cybersecurity Coordination Centres in 202121.  2.2 N  ATIONAL INITIATIVES  For the purposes of this study, a desktop research on 28 NCSS and a series of interviews with 14  responding MS have been carried out. In this subchapter, the analysis of those interviews and  NCSS highlight the strategic objectives that support innovation in cybersecurity across the Member  States. Those objectives are the following:  Organise cybersecurity exercises  In this objective, awareness in cybersecurity, skills development, collaboration and new ideas are  cultivated. All these could be a beginning for new products. Cybersecurity exercises are a great  way for people to test and enrich their skills and for companies to discover new talents.  Citizen's awareness  Informing and advising citizens regarding cybersecurity threats and incidents help them understand  the importance of cybersecurity in the everyday life. This helps in building a cybersecurity culture,  shaped according to the needs and priorities of each country. After all, human dynamics is one of  the key links of the cybersecurity chain.  Establish baseline security requirements  As internet is expanded far more than one country’s borders, cybersecurity threats concern  everyone. This is important for sectors and companies with different maturity levels to take specific  actions that will help them grow in parallel. Establishing baselines security requirements for their  information infrastructure is a first step in evolving and innovating.  Engage in international cooperation  This is a great way to collaborate, learn from each other, as well as adopt good practices.  Moreover, by organising international events, MS support internal companies to present and  promote their products, technologies and services.  Establish public-private partnerships  There is often a gap between public and private sector, making collaboration and trust difficult to be  achieved. Establishing public-private partnerships can help in bringing stakeholders together to  collaborate, understand the needs of the market and develop new products, technologies and  services.  Foster R&D  21 See: https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/proposal-regulation-establishing-european- cybersecurity-industrial-technology-and-research  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/proposal-regulation-establishing-european-cybersecurity-industrial-technology-and-research https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/proposal-regulation-establishing-european-cybersecurity-industrial-technology-and-research  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  15  As technology is growing faster and faster, research and development in cybersecurity needs to run  at the same speed or even foresee further developments. In this way technologies and people will  keep being secure and safe.  Provide incentives for the private sector to invest in security measures  One of the challenges the private sector usually faces is to choose between profit and investing in  cybersecurity, as both are important for a company’s continuity. Apart from this, companies’  security measures may also relate to their people, products or customers, so it is essential for MS  to provide incentives that could help the private sector in this dilemma. This will also help the  growth of the cybersecurity market and the adoption of new technologies, products or services.  Strengthen training and educational programmes  Universities, most of the times, is the first environment that future professionals meet. The more  trainings, conferences and workshops they organise, the more ready they will be to discuss,  brainstorm and come up with new ideas that might grow into innovative products, services and  technologies. Other initiatives such as private sector initiatives supported by the public sector  could offer training and educational programs and discover new talents, new ideas and potential  workforce for the cybersecurity domain.  In total 78.57% of the countries that participated in this study, organise cybersecurity exercises  and 92.86% establish baseline security requirements. 85.71% engage in international  cooperation and establish public-private partnerships. All participating countries confirmed that  they provide citizen’s awareness, foster R&D and strengthen training and educational programs  and 78.57% provide incentives for the private sector to invest in security measures.

National initiatives   Conducting a consultation on Cyber Science and Technology  Strategy  The analysis of the national initiatives highlights that MS are investing a substantial effort in  cybersecurity. The EU and national initiatives provide collectively a substantial investment in  cybersecurity. A strategic coordination of EU and NCSS would enhance the efficiency as well as  the potential contribution towards cybersecurity across the Union.  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  21  3. DIMENSIONS OF  INNOVATION  The analysis is structured around several aspects of innovation, which were identified by  analysing the NCSS across the EU. These aspects include: Innovation Priorities,  Industrialisation and Collaboration and Market and Policy. Each of these aspects is at the same  time divided into two dimensions. Innovation priorities can be divided into Innovation in  technologies and services, and into economic incentives and investments. Industrialisation and  collaboration can be divided into industrialisation processes and activities, and stakeholders’  collaboration. Market and Policy can be divided into Market and Technology Alignment and  Market regulation. Each dimension can be supported by several activities and mechanisms. In  order to define the different dimensions of innovation, this study took into account and analysed  the NCSS across EU Member States. The study also identifies the relevant mechanisms and  activities that support the implementation of innovation in cybersecurity as a strategic priority  under NCSS. It uses an integrated framework to analyse the different dimensions of innovation  and to identify specific elements contributing to them. Figure 4 shows the Dimensions of  Innovation in the context of NCSS.  Figure 4: Dimensions of Innovation in the context of National Cyber Security Strategies  The different dimensions are grouped on three different aspects: Innovation Priorities,  Industrialisation processes and collaboration, and Market and Policy. The dimensions include a  number of activities such as cooperation, awareness initiatives, research, etc.  ASPECTS  | DIMENSIONS  | ACTIVITIES  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  22  3.1 I  NNOVATION PRIORITIES  Innovation priorities refer to the objectives that are pursued by a given Member State in the area  of innovation. Innovation priorities can be divided in two categories: Innovation in technologies  and services, and economic incentives and investments.  Innovation in technologies and services refers to those priorities focussed on growing  existing technologies and organisations. It includes the following elements:   Cooperation: Supporting collaboration between public and private sectors in  enhancing cybersecurity and in dealing with emerging threats. For example, in the  French NCSS, this is described as the creation of an ‘environment of digital technology  businesses, industrial policy, export and internationalization’. In Ireland, this is  described as: ‘to build capacity across public administration and the private sector to  engage fully in the emergency management of cyber incidents’.   Awareness: Informing citizens, businesses and professionals and raising awareness  about the importance of cybersecurity and their abilities to deal with emerging cyber  threats. This topic has different considerations, but overall the majority of NCSS,  mention awareness raising and education activities.   Preparedness: Development of cybersecurity expertise and capabilities in order to  deal with emerging cyber threats. This is an element that some Member States identify  as an ongoing activity. For example, the Latvian NCSS states that it is possible to  protect against rapidly growing threats in cyber space only by constantly and  systematically developing and improving skills in the ICT sector and its security  specialization. Organising cybersecurity exercises are a way to increase MS  preparedness to respond to cyber threats   Expertise: Activities (including formal training programmes) contributing to  development of skills and expertise in cybersecurity. This priority is not found in the  NCSS of a lot of Member States. As an example, the Netherlands has a long-term  knowledge development program under which the academic community develops and  improves high-quality knowledge in the area of cybersecurity.   Research: Activities supporting the development of new products, services and  processes enhancing cybersecurity. Also, research is presented under different terms  in the NCSS. These terms include ‘research and development’, ‘stimulation of  technology development’, or ‘capability development’. An example of this category  from the Member States comes from the Czech Republic: ‘the Czech Republic shall  strive to ensure maximum cyberspace security. In parallel, it shall support high  technological production, research, development, and implementation. Thereby  contributing to the technological advancement of the country.  Economic incentives and investments refer to the relevant funding mechanisms that support  innovation in cybersecurity. Such mechanisms include access to capital, sector specific  investments, venture capitals, tax incentives, legal frameworks and insurance that might have  an impact on the effective adoption of cybersecurity technologies and services. NCSS define  funding mechanisms as research grants supporting studies and projects concerned with specific  innovation areas. Such funding mechanisms provide alternative opportunities, which may  complement EU research and innovation programmes. Funding mechanisms may also involve  public-private partnerships for strategic areas of innovation.  3.2 I  NDUSTRIALISATION AND COLLABORATION  Industrialisation and collaboration refers to the challenge of transitioning from research to  practice – with emphasis on stakeholder collaboration and industrialisation processes and  activities. To support such priorities, MS have identified different mechanisms or activities.  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  23  Although MS may implement such processes and activities differently, it is possible to cluster  them according to the two specific above mentioned categories  Industrialisation Processes and Activities refers to those processes and activities supporting  the integration of new cybersecurity technologies, products and services into the market. It  covers five priorities:   Innovative Organisations: Establishing organisations and formally mandating them  with industrialisation processes and activities. For example, following its NCSS, Spain  has as an objective to ‘develop a Framework for Cybersecurity Knowledge and Extend  and broaden talent recruitment, advanced research and training programmes in  cybersecurity in cooperation with Universities and specialised centres’. In  Hungary, its  NCSS states that ‘Hungary strives for strategic cooperation with universities and  scientific research centres, which have achieved outstanding and internationally  recognised results in cybersecurity research and development to help  establish  cybersecurity centres of excellence’.   Awareness Initiatives: Activities oriented towards informing citizens of emerging  threats and possible cybersecurity solutions. The Spanish NCSS mentions that it will  ‘raise the awareness of citizens, professionals and companies about the importance of  cybersecurity and the responsible use of new technologies and the services of the  Information Society’.   Professional Training: Activities oriented towards providing formal training to  professionals. In Croatia there is a push for the ‘development of human resources in  the area of communication and information technology security’.   Academic Training: Activities oriented towards providing formal academic training  either at schools or at the universities. Hungary pays particular attention to integrating  cybersecurity as a field in the information technology syllabus of primary, secondary  and higher education, in training courses for government officials and in professional  training courses.   Internationalisation: Activities supporting national stakeholders in international  activities in order to facilitate commercial opportunities. France supports export and  internationalisation of the businesses in the [cybersecurity] sector.  Stakeholder Collaboration refers to those initiatives and mechanisms supporting  stakeholder collaboration fostering industrialisation. The priority under this category is R&D,  which refers to activities oriented to the research and development of new products,  services and processes to enhance cybersecurity. Research can take many forms,  although overall, research is conducted with a combination of national and European funds.  This is the case of Austria, which mentions in its NCSS that ‘to strengthen Austria’s  research in the area of cybersecurity through national and EU security research  programmes. E.g. National Research Development Programme KIRAS Austria’.  3.3 M  ARKET AND POLICY  From governance perspective, the analysis investigated occurrences of mechanisms or  activities intended for shaping the cybersecurity market. In this section, two categories have  been identified: Market and Technology Alignment and Market regulation.  Market and Technology Alignment refers to the alignment between cybersecurity market and  innovative technologies, products and services. It covers:   Procurements: Adoption of technologies, products and services in order to support  National/EU industry. France is a big proponent of this priority by supporting public  procurement, the State will develop a favourable environment for French companies in  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  24  the digital sector offering secure products and services22. . The country is developing  and accentuating a national offer of cybersecurity products and services to create  competitiveness for national businesses. The State will develop a favourable  environment for French companies in the digital sector offering secure products and  services by supporting investment, innovation and exports. Moreover, France is  integrating cybersecurity requirements in public contracting. Croatia follows a similar  approach, stating in its NCSS that the country will aim at ‘Presenting and promoting the  solutions developed in Croatia for cybersecurity on the global market’. Poland also  develops industrial and technological resources for promoting cybersecurity.   Public and Private Partnerships (PPPs): Creation of PPPs focused on cybersecurity.  A PPPs is a cooperative arrangement between two or more public and private sectors,  typically of a long-term nature. They were primarily used for infrastructure provision,  such as the building and equipping of schools, hospitals, transport systems, water and  sewerage systems. Less than half of the Member States have created PPPs focusing  on cybersecurity. An example of a PPP is that of the Austrian Cyber Security Platform,  launched by the Federal Chancellery in 2015. It is Austria's central platform for  cooperation between the private and public sectors in matters of cybersecurity and the  protection of critical infrastructures.  Market regulations refers to relevant policy initiatives shaping the national or the European  internal market. The priorities under this category include:   Good Practices: good practices are activities that have shown to work well by proving  to succeed in achieving objectives and could be recommended as a model. They are  activities oriented towards providing guidance to the different stakeholders.   Legislative Initiatives: Activities oriented towards the establishment and maintenance  of legal frameworks. In this regard, some Member States pledge in their NCSS to keep  the legislative environment friendly to innovation in cybersecurity. For example, Spain  wants to ‘incorporate into the Spanish legal framework solutions to problems that arise  in connection with cybersecurity in order to establish types of criminal offences and the  work of the departments with responsibilities in this area’23. Greece has a similar  approach, stating in its NCSS that it aims at ‘recording and improving the existing  institutional framework’24.  All the above are the main dimensions of innovation (i.e. Innovation Priorities, Industrialisation  and Collaboration, and Market and Policy) and their underpinning mechanisms in the context of  NCSS.  3.4 N  CSS STAKEHOLDERS  The analysis of the NCSS across Member States has identified the main stakeholders, who are  involved in the implementation of cybersecurity strategies. The national strategies define  relevant measures and mechanisms for the different stakeholders. Figure 5 shows the four main  groups of stakeholders in the context of the NCSS: Governments, citizens and industries,  service providers and research institutions.  22 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss- map/France_Cyber_Security_Strategy.pdf  23 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/strategies/the-national- security-strategy  24 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/strategies/national- cyber-security-strategy-greece/view  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/France_Cyber_Security_Strategy.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/France_Cyber_Security_Strategy.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/strategies/the-national-security-strategy https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/strategies/the-national-security-strategy https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/strategies/national-cyber-security-strategy-greece/view https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/strategies/national-cyber-security-strategy-greece/view  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  25  Figure 5: Identified stakeholders in the context of NCSS  Governments refer to institutions that belong to the public sector. In particular, it refers to  governmental bodies such as ministries, military, police and institutions that compose the public  sector and as identified in the NIS Directive such as: Single Point of Contacts (SPOCs),  Computer Security Response Teams (CSIRTs) and Competent Authorities (CAs). Governments  are the main stakeholder in charge of innovation under the NCSS, having both a  leading/managerial role and an executive role. An example of governmental institutions refers to  the Ministries of Interior for some Member States.  Service providers refer mainly to the Operators of Essential Services (OESs) and to the Digital  Service Providers (DSPs), two stakeholders identified in the NIS Directive. Operators of  essential services are private businesses or public entities with an important role to provide  security in healthcare, transport, energy, banking and financial market infrastructure, digital  infrastructure and water supply. Under the NIS Directive, identified operators of essential  services will have to take appropriate security measures and to notify serious cyber incidents to  the relevant national authority. DSPs refer to all entities meeting the definitions of online  marketplaces, Cloud computing services and Search engines as presented in the NIS Directive.  This category is provided because it is expected that, in order to comply with the NIS Directive,  the stakeholders covered by the NIS Directive will be interested in innovative cybersecurity  technologies, products and services.  Citizens and Industries refer to all relevant stakeholders, who may benefit directly and indirectly  from NCSS. Strengthening cybersecurity as a whole as well as across all range ICT products,  services and processes will have a positive impact for citizens, who are often the end users and  principal beneficiaries. Industries form a complex ecosystem of stakeholders, who may depend  on other stakeholders such as governments, service providers (both OES and DSPs) and  research institutions too. Among such stakeholders are also industry associations across  sectors (e.g. manufacturing, machinery, etc.), which are becoming more and more dependent  on ICT products, services and processes. These industries may often benefit from various  initiatives under NCSS, including cyber awareness programmes and tailored cybersecurity  solutions for their sectors. Besides such industry stakeholders are also vendors, which provides  relevant cybersecurity solutions into the market. Due to the diversity of solutions, the resulting  A governmental body that has an executive role is the State School for Public Administration of  Croatia. This body provides training to Croatian public servants and plays a key role in ensuring  that cybersecurity innovation happens in the public sector.  The French General Commission for Investment, following the guidance of the French  Government allocates through public procurement public funds for promoting innovation of in the  cybersecurity sector.  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  26  cybersecurity market is highly fragmented. Furthermore, there are also public and private  stakeholders who are investing in cybersecurity with limited coordination with NCSS.  Research institutions refer to public and private academia and research organisations. Contrary  to what could be expected, this category is not mainly composed by universities. This seems to  suggest that there is a gap between universities and the NCSS. Instead, specific research  centres compose mainly this category. These centres can take many forms.  Technology Ireland ICT Skillnet is a network of companies who collaborate to address skills  needs within the technological sector. The network is a non-profit body which is co-funded by  Skillnet Ireland, the national agency for workforce development learning, and member companies.  Skillnet Ireland is funded from the National Training Fund through the Department of Education  and Skills. Another example of these institutions is the Fraunhofer Society, a German research  organization with 72 institutes spread throughout Germany, each focusing on different fields of  applied science. Fraunhofer is Europe’s largest application-oriented research organization.  Around 70 percent of Fraunhofer’s contract research revenue is derived from contracts with  industry and from publicly financed research projects. Citizens and Industries refer to the broader  private sector, including any institution that is not a part of the other categories. So far, no relevant  institutions have been identified for this category.  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  27  4. KEY FINDINGS  4.1 I  NNOVATION IN TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES  In order to identify the main priorities in innovation, the analysis investigates the following  questions:  Q1: Is innovation among the top priorities of the NCSS?  Q2: Are there policy related priorities that support innovation?  Q3: Are the mechanisms for collecting feedback from private sector regarding their access  to new cybersecurity technologies and services?  Q4: Are there challenges affecting objectives and priorities in cybersecurity innovation?  The interviews and surveys with experts highlight the different approaches that Member States  are following in order to support innovation in the context of the National Cyber Security  Strategies.  In some cases, Member States create relevant institutions or networks of stakeholders giving  them a mandate for specific aspects of innovation.  Other initiatives support innovation in cybersecurity and especially the creation of new  enterprises and new capabilities at national level.  These are just few examples that highlight how Member States develop and prioritise innovation  strategies.  Innovation is  among the  strategic  priorities of  National  cybersecurity  strategies in  the EU  In Portugal, innovation was among the top priorities in the previous NCSS of 2015. It is also  among the top priorities in the new strategy (published in the Official Journal in the 5th of June of  2019). Besides the vision defined in the new NCSS, one of the three established strategic  objectives is to “promote innovation”. There is also a specific axis of intervention: “Research,  Development and Innovation”. The specific activities planned in the next 5 years are yet  unpublished. 120 days after publication, the government will define a specific action plan to  operationalise these activities (with specified timeline, owners, etc.).  In Ireland, the Department of Communications and the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)  have a mandate for leading the NCSS work and defining relevant innovation strategies in  cybersecurity. However, innovation strategies often involve different stakeholders. The Industrial  Development Authority (IDA) has created the Cybersecurity Cluster called Cyber Ireland. In some  cases, such initiatives involve collaboration between the public and private sectors like a Public-  Private Partnership (PPP). In Spain, the Spanish National Cybersecurity Institute (INCIBE), is  involved in the development of such PPPs and other partnerships with other governmental  agencies.  Belgium is evaluating the creation of a “greenhouse” in order to support innovation in cybersecurity  and to assess new business models and solutions. Similarly in UK, the “Cyber Growth Partnership”  (CGP) is a Public-Private Partnership involving representatives from academia, industry and  government. Among the strategic objectives of this PPP is to enhance innovation within the  cybersecurity sector.  In Portugal, there is a national integrated initiative aimed at enhancing digital competences:  “InCoDe 2030”. The objective of the initiative is to develop digital skills, focussing on the  opportunities of adopting fast-paced technology. It goes in parallel to the content of the NCSS.  Innovation is also a relevant priority in the Portuguese Digital Agenda.  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  28  Figure 6 provides an overview of how experts responded to these questions. The experts’  opinions highlight that innovation is among the priorities of NCSS (Q1) and other policy related  priorities (Q2). However, there are different accounts of innovation across the NCSS across  Member States. In defining their innovation strategic priorities under NCSS, most Member  States have mechanisms for consulting stakeholders’ opinions and gathering their feedback  regarding their positions in order to access new cybersecurity technologies, products and  services (Q3).  This is useful in order to facilitate the development of innovation in the industry.  In addition,  there is a complete agreement that many challenges exist affecting innovation in cybersecurity  (Q4).  Figure 6: Innovation in technologies and services  In Luxembourg, there are multiple ways this feedback is organised:  -  Direct feedback for operators of critical infrastructures and operators of essential  services. These companies are in relation with regulators and have to provide  information about their cybersecurity capabilities. Either via providing policies, or  risk assessments.  -  Indirect feedback for other companies by the governmental cooperation with the cyber  insurance industry. The government closely collaborates with cyber insurance  companies, as they become informal regulators for non-regulated SME, which  represent a large part of the economy. The collaboration with cyber insurance is  linked to the informed governance projects, which provides risk scenarios as well as  metrics. The cyber insurance sector gives anonymous feedback to the government  about the maturity of the insured companies. The cyber insurance industry also  invests in the cybersecurity ecosystem and promotes private incident response  capabilities and research.  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  29  Table 2 highlights that the mean ranking25 has been given to critical factors such as lack of  funding and misalignment between innovation and market are higher than the median values  given to the other factors. Experts may have different views on the matter. Despite the  observation that “lack of expertise” affects developments of competitive business models for  new technologies and services, experts highlighted “lack of funding” and “misalignment between  innovation and market” as the most critical factors (Table 2). Whereas, they recognise the lack  of expertise as critical as market fragmentation and scale. One challenge is the so-called ‘Time  to Market’ challenge in Germany. This challenge is related to the process of certifying products  and services, which is very time consuming. This can often lead to the fact that when the  product arrives to the market, it is already outdated. Experts have also identified other  challenges. For instance, it is often difficult for governments to understand the needs of the  industry, as well as to develop expertise in dealing with PPPs. Often cybersecurity is addressed  within other topics. Among other factors, compliance with relevant regulatory frameworks may  according to some experts inhibit innovation. This is because lack of compliance is a business  risk, which some organisations (in particular SMEs) may perceive as a barrier to innovation. For  innovative companies such as start-ups it is very difficult to provide services or products to  regulated public and private sectors. The European market remains somehow difficult and  challenging for such innovative companies, which may try to develop their business outside  Europe. Other organisations, such as universities and research centres, may have access to  research funding. However, they usually have limited availabilities and capabilities (e.g. in terms  of data for testing innovative solutions) for bringing their research results to the market.  Table 2: Factors affecting developments of competitive business models  Critical factors  Mean ranking  (1 most important – 5 least important)  Lack of funding 2  Misalignment between innovation and market 2  Lack of expertise 3  Market fragmentation 3  Scale of market 3  Therefore, despite innovation is among the strategic priorities in NCSS, lack of funding and  misalignment between innovation and market represent important barriers for achieving  associated strategic objectives.  4.2 E  CONOMIC INCENTIVES AND INVESTMENTS  To identify the main economic mechanisms supporting innovation, the analysis investigates the  following questions:  Q6. Is there any access to capital to support innovation in cybersecurity technologies and  services?  Q7. Are there sector specific economic incentives and investments supporting innovation in  cybersecurity technologies and services?  Q8. Does the public sector support large enterprises to play a technical and economic role  in delivering new cybersecurity technology and service ventures in the marketplace?  25 The mean ranking is the weighted average of all interviewees feedback for each standard factor without  taking into consideration other custom provided factors. Other factors are documented in the text but  cannot participate in the total scoring.  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  30  Q9. Do factors such as, legal frameworks, insurance and taxation have an impact on the  effective adoption of new cybersecurity technologies and services?  Interviews with experts and surveys highlighted an irregular situation regarding funding and  innovation priorities. Member States have dedicated funding mechanisms and initiatives, which  however are often focusing on different research and innovative objectives rather than being  specific on cybersecurity.  However, eligibility criteria might limit access to public funding. Most funding mechanisms and  incentives support SMEs. Large enterprises in the private sector often rely on their own  investments. There are differences among regional, national and European funding initiatives.  Lack of coordination creates a fragmented set of funding mechanisms, which organisations may  perceive as lack of funding or strong competition. Some Member States have established and  funded institutions for managing and running innovative programmes.  Figure 7 provides an overview how experts responded to the above questions regarding funding  accessibility. The ability to access funding supporting innovation (even targeting specific  sectors) is somehow in contradiction with the perception that lack of funding is a challenge  affecting innovation. This is to a certain extent due to the misalignment between funding  available for specific innovation objectives and market opportunities.  It emerges that different types of mechanisms (e.g. legal frameworks, insurance mechanisms,  and taxation regimes) may have an impact on innovation and adoption of new technologies and  services.  In Sweden, the Swedish Innovation Agency currently allocates 200 Million Swedish Crowns for  innovation on digital security during a three year period 2018-2020. There is also a private  foundation, the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (https://strategiska.se/en/about-ssf/  ). The foundation was created by the government in 1994 and was given 6 billion SEK to  administrate. It is independent and estimates that will be able to carry out its mission until 2025.  It has recently allocated 300 Million Swedish Crowns  (https://strategiska.se/en/research/ongoing-research/cyber-security-2017/) for cybersecurity  research.  The UK Catapult centres, are networks of world-leading centres designed to transform the UK’s  capability for innovation in specific areas and to help drive future economic growth.  CyberSecIdent in Poland is a research and development program aimed at increasing the  security of cyberspace of the Republic of Poland by increasing the availability of hardware and  programming solutions.  In Italy, some security incentives for enterprise digitalization and Nuova Sabatini supporting  investments in big data, robotics, industry 4.0, cybersecurity. It is however questionable to what  extent the public sector and its relevant initiatives recognise the role of large enterprise in  supporting innovation.  In Luxembourg, the cybersecurity competence centre C3 (www.c-3.lu) identifies needs in  cybersecurity services and tries to create public private collaboration with the private sector to  create these services. The C3 operates on three main pillars: OBSERVE (threat intel, situational  awareness), TRAINING (providing innovation training), TEST (testing of start-up technology in  order to promote their services within larger companies). The government also enters into  strategic partnerships with large enterprises (e.g. Cisco), for example via memoranda of  understanding, seeking to address particular needs of the digital ecosystem, one of which is  cybersecurity.  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  31  Figure 7: Economic incentives and investments  4.3 I  NDUSTRIALISATION PROCESSES AND ACTIVITIES  To identify the main activities supporting industrialisation processes and activities, the analysis  investigates the following questions:  Q10. Is there any support for effective marketing expertise, particularly in the context of  cybersecurity and privacy?  Q11. Are there challenges effecting industrialisation processes and activities in  cybersecurity?  Q12. Are Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) preventing the exploration of the full range of  commercial options for new technologies and services in cybersecurity?  Figure 8 provides an overview how experts responded to these questions. Despite the support  to marketing initiatives (e.g. promotion of adoption of technologies and services by the public  sector and promotion of them alongside Member States’ initiatives in international events), there  are different challenges affecting the commercialisation of new cybersecurity technologies and  services. Experts do not identify that Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) prevent industrialisation  processes and activities (Q12). Most Member States support companies in positioning  themselves internally. They may organise dedicated networking events or support them in  establishing international relationships. However, there are various challenges affecting the  commercialisation of innovative solutions in cybersecurity. Among the reported challenges are  lengthily procurement processes. Thus, preventing in particular SMEs and innovative  companies such as start-ups to offer their services to the public sectors.  In Austria, the public sector relies on procurements. However, the government provides test beds  and (financially) supports SMEs in order to present their products and services to foreign  customers and investors. The government (and its initiatives including, for example, financial  supports covering travel costs for networking alongside government’s representatives) creates a  platform for enhancing the visibility of services and products. The focus is on the internal market  as well as on the international one.  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  32  Furthermore, local market characteristics such as fragmentation and composition (e.g. small  market with many SMEs) may affect industrialisation of new services and products.  Figure 8: Industrialisation processes and activities  Table 3 provides further insights regarding factors affecting industrialisation of new  technologies, products and services. Unsurprisingly, understating of technologies, products and  services together with understanding buyers’ needs are among the most important factors for  industrialisation. Interestingly, experts recognise such factors to be as important as compliance  with regulatory requirements. They recognise that understanding of business models and  understanding of alternative propositions are less important than the other factors of  industrialisation.  Table 3: Factors clarifying the value propositions of new technologies, products and services  Critical factors  Mean ranking  (1 most important – 5 least important)  Understanding of technologies and services 2  Understanding of buyers’ needs 2  Compliance with regulatory requirements 2  Clear business models 4  Understanding of alternative propositions 5  Therefore, industrialisation initiatives should focus of clarifying technologies and services, as  well as needs of potential buyers. Furthermore, compliance with regulatory requirements (e.g.  compliance with relevant security and data protection requirements drawn from relevant  regulatory frameworks) is an important aspect of technologies and services for positioning them  into the market.  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  33  4.4 S  TAKEHOLDER COLLABORATION  In order to assess the role of stakeholder collaboration in innovation activities, the analysis  investigates the following questions:  Q14. Is there any support for geographical proximity by bringing together innovation  stakeholders (e.g. universities, campuses clusters, start-ups, etc.)?  Q15. Are there any sector specific initiatives that support collaboration and fostering of  innovative products and services?  Figure 9 provides an overview how experts responded to these questions. They identify that  geographical clusters and collaborations are important mechanisms that support innovation.  However, collaboration mechanisms may support innovation differently.  Figure 9: Stakeholder collaboration  Table 4 highlights how experts recognise different collaboration mechanisms. Experts identify  that the involvement of industry in research and innovation is the most important factor affecting  industrialisation.  There are several initiatives bringing people together in Brussels, e.g. the Brussels Initiative on  Cybersecurity and Innovation. Also, everything in Brussels is geographically close enough, which  helps in bringing people together.  In Germany, the BSI takes part and/or organises sector-specific working groups for cybersecurity  products and services with industry and/or research institutes (e.g. Frauenhofer Gesellschaft) on  encryption, Artificial Intelligence and others. There are also regional initiatives for fostering  collaboration: competence centres in certain regions dealing with different topics, such as  cybersecurity research, military purposes, or universities.

Other  important mechanisms for industrialisation are industry secondments, involvement of the  industry in education and Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs).  4.5 M  ARKET AND TECHNOLOGY ALIGNMENT  To assess the role of market and technology alignment in innovation, the analysis investigates  the following questions:  Q17. Are there any barriers and challenges for creating alignments between markets and  technologies/services?  Q18. Are publicly funded research and innovation effectively addressing current and future  capability gaps of private and public services?  Q19. Are there any initiatives to build national talent base in cybersecurity research and  innovation in order to produce game-changing technologies and services addressing  current and future threats?  Figure 10 provides an overview how experts responded to these questions.  The Estonian Information Security Association (EISA) was founded to boost cross-sectorial  cooperation in Estonia between academia and private sector as well as with the government,  including supporting the EU’s contractual Public Private Partnership (cPPP) model on  cybersecurity. The joint effort intends to formalise existing ties and enhance R&D activities in the  information security and cybersecurity field in Estonia.  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  35  Figure 10: Market and Technology Alignment  Experts recognise that research and innovation initiatives are addressing future needs.  Furthermore, Member States are taking various initiatives in order to support talent in  cybersecurity research and innovation.  However, experts recognise also the existence of barriers and challenges for supporting  alignments of technologies and services with markets. Interviews with experts and surveys  highlight that normal market dynamics create opportunities for bringing innovation in operations.  In addition, there are differences across sectors. For example, the public sector depends on  procurements, which require companies offering their services and products to follow necessary  procedures and to comply with relevant requirements. Other sectors (e.g. cyber defence, critical  infrastructures, etc.) may have additional market constraints due to the criticality of services  offered at national level.  4.6 M  ARKET REGULATIONS  To assess the role of market regulations in innovation, the analysis investigates the following  questions:  Q20. Do government’s incentives accelerate the adoption of new technology in  cybersecurity and privacy?  In Austria, the Ministry of Defence organises specific initiatives (e.g. Hackathons) supporting  talent building and widening their recruiting strategies (e.g. internship opportunities for six  months).  In Belgium, which is a small country, regional governments seek to invest where they can make  a difference. They do not have the scale or budgets of international leaders, but they do have  excellent research in relevant domains, such as AI, on which they thus seek to focus investment.  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  36  Q21. Are there sector specific incentives to help in the adoption of new cybersecurity  technologies/services?  Figure 11 provides an overview how experts responded to these questions. It appears that  governments’ incentives have a positive impact in accelerating the adoptions of new  technologies, products and services.  However, there are factors that may constrain markets and the adoption of new technologies,  products and services.  Figure 11: Market regulations  Table 5 highlights how experts perceive critical factors on policies and legislative frameworks that  may stimulate innovation in cybersecurity. Regulatory stability and predictability as well as neutral  technological regulation are important factors to support innovation. Similarly, experts recognise  stakeholder involvement equally important. They recognise principle-based regulations and  In Germany, there are different relevant national strategies supporting various objectives. Such  strategies cover different topics and address different objectives: from applied cybersecurity to  cybersecurity research. Talking specifically about the NCSS, it covers four (4) areas:  1) Secure and autonomous acting in a digital environment  2) Joint mission of State and Economy  3) Efficient and sustainable cybersecurity architecture  4) Active positioning of Germany in European and international cybersecurity.  Within the activities concerned with ‘Secure and autonomous acting in a digital environment’,  there are different measures including strengthening IT security research and innovation. The  Ministry of Research and Innovation, in relation to the later, is providing direct funding through  a programme called ‘Being autonomous and secure in a digital world’ (EUR 180 million ).  Moreover, BSI develops technical guidelines, which promote adequate cybersecurity standards  in IT systems of different sectors/areas.  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  37  performance evaluations to be less critical than other factors. Experts perceive differently the  impact of regulatory frameworks and initiatives. On one hand, they highlight that most regulatory  frameworks and initiatives focus on compliance (rather than security). Such frameworks and  initiatives may prevent the adoption of innovative solutions and services that innovative companies  such as start-ups provide. On the other hand, regulatory frameworks and initiatives may drive  innovation. Companies invest in compliance projects (e.g. compliance with GDPR) and  cybersecurity capabilities (e.g. cybersecurity capabilities in alignment with security requirements  and incident notification) in order to align with relevant regulatory frameworks.

SWOT ANALYSIS  This section discusses strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats that influence the  successful implementation of innovation priorities in the Member States. It also provides a  strategic forward looking perspective, which provides insights for further developments of  National Cyber Security Strategies. Figure 12 summarises the SWOT analysis of this chapter.  Figure 12: SWOT that influence innovation priorities under NCSS  5.1 S  TRENGTHS  Stakeholder consultations for identifying and defining innovation strategies. The  interviews with experts highlighted that some Member States may have both formal and  informal means of engaging with and collecting feedback from innovation stakeholders. In  particular, industry involvement provide insights in defining innovation strategies. Member  States shall consider establishing and consolidating stakeholder involvements while identifying  and specifying national cybersecurity innovation strategies.  Positive impact of regulatory frameworks on innovation. The experts highlighted how  regulatory frameworks such as the NIS Directive and the GDPR accelerated and incentivised  innovation in relevant areas of security and data protection. On the one hand, regulatory  frameworks define governance regimes for new technologies and services. On the other hand,  they may incentivised and accelerate innovation in the specific areas of interventions.  Compliance with regulatory requirements. Experts recognise that compliance with regulatory  requirements is an important factor for commercialising and positioning cybersecurity services  and technologies in the market. This is also in alignment with the EU Cybersecurity Act, which  NIS Directive  and the GDPR  accelerated and  incentivised  innovation in  relevant areas  of security and  data protection  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  39  requires the development of a European Cybersecurity Certification Framework for ICT  products, services and processes.  Involvement of industry in Research and Innovation. An important mechanism for  supporting industrialisation is to involve directly industry in research and innovation activities.  This helps research stakeholders (e.g. universities, research centres, etc.) to align with industry  needs as well as industry stakeholders to identify opportunities for adopting or commercialising  research outcomes.  Developing skills for future needs. Among the various innovation strategies, it was possible  to identify different initiatives supporting development of cybersecurity skills. It is important to  extend such initiatives in order to develop the necessary skills for emerging cybersecurity  technologies and services.  5.2 W  EAKNESSES  Misalignment between funding and innovation priorities. Among the identified challenges  are lack of funding and misalignment between innovation and market. This is to a certain extent  due to the fact that there is a lack of direct funding supporting innovation strategies. This may  result in disconnects between national strategies and availabilities of funding for achieving and  supporting the implementation of strategic objectives related to innovation under national  cybersecurity strategies.  Lack of sectorial approach to innovation. Often the lack of funding in cybersecurity is due to  limited opportunities supporting innovation across different sectors. Although cybersecurity is a  critical factor, funding opportunities are often within generic topics (e.g. Artificial Intelligence,  Automotive, Manufacturing, Industry 4.0, etc.).  Furthermore, there is a lack of funding  addressing cybersecurity across sectors without giving any priorities to critical sectors (for  instance, the sectors of Operators of Essential Services that the NIS Directive identifies). More  R&D financing of EU technical innovation is needed as well as funding of NIS projects in the  critical sectors, which could use EU NIS products and services. Investing in R&D is expensive  for small EU specialist NIS vendors, and participating in EU programmes is difficult. Switching to  regional and national levels would need coordination.  Limited opportunities and incentives for innovation of large enterprises. There are various  mechanisms at the European and national level supporting innovation for SMEs as well as  emerging innovative entrepreneurships such as start-ups. Unfortunately, there are limited  opportunities and incentives for innovation of large enterprises. Besides some Public-Private  Partnerships (PPPs), large enterprises have to face most of the cost and investment in  innovation. However, they may have a critical role in order to accelerate innovation as well as to  provide access to markets for innovation at scale. Unfortunately, there is a lack of initiatives and  incentives in order to support innovation collaboration between SMEs and large enterprises,  besides normal market dynamics.  Fragmented market in the EU. Suppliers need to be able to cope with a fragmented EU  market often divided by language and culture. NIS often requires a specific relationship of trust  so customers may mandate that the vendor speak the same language to build this and then  conserve it in a long-term relationship. It should result in a transfer from transactional selling to a  service-based relationship of repeated sales. Marketing strategies may support companies in  promoting their services to potential buyers, in particular, internationally. Procurement to the  public sector may help companies in promoting themselves in the market.  Lack in defining sector specific incentives. Despite the positive impact of regulatory  frameworks on innovation, there is still a lack of incentives and regulatory frameworks targeting  specific sector interventions. Organisations have to deal with different frameworks, not  necessary tailored to their market needs and specificities.  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  40  Lack of training in cybersecurity skills and qualified personnel stretches back through to  university education in cybersecurity and even further into the introduction of computing and  coding, at the level of secondary schools. This impacts awareness in general and is causing a  shortage of staff with the qualifications and experience the NIS industry sorely needs.  5.3 O  PPORTUNITIES  Innovation priorities in NCSS and policy related priorities: it is necessary to understand the  relationships between innovation priorities in NCSS and other policy related priorities. In  particular, policy related initiatives should follow and support innovation priorities in NCSS. As a  marketing tool to promote EU NIS companies within the EU and internationally, technical  standards for NIS products and services should be used, such as the Federal Office for  Information Security in Germany, BSI, for ICT approvals but at EU level. An EU-wide security  label would support European sales. Harmonised qualifications should be created through local  national standards but not as a centralised approach as the EU MS require sovereignty  over NIS matters. Moreover, such standards should be promoted overseas, so EU NIS  providers gain global recognition, which is especially significant in the developing world. The  standards setting and approvals initiative and its international promotion could be part of  ENISA’s responsibilities  Innovation priorities in NCSS and incentives for the adoption of new technologies and  services: it is necessary to align innovation priorities in NCSS with relevant incentives for the  adoption of new technology. There are a number of European institutions and programs  supporting NIS development26 27, etc with the main goal to ensure cyber protection for all:  citizens, companies (including SMEs) and public administration by supporting the development  of an EU cybersecurity industry  Economic incentives and investments for the adoption of new technologies and  services: economic incentives may accelerate the adoption of new technologies, products and  services. Increased availability of national or regional funds and tax incentives. For example,  start-ups can benefit from a cut on R&D costs, on social charges and on corporate taxes.  Investors who invest in start-ups and innovation can also benefit from cuts in charges which can  lead to turning the investment riskless, as the funds invested would have been otherwise spent  in paying taxes28.  Addressing factors affecting the adoption of new technologies and services, and talent  initiatives: it is necessary to address factors affecting the adoption of new technologies and  services as well as take into account relevant talent initiatives. Through early school education  in secure software development plus development of new professional qualifications at degree  and post graduate levels, create a stronger EU-based NIS industry with large numbers of  qualified personnel for three areas requiring stronger NIS skills:   CSIRT teams to work in SOCs   Product development – both NIS and generally, especially for infrastructure   Programming of all types – bespoke, embedded, product packages for the  commercial market  Promoting geographical clusters and initiatives for collaboration: geographical clusters  support collaboration initiatives. Leveraging existing European clusters specialized in  cybersecurity will help to develop business in close proximity with other start-ups,  incubators/accelerators, universities and big corporations.  26 https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/h2020-sections  27 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/policies/start-up-europe  28 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/challenges-and-opportunities-for-eu-cybersecurity-start-ups  https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/h2020-sections https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/policies/start-up-europe https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/challenges-and-opportunities-for-eu-cybersecurity-start-ups  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  41  Security by default, within the Cybersecurity Act will allow new NIS products and  services to become more affordable and attractive to use, as they will be configured by  default with the most secure setting possible. Security by default will not require specific  technical knowledge and understanding of consumers.  5.4 T  HREATS  Lack of awareness of users of the level of threats to business is a common theme across the  EU Member States. This lack of awareness is greatest in the EU’s SME segment, where  governments need to provide more support. Business and the public sector are not being  sufficiently educated on the need for security. Major fraud activities touch every level of the  population every day, but continued low levels of sales of NIS services and products threaten  the EU economy.  In terms of the global market, the key threat to EU is that better funded overseas NIS  players succeed in entirely dominating the EU market. They could exploit the EU’s  fragmentation by acquiring the best local companies in each Member State, then expanding  sales as a common brand across the EU, with major inward investment underpinned by their  home markets’ revenues (in the USA and China).  Similarly, it is conceivable that intellectual property funded and developed in the EU could  be bought and exploited by overseas NIS suppliers, from China and the USA, so that EU  investments in R&D may be lost to the EU. In this regard, promising EU suppliers may have little  alternative because of the limited EU investment available to enable them to develop the more  advanced tools required and bring them to market. Not only is EU funding for R&D and  industrialisation too limited, given the scale of AI and large-scale data analytics required, but it is  spread too thinly, making the creation of a major EU player less likely. Moreover, EU and  national funding may be too burdensome to access in terms of costs and bureaucracy for start-  ups and SMEs. Thus, any promising innovative or existing EU NIS supplier is often acquired by  a global player, especially if major equity holders are anxious to realise their investments.  The shortfall in the cybersecurity workforce remains a critical vulnerability for the industry.  Conventional education and training policies cannot meet demand. The lack of trained  personnel exacerbates an already difficult task of managing cybersecurity risks. Professional  certification in NIS is essential to increase the qualified workforce.  Sometime in the next decade, new computing technology could endanger some current  encryption technologies. That would open more customer databases to attack for data theft.  Confidence in online commerce, and in any business that stores customer or confidential data,  could be compromised. Countering this will require further R&D investments in cryptography for  new algorithms.  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  42  6. RECOMMENDATIONS  The analyses of National Cyber Security Strategies across Member States provide an overview  of innovation challenges and good practices. Based on the results of this study, which also  involved experts providing further insights and examples of innovation practices, this report  draws some recommendations for enhancing innovation in cybersecurity. Stakeholders who are  involved in developing and implementing NCSS, EU policy makers, National policy makers may  take into account the results of this study, in particular, the identified challenges, good practices  and suggested recommendations:  Support and develop sector specific innovation priorities both at National and EU level –  Current level of funding is often perceived insufficient or misaligned with industry needs and  expectations. This is also due to a certain extent to the fragmentation of funding mechanisms as  well as to the lack of coordination between alternative funding mechanisms at regional, national  or European level. In order to address the lack of funding as well as the misalignment between  innovation strategies and industry needs, it is necessary to support an adequate level of funding  for innovation priorities and to support coordination among alternative funding mechanisms.  Moreover, most innovation priorities and funding mechanisms support general cybersecurity  objectives (including development of new products, services and processes) or other generic  objectives for which cybersecurity is only a part of them. Therefore, it is necessary to take into  account different needs across sectors. Currently, there is a lack of cybersecurity initiatives  tailored to specific sectors. Addressing this situation would help developing a sectorial approach  to innovation in cybersecurity.  Provide adequate level of funding both at National and EU level - Most economic incentives  and funding mechanisms support research organisations such as universities and research  centres, and innovative enterprises such as SMEs and start-ups. However, economic incentives  and funding mechanisms shall recognise the innovation contributions of all stakeholders, from  SMEs to large enterprises and research institutions in the public and private sectors. Innovation  stakeholders need different types of economic incentives and funding mechanisms depending  on their specific contributions to innovation in cybersecurity.  Involve stakeholders while developing and implementing innovation priorities both at  National and EU level. In order to address stakeholder’s expectations and support their needs,  it is necessary to establish both formal and informal channels of communication. A way is to  achieve this is to support the creation of industrial clusters:   To create clusters of start-ups, SMEs and post-start-up ecosystems, with  geographic concentration of resources and cross EU links to smaller players of all  kinds, possibly around a university as a centre of NIS excellence, or other  permanent institution, such as a testing and certification lab.   Clusters could be formed at various locations across the EU.   With formation of clusters for vertical sectors also, where appropriate.  Take into account the positive impact of regulatory frameworks on innovation at  national level and EU level – Regulatory frameworks may have a positive impact on  accelerating innovation and adoption of new products, services and processes. Therefore,  regulatory frameworks may positively support the achievement of specific innovation  objectives. Emphasising compliance with regulatory requirements as a market differentiator  may be perceived mainly in terms of obligations. However, compliance with specific regulatory  requirements may clearly define market opportunities both in the public and private sectors.  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  43  Support industries in positioning new cybersecurity offerings in the market both at  National and EU level – Innovative organisations such as SMEs and start-ups may face  challenging market conditions (e.g. fragmentation, international competition, etc.) in order to  offer and position their products, services and processes. It is therefore necessary to support  them with specific initiatives such us effort towards internationalisation of offerings in order to  help them to growth into the cybersecurity market.  Promote EU level certification of services/products both at National and EU level. That  would engender trust for users within the EU and provide a stamp of approval for international  markets that other regions do not have by enabling:   Security certification of ICT products and services for software, hardware and  firmware, ranging from apps for smartphones to data centre management utilities  to real-time industrial control software to chip level security. Certification should be  detailed and robust – not just a tick box exercise.   Certification of NIS products should be in terms of efficiency, ease of use and  effort needed across the product/service lifecycle.   Approved centres of certification.   EU security branding for certified products and services.   Continuous certification processes to track developing products/services.  Promote NIS training and educational measures both at National and EU level:   University level qualifications for a new NIS workforce, with a new emphasis on  security as a basic computer science   Support skill developments for current needs as well as future needs due to  emerging cybersecurity technologies and services – Skill developments should  take into account employability as well as innovation. It is necessary to support  skill developments addressing current needs as well as competencies and  capabilities needed for emerging innovative technologies, services and processes.   Education at school level on the need for cybersecurity in using ICT devices and in  writing software   Support funds for training NIS service staff for cybersecurity incident response  teams, e.g. six-month induction course for several thousand staff annually across  the EU, with financial support for training courses and trainees. This would provide  NIS service providers of all sizes with a solution to the gap in qualified personnel  for the security operations centres (SOCs) that will be a key feature of the future  EU NIS industry.  Some of these actions have already been put into motion, For example, the agreed approach of  the Commission is already turning to maximise awareness in the cybersecurity community of  financing opportunities at European, national and regional level, via existing instruments and  channels such as the Enterprise Europe Network29 and also has initiated the contractual  Cybersecurity Public Private Partnership (cPPP) for large-scale funding. Moreover the  Commission may complement these efforts with inputs from the European Investment Bank  (EIB) and the European Investment Fund (EIF) to accelerate access to finance with further  measures.  29 Strengthening Europe's Cyber Resilience System and Fostering a Competitive and Innovative  Cybersecurity Industry.

The need for a strong and effective EU Network and Information Security (NIS)  Industry becomes two-fold; on the one hand the DSM needs NIS protection for commercial  services, critical infrastructure and the everyday life of its citizens, who depend on online  services. On the other hand, the DSM offers opportunities and tools that can facilitate the  growth of the EU NIS Industry. Growth of the NIS industry can occur with direct benefits in terms  of revenue for NIS suppliers, growth of the EU GDP and boost of employment in the  cybersecurity sector; the latter is of particular importance considering that cybersecurity is one  of the faster growing segments of the ICT industry. To achieve this, innovation in cybersecurity  is a key enabler. ENISA supports the efforts aimed to enhance the overall level of cybersecurity  in the Member States (MS) both at a national and EU level. This report supports that effort by  analysing how Member States are approaching innovation as a strategic priority under National  Cyber Security Strategies (NCSS).  The analysis is structured around several aspects of innovation such as: Innovation Priorities,  Industrialisation and Collaboration and Market and Policy. Each of these aspects is at the same  time divided into two dimensions. Innovation priorities can be divided into Innovation in  technologies and services, and into economic incentives and investments. Industrialisation and  collaboration can be divided into industrialisation processes and activities, and stakeholders’  collaboration. Market and Policy can be divided into Market and Technology Alignment and  Market regulation. Each dimension can be supported by several activities and mechanisms.  Moreover, this study identifies a set of challenges and good practices, as experts perceive  them, across the different innovation dimensions. The identification of these challenges may  help in identifying relevant actions for addressing them and also in drafting future innovation  strategic objectives. Finally, this report identifies seven recommendations that can be taken into  account both at National and EU level to support the development of cybersecurity innovation  strategies and enhance their impact:  1. Support and develop sector specific innovation priorities.  2. Support sufficient and adequate level of funding.  3. Involve stakeholders while developing and implementing innovation strategies.  4. Take into account the positive impact of regulatory frameworks on innovation.  5. Support industries in positioning new cybersecurity offerings in the market  6. Promote EU level certification of services/products.  7. Promote NIS training and educational measures.  These recommendations form a roadmap for enhancing innovation on cybersecurity under  NCSS.  Stakeholders who are involved in defining national cybersecurity strategies may take into  account the results of this study, in particular, may take into account the identified challenges,  good practices and suggested recommendations.  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  7  1. INTRODUCTION  According to the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive1, MS are required to develop  National NIS Strategies to meet current and emerging cybersecurity threats. National NIS  Strategies are considered by the MS the same policy documents as National Cyber Security  Strategies (NCSS). The EU Member States need to constantly develop and adapt their  cybersecurity strategies and cooperate effectively to counter network and information security  risks. National cybersecurity strategies (NCSS) are the main documents of nation states to set  strategic principles, guidelines, and important objectives. Key priorities (among others) of a  National Cyber Security Strategy are critical information infrastructure protection, citizen’s  awareness, provision of incentives for the private sector to invest in cybersecurity, research and  development as well as promoting innovation in the field of cybersecurity.  ENISA supports the efforts aimed to enhance the overall level of cybersecurity preparedness of  EU Member States (MS) both at national and EU level. Innovation as a strategic priority under  NCSS is a key enabler to achieve those efforts. The objective of this report is to analyse how  Member States are approaching innovation as a strategic priority in terms of economic  incentives and investments, industrialisation and collaboration activities, implementation  methods, initiatives and all relevant aspects of innovation ecosystem building.  In the Commission proposal for establishing the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology  and Research Competence Centre and the Network of National Coordination Centres, the  Network and Information Security (NIS) industry is among the fastest growing segments of the  ICT market2. In order to optimise the benefits for the EU economy in terms of jobs and  competitiveness, it is necessary to create the right environment and ecosystems for the NIS  industry to grow. The Digital Single Market needs NIS products and services for its own growth.  It also provides opportunities for providers of NIS products and services. However, despite the  presence of NIS technical knowledge, innovative ideas and entrepreneurial spirit in Europe,  various factors may hinder the growth of NIS industry resulting in new companies following an  early exit strategy, or seeking growth opportunities outside the EU.  In an ever-changing cybersecurity environment, EU Member States need to have flexible and  dynamic cybersecurity strategies to meet new, global threats. ENISA is supporting the EU  Member States since 2012 to develop, implement and evaluate their NCSS in order to help the  Member States to enhance their level of cybersecurity preparedness.  1.1 P  OLICY CONTEXT  A NCSS is a plan of actions designed to improve the security and resilience of national  infrastructures and services. It is a high-level top-down approach to cybersecurity that  establishes a range of national objectives and priorities that should be achieved in a specific  timeframe. Currently all countries in the European Union have a NCSS as a key policy feature,  helping them to tackle risks which have the potential to undermine the achievement of economic  and social benefits from cyberspace. Apart from tackling cybersecurity risks, a strategy builds  on collaboration. Some of the most important settings to improve collaboration between  stakeholders is Information Sharing and the creation of Public-Private Partnerships.  1 Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 concerning  measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems across the Union (NIS  Directive) http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/1148/oj  2 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52018PC0630  http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/1148/oj https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52018PC0630  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  8  The NIS Directive reinforces NCSS’s role and states that innovation should be a key element of  a NCSS. The NIS Directive described NCSS as one element of the ‘National Frameworks on  the security of network and information system’. Specifically, Article 7 of the NIS Directive states  that each Member State shall adopt a national strategy on the security of network and  information systems defining the strategic objectives and related measures with a view to  achieving and maintaining a high level of security of network and information systems, covering  at least the Operators of Essential Services and the Digital Service Providers.  The increase in cyber threats and the perception of cyber insecurity is causing a growing  mistrust in citizens, potentially holding back the European economy as it increasingly becomes  digital. Recognising its key importance to growth of the EU’s digital economy, cybersecurity  forms a key component in the European Commission’s Digital Single Market (DSM) strategy.3  The DSM strategy recognises the need to protect the EU’s communication networks and critical  infrastructure and respond effectively to cyber threats, and the need to build on existing national  and EU-level cybersecurity strategies and regulation.  The aim of the EU’s Cybersecurity Strategy is to establish common minimum requirements for  network and information security (NIS) among the Member States; to set up coordinated  prevention, detection, mitigation, and response mechanisms; and to improve the preparedness  and engagement of the private sector. The strategy seeks to stimulate demand for effective NIS  ICT products and to certify these products by establishing a platform to identify good  cybersecurity and by developing security standards for cloud computing.  In particular, the DSM strategy also highlighted one of the key priorities of the Cybersecurity  Strategy, which is to develop industrial and technological resources for cybersecurity,  acknowledging that gaps exist between the rapid development of technologies and solutions for  online network security. It calls for “a more joined-up approach… to step up the supply of more  secure solutions by EU industry and to stimulate their take-up by enterprises, public authorities,  and citizens”.  The Commission is now considering4 key activities to protect the EU against cyber-attacks  covering multiple aspects, such as supporting EU NIS R&D and innovation for increased  competitiveness5, prompting European cooperation for a series of Sectoral Information  Sharing and Analysis Centres (sectoral ISACs), removing barriers that prevent market  participants from sharing event information and more. The European Commission supports the  model by exploring financial programmes such as the Connecting Europe facility6 (CEF),  discussing possibilities for cooperation, and suggesting further investment through procurement.  In terms of Data Privacy and Data Protection, the new General Data Protection Regulation  (GDPR)7  replaces the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC8 effective May 25, 2018. The  GDPR is directly applicable in each member state and will lead to a greater degree of data  protection harmonization across EU nations. The GDPR is an important step forward for  enhancing privacy of EU citizens, harmonizing data protection rules across Member States, and  promoting privacy and security as core aspects of the European industry.  Innovation priorities are also present in other initiatives. For example, the EU Cybersecurity  Act9, part of the Cybersecurity package, sets innovation as one of the priorities of the Digital  3 A Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe {SWD(2015) 100 final}, http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/digital- single-market/docs/dsm-communication_en.pdf  4 Communication on Strengthening Europe's Cyber Resilience System and Fostering a Competitive and  Innovative Cybersecurity Industry, COM(2016) 410 final, 5 July 2016,  http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=16546.  5 http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=16545  6 https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility  7 http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/reform/index_en.htm  8 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/LSU/?uri=celex:31995L0046  9 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/881/oj  http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/digital-single-market/docs/dsm-communication_en.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/digital-single-market/docs/dsm-communication_en.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=16546 http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=16545 https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/reform/index_en.htm http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/LSU/?uri=celex:31995L0046 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/881/oj  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  9  Single Market strategy and mandates ENISA to support Member States in their innovation  activities.  In addition, the Commission has also supported the creation of a European Cybersecurity  Industrial, Technology and Research Centre10, and of a network of Cybersecurity  Competence Centres11 to better target and coordinate available funding for cybersecurity  cooperation, research and innovation. The Competence Centre will facilitate and help  coordinate the work of the Network and foster the Cybersecurity Competence Community,  driving the cybersecurity technological agenda and facilitating common access to the expertise  of national centres. The overall mission of this new proposal is to help the Union retain and  develop the cybersecurity technological and industrial capacities necessary to secure its Digital  Single Market.  1.2 S  COPE AND OBJECTIVES  The main objective of this report is to analyse the landscape of innovation in cybersecurity in the  EU Member States and to present the good practices and the challenges that Member States  are facing when implementing innovation as a strategic priority of their National Cyber Security  Strategies. More specifically, the objectives of this report focus on:   Understanding the current landscape and mechanisms for supporting innovation in  cybersecurity in the EU by mapping regional characteristics as well as sectoral  demands.   Understanding the financial supporting mechanism in each MS from the public sector  (R&D funds) and how research results can end up as products on the market;   Share good practices and propose recommendations to relevant stakeholders to foster  the growth of innovation in cybersecurity in the EU.  1.3 M  ETHODOLOGY  Figure 1 presents the methodology adopted for conducting the study. It consists of five different  steps:  1. Desktop research: during this phase, relevant public documents and literatures have  been collected and taken into account. In particular, the desktop research focuses on  the analysis of the published NCSS. Different concepts, terminologies and usages  provide a characterisation of the different understanding of innovation and of the  different strategies that support innovation in cybersecurity.  2. Collection of experts and stakeholders point of view: Based on preliminary  analyses and findings of the desktop research, this phase identified and invited for  interviews (or online surveys) experts that have experience in relation to the  development and implementation of NCSS and more specific in the implementation of  Innovation as a strategic objective of a NCSS. For this reason, ENISA contacted its  NCSS experts group and National Liaison Officers (NLOs) to find the relevant experts  in each MS.  3. Analysis: The analysis presents an overview of the different dimensions to consider  when EU Member States implement cybersecurity innovation priorities. It also presents  the key practices used by the Member States to support innovation of cybersecurity in  their counties.  4.

EU AND NATIONAL INITIATIVES  This section provides an overview of the EU and National initiatives for innovation in  cybersecurity. In particular, it provides an account of the major EU initiatives supporting  innovation in cybersecurity. The European Commission supports innovation with different  initiatives and dedicated programmes supporting innovation across the European Union. Among  the EU programmes, the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) programme and the Horizon 2020  (H2020) programme regarding EU Research and Innovation support innovation mechanisms  and initiatives across different domains, including cybersecurity. This section also provides an  overview of the key national initiatives supporting innovation in cybersecurity.  2.1 E  U INITIATIVES  The Innovation and Networks Executive Agency (INEA) has been responsible for the  implementation of the CEF programme and parts of H2020 programme. The CEF programme  promotes growth, jobs and competitiveness through targeted infrastructure investment at  European level. The CEF programme covers three sectors: CEF Energy, CEF Telecom and  CEF Transport. Since January 2014, INEA is responsible for the implementation of most of the  CEF programme for a budget of €28.8 billion (out of €30.4 billion): €24.2 billion for Transport,  €4.8 billion for Energy, and €1.5 billion for Telecom. The CEF Telecom has also supported  cybersecurity projects and capability developments. In addition to grants, the CEF offers  financial support to projects through innovative financial instruments such as guarantees and  project bonds. These instruments create significant leverage in their use of EU budget and act  as a catalyst to attract further funding from the private sector and other public sector actors.  INEA has published a report on the achievements of the CEF programme12. The CEF  programme, in alignment with the NIS Directive, supports cooperation among Member States in  order to develop technical capabilities addressing emerging cyber threats, including potential  cross-border and cross-sector propagation of cyberattacks to operators of essential services  and digital service providers. The CEF’s Cybersecurity Digital Service Infrastructure (DSI)  supports the implementation of the Directive by increasing the cybersecurity capabilities of  actors that are fundamental for a State's cybersecurity, such as National Computer Security  Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs), operators of essential services, and national competent  12 INEA (2019): Investing in European Networks.

The Connecting  Europe Facility  (CEF) and the  Horizon 2020  (H2020)  programmes  support different  innovation  mechanisms and  initiatives in  cybersecurity  across sectors  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  13  authorities. The DSI also puts in place cooperation mechanisms for information sharing and  maturity development at the EU level. CEF Telecom has invested €29.4 million for the  Cybersecurity DSI funding 58 different actions (that INEA managed).  H2020, the other major EU programme for cooperative Research and Innovation partially  managed by INEA, has also provided supports to relevant cybersecurity research. H2020 funds  mainly three different types of mechanisms: Research and Innovation Actions (RIA) with EU  funding rate of 100% of the eligible project costs, Innovation Actions (RIA) with EU funding rate  of 70% of the eligible project costs (except non-profit, which are still funded 100%), and  Coordination and Support Actions (CSA). The European Commission maintains a H2020  dashboard, which prides an overview (by countries and beneficiaries) of the funded projects13.  Up to date, H2020 has supported over 24K grants, involved over 116K participants for a total  EU contributions exceeding €44 billion. Among the H2020 beneficiaries, over 23K SMEs have  participated in more than 10K grants receiving an EU contribution of over €7 billion. The  European Commission's proposal for Horizon Europe is an ambitious €100 billion research and  innovation programme to succeed Horizon 2020.  At the European Level, the European Commission has launched four different EU pilot projects  in order to prepare the European Cybersecurity Competence Network14. The Horizon 2020  (H2020), the EU Research and Innovation programme15, is funding the four pilot projects  addressing the overall objective of \"establishing and operating a pilot for a European  Cybersecurity Competence Network and developing a common European Cybersecurity  Research & Innovation Roadmap\". Which summarises key information of the four pilot projects:  CONCORDIA16, ECHO17, SPARTA18 and CyberSec4Europe19. These four EU pilot projects will  support strengthening the EU's cybersecurity capacity and address emerging cybersecurity  challenges for a safer European Digital Single Market20.

They will implement different activities (e.g. trainings,  cybersecurity demonstration cases and cyber ranges in different sectors such as eHealth,  finance, telecommunication, transportation, etc.) in order to address the cybersecurity-skill gab  in EU and to deliver innovative solutions preparing EU for future cross-sector and cross-border  cybersecurity challenges. These projects together with the European cybersecurity ecosystem  will work towards advancing cybersecurity research and innovation in Europe. The projects’  objectives are in alignment with the European Commission proposal for a European Regulation  establishing a European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence  Centre and a Network of National Cybersecurity Coordination Centres in 202121.  2.2 N  ATIONAL INITIATIVES  For the purposes of this study, a desktop research on 28 NCSS and a series of interviews with 14  responding MS have been carried out. In this subchapter, the analysis of those interviews and  NCSS highlight the strategic objectives that support innovation in cybersecurity across the Member  States. Those objectives are the following:  Organise cybersecurity exercises  In this objective, awareness in cybersecurity, skills development, collaboration and new ideas are  cultivated. All these could be a beginning for new products. Cybersecurity exercises are a great  way for people to test and enrich their skills and for companies to discover new talents.  Citizen's awareness  Informing and advising citizens regarding cybersecurity threats and incidents help them understand  the importance of cybersecurity in the everyday life. This helps in building a cybersecurity culture,  shaped according to the needs and priorities of each country. After all, human dynamics is one of  the key links of the cybersecurity chain.  Establish baseline security requirements  As internet is expanded far more than one country’s borders, cybersecurity threats concern  everyone. This is important for sectors and companies with different maturity levels to take specific  actions that will help them grow in parallel. Establishing baselines security requirements for their  information infrastructure is a first step in evolving and innovating.  Engage in international cooperation  This is a great way to collaborate, learn from each other, as well as adopt good practices.  Moreover, by organising international events, MS support internal companies to present and  promote their products, technologies and services.  Establish public-private partnerships  There is often a gap between public and private sector, making collaboration and trust difficult to be  achieved. Establishing public-private partnerships can help in bringing stakeholders together to  collaborate, understand the needs of the market and develop new products, technologies and  services.  Foster R&D  21 See: https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/proposal-regulation-establishing-european- cybersecurity-industrial-technology-and-research  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/proposal-regulation-establishing-european-cybersecurity-industrial-technology-and-research https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/proposal-regulation-establishing-european-cybersecurity-industrial-technology-and-research  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  15  As technology is growing faster and faster, research and development in cybersecurity needs to run  at the same speed or even foresee further developments. In this way technologies and people will  keep being secure and safe.  Provide incentives for the private sector to invest in security measures  One of the challenges the private sector usually faces is to choose between profit and investing in  cybersecurity, as both are important for a company’s continuity. Apart from this, companies’  security measures may also relate to their people, products or customers, so it is essential for MS  to provide incentives that could help the private sector in this dilemma. This will also help the  growth of the cybersecurity market and the adoption of new technologies, products or services.  Strengthen training and educational programmes  Universities, most of the times, is the first environment that future professionals meet. The more  trainings, conferences and workshops they organise, the more ready they will be to discuss,  brainstorm and come up with new ideas that might grow into innovative products, services and  technologies. Other initiatives such as private sector initiatives supported by the public sector  could offer training and educational programs and discover new talents, new ideas and potential  workforce for the cybersecurity domain.  In total 78.57% of the countries that participated in this study, organise cybersecurity exercises  and 92.86% establish baseline security requirements. 85.71% engage in international  cooperation and establish public-private partnerships. All participating countries confirmed that  they provide citizen’s awareness, foster R&D and strengthen training and educational programs  and 78.57% provide incentives for the private sector to invest in security measures.

National initiatives   Conducting a consultation on Cyber Science and Technology  Strategy  The analysis of the national initiatives highlights that MS are investing a substantial effort in  cybersecurity. The EU and national initiatives provide collectively a substantial investment in  cybersecurity. A strategic coordination of EU and NCSS would enhance the efficiency as well as  the potential contribution towards cybersecurity across the Union.  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  21  3. DIMENSIONS OF  INNOVATION  The analysis is structured around several aspects of innovation, which were identified by  analysing the NCSS across the EU. These aspects include: Innovation Priorities,  Industrialisation and Collaboration and Market and Policy. Each of these aspects is at the same  time divided into two dimensions. Innovation priorities can be divided into Innovation in  technologies and services, and into economic incentives and investments. Industrialisation and  collaboration can be divided into industrialisation processes and activities, and stakeholders’  collaboration. Market and Policy can be divided into Market and Technology Alignment and  Market regulation. Each dimension can be supported by several activities and mechanisms. In  order to define the different dimensions of innovation, this study took into account and analysed  the NCSS across EU Member States. The study also identifies the relevant mechanisms and  activities that support the implementation of innovation in cybersecurity as a strategic priority  under NCSS. It uses an integrated framework to analyse the different dimensions of innovation  and to identify specific elements contributing to them. Figure 4 shows the Dimensions of  Innovation in the context of NCSS.  Figure 4: Dimensions of Innovation in the context of National Cyber Security Strategies  The different dimensions are grouped on three different aspects: Innovation Priorities,  Industrialisation processes and collaboration, and Market and Policy. The dimensions include a  number of activities such as cooperation, awareness initiatives, research, etc.  ASPECTS  | DIMENSIONS  | ACTIVITIES  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  22  3.1 I  NNOVATION PRIORITIES  Innovation priorities refer to the objectives that are pursued by a given Member State in the area  of innovation. Innovation priorities can be divided in two categories: Innovation in technologies  and services, and economic incentives and investments.  Innovation in technologies and services refers to those priorities focussed on growing  existing technologies and organisations. It includes the following elements:   Cooperation: Supporting collaboration between public and private sectors in  enhancing cybersecurity and in dealing with emerging threats. For example, in the  French NCSS, this is described as the creation of an ‘environment of digital technology  businesses, industrial policy, export and internationalization’. In Ireland, this is  described as: ‘to build capacity across public administration and the private sector to  engage fully in the emergency management of cyber incidents’.   Awareness: Informing citizens, businesses and professionals and raising awareness  about the importance of cybersecurity and their abilities to deal with emerging cyber  threats. This topic has different considerations, but overall the majority of NCSS,  mention awareness raising and education activities.   Preparedness: Development of cybersecurity expertise and capabilities in order to  deal with emerging cyber threats. This is an element that some Member States identify  as an ongoing activity. For example, the Latvian NCSS states that it is possible to  protect against rapidly growing threats in cyber space only by constantly and  systematically developing and improving skills in the ICT sector and its security  specialization. Organising cybersecurity exercises are a way to increase MS  preparedness to respond to cyber threats   Expertise: Activities (including formal training programmes) contributing to  development of skills and expertise in cybersecurity. This priority is not found in the  NCSS of a lot of Member States. As an example, the Netherlands has a long-term  knowledge development program under which the academic community develops and  improves high-quality knowledge in the area of cybersecurity.   Research: Activities supporting the development of new products, services and  processes enhancing cybersecurity. Also, research is presented under different terms  in the NCSS. These terms include ‘research and development’, ‘stimulation of  technology development’, or ‘capability development’. An example of this category  from the Member States comes from the Czech Republic: ‘the Czech Republic shall  strive to ensure maximum cyberspace security. In parallel, it shall support high  technological production, research, development, and implementation. Thereby  contributing to the technological advancement of the country.  Economic incentives and investments refer to the relevant funding mechanisms that support  innovation in cybersecurity. Such mechanisms include access to capital, sector specific  investments, venture capitals, tax incentives, legal frameworks and insurance that might have  an impact on the effective adoption of cybersecurity technologies and services. NCSS define  funding mechanisms as research grants supporting studies and projects concerned with specific  innovation areas. Such funding mechanisms provide alternative opportunities, which may  complement EU research and innovation programmes. Funding mechanisms may also involve  public-private partnerships for strategic areas of innovation.  3.2 I  NDUSTRIALISATION AND COLLABORATION  Industrialisation and collaboration refers to the challenge of transitioning from research to  practice – with emphasis on stakeholder collaboration and industrialisation processes and  activities. To support such priorities, MS have identified different mechanisms or activities.  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  23  Although MS may implement such processes and activities differently, it is possible to cluster  them according to the two specific above mentioned categories  Industrialisation Processes and Activities refers to those processes and activities supporting  the integration of new cybersecurity technologies, products and services into the market. It  covers five priorities:   Innovative Organisations: Establishing organisations and formally mandating them  with industrialisation processes and activities. For example, following its NCSS, Spain  has as an objective to ‘develop a Framework for Cybersecurity Knowledge and Extend  and broaden talent recruitment, advanced research and training programmes in  cybersecurity in cooperation with Universities and specialised centres’. In  Hungary, its  NCSS states that ‘Hungary strives for strategic cooperation with universities and  scientific research centres, which have achieved outstanding and internationally  recognised results in cybersecurity research and development to help  establish  cybersecurity centres of excellence’.   Awareness Initiatives: Activities oriented towards informing citizens of emerging  threats and possible cybersecurity solutions. The Spanish NCSS mentions that it will  ‘raise the awareness of citizens, professionals and companies about the importance of  cybersecurity and the responsible use of new technologies and the services of the  Information Society’.   Professional Training: Activities oriented towards providing formal training to  professionals. In Croatia there is a push for the ‘development of human resources in  the area of communication and information technology security’.   Academic Training: Activities oriented towards providing formal academic training  either at schools or at the universities. Hungary pays particular attention to integrating  cybersecurity as a field in the information technology syllabus of primary, secondary  and higher education, in training courses for government officials and in professional  training courses.   Internationalisation: Activities supporting national stakeholders in international  activities in order to facilitate commercial opportunities. France supports export and  internationalisation of the businesses in the [cybersecurity] sector.  Stakeholder Collaboration refers to those initiatives and mechanisms supporting  stakeholder collaboration fostering industrialisation. The priority under this category is R&D,  which refers to activities oriented to the research and development of new products,  services and processes to enhance cybersecurity. Research can take many forms,  although overall, research is conducted with a combination of national and European funds.  This is the case of Austria, which mentions in its NCSS that ‘to strengthen Austria’s  research in the area of cybersecurity through national and EU security research  programmes. E.g. National Research Development Programme KIRAS Austria’.  3.3 M  ARKET AND POLICY  From governance perspective, the analysis investigated occurrences of mechanisms or  activities intended for shaping the cybersecurity market. In this section, two categories have  been identified: Market and Technology Alignment and Market regulation.  Market and Technology Alignment refers to the alignment between cybersecurity market and  innovative technologies, products and services. It covers:   Procurements: Adoption of technologies, products and services in order to support  National/EU industry. France is a big proponent of this priority by supporting public  procurement, the State will develop a favourable environment for French companies in  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  24  the digital sector offering secure products and services22. . The country is developing  and accentuating a national offer of cybersecurity products and services to create  competitiveness for national businesses. The State will develop a favourable  environment for French companies in the digital sector offering secure products and  services by supporting investment, innovation and exports. Moreover, France is  integrating cybersecurity requirements in public contracting. Croatia follows a similar  approach, stating in its NCSS that the country will aim at ‘Presenting and promoting the  solutions developed in Croatia for cybersecurity on the global market’. Poland also  develops industrial and technological resources for promoting cybersecurity.   Public and Private Partnerships (PPPs): Creation of PPPs focused on cybersecurity.  A PPPs is a cooperative arrangement between two or more public and private sectors,  typically of a long-term nature. They were primarily used for infrastructure provision,  such as the building and equipping of schools, hospitals, transport systems, water and  sewerage systems. Less than half of the Member States have created PPPs focusing  on cybersecurity. An example of a PPP is that of the Austrian Cyber Security Platform,  launched by the Federal Chancellery in 2015. It is Austria's central platform for  cooperation between the private and public sectors in matters of cybersecurity and the  protection of critical infrastructures.  Market regulations refers to relevant policy initiatives shaping the national or the European  internal market. The priorities under this category include:   Good Practices: good practices are activities that have shown to work well by proving  to succeed in achieving objectives and could be recommended as a model. They are  activities oriented towards providing guidance to the different stakeholders.   Legislative Initiatives: Activities oriented towards the establishment and maintenance  of legal frameworks. In this regard, some Member States pledge in their NCSS to keep  the legislative environment friendly to innovation in cybersecurity. For example, Spain  wants to ‘incorporate into the Spanish legal framework solutions to problems that arise  in connection with cybersecurity in order to establish types of criminal offences and the  work of the departments with responsibilities in this area’23. Greece has a similar  approach, stating in its NCSS that it aims at ‘recording and improving the existing  institutional framework’24.  All the above are the main dimensions of innovation (i.e. Innovation Priorities, Industrialisation  and Collaboration, and Market and Policy) and their underpinning mechanisms in the context of  NCSS.  3.4 N  CSS STAKEHOLDERS  The analysis of the NCSS across Member States has identified the main stakeholders, who are  involved in the implementation of cybersecurity strategies. The national strategies define  relevant measures and mechanisms for the different stakeholders. Figure 5 shows the four main  groups of stakeholders in the context of the NCSS: Governments, citizens and industries,  service providers and research institutions.  22 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss- map/France_Cyber_Security_Strategy.pdf  23 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/strategies/the-national- security-strategy  24 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/strategies/national- cyber-security-strategy-greece/view  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/France_Cyber_Security_Strategy.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/France_Cyber_Security_Strategy.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/strategies/the-national-security-strategy https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/strategies/the-national-security-strategy https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/strategies/national-cyber-security-strategy-greece/view https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/strategies/national-cyber-security-strategy-greece/view  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  25  Figure 5: Identified stakeholders in the context of NCSS  Governments refer to institutions that belong to the public sector. In particular, it refers to  governmental bodies such as ministries, military, police and institutions that compose the public  sector and as identified in the NIS Directive such as: Single Point of Contacts (SPOCs),  Computer Security Response Teams (CSIRTs) and Competent Authorities (CAs). Governments  are the main stakeholder in charge of innovation under the NCSS, having both a  leading/managerial role and an executive role. An example of governmental institutions refers to  the Ministries of Interior for some Member States.  Service providers refer mainly to the Operators of Essential Services (OESs) and to the Digital  Service Providers (DSPs), two stakeholders identified in the NIS Directive. Operators of  essential services are private businesses or public entities with an important role to provide  security in healthcare, transport, energy, banking and financial market infrastructure, digital  infrastructure and water supply. Under the NIS Directive, identified operators of essential  services will have to take appropriate security measures and to notify serious cyber incidents to  the relevant national authority. DSPs refer to all entities meeting the definitions of online  marketplaces, Cloud computing services and Search engines as presented in the NIS Directive.  This category is provided because it is expected that, in order to comply with the NIS Directive,  the stakeholders covered by the NIS Directive will be interested in innovative cybersecurity  technologies, products and services.  Citizens and Industries refer to all relevant stakeholders, who may benefit directly and indirectly  from NCSS. Strengthening cybersecurity as a whole as well as across all range ICT products,  services and processes will have a positive impact for citizens, who are often the end users and  principal beneficiaries. Industries form a complex ecosystem of stakeholders, who may depend  on other stakeholders such as governments, service providers (both OES and DSPs) and  research institutions too. Among such stakeholders are also industry associations across  sectors (e.g. manufacturing, machinery, etc.), which are becoming more and more dependent  on ICT products, services and processes. These industries may often benefit from various  initiatives under NCSS, including cyber awareness programmes and tailored cybersecurity  solutions for their sectors. Besides such industry stakeholders are also vendors, which provides  relevant cybersecurity solutions into the market. Due to the diversity of solutions, the resulting  A governmental body that has an executive role is the State School for Public Administration of  Croatia. This body provides training to Croatian public servants and plays a key role in ensuring  that cybersecurity innovation happens in the public sector.  The French General Commission for Investment, following the guidance of the French  Government allocates through public procurement public funds for promoting innovation of in the  cybersecurity sector.  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  26  cybersecurity market is highly fragmented. Furthermore, there are also public and private  stakeholders who are investing in cybersecurity with limited coordination with NCSS.  Research institutions refer to public and private academia and research organisations. Contrary  to what could be expected, this category is not mainly composed by universities. This seems to  suggest that there is a gap between universities and the NCSS. Instead, specific research  centres compose mainly this category. These centres can take many forms.  Technology Ireland ICT Skillnet is a network of companies who collaborate to address skills  needs within the technological sector. The network is a non-profit body which is co-funded by  Skillnet Ireland, the national agency for workforce development learning, and member companies.  Skillnet Ireland is funded from the National Training Fund through the Department of Education  and Skills. Another example of these institutions is the Fraunhofer Society, a German research  organization with 72 institutes spread throughout Germany, each focusing on different fields of  applied science. Fraunhofer is Europe’s largest application-oriented research organization.  Around 70 percent of Fraunhofer’s contract research revenue is derived from contracts with  industry and from publicly financed research projects. Citizens and Industries refer to the broader  private sector, including any institution that is not a part of the other categories. So far, no relevant  institutions have been identified for this category.  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  27  4. KEY FINDINGS  4.1 I  NNOVATION IN TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES  In order to identify the main priorities in innovation, the analysis investigates the following  questions:  Q1: Is innovation among the top priorities of the NCSS?  Q2: Are there policy related priorities that support innovation?  Q3: Are the mechanisms for collecting feedback from private sector regarding their access  to new cybersecurity technologies and services?  Q4: Are there challenges affecting objectives and priorities in cybersecurity innovation?  The interviews and surveys with experts highlight the different approaches that Member States  are following in order to support innovation in the context of the National Cyber Security  Strategies.  In some cases, Member States create relevant institutions or networks of stakeholders giving  them a mandate for specific aspects of innovation.  Other initiatives support innovation in cybersecurity and especially the creation of new  enterprises and new capabilities at national level.  These are just few examples that highlight how Member States develop and prioritise innovation  strategies.  Innovation is  among the  strategic  priorities of  National  cybersecurity  strategies in  the EU  In Portugal, innovation was among the top priorities in the previous NCSS of 2015. It is also  among the top priorities in the new strategy (published in the Official Journal in the 5th of June of  2019). Besides the vision defined in the new NCSS, one of the three established strategic  objectives is to “promote innovation”. There is also a specific axis of intervention: “Research,  Development and Innovation”. The specific activities planned in the next 5 years are yet  unpublished. 120 days after publication, the government will define a specific action plan to  operationalise these activities (with specified timeline, owners, etc.).  In Ireland, the Department of Communications and the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)  have a mandate for leading the NCSS work and defining relevant innovation strategies in  cybersecurity. However, innovation strategies often involve different stakeholders. The Industrial  Development Authority (IDA) has created the Cybersecurity Cluster called Cyber Ireland. In some  cases, such initiatives involve collaboration between the public and private sectors like a Public-  Private Partnership (PPP). In Spain, the Spanish National Cybersecurity Institute (INCIBE), is  involved in the development of such PPPs and other partnerships with other governmental  agencies.  Belgium is evaluating the creation of a “greenhouse” in order to support innovation in cybersecurity  and to assess new business models and solutions. Similarly in UK, the “Cyber Growth Partnership”  (CGP) is a Public-Private Partnership involving representatives from academia, industry and  government. Among the strategic objectives of this PPP is to enhance innovation within the  cybersecurity sector.  In Portugal, there is a national integrated initiative aimed at enhancing digital competences:  “InCoDe 2030”. The objective of the initiative is to develop digital skills, focussing on the  opportunities of adopting fast-paced technology. It goes in parallel to the content of the NCSS.  Innovation is also a relevant priority in the Portuguese Digital Agenda.  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  28  Figure 6 provides an overview of how experts responded to these questions. The experts’  opinions highlight that innovation is among the priorities of NCSS (Q1) and other policy related  priorities (Q2). However, there are different accounts of innovation across the NCSS across  Member States. In defining their innovation strategic priorities under NCSS, most Member  States have mechanisms for consulting stakeholders’ opinions and gathering their feedback  regarding their positions in order to access new cybersecurity technologies, products and  services (Q3).  This is useful in order to facilitate the development of innovation in the industry.  In addition,  there is a complete agreement that many challenges exist affecting innovation in cybersecurity  (Q4).  Figure 6: Innovation in technologies and services  In Luxembourg, there are multiple ways this feedback is organised:  -  Direct feedback for operators of critical infrastructures and operators of essential  services. These companies are in relation with regulators and have to provide  information about their cybersecurity capabilities. Either via providing policies, or  risk assessments.  -  Indirect feedback for other companies by the governmental cooperation with the cyber  insurance industry. The government closely collaborates with cyber insurance  companies, as they become informal regulators for non-regulated SME, which  represent a large part of the economy. The collaboration with cyber insurance is  linked to the informed governance projects, which provides risk scenarios as well as  metrics. The cyber insurance sector gives anonymous feedback to the government  about the maturity of the insured companies. The cyber insurance industry also  invests in the cybersecurity ecosystem and promotes private incident response  capabilities and research.  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  29  Table 2 highlights that the mean ranking25 has been given to critical factors such as lack of  funding and misalignment between innovation and market are higher than the median values  given to the other factors. Experts may have different views on the matter. Despite the  observation that “lack of expertise” affects developments of competitive business models for  new technologies and services, experts highlighted “lack of funding” and “misalignment between  innovation and market” as the most critical factors (Table 2). Whereas, they recognise the lack  of expertise as critical as market fragmentation and scale. One challenge is the so-called ‘Time  to Market’ challenge in Germany. This challenge is related to the process of certifying products  and services, which is very time consuming. This can often lead to the fact that when the  product arrives to the market, it is already outdated. Experts have also identified other  challenges. For instance, it is often difficult for governments to understand the needs of the  industry, as well as to develop expertise in dealing with PPPs. Often cybersecurity is addressed  within other topics. Among other factors, compliance with relevant regulatory frameworks may  according to some experts inhibit innovation. This is because lack of compliance is a business  risk, which some organisations (in particular SMEs) may perceive as a barrier to innovation. For  innovative companies such as start-ups it is very difficult to provide services or products to  regulated public and private sectors. The European market remains somehow difficult and  challenging for such innovative companies, which may try to develop their business outside  Europe. Other organisations, such as universities and research centres, may have access to  research funding. However, they usually have limited availabilities and capabilities (e.g. in terms  of data for testing innovative solutions) for bringing their research results to the market.  Table 2: Factors affecting developments of competitive business models  Critical factors  Mean ranking  (1 most important – 5 least important)  Lack of funding 2  Misalignment between innovation and market 2  Lack of expertise 3  Market fragmentation 3  Scale of market 3  Therefore, despite innovation is among the strategic priorities in NCSS, lack of funding and  misalignment between innovation and market represent important barriers for achieving  associated strategic objectives.  4.2 E  CONOMIC INCENTIVES AND INVESTMENTS  To identify the main economic mechanisms supporting innovation, the analysis investigates the  following questions:  Q6. Is there any access to capital to support innovation in cybersecurity technologies and  services?  Q7. Are there sector specific economic incentives and investments supporting innovation in  cybersecurity technologies and services?  Q8. Does the public sector support large enterprises to play a technical and economic role  in delivering new cybersecurity technology and service ventures in the marketplace?  25 The mean ranking is the weighted average of all interviewees feedback for each standard factor without  taking into consideration other custom provided factors. Other factors are documented in the text but  cannot participate in the total scoring.  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  30  Q9. Do factors such as, legal frameworks, insurance and taxation have an impact on the  effective adoption of new cybersecurity technologies and services?  Interviews with experts and surveys highlighted an irregular situation regarding funding and  innovation priorities. Member States have dedicated funding mechanisms and initiatives, which  however are often focusing on different research and innovative objectives rather than being  specific on cybersecurity.  However, eligibility criteria might limit access to public funding. Most funding mechanisms and  incentives support SMEs. Large enterprises in the private sector often rely on their own  investments. There are differences among regional, national and European funding initiatives.  Lack of coordination creates a fragmented set of funding mechanisms, which organisations may  perceive as lack of funding or strong competition. Some Member States have established and  funded institutions for managing and running innovative programmes.  Figure 7 provides an overview how experts responded to the above questions regarding funding  accessibility. The ability to access funding supporting innovation (even targeting specific  sectors) is somehow in contradiction with the perception that lack of funding is a challenge  affecting innovation. This is to a certain extent due to the misalignment between funding  available for specific innovation objectives and market opportunities.  It emerges that different types of mechanisms (e.g. legal frameworks, insurance mechanisms,  and taxation regimes) may have an impact on innovation and adoption of new technologies and  services.  In Sweden, the Swedish Innovation Agency currently allocates 200 Million Swedish Crowns for  innovation on digital security during a three year period 2018-2020. There is also a private  foundation, the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (https://strategiska.se/en/about-ssf/  ). The foundation was created by the government in 1994 and was given 6 billion SEK to  administrate. It is independent and estimates that will be able to carry out its mission until 2025.  It has recently allocated 300 Million Swedish Crowns  (https://strategiska.se/en/research/ongoing-research/cyber-security-2017/) for cybersecurity  research.  The UK Catapult centres, are networks of world-leading centres designed to transform the UK’s  capability for innovation in specific areas and to help drive future economic growth.  CyberSecIdent in Poland is a research and development program aimed at increasing the  security of cyberspace of the Republic of Poland by increasing the availability of hardware and  programming solutions.  In Italy, some security incentives for enterprise digitalization and Nuova Sabatini supporting  investments in big data, robotics, industry 4.0, cybersecurity. It is however questionable to what  extent the public sector and its relevant initiatives recognise the role of large enterprise in  supporting innovation.  In Luxembourg, the cybersecurity competence centre C3 (www.c-3.lu) identifies needs in  cybersecurity services and tries to create public private collaboration with the private sector to  create these services. The C3 operates on three main pillars: OBSERVE (threat intel, situational  awareness), TRAINING (providing innovation training), TEST (testing of start-up technology in  order to promote their services within larger companies). The government also enters into  strategic partnerships with large enterprises (e.g. Cisco), for example via memoranda of  understanding, seeking to address particular needs of the digital ecosystem, one of which is  cybersecurity.  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  31  Figure 7: Economic incentives and investments  4.3 I  NDUSTRIALISATION PROCESSES AND ACTIVITIES  To identify the main activities supporting industrialisation processes and activities, the analysis  investigates the following questions:  Q10. Is there any support for effective marketing expertise, particularly in the context of  cybersecurity and privacy?  Q11. Are there challenges effecting industrialisation processes and activities in  cybersecurity?  Q12. Are Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) preventing the exploration of the full range of  commercial options for new technologies and services in cybersecurity?  Figure 8 provides an overview how experts responded to these questions. Despite the support  to marketing initiatives (e.g. promotion of adoption of technologies and services by the public  sector and promotion of them alongside Member States’ initiatives in international events), there  are different challenges affecting the commercialisation of new cybersecurity technologies and  services. Experts do not identify that Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) prevent industrialisation  processes and activities (Q12). Most Member States support companies in positioning  themselves internally. They may organise dedicated networking events or support them in  establishing international relationships. However, there are various challenges affecting the  commercialisation of innovative solutions in cybersecurity. Among the reported challenges are  lengthily procurement processes. Thus, preventing in particular SMEs and innovative  companies such as start-ups to offer their services to the public sectors.  In Austria, the public sector relies on procurements. However, the government provides test beds  and (financially) supports SMEs in order to present their products and services to foreign  customers and investors. The government (and its initiatives including, for example, financial  supports covering travel costs for networking alongside government’s representatives) creates a  platform for enhancing the visibility of services and products. The focus is on the internal market  as well as on the international one.  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  32  Furthermore, local market characteristics such as fragmentation and composition (e.g. small  market with many SMEs) may affect industrialisation of new services and products.  Figure 8: Industrialisation processes and activities  Table 3 provides further insights regarding factors affecting industrialisation of new  technologies, products and services. Unsurprisingly, understating of technologies, products and  services together with understanding buyers’ needs are among the most important factors for  industrialisation. Interestingly, experts recognise such factors to be as important as compliance  with regulatory requirements. They recognise that understanding of business models and  understanding of alternative propositions are less important than the other factors of  industrialisation.  Table 3: Factors clarifying the value propositions of new technologies, products and services  Critical factors  Mean ranking  (1 most important – 5 least important)  Understanding of technologies and services 2  Understanding of buyers’ needs 2  Compliance with regulatory requirements 2  Clear business models 4  Understanding of alternative propositions 5  Therefore, industrialisation initiatives should focus of clarifying technologies and services, as  well as needs of potential buyers. Furthermore, compliance with regulatory requirements (e.g.  compliance with relevant security and data protection requirements drawn from relevant  regulatory frameworks) is an important aspect of technologies and services for positioning them  into the market.  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  33  4.4 S  TAKEHOLDER COLLABORATION  In order to assess the role of stakeholder collaboration in innovation activities, the analysis  investigates the following questions:  Q14. Is there any support for geographical proximity by bringing together innovation  stakeholders (e.g. universities, campuses clusters, start-ups, etc.)?  Q15. Are there any sector specific initiatives that support collaboration and fostering of  innovative products and services?  Figure 9 provides an overview how experts responded to these questions. They identify that  geographical clusters and collaborations are important mechanisms that support innovation.  However, collaboration mechanisms may support innovation differently.  Figure 9: Stakeholder collaboration  Table 4 highlights how experts recognise different collaboration mechanisms. Experts identify  that the involvement of industry in research and innovation is the most important factor affecting  industrialisation.  There are several initiatives bringing people together in Brussels, e.g. the Brussels Initiative on  Cybersecurity and Innovation. Also, everything in Brussels is geographically close enough, which  helps in bringing people together.  In Germany, the BSI takes part and/or organises sector-specific working groups for cybersecurity  products and services with industry and/or research institutes (e.g. Frauenhofer Gesellschaft) on  encryption, Artificial Intelligence and others. There are also regional initiatives for fostering  collaboration: competence centres in certain regions dealing with different topics, such as  cybersecurity research, military purposes, or universities.

Other  important mechanisms for industrialisation are industry secondments, involvement of the  industry in education and Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs).  4.5 M  ARKET AND TECHNOLOGY ALIGNMENT  To assess the role of market and technology alignment in innovation, the analysis investigates  the following questions:  Q17. Are there any barriers and challenges for creating alignments between markets and  technologies/services?  Q18. Are publicly funded research and innovation effectively addressing current and future  capability gaps of private and public services?  Q19. Are there any initiatives to build national talent base in cybersecurity research and  innovation in order to produce game-changing technologies and services addressing  current and future threats?  Figure 10 provides an overview how experts responded to these questions.  The Estonian Information Security Association (EISA) was founded to boost cross-sectorial  cooperation in Estonia between academia and private sector as well as with the government,  including supporting the EU’s contractual Public Private Partnership (cPPP) model on  cybersecurity. The joint effort intends to formalise existing ties and enhance R&D activities in the  information security and cybersecurity field in Estonia.  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  35  Figure 10: Market and Technology Alignment  Experts recognise that research and innovation initiatives are addressing future needs.  Furthermore, Member States are taking various initiatives in order to support talent in  cybersecurity research and innovation.  However, experts recognise also the existence of barriers and challenges for supporting  alignments of technologies and services with markets. Interviews with experts and surveys  highlight that normal market dynamics create opportunities for bringing innovation in operations.  In addition, there are differences across sectors. For example, the public sector depends on  procurements, which require companies offering their services and products to follow necessary  procedures and to comply with relevant requirements. Other sectors (e.g. cyber defence, critical  infrastructures, etc.) may have additional market constraints due to the criticality of services  offered at national level.  4.6 M  ARKET REGULATIONS  To assess the role of market regulations in innovation, the analysis investigates the following  questions:  Q20. Do government’s incentives accelerate the adoption of new technology in  cybersecurity and privacy?  In Austria, the Ministry of Defence organises specific initiatives (e.g. Hackathons) supporting  talent building and widening their recruiting strategies (e.g. internship opportunities for six  months).  In Belgium, which is a small country, regional governments seek to invest where they can make  a difference. They do not have the scale or budgets of international leaders, but they do have  excellent research in relevant domains, such as AI, on which they thus seek to focus investment.  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  36  Q21. Are there sector specific incentives to help in the adoption of new cybersecurity  technologies/services?  Figure 11 provides an overview how experts responded to these questions. It appears that  governments’ incentives have a positive impact in accelerating the adoptions of new  technologies, products and services.  However, there are factors that may constrain markets and the adoption of new technologies,  products and services.  Figure 11: Market regulations  Table 5 highlights how experts perceive critical factors on policies and legislative frameworks that  may stimulate innovation in cybersecurity. Regulatory stability and predictability as well as neutral  technological regulation are important factors to support innovation. Similarly, experts recognise  stakeholder involvement equally important. They recognise principle-based regulations and  In Germany, there are different relevant national strategies supporting various objectives. Such  strategies cover different topics and address different objectives: from applied cybersecurity to  cybersecurity research. Talking specifically about the NCSS, it covers four (4) areas:  1) Secure and autonomous acting in a digital environment  2) Joint mission of State and Economy  3) Efficient and sustainable cybersecurity architecture  4) Active positioning of Germany in European and international cybersecurity.  Within the activities concerned with ‘Secure and autonomous acting in a digital environment’,  there are different measures including strengthening IT security research and innovation. The  Ministry of Research and Innovation, in relation to the later, is providing direct funding through  a programme called ‘Being autonomous and secure in a digital world’ (EUR 180 million ).  Moreover, BSI develops technical guidelines, which promote adequate cybersecurity standards  in IT systems of different sectors/areas.  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  37  performance evaluations to be less critical than other factors. Experts perceive differently the  impact of regulatory frameworks and initiatives. On one hand, they highlight that most regulatory  frameworks and initiatives focus on compliance (rather than security). Such frameworks and  initiatives may prevent the adoption of innovative solutions and services that innovative companies  such as start-ups provide. On the other hand, regulatory frameworks and initiatives may drive  innovation. Companies invest in compliance projects (e.g. compliance with GDPR) and  cybersecurity capabilities (e.g. cybersecurity capabilities in alignment with security requirements  and incident notification) in order to align with relevant regulatory frameworks.

SWOT ANALYSIS  This section discusses strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats that influence the  successful implementation of innovation priorities in the Member States. It also provides a  strategic forward looking perspective, which provides insights for further developments of  National Cyber Security Strategies. Figure 12 summarises the SWOT analysis of this chapter.  Figure 12: SWOT that influence innovation priorities under NCSS  5.1 S  TRENGTHS  Stakeholder consultations for identifying and defining innovation strategies. The  interviews with experts highlighted that some Member States may have both formal and  informal means of engaging with and collecting feedback from innovation stakeholders. In  particular, industry involvement provide insights in defining innovation strategies. Member  States shall consider establishing and consolidating stakeholder involvements while identifying  and specifying national cybersecurity innovation strategies.  Positive impact of regulatory frameworks on innovation. The experts highlighted how  regulatory frameworks such as the NIS Directive and the GDPR accelerated and incentivised  innovation in relevant areas of security and data protection. On the one hand, regulatory  frameworks define governance regimes for new technologies and services. On the other hand,  they may incentivised and accelerate innovation in the specific areas of interventions.  Compliance with regulatory requirements. Experts recognise that compliance with regulatory  requirements is an important factor for commercialising and positioning cybersecurity services  and technologies in the market. This is also in alignment with the EU Cybersecurity Act, which  NIS Directive  and the GDPR  accelerated and  incentivised  innovation in  relevant areas  of security and  data protection  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  39  requires the development of a European Cybersecurity Certification Framework for ICT  products, services and processes.  Involvement of industry in Research and Innovation. An important mechanism for  supporting industrialisation is to involve directly industry in research and innovation activities.  This helps research stakeholders (e.g. universities, research centres, etc.) to align with industry  needs as well as industry stakeholders to identify opportunities for adopting or commercialising  research outcomes.  Developing skills for future needs. Among the various innovation strategies, it was possible  to identify different initiatives supporting development of cybersecurity skills. It is important to  extend such initiatives in order to develop the necessary skills for emerging cybersecurity  technologies and services.  5.2 W  EAKNESSES  Misalignment between funding and innovation priorities. Among the identified challenges  are lack of funding and misalignment between innovation and market. This is to a certain extent  due to the fact that there is a lack of direct funding supporting innovation strategies. This may  result in disconnects between national strategies and availabilities of funding for achieving and  supporting the implementation of strategic objectives related to innovation under national  cybersecurity strategies.  Lack of sectorial approach to innovation. Often the lack of funding in cybersecurity is due to  limited opportunities supporting innovation across different sectors. Although cybersecurity is a  critical factor, funding opportunities are often within generic topics (e.g. Artificial Intelligence,  Automotive, Manufacturing, Industry 4.0, etc.).  Furthermore, there is a lack of funding  addressing cybersecurity across sectors without giving any priorities to critical sectors (for  instance, the sectors of Operators of Essential Services that the NIS Directive identifies). More  R&D financing of EU technical innovation is needed as well as funding of NIS projects in the  critical sectors, which could use EU NIS products and services. Investing in R&D is expensive  for small EU specialist NIS vendors, and participating in EU programmes is difficult. Switching to  regional and national levels would need coordination.  Limited opportunities and incentives for innovation of large enterprises. There are various  mechanisms at the European and national level supporting innovation for SMEs as well as  emerging innovative entrepreneurships such as start-ups. Unfortunately, there are limited  opportunities and incentives for innovation of large enterprises. Besides some Public-Private  Partnerships (PPPs), large enterprises have to face most of the cost and investment in  innovation. However, they may have a critical role in order to accelerate innovation as well as to  provide access to markets for innovation at scale. Unfortunately, there is a lack of initiatives and  incentives in order to support innovation collaboration between SMEs and large enterprises,  besides normal market dynamics.  Fragmented market in the EU. Suppliers need to be able to cope with a fragmented EU  market often divided by language and culture. NIS often requires a specific relationship of trust  so customers may mandate that the vendor speak the same language to build this and then  conserve it in a long-term relationship. It should result in a transfer from transactional selling to a  service-based relationship of repeated sales. Marketing strategies may support companies in  promoting their services to potential buyers, in particular, internationally. Procurement to the  public sector may help companies in promoting themselves in the market.  Lack in defining sector specific incentives. Despite the positive impact of regulatory  frameworks on innovation, there is still a lack of incentives and regulatory frameworks targeting  specific sector interventions. Organisations have to deal with different frameworks, not  necessary tailored to their market needs and specificities.  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  40  Lack of training in cybersecurity skills and qualified personnel stretches back through to  university education in cybersecurity and even further into the introduction of computing and  coding, at the level of secondary schools. This impacts awareness in general and is causing a  shortage of staff with the qualifications and experience the NIS industry sorely needs.  5.3 O  PPORTUNITIES  Innovation priorities in NCSS and policy related priorities: it is necessary to understand the  relationships between innovation priorities in NCSS and other policy related priorities. In  particular, policy related initiatives should follow and support innovation priorities in NCSS. As a  marketing tool to promote EU NIS companies within the EU and internationally, technical  standards for NIS products and services should be used, such as the Federal Office for  Information Security in Germany, BSI, for ICT approvals but at EU level. An EU-wide security  label would support European sales. Harmonised qualifications should be created through local  national standards but not as a centralised approach as the EU MS require sovereignty  over NIS matters. Moreover, such standards should be promoted overseas, so EU NIS  providers gain global recognition, which is especially significant in the developing world. The  standards setting and approvals initiative and its international promotion could be part of  ENISA’s responsibilities  Innovation priorities in NCSS and incentives for the adoption of new technologies and  services: it is necessary to align innovation priorities in NCSS with relevant incentives for the  adoption of new technology. There are a number of European institutions and programs  supporting NIS development26 27, etc with the main goal to ensure cyber protection for all:  citizens, companies (including SMEs) and public administration by supporting the development  of an EU cybersecurity industry  Economic incentives and investments for the adoption of new technologies and  services: economic incentives may accelerate the adoption of new technologies, products and  services. Increased availability of national or regional funds and tax incentives. For example,  start-ups can benefit from a cut on R&D costs, on social charges and on corporate taxes.  Investors who invest in start-ups and innovation can also benefit from cuts in charges which can  lead to turning the investment riskless, as the funds invested would have been otherwise spent  in paying taxes28.  Addressing factors affecting the adoption of new technologies and services, and talent  initiatives: it is necessary to address factors affecting the adoption of new technologies and  services as well as take into account relevant talent initiatives. Through early school education  in secure software development plus development of new professional qualifications at degree  and post graduate levels, create a stronger EU-based NIS industry with large numbers of  qualified personnel for three areas requiring stronger NIS skills:   CSIRT teams to work in SOCs   Product development – both NIS and generally, especially for infrastructure   Programming of all types – bespoke, embedded, product packages for the  commercial market  Promoting geographical clusters and initiatives for collaboration: geographical clusters  support collaboration initiatives. Leveraging existing European clusters specialized in  cybersecurity will help to develop business in close proximity with other start-ups,  incubators/accelerators, universities and big corporations.  26 https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/h2020-sections  27 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/policies/start-up-europe  28 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/challenges-and-opportunities-for-eu-cybersecurity-start-ups  https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/h2020-sections https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/policies/start-up-europe https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/challenges-and-opportunities-for-eu-cybersecurity-start-ups  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  41  Security by default, within the Cybersecurity Act will allow new NIS products and  services to become more affordable and attractive to use, as they will be configured by  default with the most secure setting possible. Security by default will not require specific  technical knowledge and understanding of consumers.  5.4 T  HREATS  Lack of awareness of users of the level of threats to business is a common theme across the  EU Member States. This lack of awareness is greatest in the EU’s SME segment, where  governments need to provide more support. Business and the public sector are not being  sufficiently educated on the need for security. Major fraud activities touch every level of the  population every day, but continued low levels of sales of NIS services and products threaten  the EU economy.  In terms of the global market, the key threat to EU is that better funded overseas NIS  players succeed in entirely dominating the EU market. They could exploit the EU’s  fragmentation by acquiring the best local companies in each Member State, then expanding  sales as a common brand across the EU, with major inward investment underpinned by their  home markets’ revenues (in the USA and China).  Similarly, it is conceivable that intellectual property funded and developed in the EU could  be bought and exploited by overseas NIS suppliers, from China and the USA, so that EU  investments in R&D may be lost to the EU. In this regard, promising EU suppliers may have little  alternative because of the limited EU investment available to enable them to develop the more  advanced tools required and bring them to market. Not only is EU funding for R&D and  industrialisation too limited, given the scale of AI and large-scale data analytics required, but it is  spread too thinly, making the creation of a major EU player less likely. Moreover, EU and  national funding may be too burdensome to access in terms of costs and bureaucracy for start-  ups and SMEs. Thus, any promising innovative or existing EU NIS supplier is often acquired by  a global player, especially if major equity holders are anxious to realise their investments.  The shortfall in the cybersecurity workforce remains a critical vulnerability for the industry.  Conventional education and training policies cannot meet demand. The lack of trained  personnel exacerbates an already difficult task of managing cybersecurity risks. Professional  certification in NIS is essential to increase the qualified workforce.  Sometime in the next decade, new computing technology could endanger some current  encryption technologies. That would open more customer databases to attack for data theft.  Confidence in online commerce, and in any business that stores customer or confidential data,  could be compromised. Countering this will require further R&D investments in cryptography for  new algorithms.  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  42  6. RECOMMENDATIONS  The analyses of National Cyber Security Strategies across Member States provide an overview  of innovation challenges and good practices. Based on the results of this study, which also  involved experts providing further insights and examples of innovation practices, this report  draws some recommendations for enhancing innovation in cybersecurity. Stakeholders who are  involved in developing and implementing NCSS, EU policy makers, National policy makers may  take into account the results of this study, in particular, the identified challenges, good practices  and suggested recommendations:  Support and develop sector specific innovation priorities both at National and EU level –  Current level of funding is often perceived insufficient or misaligned with industry needs and  expectations. This is also due to a certain extent to the fragmentation of funding mechanisms as  well as to the lack of coordination between alternative funding mechanisms at regional, national  or European level. In order to address the lack of funding as well as the misalignment between  innovation strategies and industry needs, it is necessary to support an adequate level of funding  for innovation priorities and to support coordination among alternative funding mechanisms.  Moreover, most innovation priorities and funding mechanisms support general cybersecurity  objectives (including development of new products, services and processes) or other generic  objectives for which cybersecurity is only a part of them. Therefore, it is necessary to take into  account different needs across sectors. Currently, there is a lack of cybersecurity initiatives  tailored to specific sectors. Addressing this situation would help developing a sectorial approach  to innovation in cybersecurity.  Provide adequate level of funding both at National and EU level - Most economic incentives  and funding mechanisms support research organisations such as universities and research  centres, and innovative enterprises such as SMEs and start-ups. However, economic incentives  and funding mechanisms shall recognise the innovation contributions of all stakeholders, from  SMEs to large enterprises and research institutions in the public and private sectors. Innovation  stakeholders need different types of economic incentives and funding mechanisms depending  on their specific contributions to innovation in cybersecurity.  Involve stakeholders while developing and implementing innovation priorities both at  National and EU level. In order to address stakeholder’s expectations and support their needs,  it is necessary to establish both formal and informal channels of communication. A way is to  achieve this is to support the creation of industrial clusters:   To create clusters of start-ups, SMEs and post-start-up ecosystems, with  geographic concentration of resources and cross EU links to smaller players of all  kinds, possibly around a university as a centre of NIS excellence, or other  permanent institution, such as a testing and certification lab.   Clusters could be formed at various locations across the EU.   With formation of clusters for vertical sectors also, where appropriate.  Take into account the positive impact of regulatory frameworks on innovation at  national level and EU level – Regulatory frameworks may have a positive impact on  accelerating innovation and adoption of new products, services and processes. Therefore,  regulatory frameworks may positively support the achievement of specific innovation  objectives. Emphasising compliance with regulatory requirements as a market differentiator  may be perceived mainly in terms of obligations. However, compliance with specific regulatory  requirements may clearly define market opportunities both in the public and private sectors.  GOOD PRACTICES IN INNOVATION UNDER NCSS  NOVEMBER 2019  43  Support industries in positioning new cybersecurity offerings in the market both at  National and EU level – Innovative organisations such as SMEs and start-ups may face  challenging market conditions (e.g. fragmentation, international competition, etc.) in order to  offer and position their products, services and processes. It is therefore necessary to support  them with specific initiatives such us effort towards internationalisation of offerings in order to  help them to growth into the cybersecurity market.  Promote EU level certification of services/products both at National and EU level. That  would engender trust for users within the EU and provide a stamp of approval for international  markets that other regions do not have by enabling:   Security certification of ICT products and services for software, hardware and  firmware, ranging from apps for smartphones to data centre management utilities  to real-time industrial control software to chip level security. Certification should be  detailed and robust – not just a tick box exercise.   Certification of NIS products should be in terms of efficiency, ease of use and  effort needed across the product/service lifecycle.   Approved centres of certification.   EU security branding for certified products and services.   Continuous certification processes to track developing products/services.  Promote NIS training and educational measures both at National and EU level:   University level qualifications for a new NIS workforce, with a new emphasis on  security as a basic computer science   Support skill developments for current needs as well as future needs due to  emerging cybersecurity technologies and services – Skill developments should  take into account employability as well as innovation. It is necessary to support  skill developments addressing current needs as well as competencies and  capabilities needed for emerging innovative technologies, services and processes.   Education at school level on the need for cybersecurity in using ICT devices and in  writing software   Support funds for training NIS service staff for cybersecurity incident response  teams, e.g. six-month induction course for several thousand staff annually across  the EU, with financial support for training courses and trainees. This would provide  NIS service providers of all sizes with a solution to the gap in qualified personnel  for the security operations centres (SOCs) that will be a key feature of the future  EU NIS industry.  Some of these actions have already been put into motion, For example, the agreed approach of  the Commission is already turning to maximise awareness in the cybersecurity community of  financing opportunities at European, national and regional level, via existing instruments and  channels such as the Enterprise Europe Network29 and also has initiated the contractual  Cybersecurity Public Private Partnership (cPPP) for large-scale funding. Moreover the  Commission may complement these efforts with inputs from the European Investment Bank  (EIB) and the European Investment Fund (EIF) to accelerate access to finance with further  measures.  29 Strengthening Europe's Cyber Resilience System and Fostering a Competitive and Innovative  Cybersecurity Industry. EC COM 410 Final, 05JUL2016,  T P  -0 1  -1 9  -8 3  0 -E  N -N  ABOUT ENISA  The mission of the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) is to achieve a  high common level of cybersecurity across the Union, by actively supporting Member  States, Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies in improving cybersecurity. We  contribute to policy development and implementation, support capacity building and  preparedness, facilitate operational cooperation at Union level, enhance the  trustworthiness of ICT products, services and processes by rolling out cybersecurity  certification schemes, enable knowledge sharing, research, innovation and awareness  building, whilst developing cross-border communities.

    "abstract": "ENISA supports the efforts aimed to enhance the overall level of cybersecurity in the Member States (MS) both at a national and EU level. This report supports that effort by analysing how Member States are approaching innovation as a strategic priority under National Cyber Security Strategies (NCSS). The analysis is structured around several aspects of innovation such as: Innovation Priorities, Industrialisation and Collaboration and Market and Policy. Each of these aspects is at the same time divided into two dimensions. Innovation priorities can be divided into Innovation in technologies and services, and into economic incentives and investments. Industrialisation and collaboration can be divided into industrialisation processes and activities, and stakeholders’ collaboration. Market and Policy can be divided into Market and Technology Alignment and Market regulation. Each dimension can be supported by several activities and mechanisms."

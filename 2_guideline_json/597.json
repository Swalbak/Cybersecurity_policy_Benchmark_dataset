Among the actions it is mentioned that “prime  focus should be to create incentives to carry out appropriate risk management and adopt security  standards and solutions, as well as possibly establish voluntary EU-wide certification schemes  building on existing schemes in the EU and internationally” 2.  This study focuses on two objectives: The first objective is to provide expertise from other  certification areas to the reform of the European data protection legislation3, as the new proposed  legislation identifies privacy certification as a means to achieve implementation of data protection  requirements.  The second objective is to identify, based on existing knowledge, recommendations  and steps to be followed for achieving the objectives of the aforementioned EU cyberstrategy,  namely the development of voluntary EU-wide certification schemes building on existing schemes in  the EU. In order to collect experiences from existing certification schemes and given the broad range  of existing certification schemes, this study addresses Information Security Management Systems  (ISMS) certification.  For the collection of practical experiences of private companies and public organisations for  Information Security Management Systems certification a survey was conducted.  Based on the  available resources, the survey was carried out in a set of Member States (MSs), which account more  than 50% of EU population and covered Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands,  Poland, Spain, Sweden, Slovakia, United Kingdom.  The survey provides information on existing accreditation bodies and schemes and on certification  bodies and schemes.  Further to this administrative perspective, based on the available resources we  identify the current practice on the basis of two interviews carried out with one company of the  private sector and one organization of the public sector in each surveyed country.  Based on the  collected information, this study provides a qualitative analysis of certification practices in the area  of Information Security Management Systems.  Further work will provide a quantitative perspective  on the practice in the area of certification by considering a larger sample of companies, which are  selected using statistical methods, and such work should not be focusing only on ISMS certification.  Some of the findings of the survey are introduced here:   In certain MSs national legislation requires information security certification in specific  sectors, such as public healthcare.   National authorities are encouraging the implementation of certification processes for ISMS  (e.g. by introducing specific information security certification requirements in case of  participation in public procurement).   Based on the survey, the large majority of companies that own a security certificate consider  this as useful for their functioning, as the certification process ensures a regular and  systematic identification of risks and evaluation, etc. and also provides competitive  advantages.  Between the recommendations of this study are:  1 Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace - JOIN(2013) 1 final, 7/2/2013, (last accessed on  23.09.2013), available at:  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667  2 ibid, p. 12.  3 European Commission, Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with  regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation), COM(2012) 11  final, 25 January 2012, available at http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf  (last  accessed on 23.09.2013)  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667 http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf  Security certification practice in the EU  Information Security Management Systems - A case study  Version 1, October 2013  Page  2   There are limitations in the statistics on existing certification processes.  We recommend that  policy makers (i.e. the European Commission in case it is regulating the area) or the  responsible authorities (i.e. national supervising authorities in the area of accreditation and  certification) should demand reliable statistics on certification. The bodies issuing  certificates should keep updated public records on certificates that they have issued, on the  specific version of products/systems they certified including information on the validity of  the certificates.    Introducing and possibly requiring an additional certification related to privacy may be  cumbersome especially for SMEs. Under the lead of the European Commission,  standardization bodies, and responsible stakeholders should work together to develop best  practices and standards combining the requirements for security and data protection in  order avoid duplication of work for the two certification areas.    There is a well-established legislation regarding accreditation and certification in the MSs.  When considering introducing certification for other purposes, i.e. for privacy/data  protection, the European Commission together with national policy makers should link such  initiatives with existing national accreditation structures.   Companies should not be able to get certificates without really having implemented the  processes and controls that have been written down in the audited documents.  The national  policy makers should ensure enforcement of such requirements for genuine compliance for  instance by applying sanctions and/or ad-hoc assessments carried on by third parties.  Security certification practice in the EU  Information Security Management Systems - A case study  Version 1, October 2013  Page  3  2 Introduction  The recently published Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union4 states clearly the shared  responsibility of all stakeholders and the need for all actors to protect themselves in the context of  growing dependency on information and communications technologies. The need to develop  industrial and technical resources for cybersecurity is mentioned among the strategic priorities and  actions, and in this context “prime focus should be to create incentives to carry out appropriate risk  management and adopt security standards and solutions, as well as possibly establish voluntary EU- wide certification schemes building on existing schemes in the EU and internationally” 5  This report aims at providing input for the adoption of a framework on privacy certifications6, as well  as for eGovernment certification in Europe.  There are numerous IT security certification schemes  across the European Member States that can serve as the basis for the drawing of recommendations  on aspects of security certifications that could be applied to privacy and eGovernment services  certification. This study addresses Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) certification.  An Information Security Management System (ISMS) is a systematic approach to managing sensitive  company information so that it remains secure. It encompasses people, processes and IT systems.7  This study focuses on two objectives: The first objective is to provide expertise from other  certification areas to the reform of the European data protection legislation8, as the new proposed  legislation identifies privacy certification as a means to achieve implementation of data protection  requirements. As such, this study aims at providing ‘lessons learned’ from security certification to be  used for the purpose of developing privacy certification & privacy seals and to support, according to  the Work Programme of ENISA9, related activities initiated by DG JUST and JRC10. The second  objective is to identify, based on existing knowledge, recommendations and steps to be followed for  achieving the objectives of the aforementioned EU Cyber Security Strategy, namely the development  of voluntary EU-wide certification schemes building on existing ISMS schemes in the EU.  In order to achieve the goals the report examines current practices regarding security certification in  the European Union and provides a short overview of existing information technology security  certification schemes in a selection of European Union Member States.  In order to collect practical  experiences from certification, a survey was carried out on the experiences of private companies and  public organisations for ISMS certification. The survey was based on the collection of information  4 Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace - JOIN(2013) 1 final, 7/2/2013, (last accessed on  23.09.2013), available at:  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667  The European Commission, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, have published a cybersecurity  strategy for the European Union. The cybersecurity strategy provides a list of priorities and actions aimed at enhancing cyber resilience of  information systems, reducing cybercrime and strengthening EU international cyber-security policy and cyber defence, while promoting  values of freedom and democracy and ensuring the safely grow of digital economy.  5 ibid, p. 12.  6 In the context of this report certification consists of the “attestation, by an independent third party assessment, that certain  requirements and best practices are being observed”6.  7 http://emea.bsi-global.com/InformationSecurity/Overview/WhatisanISMS.xalter.  8 European Commission, Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with  regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation), COM(2012) 11  final, 25 January 2012, available at http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf  (last  accessed on 23.09.2013)  The European Commission proposed a regulation on data protection that will replace the existing Data Protection Directive.

Based on available resources for this study, we  aimed at having a representative sample of EU Member States, accounting for over 50% of the  European population.  These Member States represent different legal, administrative and socio- political cultures and ensure an adequate population and geographic coverage.  2.1 Background  In January 2012, the European Commission presented its proposals for the reform of the data  protection legal framework of the European Union, proposing the replacement of the Data  Protection Directive with a Regulation11 (hereafter ‘draft Regulation’), which was the outcome of  consultation and debates of three intense years. The draft Regulation introduces in Article 39 the  possibility for the Member States and the Commission to establish data protection certification  mechanisms and data protection seals and marks.  Such certification mechanisms are seen as  transparency mechanisms that will ensure compliance with the rules contained in the draft Data  Protection Regulation “allowing data subjects to quickly assess the level of data protection of  relevant products and services”12. More specifically Article 39 - “Certification” - reads as follows:  “1. The Member States and the Commission shall encourage, in particular at European level, the establishment  of data protection certification mechanisms and of data protection seals and marks, allowing data subjects to  quickly assess the level of data protection provided by controllers and processors. The data protection  certifications mechanisms shall contribute to the proper application of this Regulation, taking account of the  specific features of the various sectors and different processing operations.  2. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 86 for the purpose  of further specifying the criteria and requirements for the data protection certification mechanisms  referred to  in paragraph 1, including conditions for granting and withdrawal, and requirements for recognition within the  Union and in third countries.  3. The Commission may lay down technical standards for certification mechanisms and data protection seals  and marks and mechanisms to promote and recognize certification mechanisms and data protection seals and  marks. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure set out in  Article 87(2).”  Based on the requirements mentioned in Article 39 of the draft Regulation, this study aims at  providing ‘lessons learned’ from security certification to be used for the purpose of developing  privacy certification & privacy seals and to support, according to the Work Programme of ENISA13,  related activities initiated by DG JUST and JRC14.  This survey is complemented with a paper addressing the security and usability issues of trust  indicators on websites, more concrete analysing the human behaviour and interaction with seals,  trustmarks, and indicators15.  2.2 Description of the survey  The area of Information Security Management Systems certification schemes is very rich.

The survey was based on the collection of information from eleven EU Member States, namely  Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Slovakia and the  United Kingdom. Based on available resources for this study we aimed at having a representative  sample of EU Member States, accounting for over 50% of the European population.  These Member  States represent different legal, administrative and socio-political cultures and ensure an adequate  population and geographic coverage.  Austria and Germany are two countries with an Austrian-German legal system. France has a strong  continental Napoleonic law tradition, while the United Kingdom is the largest common-law country  in the European Union.  Italy and Spain are two countries from the South of Europe.  The  Netherlands and Belgium are two Northern European countries, while Sweden is a Scandinavian  country. Finally, Slovakia and Poland are two Central European countries.  These countries form an interesting mix of experiences with ISMS, and furthermore contain both  common law and continental law, western and central European jurisdictions on larger and smaller  territories.  The information was collected through a questionnaire that was dispatched to and collected from a  selected list of representatives in these Member States (see Annex I).  Besides providing the legal  background and an overview of accreditation bodies and certification practice in the selected MSs,  the national representatives carried out two interviews.  The national representatives selected one  company from the private sector and one organization from the public sector in each surveyed  country, using their expertise, choosing from entities that were subject to certification.  Although the  number of interviews will not allow for general findings, they do provide a good indication of current  practices in the area of ISMS certification.  The answers focused on providing information  a) on the number and type of organisations accredited under ISMS certification,  b) on the number and type of organisations certified – by these or other accredited  organisations – on the basis of the ISMS certification standards and  c) on the practical experience with the certification process both in the private and the  public sector.  2.3 Structure of the study  Following the Introduction (Section 2), Section 3 of the study provides an introduction to  certification, focusing on IT certification in Europe and on privacy seals and other privacy  certification schemes. The next two sections are dedicated to the survey carried out in eleven  European Member States on Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) schemes and  practical experiences, the outcomes of which can be used as the basis for the development of  privacy and data protection certification schemes that are promoted by the European Commission.  Section 4 provides information on existing accreditation, as well as certification bodies and schemes.  Section 5 analyses certification practices in the area of Information Security Management Systems  on the basis of two interviews carried out with one company of the private sector and one  organization of the public sector in each surveyed country (sections 5.1 and 5.2 respectively). The  findings of the survey, followed by a number of recommendations, are summarized in section 6.  Security certification practice in the EU  Information Security Management Systems - A case study  Version 1, October 2013  Page  6  3 Certification  Certification schemes cover business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) processes  and products based on their performance according to the baseline requirements specified in the  scheme of reference (See Table 1).

A certification scheme can be  defined as the collection of requirements, procedures and means available for obtaining a  certificate.  Certification often means compliance with a standard. ISO defines an official standard as follows:  “[d]ocument established by consensus and approved by a recognized body, that provides, for  common and repeated use, rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their results, aimed at  the achievement of the optimum degree of order in a given context”18. However, “standards” can  also be set de facto, by private actors. By way of illustration, the so-called ‘Common Criteria’ is a  certification scheme where the security level of a product is evaluated according to a set of criteria  defined in the international standard ISO/IEC 15408.  Certification, as defined in the ENISA study of 2007, is the final stage of a longer process. This  process is usually designated with the term “conformity assessment.”  During a conformity  assessment a person or a body will evaluate compliance of persons, products and/or processes with  a given set of requirements.  It is important to emphasize that 1) the evaluation, and 2) the  certification, are not necessarily performed by the same body.  IT security certification schemes have been developed by international, regional and national  organisations. At international level, schemes with broad acceptance in practice have been deployed  by the International Organisation for Standardization (ISO), by the information Systems Audit and  Control Association (ISACA) or the Information Systems Security Association (ISSA). According to a  2012 information security breaches survey, 41% of the customers of large organisations and 13% of  small organisations asked companies to comply with a recognised international standard, such as  ISO 27001.19  16 European Commission, “Commission Communication — EU best practice guidelines for voluntary certification schemes for agricultural  products and foodstuffs”, 2010/C 341/04, OJ C341/5 (16.12.2010), available at http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:341:0005:0011:en:PDF.  17 C.

Organisations  that have been involved in the deployment of IT security certification scheme at national level are,  for instance, the US National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) or the British Standards  Institute (BSI).  Evidently, it is impossible to provide an overview of all possible certification schemes related to  information security. Usually a distinction is made between certificates for a) persons, b) products  and c) organizations.  a) Persons  Certification of information security experts often concludes a training programme. Programmes and  certificates can be provided by private companies, professional associations, educational  institutions, etc. Well-known are also the information security certification schemes provided by  specialized institutions such as GIAC20, International Council of Electronic Commerce Consultants  (EC-Council)21, ISC22or by professional associations such as ISACA.23 In the framework of ISO, specific  certification can be obtained by ISO 27001 auditors or by information security officers who wish to  implement the ISO 27001 standard. This ISO certification is provided by accredited certification  bodies or unaccredited ones.  b) Products  Typical examples of certification schemes for products are the schemes available for the payment  sector.24 The “Common Criteria” is a certification scheme where the security level of a product is  evaluated according to a set of criteria defined in the international standard ISO/IEC 15408.25 A  “certified product” does not necessarily mean that the (security of a) product has been tested and  approved by an independent body. There are four types of certification, and they are based on who  does the certifying: vendor certification, market certification, user (self) certification, and  independent certification. While independent certification is generally recommended, it is often not  realistic due to the rapid turnover and the continuous launch of new product generations.  c) Organisations  Certification of organisations can take various forms. In the first place it is important to mention that  the absence of certification does not necessarily mean that this organisation has not been – or is not  – audited and monitored, whether or not by external and/or independent experts. The security of a  critical networks and operations, e.g. in the financial sector or the transport sector, is often  submitted to permanent security monitoring. Secondly, organisations often engage in certification  processes for specific applications or for their most critical operations. Certification doesn’t  necessarily mean that the organisation is being certified as such. Thirdly one needs to distinguish  between general information security management certification and the certification of specific  security-related activities. Very specific auditing or certification schemes exist, for example, for data  hosting services (data centres) or for so-called third-party trust providers.  3.2 Approaches to achieve auditable information security management  Based on the above discussion, one can distinguish between at least five different approaches to  information security management certification: 1) the “ISO Conformity Assessment” approach; 2)  20 http://www.giac.org  21 http://www.eccouncil.org  22 http://www.isc2.org  23 http://www.isaca.org/certification/  24 See, for example: https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/  25 http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/  http://www.giac.org/ http://www.eccouncil.org/ http://www.isc2.org/ http://www.isaca.org/certification/ https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/ http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/  Security certification practice in the EU  Information Security Management Systems - A case study  Version 1, October 2013  Page  8  the ISAE 3000 approach; 3) the AICPA approach; 3) the ISAE 3402 approach and 5) the ISRS 4400  approach on “agreed upon procedures”.  1) The “ISO Conformity Assessment” approach  Within the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the conformity assessment policy  development committee ISO/CASCO is both responsible for developing and making  recommendations on conformity assessment policy to the ISO/CASCO membership and for  developing conformity assessment standards and guides.  Particularly relevant ISO standards include  (a) ISO 17021 “Conformity assessment: Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of  management systems” (where the ISO 17000 series replaces EN 45000), and (b) ISO 27006  Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of information security management  systems.  Certification of an entity against a specific set of requirements or standard (e.g. ISO 27001) is  performed by a certification body “accredited” for performing conformity assessments against such  a specific set of requirements or standard by an Accreditation Body. Such an accreditation means  that the accredited certification body has the authority, expertise and knowhow to go into  organisations and assess them against the target requirements. Only certification bodies can be  accredited. It is a common misconception that organisations think that they can become e.g. ISO  27001 “accredited” (instead of “certified”). Accredited certification bodies undergo periodic  assessments by their accreditation bodies, usually their National Accreditation Body.  2) The ISAE 3000 approach  The International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) operates the International Auditing and  Assurance Standards Board (IAASB).  This IAASB issued the “International Standard on Assurance  Engagements (ISAE) No. 3000, Assurance Reports on Controls at a Service Organization” originally in  June 2000.  The current version is “ISAE 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits  or Reviews of Historical Financial Information - International Standard on Assurance Engagements  (ISAE)”.26 ISAE 3000’s core part focuses on the requirements that allow a practitioner (i.e. an auditor)  to express a degree of assurance over a subject matter. Much attention is devoted to selecting the  appropriate criteria to audit the subject matter (the topic of the audit), and to obtaining and  evaluating evidence. ISAE 3000 offers the state-of-the-art framework in auditing, based on  worldwide consensus. To convince customers that the organisation uses the most advanced  routines, controls and processes, also in the area of information security, providers often try to  obtain a ISAE 3000 assurance statement. For example in the area of cloud services, providers  sometimes refer to “ISAE 3000 compliance” in order to demonstrate that the data of the customer  are securely stored and only accessible for duly authenticated persons.  3) The AICPA approach  Historically, the AICPA’s “Statement on Auditing Standards No. 70: Service Organizations”,  commonly abbreviated as SAS 70 was a popular auditing statement issued by the Auditing Standards  Board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) with its content codified as  AU 324. SAS 70 was recently replaced by two standards: (a) ISAE 3402: International Standard on  Assurance Engagements No. 3402, Assurance Reports on Controls at a Service Organization, which is  the international standard adopted by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board  (IAASB), and (b) SSAE 16: Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 16 , Reporting on  Controls at a Service Organization, which is the “local” standard adopted by the Auditing Standards  Board (ASB) of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).  26 http://www.ifac.org/publications-resources/  http://www.ifac.org/publications-resources/  Security certification practice in the EU  Information Security Management Systems - A case study  Version 1, October 2013  Page  9  To help Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) selecting the appropriate standard for a particular  engagement, the AICPA has introduced the SOC (Service Organization Control) reporting concept,  and identified 3 different engagements (SOC 1 relevant to user entities' internal control over  financial reporting, SOC 2 focusing on security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or  privacy and SOC 3 on trust service principles and criteria).27 SOC reports are internal control reports  on the services provided by a service organization providing information that users need to assess  and address the risks associated with an outsourced service.28  4) The ISAE 3402 approach  The IFAC International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). Issued in December 2009  the “International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) No. 3402, Assurance Reports on  Controls at a Service Organization”.29  ISAE 3402 was developed to provide an international  assurance standard to allow public accountants to issue a report for use by user organizations and  their auditors on the controls at a service provider that are likely to impact or be a part of the user  organization’s system of internal control over financial reporting. Its focus is on financial reporting.  In principle, the procedure is as follows: a) The user organization is an entity that outsourced part of  its business to a service organization. b) Formal agreements regarding the outsourced services are  recorded in a contract and/or Service Level Agreement (SLA). c) Under the ISAE 3402 standard the  external auditor has five responsibilities:  1 Prepare and present a complete an accurate description of the ‘system’ (i.e. the internal  control framework).  2 Specify the control objectives.  3 Identify the risks that threaten the achievement of the control objectives.  4 Design, implement and maintain controls to provide reasonable assurance that the control  objectives will be achieved.  5 Provide a written assertion to accompany the description as to the completeness and  accuracy of the information provided and state the criteria used as a basis for making the  assertion.  The external auditor shall subsequently determine if all relevant aspects of the ISAE 3402 standard  are adequately addressed by the system description. In addition, the service auditor determines if  mentioned controls exist, are adequately designed and operated effectively (only type II) during a  certain period.  The service auditor provides an opinion to the ISAE 3402 report.  The auditor of the  user (internal auditor) can subsequently rely on the external auditor opinion, when auditing the user  organization financial statements.  5) The approach on “Agreed upon procedures”  Finally, an approach can be based upon procedures agreed between the service provider and the  auditor. Such an approach allows fine-tuning of scope and audit objectives to the largest extent  possible. It is typically used to provide comfort to the service provider internally.  It is less suitable to  provide assurance towards external parties. 30  27 See http://www.ssae16.org/white-papers/aicpa-soc-reports--introduction.html  28 See further http://www.cohnreznick.com/soc-report-faqs  29 http://isae3402.com  30 For an example, see http://www.pscpa.com/assurance/agreed-upon-procedures  http://www.ssae16.org/white-papers/aicpa-soc-reports--introduction.html http://www.cohnreznick.com/soc-report-faqs http://isae3402.com/ http://www.pscpa.com/assurance/agreed-upon-procedures  Security certification practice in the EU  Information Security Management Systems - A case study  Version 1, October 2013  Page  10  3.3 Privacy seals and privacy certification  As mentioned in the Introduction, one of the objective of the study is also to provide ‘lessons  learned’ from security certification to be used for the purpose of developing privacy certification &  privacy seals31 Therefore, this section presents a short introduction to privacy seals and privacy  certification.  Certification of privacy seals and other privacy certification schemes present a problem of adverse  selection32 that arises when less trustworthy companies would use means to pretend that they are  trustworthy taking advantage of the existing information asymmetry on the market.  Online  interactions reflect a two-sided market, with companies actively making decisions about how to  present themselves.  Good companies want to demonstrate their integrity.  Nevertheless, as usual in  adverse selection, less trustworthy companies also have an incentive to pretend that they are good.  There is currently a lax approach toward privacy certification, which can give rise to adverse  selection, resulting in a situation where the companies that seek and obtain trust certifications are  actually less trustworthy than others.33  Control measures, regulation and best practices in the area have been set to address possible issues  along the certification process, for instance by guaranteeing the independency of certifiers, and  granting them enforcement powers (See Figure 1).  Figure 1: The certification process  The following aspects generally describe the solidity of a (privacy) certification scheme34:  1. Certifier independency: The certifier should be an independent entity, with no conflicts of  interest towards the certified entity. In the framework of member-funded and profit-oriented  certification initiatives, a further check of the impartiality of the certifier can be constituted by  the cost structure of the service.  2.  Choice of standards: The baseline to which the certification relates is a fundamental element of  the process. Its conceivability and transparent representation allows users to understand the  principles that the privacy seal summarizes in one pictogram.  31 Privacy seal is an identifiable symbol or logo, voluntarily displayed on a Web site, which graphically asserts that the site has  implemented and complies with specified privacy practices: Definition by Andrew Tan at http://www.slideshare.net/acc626tan/privacy- seals-8465052.  32 Herschel I.

Impartiality in auditing procedure: Audits can be conducted internally based on internal or  third-party standards, or externally by a third party, such as auditing firms.  4.  Active monitoring of the certified company: The certification system should address the  question of ongoing monitoring and periodic re-assessment of the company.  5.  Certifier enforcement power: In order for certificates to guarantee the standards on which they  are based, the certification system has to enable the certifier to withdraw or suspend the  certificate in cases when the certified service departs from the pre-established standards.  6.  Certifier accountability: The certificate informs the customer of certain quality aspects of a  product or service and thus of its use. Certifier liability towards third parties motivates the  certifier to provide the most accurate information possible and enhances trust in the certifying  system itself.35  The deployment of a privacy seals and privacy certification scheme should take into account these  characteristics.  35 Y Danidou and B.

Table 3 below provides an  overview of the number of certified bodies in the area of ISMS in the surveyed Member States, while  a list of the certified bodies in the area of ISMS in the surveyed Member States can be found in  Annex 2.  Table 3 Number of ISMS certification bodies  It is interesting to note that the Netherlands Standardization Institute (NEN) has specified the NEN  7510:2011 ‘Health Informatics - Information security management in health’.64 NEN is currently  working on a certification schema for NEN 7510. As far as known the Dutch national accreditation  organisation (RvA) is not involved.  Summary of findings: The number of certification bodies that have been accredited in the area of  ISMS varies significantly between the surveyed countries, ranging from only one, as in the case of  Austria and Belgium, to twenty-three in the United Kingdom.  4.2 Accredited certification bodies and schemes/ISMS certifications in the  surveyed countries  All certification bodies provide ISMS certification for compliance with the ISO 27001 standard  (ISO/IEC 27001:2005).65 Many of them provide certification with other relevant standards as well, as  for instance the French LSTI that provides ISMS certification for compliance also with ISO 27005  (Security Risk Manager).  The number of certificates issued in each surveyed country varies significantly and unfortunately for  the majority of the surveyed countries there are no statistics. The International Register of ISMS  Certificates66 mentions a fraction only of the ISMS certificates. For instance the Register mentions  only 3 certified companies in Belgium, while the authors are aware of at least fifteen ISMS certified  organisations. Some ISMS certification companies provide information about the organisations they  certify, but this information is also not complete. In Sweden, the certification bodies accredited by  SWEDAC must be able to present to which companies they have issued a certificate.

The register is according to  SWEDAC's website “the most complete at present” and list 30 companies certified for compliance  with ISO 27001, although this number may not be accurate.  A survey of certifications to ISO management system standards was carried out in 2012 by ISO68,  where data on ISO/IEC 27001 for information security were also collected. Table 4 illustrates the  number of certificates issued in 2012, according to the ISO survey.  Country Number  Austria  28  Belgium  31  France  71  Germany  488  Italy  495  Netherlands  190  Poland  279  Slovakia  127  Spain  805  Sweden  32  United Kingdom  1701  Table 4 Number of certificates accredited by national accredited bodies against ISO/IEC 27001 in 2012 69  Summary of findings:  The number of certificates issued in each surveyed country varies significantly  and unfortunately, for the majority of the surveyed countries there are no official statistics.  Certification companies provide information about the organisations they certify, but this  information is also not complete.  4.3 Validity and revocation of ISMS certificates  The ISMS certifications are based on ISO/IEC 17021.  The certification is subject to surveillance audits  and recertification. The audit programme shall include a two-stage initial audit, surveillance audits in  the first and second years, and a recertification audit in the third year prior to expiration of  certification. The three-year certification cycle begins with the certification or recertification  decision.  The surveillance audit programme shall include, at least  a) internal audits and management review,  b) a review of actions taken on nonconformities identified during the previous audit,  c) treatment of complaints,  d) effectiveness of the management system with regard to achieving the certified client's  objectives,  e) progress of planned activities aimed at continual improvement,  f) continuing operational control,  67 SWETIC, http://www.swetic.org/en/swetic-swedish-association-for-testing-inspection-and-certification-1  68 ISO survey conducted in 2012 , http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/certification/iso-survey.htm.  69 http://www.iso.org/iso/database_iso_27001_iso_survey.xls.  http://www.swetic.org/en/swetic-swedish-association-for-testing-inspection-and-certification-1 http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/certification/iso-survey.htm http://www.iso.org/iso/database_iso_27001_iso_survey.xls  Security certification practice in the EU  Information Security Management Systems - A case study  Version 1, October 2013  Page  16  g) review of any changes, and  h) use of marks and/or any other reference to certification.  The ISO/IEC 27001 certification is usually divided in a two-stage external audit process defined by  the ISO/IEC 17021 and ISO/IEC 27006 standards, while a third stage involves follow-up audits that  are carried out in order to verify that the organisation remain compliant to the standard.  Stage 1 is  dedicated to the review of the documented ISMS against the standard and Stage 2 to the review of  the implementation of the ISMS within the business and evidence of adherence. The third stage, as  mentioned above involves follow-up audits that are carried out in order to verify that the  organisation remain compliant to the standard. In the majority of the surveyed countries, the ISMS  certificates are granted for a three-year period, during which certified bodies need to be annually  audited to ensure on-going compliance with the standards. The certification can be renewed for  subsequent three-year periods. However this timeframe depends on scheme requirements.  The certificate can be revoked if the annual audit finds reasons for it. The ISO/IEC 17021 (which  regulates the activities of Certification Bodies) regulates both suspension and revocation of issued  certificates. Motivations are coded and described - at standard regulation level - by each  Certification Body.  The certification body shall suspend certification in cases when, for example, the  client's certified management system has persistently or seriously failed to meet certification  requirements, including requirements for the effectiveness of the management system, the certified  client does not allow surveillance or recertification audits to be conducted at the required  frequencies, or the certified client has voluntarily requested a suspension.  Summary of findings.  In the majority of the surveyed countries, the ISMS certificates are granted  for a three-year period, during which certified bodies need to be annually audited to ensure ongoing  compliance with the standards. The certificate can be revoked if the annual audit finds reasons for it.  4.4 Costs for an ISMS certificate  In practice, many certification bodies follow the guidance in ISO/IEC 27006 on the number of days  (Auditor Time Chart in annex C70) for calculating the minimum duration of an audit, for usage of  Certification and Accreditation Bodies. The cost will then be determined by applying the appropriate  daily rates to the days needed. According to the findings of the survey, the costs for the certification  depend on a number of factors, such as the type and size of the organisation, the scope of the  certification, the location of workplaces and operations.  Only one national correspondent provided  an estimate for the cost, stating that the auditor’s daily fee can vary between 800 and 1.000 EUR. In  addition to the costs for the certification audit, there is significant cost associated with the effort to  implement the ISMS in the organisation, to set up processes to gather and store evidence and to  train the employees.  Summary of findings.  The costs for an ISMS certificate depend on the number of days needed  (depending on the size and the type of organisation or the scope of the certification), the tariff  scheme of the certification body and the expertise/experience of the auditors applied.  4.5 Additional information on seals and certification schemes  Some of the surveyed countries provided information on other security seals and security  certification schemes that are delivered by accredited certification bodies. The French National  Agency of Information Security (ANSSI) recently published a document enlisting requirements  applicable to audit service providers regarding the security of information systems (the PASSI  70 http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=59144  Security certification practice in the EU  Information Security Management Systems - A case study  Version 1, October 2013  Page  17  standard). Such standard covers the following activities: architecture audit, configuration audit,  source code audit, intrusion tests, organizational and physical audit. The PASSI standard will be  integrated into the next version of the general security standard RGSv2. Upon the RGSv2’s  publication, public administrations shall refer to audit service providers complying with such  standards.71  In the Netherlands the Privacy-Audit-Proof certificate has been developed by the Dutch Data  Protection Authority72, while NEN 751073 is a national Dutch standard for healthcare information  security management. Finally the Swedish Certification Body for IT Security (CSEC) is the certification  body accredited by SWEDAC74  and operates as Sweden’s national certification body for IT security in  products and systems according to Common Criteria for Information Technology Security  Evaluation75.  Summary of findings.  Some countries have developed national certification schemes for specific  sectors. For instance in France ANSSI, the National Agency of Information Systems’ Security defined  a document enlisting requirements applicable to audit service providers regarding the security of  information systems (the PASSI standard), which is applicable to public authorities in terms of  information systems’ security. In the Netherlands the Privacy-Audit-Proof certificate has been  developed by the Dutch Data Protection Authority76, while NEN 751077 is a national Dutch standard  specific for healthcare information security management.  71 Further information can be found at: http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/fr/menu/actualites/publication-du-referentiel-d-exigences-applicable-aux- prestataires-d-audit-de.html.  72 http://www.dutchdpa.nl/downloads_audit/PrivacyAuditFramework.pdf  73 http://www.nen7510.org  74 http://www.fmv.se/en/Our-activities/CSEC---The-Swedish-Certification-Body-for-IT-Security/About-CSEC/.  75 http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org  76 http://www.dutchdpa.nl/downloads_audit/PrivacyAuditFramework.pdf  77 http://www.nen7510.org  http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/fr/menu/actualites/publication-du-referentiel-d-exigences-applicable-aux-prestataires-d-audit-de.html http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/fr/menu/actualites/publication-du-referentiel-d-exigences-applicable-aux-prestataires-d-audit-de.html http://www.dutchdpa.nl/downloads_audit/PrivacyAuditFramework.pdf http://www.nen7510.org/ http://www.fmv.se/en/Our-activities/CSEC---The-Swedish-Certification-Body-for-IT-Security/About-CSEC/ http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/ http://www.dutchdpa.nl/downloads_audit/PrivacyAuditFramework.pdf http://www.nen7510.org/  Security certification practice in the EU  Information Security Management Systems - A case study  Version 1, October 2013  Page  18  5 Practical experiences with the ISMS certification process  5.1 Private sector  5.1.1 Surveyed companies  In order to gather information about the practical experiences with the ISMS certification process in  the private sector and identify potential key success elements for European certification bodies,  national correspondents from the selected eleven European Member States78 carried out personal  interviews with companies from the private sector that have experiences with going through ISMS  certification.  The surveyed companies were all active in the IT industry and their profiles varied as  follows: two companies were IT service providers, two were trust service providers offering digital  certificates, two were IT consultancy companies, a communication service provider, a data centre  (outsourcing) provider, an identity service provider, a company active in product and people  identification and one specialised in the reuse of computers and equipment.  The companies cover a  broad range of size (from 11 to 5.000 employees) and all companies were interviewed on their  experiences for ISMS certification according to the ISO 27001 standard.  The interviews79 were  carried out with specialised employees from each company, who had the position of (Chief)  Information Security Officer, (Chief) Security Officer, Security Manager, Coordinator of Information  Security Management System or Risk Management Director. Thus they were highly qualified to  provide answers on the experiences of their company with ISMS certification.  Eight of the surveyed companies had prior experience with certification. All of them had gone  through the process of obtaining ISO 9001, while two of them had experience with ISO 20000 that  targets IT systems in general, but has also security part. Some of the companies have also  experiences with specific sector certification processes.  The certification processes covered in the majority of the examined countries all core processes and  services provided by the company. One of the examined companies excluded only two specific  controls concerning electronic commerce in the certification process. In three cases, ISMS  certification was pursued for specific processes, such as the deployment, supply and support of  managed information and communication technology services on different sites, outsourcing,  software development, deployment of LANs and WLANs, maintenance, or design, development,  implementation and administration of software.  Only one company had used security seals on their website, as they were WebTrust for CAs, while  the one company had acquired the official national seal for ISO27001.  5.1.2 Motivation for undergoing ISMS certification  The reasons for which the surveyed companies decided to obtain ISMS certification were very similar  among all companies and ranged from internal (e.g. improvement in quality) to external (e.g.  meeting clients expectations).  More specifically, the certification is seen as integrated into the company’s quality approach. In the  phase of preparation for the certification, all services of the company as are checked, which leads to  an improvement in quality. One company found that even the ordinary management of security  was greatly improved by having a formal system in place.  One company also stated that the  certificate raises the security-awareness of the employees.  78 See Annex I for a list of the national correspondents.  79 Due to the sensitivity of the information relating to ISMS certification, the interviewees preferred to remain anonymous.  Security certification practice in the EU  Information Security Management Systems - A case study  Version 1, October 2013  Page  19  Another incentive for the acquisition of an ISMS certificate is that it represents a marketing and  competitive advantage. The companies that obtained a certificate did not only aim at keeping their  existing customers satisfied, but also at gaining new ones. Actually, the use of certification as a  means to meet customer expectations has been mentioned as the most important incentive by the  surveyed companies. Obtaining the certificate has led to an increased assurance level perceived by  customers. In many cases, the clients actually requested the demonstration, with an  acknowledgment by an independent entity, that certain safeguards with regard to ISMS are met.  One of the surveyed companies stated that the customers are requesting every year more and more  for the so called “big 3” certificates (9001, 20000 and 27001), putting companies that have them at a  competitive advantage. One surveyed company actually decided to obtain the certification, because  it was working with government authorities that requested a managed security process from them.  Another reason for which the surveyed companies acquired the certificate is due to the fact that the  requirement to be certified is set in a growing number of procurement procedures.  Finally one company found that the decision to obtain certification under ISO 27001 was a natural  choice as it forms a good base for other assurance schemes.  5.1.3 Time period required for the preparation of the company in view of the certification  The time period required for the preparation of a company in order to undergo certification depends  on a number of factors, such as for example if the company has obtained another certificate or  whether several of the controls are already in place in the company. The time period that was  required for the surveyed companies in order to prepare for the certification varied between 3 and  18 months. The majority of the companies required about 6 to 12 months in order to complete the  preparation. Companies that already had experience with certification were already familiar with the  process and needed less time for preparation.  For example one company already had experience  from the certification of quality management systems as it was ISO 9001 certified and it needed  about six months. One of the companies explained that while the preparation phase took  approximately six months, 3-4 months were dedicated to the gathering of evidence of adherence.  Finally, two companies stated that the preparation took about 18 months, which included two-stage  reviews for quality checks on the way to the certification audit.  5.1.4 Time period required for the actual certification process  The time period required for the actual certification process did not exceed a week for the surveyed  companies.  The duration of the actual certification process depends of course on the size of the  organisation and the scope of the audit. The certification audit normally took two to six days, while  yearly audit took between one and three days. The time was longer in companies that were certified  for other/more standards at the same time.  Often the certification was divided in two stages that  were carried out on different time periods:  Stage 1 for a review of the documented ISMS against the  standard and Stage 2 for a review of the implementation of the ISMS within the business and  evidence of adherence.  5.1.5 Cost for certification  The cost for the certification, in the sense of the audit itself, in the case of majority of the surveyed  companies did not exceed the amount of 10.000 EUR, which in most cases was characterised as less  than 1% of the annual turnover.80 In all cases, however, the surveyed companies found that the cost  of the audit and certification is low compared to the added value for the company.  80 One company did not provide financial information due to their company policy.  Security certification practice in the EU  Information Security Management Systems - A case study  Version 1, October 2013  Page  20  5.1.6 Experiences from ISMS certification  One may think that companies, especially start-ups or SMEs, may find an ISMS certification as an  unwanted necessity and excessive cost to meet customer requirements.  However, the survey that  was conducted in eleven European Member States revealed that all surveyed companies had very  good experiences with ISMS certification. One of the companies found that ISMS certification brings  together “a wealth of industry experience and knowledge”, while another company characterised  ISMS certification as possibly “the company’s main strategic business asset”.  All surveyed companies found that the actual preparation of the company for the certification  increased internal awareness and contributed to the improvement of the processes and the offered  services.  Two companies stressed especially the importance of the fact that that the certification  was not a snapshot at a certain moment in time. Not only are there annual follow-up audits, as  foreseen by ISO 27001, but the changes in processes, controls and infrastructure are so drastic that  it wouldn’t be possible to put everything in place during the audit and not continue to implement it  further on, especially since it involves continuous improvement due to the annual auditing. One  company found that even the ordinary management of security was greatly improved by having a  formal system in place  All surveyed companies also had very positive experiences with the acceptance of the certification by  their customers. The certification contributed to an increased assurance level perceived by  customers and also opened new business opportunities. Finally, the certification was found very  useful in public procurement procedures, even when the certification was not obligatory  requirement.  5.2 Public sector  5.2.1 Surveyed companies  In order to gather information about the practical experiences with the ISMS certification process in  the public sector and identify potential key success elements for European certification bodies,  national correspondents from the selected eleven European Member States81 carried out personal  interviews with public bodies and agencies that have experiences with going through ISMS  certification. Eleven public organisations, one from each surveyed country, were surveyed. ISMS  certification is the public sector aims at raising the quality of the services that are offered to citizens.  However, ISMS certification of public bodies or agencies is not yet so widespread compared to the  private sector.82 Therefore it was not possible for all national correspondents to find an organisation  from the public sector that had acquired ISMS certification. Three of the surveyed companies  (Belgium, Germany, Spain) are in the preparation phase in order to obtain an ISMS certification.  Nevertheless they provided valuable information on their experiences so far in order to prepare for  the certification.  Few of the surveyed organisations had any previous experience of security certification schemes.  The French organisation was already familiar with the General Security Database (“Référenciel  Général de Sécurité” or the “RGS”) issued by ANSSI (“Agence Nationale de la Sécurité des Sytèmes d’  Information”, the National Agency of Information Systems” Security). RGS defines a set of security  rules applicable to the public authorities in terms of information systems’ security. The Dutch  organization had prior experience with a “Privacy Audit Proof” certificate83, which is a Dutch privacy  81 See Section I for the list of MSs and the rationale of the selection.  82 According to the ISO 2011 survey, out of the 6.314 ISO 27001 certificates that were obtained in 2011, only 106 fell under the category.  ‘public administration’ (http://www.iso.org/iso/database_iso_27001_iso_survey.xls).  83 https://www.privacy-audit-proof.nl/.  https://www.privacy-audit-proof.nl/  Security certification practice in the EU  Information Security Management Systems - A case study  Version 1, October 2013  Page  21  certification scheme based on a privacy audit framework developed under the auspices of the Dutch  Data Protection Authority. None of the organisations had used security seals.  The activities of the surveyed public organisations covered a broad range: the directorate general for  IT of a ministry and a ministry of transport, two municipalities, a health insurance body, a public  service in charge of employment, an organisation involved in the infrastructure of electronic health  cards, an organisation managing IT and data transmission infrastructure for specific functions,  regional land registers, an organisation providing bailiff, process serving and credit management  services and an agency that depends on ministry of industry.  Ten out of the eleven surveyed organisations were interviewed on their experiences for ISMS  certification according to the ISO 27001 standard. In one case, the public organisation had to comply  with a national certification scheme, which is actually very similar to the ISO 27001 certificate.  The interviews84 were carried out with specialised employees from each company, who had the  position of (Chief) Information Security Officer, (Chief) Security Officer, Data Protection and Security  Officer, IT Security Officer. Thus the interviewed experts were highly qualified to provide answers on  the experiences of their company with ISMS certification. One of them, specialist in internal security,  was actually certified Lead Auditor ISO27001: 2005.  5.2.2 Motivation for undergoing ISMS certification  All surveyed public organisations decided to obtain ISMS certification, because on the one hand they  realised the importance of information management in a secure way, and on the other hand they  wished to strengthen the confidence of citizens, or of companies that collaborate with them, in the  security of the IT and data management processes. One organisation highlighted that the  certification was used in order to promote customer take up for services that they were developing.  Another organisation stated that they decided to obtain the ISMS certificate because they did not  want security to be a separate process but rather to be integrated throughout their business  processes. The surveyed organisations that are active in the in area of health and deal with health  data considered ISMS certification as essential both for the citizens, as well as for their partners  (medical sector, health insurers…). In Germany, Slovakia and Spain national legislation required the  certification of information security processes in the sectors in which the surveyed organisations are  active.85 One organisation admitted that they obtained the ISO 27001 certification as part of  complying with the requirement to adhere to a sector scheme and that they would probably have  not pursued ISO 27001 certification alone otherwise.  5.2.3 Time period required for the preparation of the organisation in view of the certification  The time period required for the preparation of an organisation in order to undergo certification  depends on a number of factors, such as for example if the organisation has obtained another  certificate or whether several of the controls are already in place. The time period that was required  for the surveyed public sector organisations in order to prepare for the certification varied between  3 months and two years. Three of the interviewed organisations are still in the preparatory phase for  certification, while one prepared for the ISO 27001 together with ISO 9001 and therefore could not  estimate the preparation period that was required for the ISMS certification. Two organisations had  already prior security schemes in place and this shortened the preparation time they needed for the  84 Due to the sensitivity of the information relating to ISMS certification, the interviewees preferred to remain anonymous.  85 In Germany, the electronic health card system is specified by an organisation called Gematik, according to the requirements of which an  ISO27001 certification for the electronic health card infrastructure is required. Regulation of the Slovak Ministry of Finance 312/2010  contains requirements fr information security for public administration. In Spain, Public Administration Organisations are obliged to  comply with ENS, the National Security Scheme before 30 January 2014 (www.minhap.gob.es).  Security certification practice in the EU  Information Security Management Systems - A case study  Version 1, October 2013  Page  22  certification. Two organisations needed about 8 months, one 15 months, one 18 months and one 2  years.  5.2.4 Time period required for the actual certification process  The time period required for the actual certification process varied between the surveyed  companies, while three of the surveyed organisations have not been certified yet. The duration of  the actual certification process depends on the size of the organisation and the scope of the audit.  Often the certification was divided in two stages that were carried out on different time periods:  Stage 1 for a review of the documented ISMS against the standard and Stage 2 for a review of the  implementation of the ISMS within the business and evidence of adherence. The certification audit  normally took between 2 days and 2 weeks, while one organisation spent 4 weeks for the  certification process.  More specifically, two organisations spent 2 days, two spent 7 days, one spent  10 days, two organisations spent 2 weeks, and one spent 4 weeks. The time was longer in  organisations that were certified for other standards at the same time.  5.2.5 Cost for certification  The cost for the certification, in the sense of the audit itself, varies depending on the size of the  organisation, to processes that are being certified and the experience of the auditor.  For less than  one third of the surveyed organisations the cost did not exceed the amount of 10.000 EUR. For one  third of companies the cost was above 10.000 EUR and the remaining companies did not provide  values.  Three of the surveyed organisations have not been certified yet and did not provide any data  on cost.  5.2.6 Experiences from ISMS certification  The overall experiences of the surveyed public organisations with ISMS certification were positive.  The ISMS itself is a process-oriented management system and permits standardised management  and control of the required information security in the processing of comprehensive data sets as  defined in existing statutory provisions. The ISMS certification ensures a regular and systematic  identification of risks to information security, and the evaluation and reduction of such risks to an  acceptable and feasible degree by means of suitable security measures. In addition, the certification  permits to proceed to an annual audit of the organization’s good practices, which requires  continuous assessment with the aid of numerous system and process audits and leads to  improvements of the implemented system and thus improvements to the organisation of work.  Thanks to the calculation of security indicators reflecting the efficiency of the system, continuous  adjustment and further evolution in line with changing requirements can be achieved. ISMS  certification also allowed the management of information in a much more rigorous and deliberate  way than before. Moreover, this certification ensures sustainable security and safety in the  organization’s processes, which would not be possible without such certification. In short, ISMS  certification brought the organisation a lot of structure and strongly improved system availability.  With regard to the handling of personal data, on organisation found that ISMS certification  preserves the compliance of rules for the processing and handling of personal data. The certified  ISMS introduced also policy access rights to information systems and management of security  incidents and vulnerabilities to the surveyed organization.  One company referred to the limits of ISO 27001 certification, stating that an organisation could get  certified without really having implemented the processes and controls that have been written  down in the audited documents.

Security certification practice in the EU  Information Security Management Systems - A case study  Version 1, October 2013  Page  25  6 Conclusions and recommendations  The number of certification bodies that have been accredited in the area of ISMS varies significantly  between the surveyed countries, ranging from only one, as in the case of Austria and Belgium, to  twenty-three in the United Kingdom. Similarly, the number of certificates issued in each surveyed  country varies significantly and unfortunately, for the majority of the surveyed countries there are  no official statistics.  Some certification companies provide information about the organisations they  certify, but this information is also not complete.  The main findings of the survey are:   There are no reliable statistics on the number of certificates and certified companies.   Certain MSs national laws require an information security certification in certain sectors,  such as public healthcare.   National authorities are encouraging the implementation of certification processes for ISMS  (e.g. by introducing specific information security certification requirements in case of  participation in public procurement).   Some MSs have developed national certification schemes for specific sectors.   Based on the survey, the large majority of the interviewed companies, which were awarded  an information security certificate, consider this useful for their functioning, as the  certification process ensures a regular and systematic identification of risks and evaluation,  etc. and also provides competitive advantages.   The costs for an ISMS certificate depend on the number of days needed (depending on the  size and the type of organisation or the scope of the certification), the tariff scheme of the  certification body and the expertise/experience of the auditors applied.   In the majority of the surveyed countries, the ISMS certificates are granted for a three-year  period, during which certified bodies need to be annually audited to ensure ongoing  compliance with the standards.  The certificate can be revoked if the annual audit finds  reasons for it.   The initial certification process requires more resources (especially for the preparation  stage) in the case of the first certification. The preparation stage requires between 3 months  and 2 years, while majority of the companies required 6 to 12 months. The actual  certification process takes two to six days for private companies and between two days to  two weeks for public organisations.  One may think that companies, especially start-ups or SMEs, may find an ISMS certification as an  unwanted necessity and excessive cost to meet customer requirements. This survey, conducted in  eleven European Member States, revealed positive perspective on ISMS certification for the case of  the surveyed companies.  The concluding remarks and recommendations are listed below:   There are limitations in the statistics on the existing certification processes.  We recommend  that policy makers should demand reliable statistics. The bodies issuing certificates should  keep updated public records on certificates that they have issued, on the specific version  of products/systems they certified, including information on the validity of the certificates.   Introducing and possibly requiring an additional certification related to privacy may be  cumbersome especially for SMEs.  Under the lead of the European Commission,  standardization bodies, and responsible stakeholders should work together to develop  Security certification practice in the EU  Information Security Management Systems - A case study  Version 1, October 2013  Page  26  best practices and standards combining the requirements for security and data protection  in order avoid duplication of work for the two certification areas.    There is a well-established legislation regarding accreditation and certification in the MSs.  When considering introducing certification for other purposes, i.e. for privacy/data  protection, the European Commission and the national policy makers should link such  initiatives with existing national accreditation structures.   There should be no possibility for an organisation to be certified without actually  implementing the processes and controls that have been described in the audited  documents.  Furthermore, due to the relatively long duration of the preparation stage, there  is a high probability that the updated versions of systems are not certified right away after  their implementation/deployment.  The national policy makers should ensure enforcement  of such requirements for genuine compliance for instance by applying sanctions and/or ad- hoc assessments carried on by third parties.

Among the actions it is mentioned that “prime  focus should be to create incentives to carry out appropriate risk management and adopt security  standards and solutions, as well as possibly establish voluntary EU-wide certification schemes  building on existing schemes in the EU and internationally” 2.  This study focuses on two objectives: The first objective is to provide expertise from other  certification areas to the reform of the European data protection legislation3, as the new proposed  legislation identifies privacy certification as a means to achieve implementation of data protection  requirements.  The second objective is to identify, based on existing knowledge, recommendations  and steps to be followed for achieving the objectives of the aforementioned EU cyberstrategy,  namely the development of voluntary EU-wide certification schemes building on existing schemes in  the EU. In order to collect experiences from existing certification schemes and given the broad range  of existing certification schemes, this study addresses Information Security Management Systems  (ISMS) certification.  For the collection of practical experiences of private companies and public organisations for  Information Security Management Systems certification a survey was conducted.  Based on the  available resources, the survey was carried out in a set of Member States (MSs), which account more  than 50% of EU population and covered Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands,  Poland, Spain, Sweden, Slovakia, United Kingdom.  The survey provides information on existing accreditation bodies and schemes and on certification  bodies and schemes.  Further to this administrative perspective, based on the available resources we  identify the current practice on the basis of two interviews carried out with one company of the  private sector and one organization of the public sector in each surveyed country.  Based on the  collected information, this study provides a qualitative analysis of certification practices in the area  of Information Security Management Systems.  Further work will provide a quantitative perspective  on the practice in the area of certification by considering a larger sample of companies, which are  selected using statistical methods, and such work should not be focusing only on ISMS certification.  Some of the findings of the survey are introduced here:   In certain MSs national legislation requires information security certification in specific  sectors, such as public healthcare.   National authorities are encouraging the implementation of certification processes for ISMS  (e.g. by introducing specific information security certification requirements in case of  participation in public procurement).   Based on the survey, the large majority of companies that own a security certificate consider  this as useful for their functioning, as the certification process ensures a regular and  systematic identification of risks and evaluation, etc. and also provides competitive  advantages.  Between the recommendations of this study are:  1 Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace - JOIN(2013) 1 final, 7/2/2013, (last accessed on  23.09.2013), available at:  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667  2 ibid, p. 12.  3 European Commission, Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with  regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation), COM(2012) 11  final, 25 January 2012, available at http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf  (last  accessed on 23.09.2013)  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667 http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf  Security certification practice in the EU  Information Security Management Systems - A case study  Version 1, October 2013  Page  2   There are limitations in the statistics on existing certification processes.  We recommend that  policy makers (i.e. the European Commission in case it is regulating the area) or the  responsible authorities (i.e. national supervising authorities in the area of accreditation and  certification) should demand reliable statistics on certification. The bodies issuing  certificates should keep updated public records on certificates that they have issued, on the  specific version of products/systems they certified including information on the validity of  the certificates.    Introducing and possibly requiring an additional certification related to privacy may be  cumbersome especially for SMEs. Under the lead of the European Commission,  standardization bodies, and responsible stakeholders should work together to develop best  practices and standards combining the requirements for security and data protection in  order avoid duplication of work for the two certification areas.    There is a well-established legislation regarding accreditation and certification in the MSs.  When considering introducing certification for other purposes, i.e. for privacy/data  protection, the European Commission together with national policy makers should link such  initiatives with existing national accreditation structures.   Companies should not be able to get certificates without really having implemented the  processes and controls that have been written down in the audited documents.  The national  policy makers should ensure enforcement of such requirements for genuine compliance for  instance by applying sanctions and/or ad-hoc assessments carried on by third parties.  Security certification practice in the EU  Information Security Management Systems - A case study  Version 1, October 2013  Page  3  2 Introduction  The recently published Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union4 states clearly the shared  responsibility of all stakeholders and the need for all actors to protect themselves in the context of  growing dependency on information and communications technologies. The need to develop  industrial and technical resources for cybersecurity is mentioned among the strategic priorities and  actions, and in this context “prime focus should be to create incentives to carry out appropriate risk  management and adopt security standards and solutions, as well as possibly establish voluntary EU- wide certification schemes building on existing schemes in the EU and internationally” 5  This report aims at providing input for the adoption of a framework on privacy certifications6, as well  as for eGovernment certification in Europe.  There are numerous IT security certification schemes  across the European Member States that can serve as the basis for the drawing of recommendations  on aspects of security certifications that could be applied to privacy and eGovernment services  certification. This study addresses Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) certification.  An Information Security Management System (ISMS) is a systematic approach to managing sensitive  company information so that it remains secure. It encompasses people, processes and IT systems.7  This study focuses on two objectives: The first objective is to provide expertise from other  certification areas to the reform of the European data protection legislation8, as the new proposed  legislation identifies privacy certification as a means to achieve implementation of data protection  requirements. As such, this study aims at providing ‘lessons learned’ from security certification to be  used for the purpose of developing privacy certification & privacy seals and to support, according to  the Work Programme of ENISA9, related activities initiated by DG JUST and JRC10. The second  objective is to identify, based on existing knowledge, recommendations and steps to be followed for  achieving the objectives of the aforementioned EU Cyber Security Strategy, namely the development  of voluntary EU-wide certification schemes building on existing ISMS schemes in the EU.  In order to achieve the goals the report examines current practices regarding security certification in  the European Union and provides a short overview of existing information technology security  certification schemes in a selection of European Union Member States.  In order to collect practical  experiences from certification, a survey was carried out on the experiences of private companies and  public organisations for ISMS certification. The survey was based on the collection of information  4 Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace - JOIN(2013) 1 final, 7/2/2013, (last accessed on  23.09.2013), available at:  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667  The European Commission, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, have published a cybersecurity  strategy for the European Union. The cybersecurity strategy provides a list of priorities and actions aimed at enhancing cyber resilience of  information systems, reducing cybercrime and strengthening EU international cyber-security policy and cyber defence, while promoting  values of freedom and democracy and ensuring the safely grow of digital economy.  5 ibid, p. 12.  6 In the context of this report certification consists of the “attestation, by an independent third party assessment, that certain  requirements and best practices are being observed”6.  7 http://emea.bsi-global.com/InformationSecurity/Overview/WhatisanISMS.xalter.  8 European Commission, Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with  regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation), COM(2012) 11  final, 25 January 2012, available at http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf  (last  accessed on 23.09.2013)  The European Commission proposed a regulation on data protection that will replace the existing Data Protection Directive.

Based on available resources for this study, we  aimed at having a representative sample of EU Member States, accounting for over 50% of the  European population.  These Member States represent different legal, administrative and socio- political cultures and ensure an adequate population and geographic coverage.  2.1 Background  In January 2012, the European Commission presented its proposals for the reform of the data  protection legal framework of the European Union, proposing the replacement of the Data  Protection Directive with a Regulation11 (hereafter ‘draft Regulation’), which was the outcome of  consultation and debates of three intense years. The draft Regulation introduces in Article 39 the  possibility for the Member States and the Commission to establish data protection certification  mechanisms and data protection seals and marks.  Such certification mechanisms are seen as  transparency mechanisms that will ensure compliance with the rules contained in the draft Data  Protection Regulation “allowing data subjects to quickly assess the level of data protection of  relevant products and services”12. More specifically Article 39 - “Certification” - reads as follows:  “1. The Member States and the Commission shall encourage, in particular at European level, the establishment  of data protection certification mechanisms and of data protection seals and marks, allowing data subjects to  quickly assess the level of data protection provided by controllers and processors. The data protection  certifications mechanisms shall contribute to the proper application of this Regulation, taking account of the  specific features of the various sectors and different processing operations.  2. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 86 for the purpose  of further specifying the criteria and requirements for the data protection certification mechanisms  referred to  in paragraph 1, including conditions for granting and withdrawal, and requirements for recognition within the  Union and in third countries.  3. The Commission may lay down technical standards for certification mechanisms and data protection seals  and marks and mechanisms to promote and recognize certification mechanisms and data protection seals and  marks. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure set out in  Article 87(2).”  Based on the requirements mentioned in Article 39 of the draft Regulation, this study aims at  providing ‘lessons learned’ from security certification to be used for the purpose of developing  privacy certification & privacy seals and to support, according to the Work Programme of ENISA13,  related activities initiated by DG JUST and JRC14.  This survey is complemented with a paper addressing the security and usability issues of trust  indicators on websites, more concrete analysing the human behaviour and interaction with seals,  trustmarks, and indicators15.  2.2 Description of the survey  The area of Information Security Management Systems certification schemes is very rich.

The survey was based on the collection of information from eleven EU Member States, namely  Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Slovakia and the  United Kingdom. Based on available resources for this study we aimed at having a representative  sample of EU Member States, accounting for over 50% of the European population.  These Member  States represent different legal, administrative and socio-political cultures and ensure an adequate  population and geographic coverage.  Austria and Germany are two countries with an Austrian-German legal system. France has a strong  continental Napoleonic law tradition, while the United Kingdom is the largest common-law country  in the European Union.  Italy and Spain are two countries from the South of Europe.  The  Netherlands and Belgium are two Northern European countries, while Sweden is a Scandinavian  country. Finally, Slovakia and Poland are two Central European countries.  These countries form an interesting mix of experiences with ISMS, and furthermore contain both  common law and continental law, western and central European jurisdictions on larger and smaller  territories.  The information was collected through a questionnaire that was dispatched to and collected from a  selected list of representatives in these Member States (see Annex I).  Besides providing the legal  background and an overview of accreditation bodies and certification practice in the selected MSs,  the national representatives carried out two interviews.  The national representatives selected one  company from the private sector and one organization from the public sector in each surveyed  country, using their expertise, choosing from entities that were subject to certification.  Although the  number of interviews will not allow for general findings, they do provide a good indication of current  practices in the area of ISMS certification.  The answers focused on providing information  a) on the number and type of organisations accredited under ISMS certification,  b) on the number and type of organisations certified – by these or other accredited  organisations – on the basis of the ISMS certification standards and  c) on the practical experience with the certification process both in the private and the  public sector.  2.3 Structure of the study  Following the Introduction (Section 2), Section 3 of the study provides an introduction to  certification, focusing on IT certification in Europe and on privacy seals and other privacy  certification schemes. The next two sections are dedicated to the survey carried out in eleven  European Member States on Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) schemes and  practical experiences, the outcomes of which can be used as the basis for the development of  privacy and data protection certification schemes that are promoted by the European Commission.  Section 4 provides information on existing accreditation, as well as certification bodies and schemes.  Section 5 analyses certification practices in the area of Information Security Management Systems  on the basis of two interviews carried out with one company of the private sector and one  organization of the public sector in each surveyed country (sections 5.1 and 5.2 respectively). The  findings of the survey, followed by a number of recommendations, are summarized in section 6.

A certification scheme can be  defined as the collection of requirements, procedures and means available for obtaining a  certificate.  Certification often means compliance with a standard. ISO defines an official standard as follows:  “[d]ocument established by consensus and approved by a recognized body, that provides, for  common and repeated use, rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their results, aimed at  the achievement of the optimum degree of order in a given context”18. However, “standards” can  also be set de facto, by private actors. By way of illustration, the so-called ‘Common Criteria’ is a  certification scheme where the security level of a product is evaluated according to a set of criteria  defined in the international standard ISO/IEC 15408.  Certification, as defined in the ENISA study of 2007, is the final stage of a longer process. This  process is usually designated with the term “conformity assessment.”  During a conformity  assessment a person or a body will evaluate compliance of persons, products and/or processes with  a given set of requirements.  It is important to emphasize that 1) the evaluation, and 2) the  certification, are not necessarily performed by the same body.  IT security certification schemes have been developed by international, regional and national  organisations. At international level, schemes with broad acceptance in practice have been deployed  by the International Organisation for Standardization (ISO), by the information Systems Audit and  Control Association (ISACA) or the Information Systems Security Association (ISSA). According to a  2012 information security breaches survey, 41% of the customers of large organisations and 13% of  small organisations asked companies to comply with a recognised international standard, such as  ISO 27001.19  16 European Commission, “Commission Communication — EU best practice guidelines for voluntary certification schemes for agricultural  products and foodstuffs”, 2010/C 341/04, OJ C341/5 (16.12.2010), available at http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:341:0005:0011:en:PDF.  17 C.

Organisations  that have been involved in the deployment of IT security certification scheme at national level are,  for instance, the US National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) or the British Standards  Institute (BSI).  Evidently, it is impossible to provide an overview of all possible certification schemes related to  information security. Usually a distinction is made between certificates for a) persons, b) products  and c) organizations.  a) Persons  Certification of information security experts often concludes a training programme. Programmes and  certificates can be provided by private companies, professional associations, educational  institutions, etc. Well-known are also the information security certification schemes provided by  specialized institutions such as GIAC20, International Council of Electronic Commerce Consultants  (EC-Council)21, ISC22or by professional associations such as ISACA.23 In the framework of ISO, specific  certification can be obtained by ISO 27001 auditors or by information security officers who wish to  implement the ISO 27001 standard. This ISO certification is provided by accredited certification  bodies or unaccredited ones.  b) Products  Typical examples of certification schemes for products are the schemes available for the payment  sector.24 The “Common Criteria” is a certification scheme where the security level of a product is  evaluated according to a set of criteria defined in the international standard ISO/IEC 15408.25 A  “certified product” does not necessarily mean that the (security of a) product has been tested and  approved by an independent body. There are four types of certification, and they are based on who  does the certifying: vendor certification, market certification, user (self) certification, and  independent certification. While independent certification is generally recommended, it is often not  realistic due to the rapid turnover and the continuous launch of new product generations.  c) Organisations  Certification of organisations can take various forms. In the first place it is important to mention that  the absence of certification does not necessarily mean that this organisation has not been – or is not  – audited and monitored, whether or not by external and/or independent experts. The security of a  critical networks and operations, e.g. in the financial sector or the transport sector, is often  submitted to permanent security monitoring. Secondly, organisations often engage in certification  processes for specific applications or for their most critical operations. Certification doesn’t  necessarily mean that the organisation is being certified as such. Thirdly one needs to distinguish  between general information security management certification and the certification of specific  security-related activities. Very specific auditing or certification schemes exist, for example, for data  hosting services (data centres) or for so-called third-party trust providers.  3.2 Approaches to achieve auditable information security management  Based on the above discussion, one can distinguish between at least five different approaches to  information security management certification: 1) the “ISO Conformity Assessment” approach; 2)  20 http://www.giac.org  21 http://www.eccouncil.org  22 http://www.isc2.org  23 http://www.isaca.org/certification/  24 See, for example: https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/  25 http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/  http://www.giac.org/ http://www.eccouncil.org/ http://www.isc2.org/ http://www.isaca.org/certification/ https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/ http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/  Security certification practice in the EU  Information Security Management Systems - A case study  Version 1, October 2013  Page  8  the ISAE 3000 approach; 3) the AICPA approach; 3) the ISAE 3402 approach and 5) the ISRS 4400  approach on “agreed upon procedures”.  1) The “ISO Conformity Assessment” approach  Within the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the conformity assessment policy  development committee ISO/CASCO is both responsible for developing and making  recommendations on conformity assessment policy to the ISO/CASCO membership and for  developing conformity assessment standards and guides.  Particularly relevant ISO standards include  (a) ISO 17021 “Conformity assessment: Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of  management systems” (where the ISO 17000 series replaces EN 45000), and (b) ISO 27006  Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of information security management  systems.  Certification of an entity against a specific set of requirements or standard (e.g. ISO 27001) is  performed by a certification body “accredited” for performing conformity assessments against such  a specific set of requirements or standard by an Accreditation Body. Such an accreditation means  that the accredited certification body has the authority, expertise and knowhow to go into  organisations and assess them against the target requirements. Only certification bodies can be  accredited. It is a common misconception that organisations think that they can become e.g. ISO  27001 “accredited” (instead of “certified”). Accredited certification bodies undergo periodic  assessments by their accreditation bodies, usually their National Accreditation Body.  2) The ISAE 3000 approach  The International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) operates the International Auditing and  Assurance Standards Board (IAASB).  This IAASB issued the “International Standard on Assurance  Engagements (ISAE) No. 3000, Assurance Reports on Controls at a Service Organization” originally in  June 2000.  The current version is “ISAE 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits  or Reviews of Historical Financial Information - International Standard on Assurance Engagements  (ISAE)”.26 ISAE 3000’s core part focuses on the requirements that allow a practitioner (i.e. an auditor)  to express a degree of assurance over a subject matter. Much attention is devoted to selecting the  appropriate criteria to audit the subject matter (the topic of the audit), and to obtaining and  evaluating evidence. ISAE 3000 offers the state-of-the-art framework in auditing, based on  worldwide consensus. To convince customers that the organisation uses the most advanced  routines, controls and processes, also in the area of information security, providers often try to  obtain a ISAE 3000 assurance statement. For example in the area of cloud services, providers  sometimes refer to “ISAE 3000 compliance” in order to demonstrate that the data of the customer  are securely stored and only accessible for duly authenticated persons.  3) The AICPA approach  Historically, the AICPA’s “Statement on Auditing Standards No. 70: Service Organizations”,  commonly abbreviated as SAS 70 was a popular auditing statement issued by the Auditing Standards  Board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) with its content codified as  AU 324. SAS 70 was recently replaced by two standards: (a) ISAE 3402: International Standard on  Assurance Engagements No. 3402, Assurance Reports on Controls at a Service Organization, which is  the international standard adopted by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board  (IAASB), and (b) SSAE 16: Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 16 , Reporting on  Controls at a Service Organization, which is the “local” standard adopted by the Auditing Standards  Board (ASB) of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).  26 http://www.ifac.org/publications-resources/  http://www.ifac.org/publications-resources/  Security certification practice in the EU  Information Security Management Systems - A case study  Version 1, October 2013  Page  9  To help Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) selecting the appropriate standard for a particular  engagement, the AICPA has introduced the SOC (Service Organization Control) reporting concept,  and identified 3 different engagements (SOC 1 relevant to user entities' internal control over  financial reporting, SOC 2 focusing on security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or  privacy and SOC 3 on trust service principles and criteria).27 SOC reports are internal control reports  on the services provided by a service organization providing information that users need to assess  and address the risks associated with an outsourced service.28  4) The ISAE 3402 approach  The IFAC International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). Issued in December 2009  the “International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) No. 3402, Assurance Reports on  Controls at a Service Organization”.29  ISAE 3402 was developed to provide an international  assurance standard to allow public accountants to issue a report for use by user organizations and  their auditors on the controls at a service provider that are likely to impact or be a part of the user  organization’s system of internal control over financial reporting. Its focus is on financial reporting.  In principle, the procedure is as follows: a) The user organization is an entity that outsourced part of  its business to a service organization. b) Formal agreements regarding the outsourced services are  recorded in a contract and/or Service Level Agreement (SLA). c) Under the ISAE 3402 standard the  external auditor has five responsibilities:  1 Prepare and present a complete an accurate description of the ‘system’ (i.e. the internal  control framework).  2 Specify the control objectives.  3 Identify the risks that threaten the achievement of the control objectives.  4 Design, implement and maintain controls to provide reasonable assurance that the control  objectives will be achieved.  5 Provide a written assertion to accompany the description as to the completeness and  accuracy of the information provided and state the criteria used as a basis for making the  assertion.  The external auditor shall subsequently determine if all relevant aspects of the ISAE 3402 standard  are adequately addressed by the system description. In addition, the service auditor determines if  mentioned controls exist, are adequately designed and operated effectively (only type II) during a  certain period.  The service auditor provides an opinion to the ISAE 3402 report.  The auditor of the  user (internal auditor) can subsequently rely on the external auditor opinion, when auditing the user  organization financial statements.  5) The approach on “Agreed upon procedures”  Finally, an approach can be based upon procedures agreed between the service provider and the  auditor. Such an approach allows fine-tuning of scope and audit objectives to the largest extent  possible. It is typically used to provide comfort to the service provider internally.  It is less suitable to  provide assurance towards external parties. 30  27 See http://www.ssae16.org/white-papers/aicpa-soc-reports--introduction.html  28 See further http://www.cohnreznick.com/soc-report-faqs  29 http://isae3402.com  30 For an example, see http://www.pscpa.com/assurance/agreed-upon-procedures  http://www.ssae16.org/white-papers/aicpa-soc-reports--introduction.html http://www.cohnreznick.com/soc-report-faqs http://isae3402.com/ http://www.pscpa.com/assurance/agreed-upon-procedures  Security certification practice in the EU  Information Security Management Systems - A case study  Version 1, October 2013  Page  10  3.3 Privacy seals and privacy certification  As mentioned in the Introduction, one of the objective of the study is also to provide ‘lessons  learned’ from security certification to be used for the purpose of developing privacy certification &  privacy seals31 Therefore, this section presents a short introduction to privacy seals and privacy  certification.  Certification of privacy seals and other privacy certification schemes present a problem of adverse  selection32 that arises when less trustworthy companies would use means to pretend that they are  trustworthy taking advantage of the existing information asymmetry on the market.  Online  interactions reflect a two-sided market, with companies actively making decisions about how to  present themselves.  Good companies want to demonstrate their integrity.  Nevertheless, as usual in  adverse selection, less trustworthy companies also have an incentive to pretend that they are good.  There is currently a lax approach toward privacy certification, which can give rise to adverse  selection, resulting in a situation where the companies that seek and obtain trust certifications are  actually less trustworthy than others.33  Control measures, regulation and best practices in the area have been set to address possible issues  along the certification process, for instance by guaranteeing the independency of certifiers, and  granting them enforcement powers (See Figure 1).  Figure 1: The certification process  The following aspects generally describe the solidity of a (privacy) certification scheme34:  1. Certifier independency: The certifier should be an independent entity, with no conflicts of  interest towards the certified entity. In the framework of member-funded and profit-oriented  certification initiatives, a further check of the impartiality of the certifier can be constituted by  the cost structure of the service.  2.  Choice of standards: The baseline to which the certification relates is a fundamental element of  the process. Its conceivability and transparent representation allows users to understand the  principles that the privacy seal summarizes in one pictogram.  31 Privacy seal is an identifiable symbol or logo, voluntarily displayed on a Web site, which graphically asserts that the site has  implemented and complies with specified privacy practices: Definition by Andrew Tan at http://www.slideshare.net/acc626tan/privacy- seals-8465052.  32 Herschel I.

Impartiality in auditing procedure: Audits can be conducted internally based on internal or  third-party standards, or externally by a third party, such as auditing firms.  4.  Active monitoring of the certified company: The certification system should address the  question of ongoing monitoring and periodic re-assessment of the company.  5.  Certifier enforcement power: In order for certificates to guarantee the standards on which they  are based, the certification system has to enable the certifier to withdraw or suspend the  certificate in cases when the certified service departs from the pre-established standards.  6.  Certifier accountability: The certificate informs the customer of certain quality aspects of a  product or service and thus of its use. Certifier liability towards third parties motivates the  certifier to provide the most accurate information possible and enhances trust in the certifying  system itself.35  The deployment of a privacy seals and privacy certification scheme should take into account these  characteristics.  35 Y Danidou and B.

This network is well established, in particular in the area of ISO 27001,  which is the main international standard for an Information Security Management System (ISMS).  With regard to Information Security Management Systems, the national accreditation bodies have  accredited certification bodies in the area of ISMS. The number of certification bodies that have  been accredited in the area of ISMS varies significantly between the surveyed countries: The  Austrian and Belgian accreditation bodies have certified only one company each in the area of ISMS,  49 www.rva.nl  50 Wet van 29 oktober 2009, houdende regels omtrent de aanwijzing van een nationale accreditatie-instantie in verband met de  implementatie van EG-verordening nr. 765/2008 (Wet aanwijzing nationale accreditatie-instantie), available in Dutch at  http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0026591/geldigheidsdatum_01-09-2013  51 http://www.pca.gov.pl/english/?page=akredytacja_en  52 Ustawa z dnia 30 sierpnia 2002 r.o systemie oceny zgodności, Off.

Table 3 below provides an  overview of the number of certified bodies in the area of ISMS in the surveyed Member States, while  a list of the certified bodies in the area of ISMS in the surveyed Member States can be found in  Annex 2.  Table 3 Number of ISMS certification bodies  It is interesting to note that the Netherlands Standardization Institute (NEN) has specified the NEN  7510:2011 ‘Health Informatics - Information security management in health’.64 NEN is currently  working on a certification schema for NEN 7510. As far as known the Dutch national accreditation  organisation (RvA) is not involved.  Summary of findings: The number of certification bodies that have been accredited in the area of  ISMS varies significantly between the surveyed countries, ranging from only one, as in the case of  Austria and Belgium, to twenty-three in the United Kingdom.  4.2 Accredited certification bodies and schemes/ISMS certifications in the  surveyed countries  All certification bodies provide ISMS certification for compliance with the ISO 27001 standard  (ISO/IEC 27001:2005).65 Many of them provide certification with other relevant standards as well, as  for instance the French LSTI that provides ISMS certification for compliance also with ISO 27005  (Security Risk Manager).  The number of certificates issued in each surveyed country varies significantly and unfortunately for  the majority of the surveyed countries there are no statistics. The International Register of ISMS  Certificates66 mentions a fraction only of the ISMS certificates. For instance the Register mentions  only 3 certified companies in Belgium, while the authors are aware of at least fifteen ISMS certified  organisations. Some ISMS certification companies provide information about the organisations they  certify, but this information is also not complete. In Sweden, the certification bodies accredited by  SWEDAC must be able to present to which companies they have issued a certificate.

The register is according to  SWEDAC's website “the most complete at present” and list 30 companies certified for compliance  with ISO 27001, although this number may not be accurate.  A survey of certifications to ISO management system standards was carried out in 2012 by ISO68,  where data on ISO/IEC 27001 for information security were also collected. Table 4 illustrates the  number of certificates issued in 2012, according to the ISO survey.  Country Number  Austria  28  Belgium  31  France  71  Germany  488  Italy  495  Netherlands  190  Poland  279  Slovakia  127  Spain  805  Sweden  32  United Kingdom  1701  Table 4 Number of certificates accredited by national accredited bodies against ISO/IEC 27001 in 2012 69  Summary of findings:  The number of certificates issued in each surveyed country varies significantly  and unfortunately, for the majority of the surveyed countries there are no official statistics.  Certification companies provide information about the organisations they certify, but this  information is also not complete.  4.3 Validity and revocation of ISMS certificates  The ISMS certifications are based on ISO/IEC 17021.  The certification is subject to surveillance audits  and recertification. The audit programme shall include a two-stage initial audit, surveillance audits in  the first and second years, and a recertification audit in the third year prior to expiration of  certification. The three-year certification cycle begins with the certification or recertification  decision.  The surveillance audit programme shall include, at least  a) internal audits and management review,  b) a review of actions taken on nonconformities identified during the previous audit,  c) treatment of complaints,  d) effectiveness of the management system with regard to achieving the certified client's  objectives,  e) progress of planned activities aimed at continual improvement,  f) continuing operational control,  67 SWETIC, http://www.swetic.org/en/swetic-swedish-association-for-testing-inspection-and-certification-1  68 ISO survey conducted in 2012 , http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/certification/iso-survey.htm.  69 http://www.iso.org/iso/database_iso_27001_iso_survey.xls.  http://www.swetic.org/en/swetic-swedish-association-for-testing-inspection-and-certification-1 http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/certification/iso-survey.htm http://www.iso.org/iso/database_iso_27001_iso_survey.xls  Security certification practice in the EU  Information Security Management Systems - A case study  Version 1, October 2013  Page  16  g) review of any changes, and  h) use of marks and/or any other reference to certification.  The ISO/IEC 27001 certification is usually divided in a two-stage external audit process defined by  the ISO/IEC 17021 and ISO/IEC 27006 standards, while a third stage involves follow-up audits that  are carried out in order to verify that the organisation remain compliant to the standard.  Stage 1 is  dedicated to the review of the documented ISMS against the standard and Stage 2 to the review of  the implementation of the ISMS within the business and evidence of adherence. The third stage, as  mentioned above involves follow-up audits that are carried out in order to verify that the  organisation remain compliant to the standard. In the majority of the surveyed countries, the ISMS  certificates are granted for a three-year period, during which certified bodies need to be annually  audited to ensure on-going compliance with the standards. The certification can be renewed for  subsequent three-year periods. However this timeframe depends on scheme requirements.  The certificate can be revoked if the annual audit finds reasons for it. The ISO/IEC 17021 (which  regulates the activities of Certification Bodies) regulates both suspension and revocation of issued  certificates. Motivations are coded and described - at standard regulation level - by each  Certification Body.  The certification body shall suspend certification in cases when, for example, the  client's certified management system has persistently or seriously failed to meet certification  requirements, including requirements for the effectiveness of the management system, the certified  client does not allow surveillance or recertification audits to be conducted at the required  frequencies, or the certified client has voluntarily requested a suspension.  Summary of findings.  In the majority of the surveyed countries, the ISMS certificates are granted  for a three-year period, during which certified bodies need to be annually audited to ensure ongoing  compliance with the standards. The certificate can be revoked if the annual audit finds reasons for it.  4.4 Costs for an ISMS certificate  In practice, many certification bodies follow the guidance in ISO/IEC 27006 on the number of days  (Auditor Time Chart in annex C70) for calculating the minimum duration of an audit, for usage of  Certification and Accreditation Bodies. The cost will then be determined by applying the appropriate  daily rates to the days needed. According to the findings of the survey, the costs for the certification  depend on a number of factors, such as the type and size of the organisation, the scope of the  certification, the location of workplaces and operations.  Only one national correspondent provided  an estimate for the cost, stating that the auditor’s daily fee can vary between 800 and 1.000 EUR. In  addition to the costs for the certification audit, there is significant cost associated with the effort to  implement the ISMS in the organisation, to set up processes to gather and store evidence and to  train the employees.  Summary of findings.  The costs for an ISMS certificate depend on the number of days needed  (depending on the size and the type of organisation or the scope of the certification), the tariff  scheme of the certification body and the expertise/experience of the auditors applied.  4.5 Additional information on seals and certification schemes  Some of the surveyed countries provided information on other security seals and security  certification schemes that are delivered by accredited certification bodies. The French National  Agency of Information Security (ANSSI) recently published a document enlisting requirements  applicable to audit service providers regarding the security of information systems (the PASSI  70 http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=59144  Security certification practice in the EU  Information Security Management Systems - A case study  Version 1, October 2013  Page  17  standard). Such standard covers the following activities: architecture audit, configuration audit,  source code audit, intrusion tests, organizational and physical audit. The PASSI standard will be  integrated into the next version of the general security standard RGSv2. Upon the RGSv2’s  publication, public administrations shall refer to audit service providers complying with such  standards.71  In the Netherlands the Privacy-Audit-Proof certificate has been developed by the Dutch Data  Protection Authority72, while NEN 751073 is a national Dutch standard for healthcare information  security management. Finally the Swedish Certification Body for IT Security (CSEC) is the certification  body accredited by SWEDAC74  and operates as Sweden’s national certification body for IT security in  products and systems according to Common Criteria for Information Technology Security  Evaluation75.  Summary of findings.  Some countries have developed national certification schemes for specific  sectors. For instance in France ANSSI, the National Agency of Information Systems’ Security defined  a document enlisting requirements applicable to audit service providers regarding the security of  information systems (the PASSI standard), which is applicable to public authorities in terms of  information systems’ security. In the Netherlands the Privacy-Audit-Proof certificate has been  developed by the Dutch Data Protection Authority76, while NEN 751077 is a national Dutch standard  specific for healthcare information security management.  71 Further information can be found at: http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/fr/menu/actualites/publication-du-referentiel-d-exigences-applicable-aux- prestataires-d-audit-de.html.  72 http://www.dutchdpa.nl/downloads_audit/PrivacyAuditFramework.pdf  73 http://www.nen7510.org  74 http://www.fmv.se/en/Our-activities/CSEC---The-Swedish-Certification-Body-for-IT-Security/About-CSEC/.  75 http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org  76 http://www.dutchdpa.nl/downloads_audit/PrivacyAuditFramework.pdf  77 http://www.nen7510.org  http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/fr/menu/actualites/publication-du-referentiel-d-exigences-applicable-aux-prestataires-d-audit-de.html http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/fr/menu/actualites/publication-du-referentiel-d-exigences-applicable-aux-prestataires-d-audit-de.html http://www.dutchdpa.nl/downloads_audit/PrivacyAuditFramework.pdf http://www.nen7510.org/ http://www.fmv.se/en/Our-activities/CSEC---The-Swedish-Certification-Body-for-IT-Security/About-CSEC/ http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/ http://www.dutchdpa.nl/downloads_audit/PrivacyAuditFramework.pdf http://www.nen7510.org/  Security certification practice in the EU  Information Security Management Systems - A case study  Version 1, October 2013  Page  18  5 Practical experiences with the ISMS certification process  5.1 Private sector  5.1.1 Surveyed companies  In order to gather information about the practical experiences with the ISMS certification process in  the private sector and identify potential key success elements for European certification bodies,  national correspondents from the selected eleven European Member States78 carried out personal  interviews with companies from the private sector that have experiences with going through ISMS  certification.  The surveyed companies were all active in the IT industry and their profiles varied as  follows: two companies were IT service providers, two were trust service providers offering digital  certificates, two were IT consultancy companies, a communication service provider, a data centre  (outsourcing) provider, an identity service provider, a company active in product and people  identification and one specialised in the reuse of computers and equipment.  The companies cover a  broad range of size (from 11 to 5.000 employees) and all companies were interviewed on their  experiences for ISMS certification according to the ISO 27001 standard.  The interviews79 were  carried out with specialised employees from each company, who had the position of (Chief)  Information Security Officer, (Chief) Security Officer, Security Manager, Coordinator of Information  Security Management System or Risk Management Director. Thus they were highly qualified to  provide answers on the experiences of their company with ISMS certification.  Eight of the surveyed companies had prior experience with certification. All of them had gone  through the process of obtaining ISO 9001, while two of them had experience with ISO 20000 that  targets IT systems in general, but has also security part. Some of the companies have also  experiences with specific sector certification processes.  The certification processes covered in the majority of the examined countries all core processes and  services provided by the company. One of the examined companies excluded only two specific  controls concerning electronic commerce in the certification process. In three cases, ISMS  certification was pursued for specific processes, such as the deployment, supply and support of  managed information and communication technology services on different sites, outsourcing,  software development, deployment of LANs and WLANs, maintenance, or design, development,  implementation and administration of software.  Only one company had used security seals on their website, as they were WebTrust for CAs, while  the one company had acquired the official national seal for ISO27001.  5.1.2 Motivation for undergoing ISMS certification  The reasons for which the surveyed companies decided to obtain ISMS certification were very similar  among all companies and ranged from internal (e.g. improvement in quality) to external (e.g.  meeting clients expectations).  More specifically, the certification is seen as integrated into the company’s quality approach. In the  phase of preparation for the certification, all services of the company as are checked, which leads to  an improvement in quality. One company found that even the ordinary management of security  was greatly improved by having a formal system in place.  One company also stated that the  certificate raises the security-awareness of the employees.  78 See Annex I for a list of the national correspondents.  79 Due to the sensitivity of the information relating to ISMS certification, the interviewees preferred to remain anonymous.  Security certification practice in the EU  Information Security Management Systems - A case study  Version 1, October 2013  Page  19  Another incentive for the acquisition of an ISMS certificate is that it represents a marketing and  competitive advantage. The companies that obtained a certificate did not only aim at keeping their  existing customers satisfied, but also at gaining new ones. Actually, the use of certification as a  means to meet customer expectations has been mentioned as the most important incentive by the  surveyed companies. Obtaining the certificate has led to an increased assurance level perceived by  customers. In many cases, the clients actually requested the demonstration, with an  acknowledgment by an independent entity, that certain safeguards with regard to ISMS are met.  One of the surveyed companies stated that the customers are requesting every year more and more  for the so called “big 3” certificates (9001, 20000 and 27001), putting companies that have them at a  competitive advantage. One surveyed company actually decided to obtain the certification, because  it was working with government authorities that requested a managed security process from them.  Another reason for which the surveyed companies acquired the certificate is due to the fact that the  requirement to be certified is set in a growing number of procurement procedures.  Finally one company found that the decision to obtain certification under ISO 27001 was a natural  choice as it forms a good base for other assurance schemes.  5.1.3 Time period required for the preparation of the company in view of the certification  The time period required for the preparation of a company in order to undergo certification depends  on a number of factors, such as for example if the company has obtained another certificate or  whether several of the controls are already in place in the company. The time period that was  required for the surveyed companies in order to prepare for the certification varied between 3 and  18 months. The majority of the companies required about 6 to 12 months in order to complete the  preparation. Companies that already had experience with certification were already familiar with the  process and needed less time for preparation.  For example one company already had experience  from the certification of quality management systems as it was ISO 9001 certified and it needed  about six months. One of the companies explained that while the preparation phase took  approximately six months, 3-4 months were dedicated to the gathering of evidence of adherence.  Finally, two companies stated that the preparation took about 18 months, which included two-stage  reviews for quality checks on the way to the certification audit.  5.1.4 Time period required for the actual certification process  The time period required for the actual certification process did not exceed a week for the surveyed  companies.  The duration of the actual certification process depends of course on the size of the  organisation and the scope of the audit. The certification audit normally took two to six days, while  yearly audit took between one and three days. The time was longer in companies that were certified  for other/more standards at the same time.  Often the certification was divided in two stages that  were carried out on different time periods:  Stage 1 for a review of the documented ISMS against the  standard and Stage 2 for a review of the implementation of the ISMS within the business and  evidence of adherence.  5.1.5 Cost for certification  The cost for the certification, in the sense of the audit itself, in the case of majority of the surveyed  companies did not exceed the amount of 10.000 EUR, which in most cases was characterised as less  than 1% of the annual turnover.80 In all cases, however, the surveyed companies found that the cost  of the audit and certification is low compared to the added value for the company.  80 One company did not provide financial information due to their company policy.  Security certification practice in the EU  Information Security Management Systems - A case study  Version 1, October 2013  Page  20  5.1.6 Experiences from ISMS certification  One may think that companies, especially start-ups or SMEs, may find an ISMS certification as an  unwanted necessity and excessive cost to meet customer requirements.  However, the survey that  was conducted in eleven European Member States revealed that all surveyed companies had very  good experiences with ISMS certification. One of the companies found that ISMS certification brings  together “a wealth of industry experience and knowledge”, while another company characterised  ISMS certification as possibly “the company’s main strategic business asset”.  All surveyed companies found that the actual preparation of the company for the certification  increased internal awareness and contributed to the improvement of the processes and the offered  services.  Two companies stressed especially the importance of the fact that that the certification  was not a snapshot at a certain moment in time. Not only are there annual follow-up audits, as  foreseen by ISO 27001, but the changes in processes, controls and infrastructure are so drastic that  it wouldn’t be possible to put everything in place during the audit and not continue to implement it  further on, especially since it involves continuous improvement due to the annual auditing. One  company found that even the ordinary management of security was greatly improved by having a  formal system in place  All surveyed companies also had very positive experiences with the acceptance of the certification by  their customers. The certification contributed to an increased assurance level perceived by  customers and also opened new business opportunities. Finally, the certification was found very  useful in public procurement procedures, even when the certification was not obligatory  requirement.  5.2 Public sector  5.2.1 Surveyed companies  In order to gather information about the practical experiences with the ISMS certification process in  the public sector and identify potential key success elements for European certification bodies,  national correspondents from the selected eleven European Member States81 carried out personal  interviews with public bodies and agencies that have experiences with going through ISMS  certification. Eleven public organisations, one from each surveyed country, were surveyed. ISMS  certification is the public sector aims at raising the quality of the services that are offered to citizens.  However, ISMS certification of public bodies or agencies is not yet so widespread compared to the  private sector.82 Therefore it was not possible for all national correspondents to find an organisation  from the public sector that had acquired ISMS certification. Three of the surveyed companies  (Belgium, Germany, Spain) are in the preparation phase in order to obtain an ISMS certification.  Nevertheless they provided valuable information on their experiences so far in order to prepare for  the certification.  Few of the surveyed organisations had any previous experience of security certification schemes.  The French organisation was already familiar with the General Security Database (“Référenciel  Général de Sécurité” or the “RGS”) issued by ANSSI (“Agence Nationale de la Sécurité des Sytèmes d’  Information”, the National Agency of Information Systems” Security). RGS defines a set of security  rules applicable to the public authorities in terms of information systems’ security. The Dutch  organization had prior experience with a “Privacy Audit Proof” certificate83, which is a Dutch privacy  81 See Section I for the list of MSs and the rationale of the selection.  82 According to the ISO 2011 survey, out of the 6.314 ISO 27001 certificates that were obtained in 2011, only 106 fell under the category.  ‘public administration’ (http://www.iso.org/iso/database_iso_27001_iso_survey.xls).  83 https://www.privacy-audit-proof.nl/.  https://www.privacy-audit-proof.nl/  Security certification practice in the EU  Information Security Management Systems - A case study  Version 1, October 2013  Page  21  certification scheme based on a privacy audit framework developed under the auspices of the Dutch  Data Protection Authority. None of the organisations had used security seals.  The activities of the surveyed public organisations covered a broad range: the directorate general for  IT of a ministry and a ministry of transport, two municipalities, a health insurance body, a public  service in charge of employment, an organisation involved in the infrastructure of electronic health  cards, an organisation managing IT and data transmission infrastructure for specific functions,  regional land registers, an organisation providing bailiff, process serving and credit management  services and an agency that depends on ministry of industry.  Ten out of the eleven surveyed organisations were interviewed on their experiences for ISMS  certification according to the ISO 27001 standard. In one case, the public organisation had to comply  with a national certification scheme, which is actually very similar to the ISO 27001 certificate.  The interviews84 were carried out with specialised employees from each company, who had the  position of (Chief) Information Security Officer, (Chief) Security Officer, Data Protection and Security  Officer, IT Security Officer. Thus the interviewed experts were highly qualified to provide answers on  the experiences of their company with ISMS certification. One of them, specialist in internal security,  was actually certified Lead Auditor ISO27001: 2005.  5.2.2 Motivation for undergoing ISMS certification  All surveyed public organisations decided to obtain ISMS certification, because on the one hand they  realised the importance of information management in a secure way, and on the other hand they  wished to strengthen the confidence of citizens, or of companies that collaborate with them, in the  security of the IT and data management processes. One organisation highlighted that the  certification was used in order to promote customer take up for services that they were developing.  Another organisation stated that they decided to obtain the ISMS certificate because they did not  want security to be a separate process but rather to be integrated throughout their business  processes. The surveyed organisations that are active in the in area of health and deal with health  data considered ISMS certification as essential both for the citizens, as well as for their partners  (medical sector, health insurers…). In Germany, Slovakia and Spain national legislation required the  certification of information security processes in the sectors in which the surveyed organisations are  active.85 One organisation admitted that they obtained the ISO 27001 certification as part of  complying with the requirement to adhere to a sector scheme and that they would probably have  not pursued ISO 27001 certification alone otherwise.  5.2.3 Time period required for the preparation of the organisation in view of the certification  The time period required for the preparation of an organisation in order to undergo certification  depends on a number of factors, such as for example if the organisation has obtained another  certificate or whether several of the controls are already in place. The time period that was required  for the surveyed public sector organisations in order to prepare for the certification varied between  3 months and two years. Three of the interviewed organisations are still in the preparatory phase for  certification, while one prepared for the ISO 27001 together with ISO 9001 and therefore could not  estimate the preparation period that was required for the ISMS certification. Two organisations had  already prior security schemes in place and this shortened the preparation time they needed for the  84 Due to the sensitivity of the information relating to ISMS certification, the interviewees preferred to remain anonymous.  85 In Germany, the electronic health card system is specified by an organisation called Gematik, according to the requirements of which an  ISO27001 certification for the electronic health card infrastructure is required. Regulation of the Slovak Ministry of Finance 312/2010  contains requirements fr information security for public administration. In Spain, Public Administration Organisations are obliged to  comply with ENS, the National Security Scheme before 30 January 2014 (www.minhap.gob.es).  Security certification practice in the EU  Information Security Management Systems - A case study  Version 1, October 2013  Page  22  certification. Two organisations needed about 8 months, one 15 months, one 18 months and one 2  years.  5.2.4 Time period required for the actual certification process  The time period required for the actual certification process varied between the surveyed  companies, while three of the surveyed organisations have not been certified yet. The duration of  the actual certification process depends on the size of the organisation and the scope of the audit.  Often the certification was divided in two stages that were carried out on different time periods:  Stage 1 for a review of the documented ISMS against the standard and Stage 2 for a review of the  implementation of the ISMS within the business and evidence of adherence. The certification audit  normally took between 2 days and 2 weeks, while one organisation spent 4 weeks for the  certification process.  More specifically, two organisations spent 2 days, two spent 7 days, one spent  10 days, two organisations spent 2 weeks, and one spent 4 weeks. The time was longer in  organisations that were certified for other standards at the same time.  5.2.5 Cost for certification  The cost for the certification, in the sense of the audit itself, varies depending on the size of the  organisation, to processes that are being certified and the experience of the auditor.  For less than  one third of the surveyed organisations the cost did not exceed the amount of 10.000 EUR. For one  third of companies the cost was above 10.000 EUR and the remaining companies did not provide  values.  Three of the surveyed organisations have not been certified yet and did not provide any data  on cost.  5.2.6 Experiences from ISMS certification  The overall experiences of the surveyed public organisations with ISMS certification were positive.  The ISMS itself is a process-oriented management system and permits standardised management  and control of the required information security in the processing of comprehensive data sets as  defined in existing statutory provisions. The ISMS certification ensures a regular and systematic  identification of risks to information security, and the evaluation and reduction of such risks to an  acceptable and feasible degree by means of suitable security measures. In addition, the certification  permits to proceed to an annual audit of the organization’s good practices, which requires  continuous assessment with the aid of numerous system and process audits and leads to  improvements of the implemented system and thus improvements to the organisation of work.  Thanks to the calculation of security indicators reflecting the efficiency of the system, continuous  adjustment and further evolution in line with changing requirements can be achieved. ISMS  certification also allowed the management of information in a much more rigorous and deliberate  way than before. Moreover, this certification ensures sustainable security and safety in the  organization’s processes, which would not be possible without such certification. In short, ISMS  certification brought the organisation a lot of structure and strongly improved system availability.  With regard to the handling of personal data, on organisation found that ISMS certification  preserves the compliance of rules for the processing and handling of personal data. The certified  ISMS introduced also policy access rights to information systems and management of security  incidents and vulnerabilities to the surveyed organization.  One company referred to the limits of ISO 27001 certification, stating that an organisation could get  certified without really having implemented the processes and controls that have been written  down in the audited documents.  Security certification practice in the EU  Information Security Management Systems - A case study  Version 1, October 2013  Page  23  5.3 Summary of findings from the interviews with private companies and  public organisations  The interviews with private companies that had experiences with ISMS certification revealed the  following findings:   The time period required for the preparation of a company in order to undergo ISMS  certification depends on a number of factors, such as for example if the company has  obtained another certificate or whether several of the controls are already in place in the  company. The time period that was required for the surveyed companies in order to prepare  for the certification varied between 3 and 18 months.  The majority of the companies  required about 6 to 12 months in order to complete the preparation.   The time period required for the actual certification process did not exceed a week for the  surveyed companies.  The duration of the actual certification process depends of course on  the size of the organisation and the scope of the audit.   the cost for the certification, in the sense of the audit itself, in eight of the surveyed  companies did not exceed the amount of 10.000 EUR, which in most cases was characterised  as less than 1% of the annual turnover. In all cases, however, the surveyed companies found  that the cost of the audit and certification is low compared to the added value for the  company.   The use of certification as a means to meet customer expectations has been mentioned as  the most important incentive by the surveyed private companies. However, private  companies actually underwent ISMS certification when this was required either in order to  ensure collaboration with government authorities that requested a managed security  process from them or because the requirement to be certified is set in a growing number of  procurement procedures.   All surveyed companies found that the actual preparation of the company for the  certification increased internal awareness and contributed to the improvement of the  processes and the offered services.  All surveyed companies also had very positive  experiences with the acceptance of the certification by their customers.  The interviews with public organisations that had experiences with ISMS certification revealed the  following findings:   All surveyed public organisations decided to obtain ISMS certification, because on the one  hand they realised the importance of information management in a secure way, and on the  other hand they wished to strengthen the confidence of citizens, or of companies that  collaborate with them, in the security of the IT and data management processes   The time period required for the preparation of an organisation in order to undergo  certification depends on a number of factors, such as for example the size of the company, if  the organisation has obtained another certificate or whether several of the controls are  already in place.

Security certification practice in the EU  Information Security Management Systems - A case study  Version 1, October 2013  Page  25  6 Conclusions and recommendations  The number of certification bodies that have been accredited in the area of ISMS varies significantly  between the surveyed countries, ranging from only one, as in the case of Austria and Belgium, to  twenty-three in the United Kingdom. Similarly, the number of certificates issued in each surveyed  country varies significantly and unfortunately, for the majority of the surveyed countries there are  no official statistics.  Some certification companies provide information about the organisations they  certify, but this information is also not complete.  The main findings of the survey are:   There are no reliable statistics on the number of certificates and certified companies.   Certain MSs national laws require an information security certification in certain sectors,  such as public healthcare.   National authorities are encouraging the implementation of certification processes for ISMS  (e.g. by introducing specific information security certification requirements in case of  participation in public procurement).   Some MSs have developed national certification schemes for specific sectors.   Based on the survey, the large majority of the interviewed companies, which were awarded  an information security certificate, consider this useful for their functioning, as the  certification process ensures a regular and systematic identification of risks and evaluation,  etc. and also provides competitive advantages.   The costs for an ISMS certificate depend on the number of days needed (depending on the  size and the type of organisation or the scope of the certification), the tariff scheme of the  certification body and the expertise/experience of the auditors applied.   In the majority of the surveyed countries, the ISMS certificates are granted for a three-year  period, during which certified bodies need to be annually audited to ensure ongoing  compliance with the standards.  The certificate can be revoked if the annual audit finds  reasons for it.   The initial certification process requires more resources (especially for the preparation  stage) in the case of the first certification. The preparation stage requires between 3 months  and 2 years, while majority of the companies required 6 to 12 months. The actual  certification process takes two to six days for private companies and between two days to  two weeks for public organisations.  One may think that companies, especially start-ups or SMEs, may find an ISMS certification as an  unwanted necessity and excessive cost to meet customer requirements. This survey, conducted in  eleven European Member States, revealed positive perspective on ISMS certification for the case of  the surveyed companies.  The concluding remarks and recommendations are listed below:   There are limitations in the statistics on the existing certification processes.  We recommend  that policy makers should demand reliable statistics. The bodies issuing certificates should  keep updated public records on certificates that they have issued, on the specific version  of products/systems they certified, including information on the validity of the certificates.   Introducing and possibly requiring an additional certification related to privacy may be  cumbersome especially for SMEs.  Under the lead of the European Commission,  standardization bodies, and responsible stakeholders should work together to develop  Security certification practice in the EU  Information Security Management Systems - A case study  Version 1, October 2013  Page  26  best practices and standards combining the requirements for security and data protection  in order avoid duplication of work for the two certification areas.    There is a well-established legislation regarding accreditation and certification in the MSs.  When considering introducing certification for other purposes, i.e. for privacy/data  protection, the European Commission and the national policy makers should link such  initiatives with existing national accreditation structures.   There should be no possibility for an organisation to be certified without actually  implementing the processes and controls that have been described in the audited  documents.  Furthermore, due to the relatively long duration of the preparation stage, there  is a high probability that the updated versions of systems are not certified right away after  their implementation/deployment.  The national policy makers should ensure enforcement  of such requirements for genuine compliance for instance by applying sanctions and/or ad- hoc assessments carried on by third parties.

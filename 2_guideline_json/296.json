Active exploitation has been observed ever since on premises running MS Exchange  installations. Although the initial focus of malicious attacks was observed mainly in the US,  incidents rapidly expanded around the globe, including in the EU by an increasing number of  hacking groups.  In the EU, an increasing number of MS Exchange installations have also been found to be the  target of malicious attacks. Although the initial focus of attacks was on exfiltration of information,  attackers seem to be exploiting the MS exchange vulnerabilities to plant ransomware in order to  gain profits. Cases of such systems infected with the DearCry ransomware have been reported.  On 7th March 2021, the European Banking Authority (EBA) published a statement on their  website announcing that their Microsoft Exchange servers had been the victim of a cyber-attack,  as a result of the recently-disclosed zero-day vulnerabilities in the servers1. The incident has  been mitigated according to a later statement by EBA, without affecting confidentiality of EBA  systems and data2.  The EU Cyber Crises Liaison Organisation Network (CyCLONe) and the EU CSIRTs network  are monitoring the situation and collecting information.  SITUATION UPDATE3  Scans conducted by researchers indicate that on March 5th there were around 250,000  vulnerable servers. That number dropped to around 60,000 over the next 10 days. The initial  rush to patch by companies with good security posture has considerably lowered the number of  vulnerable systems exposed.  There are indications that threat actors are targeting Exchange Servers from infrastructure  hosted in a number of EU countries, Hong Kong, United States, Belize, Japan, and Singapore.  Wide scanning activities for the vulnerabilities have been observed from systems in the EU, the  United States, Hong Kong and China.  Botnet operators are likely to be leveraging the vulnerabilities to expand their operations. The  LemonDuck botnet has been observed exploiting the vulnerabilities recently.  Ransomware operators are also leveraging the vulnerabilities and it is likely that this activity will  continue. The new DearCry ransomware has been deployed following successful exploitation  with victims observed in some EU countries, Indonesia, India and the United States.  1 https://www.eba.europa.eu/cyber-attack-european-banking-authority  2 https://www.eba.europa.eu/cyber-attack-european-banking-authority-update-3  3 Source: ENISA trusted partners  https://www.eba.europa.eu/cyber-attack-european-banking-authority https://www.eba.europa.eu/cyber-attack-european-banking-authority-update-3  MICROSOFT EXCHANGE VULNERABILITIES  March 2021  4  ASSESSMENT  This threat is categorised as severe due to active exploitation in the wild and the popularity and  widespread utilisation of MS exchange server products.  The first observed APT group to have exploited the vulnerabilities has been the “Hafnium”  cyberespionage group, which targets primarily entities in the United States across a number of  industry sectors, including infectious disease researchers, law firms, higher education  institutions, defence contractors, policy think tanks, and NGOs. In the meantime, several other  APT groups and threat actors have used the vulnerabilities to exfiltrate data and spread  malware in the EU and across the world.  ADVICE AND MITIGATION  MS Exchange vulnerabilities once exploited may lead to network compromise, data exfiltration  and ransomware attacks. Senior management of public and private organisations and  companies should consider these types of attacks probable and of a high risk. Appropriate aid  should be allocated for detection and removal from 3rd parties if they do not possess the  necessary capacities to deal with this threat.  The vulnerabilities being exploited are:  - CVE-2021-26855, a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Microsoft  Exchange that could be exploited by an attacker to authenticate as the Exchange  server by sending arbitrary HTTP requests  - CVE-2021-26857, an insecure deserialization issue that resides in the Unified  Messaging service. This flaw allows an attacker with administrative permission to run  code as SYSTEM – the highest privilege level – on the Exchange server.  - CVE-2021-26858 and CVE-2021-27065, both of which allow authenticated users to  arbitrarily write files to the Exchange Server  The combination of a vulnerability that allows unauthorised actors to authenticate and several  vulnerabilities that allow arbitrary write access to authenticated users is what makes these  vulnerabilities very dangerous.  Organisations using affected Microsoft Exchange versions are recommended to patch the flaws  immediately and examine their systems for indicators of compromise4. Microsoft is continuously  updating its relative advisories and has published relative guidance and a mitigation tool5.

Due to the high probabilities of attackers having attempted to gain persistence and performed  lateral movement, any infrastructure with vulnerable Exchange servers should be carefully  monitored for additional compromised systems.

    "abstract": "This ENISA situation report provides an assessment as well as advice and mitigation measures for the MS Exchange vulnerabilities. The threat for the new updates has been assessed as severe and ENISA considers attacks probable and of high risk. The Agency calls on organisations using affected Microsoft Exchange versions to patch the flaws immediately and thoroughly investigate for potential signs of compromise. MS Exchange vulnerabilities once exploited may lead to network compromise, data exfiltration and ransomware attacks. Across the EU, an increasing number of MS Exchange installations have also been found to be the target of malicious attacks."

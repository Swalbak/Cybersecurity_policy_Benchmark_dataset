In 2012 the EC drew up detailed guidelines1 on how to make  best use of ICT standards in tender specifications in the context of Action 23 of the Digital Agenda of  Europe and in 2013 issued a Communication on Standardisation and Public Procurement2 . Use of  standards promotes a level playing-field, allowing a broader range of participation, including SMEs, and  avoids “lock-in” to specific brands with proprietary features. However, due to the evolution of technology  in ICT and the lack of expertise to decide which standards are relevant and appropriate for the particular  ICT needs, it is not always the case that ICT procurements are standards-based.  Therefore, it is important to help procurers overcome these difficulties through common and sufficiently  generic minimum indispensable requirements that will cover the whole lifecycle of the procured product  or service and will eventually contribute to an appropriate (and desired) minimum level of security and  resilience. In this context, ENISA set up an Expert Group composed of experts nominated from Member  States to identify existing best practises and requirements and to use them to identify a set of  indispensable baseline security requirements. This collaborative approach will support all Digital Single  Market stakeholders to develop a more unified, integrated and cost-effective approach for standards- based procurement of secure ICT products, and helps providers in specifically dealing with security risks  involved in the procurement and outsourcing processes.  1.1 Purpose  This document can be of use to suppliers and procurement officers when planning, offering and purchasing  ICT products, systems and services. It is meant as a practical, technologically neutral document with clear,  simple and sector-agnostic minimum necessary indispensable requirements for secure ICT products and  services. Any ICT product or service that fails to be compliant with one or more of the minimum security  requirements should be considered as insecure and therefore it shall not be purchased or put in operation  on the Digital Single Market (DSM). It focusses on a few indispensable conditions, commonly agreed  among experts and based on standards and best practices, but does not claim to cover completely and  sufficiently all possible security requirements. It is not intended to substitute existing security certifications  schemes and standards: instead it is a complementary security baseline.  1 http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=2326  2 http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=2327  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/ https://www.facebook.com/ENISAEUAGENCY https://twitter.com/enisa_eu http://www.linkedin.com/company/european-network-and-information-security-agency-enisa- https://www.youtube.com/user/ENISAvideos http://www.enisa.europa.eu/front-page/RSS http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=2326 http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=2327  Indispensable baseline security requirements for the procurement of secure ICT products and services  v.1.0 | Public | December 2016  02  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  ENISA - The EU Cyber Security Agency  Follow the EU cyber security affairs of ENISA:  www.enisa.europa.eu & Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, RSS feeds  1.2 Approach  Figure 1 above depicts the four principles that were stated by the Expert Group as a basis for the  development of the indispensable requirements. Components of the system, the services that they and  the system use, and the services the system provides shall be secure:  • By design – the product, or service, has been conceived, designed and implemented to ensure the  key security properties are maintained: availability, confidentiality, integrity and accountability.  • By default – the product, or service, is supplied with the confirmed capability to support these  security properties at installation.  • Throughout their lifecycle – security should be maintained from initial deployment through  maintenance to decommissioning.  • And that each of the above principles should be verifiable.  The indispensable baseline security requirements are expressed as a limited collection of principles  written, as far as possible, in non-specialist terms – a set of “Commandments” listed in Section 2. In  addition, Section 3 provides explanations and examples than can be used for compliance checks.  1.3 Obligations for the Customer (Procurer)  The security requirements for the specific ICT system will have wider, or different, scope than those stated  in this baseline and will be identified by a risk-assessment that takes account of the desired system  objectives and the prevailing security landscape.  The baseline may be sufficient but users of this guide  must ensure that security requirements beyond the baseline are fulfilled effectively by appropriate  measures.

The approach to developing such  requirements was outlined along to the requirements themselves followed by clarifying examples of  detailed issues that must be addressed. Envisioned next steps include consultation with European Cyber  Security Organisation (ECSO) community as the established representative of private sector from all  sectors, to initiate a broader discussion, structured feedback and improvements in order to find consensus  on the applicability of this document. Subject to advice from the community, future work could include a  mapping of the baseline requirements to a catalogue of relevant standards, and further detail on the  verification that ICT products are secure: by design, by default, and throughout their life.

In 2012 the EC drew up detailed guidelines1 on how to make  best use of ICT standards in tender specifications in the context of Action 23 of the Digital Agenda of  Europe and in 2013 issued a Communication on Standardisation and Public Procurement2 . Use of  standards promotes a level playing-field, allowing a broader range of participation, including SMEs, and  avoids “lock-in” to specific brands with proprietary features. However, due to the evolution of technology  in ICT and the lack of expertise to decide which standards are relevant and appropriate for the particular  ICT needs, it is not always the case that ICT procurements are standards-based.  Therefore, it is important to help procurers overcome these difficulties through common and sufficiently  generic minimum indispensable requirements that will cover the whole lifecycle of the procured product  or service and will eventually contribute to an appropriate (and desired) minimum level of security and  resilience. In this context, ENISA set up an Expert Group composed of experts nominated from Member  States to identify existing best practises and requirements and to use them to identify a set of  indispensable baseline security requirements. This collaborative approach will support all Digital Single  Market stakeholders to develop a more unified, integrated and cost-effective approach for standards- based procurement of secure ICT products, and helps providers in specifically dealing with security risks  involved in the procurement and outsourcing processes.  1.1 Purpose  This document can be of use to suppliers and procurement officers when planning, offering and purchasing  ICT products, systems and services. It is meant as a practical, technologically neutral document with clear,  simple and sector-agnostic minimum necessary indispensable requirements for secure ICT products and  services. Any ICT product or service that fails to be compliant with one or more of the minimum security  requirements should be considered as insecure and therefore it shall not be purchased or put in operation  on the Digital Single Market (DSM). It focusses on a few indispensable conditions, commonly agreed  among experts and based on standards and best practices, but does not claim to cover completely and  sufficiently all possible security requirements. It is not intended to substitute existing security certifications  schemes and standards: instead it is a complementary security baseline.  1 http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=2326  2 http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=2327  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/ https://www.facebook.com/ENISAEUAGENCY https://twitter.com/enisa_eu http://www.linkedin.com/company/european-network-and-information-security-agency-enisa- https://www.youtube.com/user/ENISAvideos http://www.enisa.europa.eu/front-page/RSS http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=2326 http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=2327  Indispensable baseline security requirements for the procurement of secure ICT products and services  v.1.0 | Public | December 2016  02  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  ENISA - The EU Cyber Security Agency  Follow the EU cyber security affairs of ENISA:  www.enisa.europa.eu & Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, RSS feeds  1.2 Approach  Figure 1 above depicts the four principles that were stated by the Expert Group as a basis for the  development of the indispensable requirements. Components of the system, the services that they and  the system use, and the services the system provides shall be secure:  • By design – the product, or service, has been conceived, designed and implemented to ensure the  key security properties are maintained: availability, confidentiality, integrity and accountability.  • By default – the product, or service, is supplied with the confirmed capability to support these  security properties at installation.  • Throughout their lifecycle – security should be maintained from initial deployment through  maintenance to decommissioning.  • And that each of the above principles should be verifiable.  The indispensable baseline security requirements are expressed as a limited collection of principles  written, as far as possible, in non-specialist terms – a set of “Commandments” listed in Section 2. In  addition, Section 3 provides explanations and examples than can be used for compliance checks.  1.3 Obligations for the Customer (Procurer)  The security requirements for the specific ICT system will have wider, or different, scope than those stated  in this baseline and will be identified by a risk-assessment that takes account of the desired system  objectives and the prevailing security landscape.  The baseline may be sufficient but users of this guide  must ensure that security requirements beyond the baseline are fulfilled effectively by appropriate  measures.

The approach to developing such  requirements was outlined along to the requirements themselves followed by clarifying examples of  detailed issues that must be addressed. Envisioned next steps include consultation with European Cyber  Security Organisation (ECSO) community as the established representative of private sector from all  sectors, to initiate a broader discussion, structured feedback and improvements in order to find consensus  on the applicability of this document. Subject to advice from the community, future work could include a  mapping of the baseline requirements to a catalogue of relevant standards, and further detail on the  verification that ICT products are secure: by design, by default, and throughout their life.

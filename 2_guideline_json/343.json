    "document(english)": "ENISA ETL2020 - Cyber Espionage  From January 2019 to April 2020  Cyber  espionage ENISA Threat Landscape  Overview  Cyber espionage is considered both a threat and a motive in the  cybersecurity playbook. It is defined as ‘the use of computer networks to  gain illicit access to confidential information, typically that held by a  government or other organisation’. 1  In 2019, many reports revealed that global organisations consider cyber  espionage (or nation-state-sponsored espionage) a growing threat  affecting industrial sectors, as well as critical and strategic infrastructures  across the world, including government ministries, railways,  telecommunication providers, energy companies, hospitals and banks.  Cyber espionage focuses on driving geopolitics, and on stealing state and  trade secrets, intellectual property rights and proprietary information in  strategic fields. It also mobilises actors from the economy, industry and  foreign intelligence services, as well as actors who work on their behalf. In  a recent report, threat intelligence analysts were not surprised to learn  that 71% of organisations are treating cyber espionage and other threats  as a ‘black box’ and are still learning about them.  In 2019, the number of nation-state-sponsored cyberattacks  targeting the economy increased and it is likely to continue this way.  In detail, nation-state-sponsored and other adversary-driven attacks on  the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) are increasing in the utilities, oil and  natural gas (ONG), and manufacturing sectors. Furthermore, cyberattacks  conducted by advanced persistent threat (APT) groups indicate that  financial attacks are often motivated by espionage. Using tactics,  techniques and procedures (TTPs) akin to those of their espionage  counterparts, groups such as the Cobalt Group, Carbanak and FIN7 have  allegedly been targeting large financial institutions and restaurant chains  successfully.  2  3   The European Parliament’s Committee of Foreign Affairs called upon  Member States to establish a cyber-defence unit and to work together  on their common defence. It stated that ‘the Union’s strategic  environment has been deteriorating … in order to face the multiple  challenges that directly or indirectly affect the security of its Member  States and its citizens; whereas issues that affect the security of EU  citizens include: armed conflicts immediately to the east and south of  the European continent and fragile states; terrorism – and in particular  Jihadism –, cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns; foreign  interference in European political and electoral processes’. 42   Threat actors motivated by financial, political, or ideological gain will  increasingly focus attacks on supplier networks with weak cybersecurity  programs. Cyber espionage adversaries have slowly shifted their attack  patterns to exploiting third- and fourth-party supply chain partners. 1  20%  Data breaches motivated  by cyber espionage  2  Incidents motived by  cyber espionage  11,2%  38%  Malicious actors connected  with nation-states  Cyber espionage incidents  involving phishing  63%  4   South Korean’s Ministry of National Defence announced that unknown  hackers had compromised computer systems at the ministry’s  procurement office.  3   The United States Department of Justice announced a foreign state- sponsored operation with a botnet meant to disrupt by targeting  companies in the media, aerospace, financial, and critical infrastructure  sectors.  16   The Norwegian software firm Visma revealed that it had been targeted  by hackers who were attempting to steal trade secrets from the firm’s  clients.  4   Individuals were caught in the early stages of gaining access to  computer systems of several political parties and of the Australian  Federal Parliament.  17   European aerospace company Airbus revealed that it was targeted by  alleged nation-state sponsored hackers who stole personal and IT  identification information of many employees.  19   Following an attack on Indian military forces in Kashmir, Pakistani  hackers targeted almost 100 Indian government websites and critical  systems.  5   Indonesia’s National Election Commission reported that Chinese and  Russian individuals had probed the voters’ database ahead of  presidential and legislative elections in the country.  20   Foreign hackers targeted several European government agencies ahead  of EU elections in May.  21   The Australian Signal Directorate revealed that it had conducted  cyberattacks against ISIS in the Middle East.  22   The Finish police probed a DoS attack against the web service used to  publish the vote tallies from Finland’s elections.  6   Amnesty International’s Hong Kong Office announced that it had been  the victim of an cyberattack.  23   The Israeli Defence Forces launched an airstrike on the Hamas after  they unsuccessfully attempted to hack Israeli targets.  7  Incidents  5   An Iranian network of websites and accounts was allegedly used to  spread out false information about United Sates, Israel and Saudi  Arabia.  24   Croatian government agencies were targeted in a series of attacks by  unidentified state-sponsored hackers. The malware payloads were  Empire backdoor and SilentTrinity, neither of which had been seen  before.  26   Libya arrested two men who were accused of working with a Russian  ‘troll farm’ to influence the elections in several African countries.27   Several major German industrial firms including BASF, Siemens, and  Henkel announced that they had been the victim of a state-sponsored  hacking campaign.  28   A state-sponsored group allegedly conducted a series of cyberattacks  against Egyptian journalists, academics, lawyers, human rights activists,  and politicians.  8   A state-sponsored hacking group targeted diplomats and high-profile  Russian speaking users in Eastern Europe using malware dubbed Attor.  29   An Israeli cybersecurity firm was found to have sold spyware used to  target senior government and military officials in at least 20 countries by  exploiting a vulnerability in WhatsApp.  32   A 7 year campaign by an unidentified Spanish-language espionage  group was revealed to have resulted in the theft of sensitive mapping  files from senior officials in the Venezuelan Army.  10   A state-sponsored cyberespionage group allegedly conducted a  phishing campaign targeting Chinese government agencies and state- owned enterprises for information related to economic trade, defence issues, and foreign relations.  33   The Czech Foreign Ministry fell victim to a cyberattack by an unspecified  foreign state.  34   A non-state actor targeted the British Labour party with a major DDoS attack that temporarily took the party’s computer systems offline ahead  of the national elections’.  36  Xiaoqing Zheng, an American citizen of Chinese descent, was accused of  spying against General Electric (GE). Mr. Zheng allegedly stole GE’s  turbine technology secrets and delivered them to a Chinese business  man who allegedly, delivered them to a Chinese officials. Mr Zheng  worked for GE between 2008 and 2018. 15  The United Sates justice department accused the two men of stealing  information to advance their own business interests in two turbine  research and development companies - Liaoning Tianyi Aviation  Technology Co Ltd and Nanjing Tianyi Avi Tech Co Ltd. 47  The modus operandi of this inside threat actor included:   copying secrets into a USB drive until GE blocked the use of these  devices;   encrypting the secrets and use steganography to hide data files in the  binary code of digital photo files;   plugging an iPhone to the work desktop computer to copy the image;   sending the files to his personal e-mail address.  _ The General Electric case  6  Incidents  7  Because of the comprehensive nature of this threat, several of the  mitigation measures recommended for other threats in this report could  be employed as part of the following baseline mitigation controls 2 :   Identify mission critical roles in the organisation and estimate their  exposure to espionage risks. Evaluate such risks based on business  information (i.e. business intelligence).   Create security policies that accommodate human resource, business  and operational security controls to cater for risk mitigation. These  should include rules and practices for awareness raising, corporate  governance and security operations.   Establish corporate practices to communicate, train staff in the rules  developed.   Develop an evaluation criteria (KPIs) to benchmark the operation and  adapt it to upcoming changes.   Create a Whitelist for critical application services depending on the risk  level assessed.   Assess vulnerabilities and patch the software regularly, especially for  systems that are on the perimeter.   Implement the need-to-know principle for defining access rights and  establish controls to monitor misuse of privileged profiles.   Establish content filtering for all inbound and outbound channels (e.g. e-  mail, web, network traffic).  _ Mitigation measures  8  References  1. “Cyber Threatscape Report. 2019.” IDefense - Accenture.  https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/pdf-107/accenture-security-cyber.pdf  2. “Data Breach Investigations Report 2020” DBR & Verizon.  https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/2019-data-breach-investigations-report- emea.pdf  3.

    "original document": "ENISA ETL2020 - Cyber Espionage  From January 2019 to April 2020  Cyber  espionage ENISA Threat Landscape  Overview  Cyber espionage is considered both a threat and a motive in the  cybersecurity playbook. It is defined as ‘the use of computer networks to  gain illicit access to confidential information, typically that held by a  government or other organisation’. 1  In 2019, many reports revealed that global organisations consider cyber  espionage (or nation-state-sponsored espionage) a growing threat  affecting industrial sectors, as well as critical and strategic infrastructures  across the world, including government ministries, railways,  telecommunication providers, energy companies, hospitals and banks.  Cyber espionage focuses on driving geopolitics, and on stealing state and  trade secrets, intellectual property rights and proprietary information in  strategic fields. It also mobilises actors from the economy, industry and  foreign intelligence services, as well as actors who work on their behalf. In  a recent report, threat intelligence analysts were not surprised to learn  that 71% of organisations are treating cyber espionage and other threats  as a ‘black box’ and are still learning about them.  In 2019, the number of nation-state-sponsored cyberattacks  targeting the economy increased and it is likely to continue this way.  In detail, nation-state-sponsored and other adversary-driven attacks on  the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) are increasing in the utilities, oil and  natural gas (ONG), and manufacturing sectors. Furthermore, cyberattacks  conducted by advanced persistent threat (APT) groups indicate that  financial attacks are often motivated by espionage. Using tactics,  techniques and procedures (TTPs) akin to those of their espionage  counterparts, groups such as the Cobalt Group, Carbanak and FIN7 have  allegedly been targeting large financial institutions and restaurant chains  successfully.  2  3   The European Parliament’s Committee of Foreign Affairs called upon  Member States to establish a cyber-defence unit and to work together  on their common defence. It stated that ‘the Union’s strategic  environment has been deteriorating … in order to face the multiple  challenges that directly or indirectly affect the security of its Member  States and its citizens; whereas issues that affect the security of EU  citizens include: armed conflicts immediately to the east and south of  the European continent and fragile states; terrorism – and in particular  Jihadism –, cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns; foreign  interference in European political and electoral processes’. 42   Threat actors motivated by financial, political, or ideological gain will  increasingly focus attacks on supplier networks with weak cybersecurity  programs. Cyber espionage adversaries have slowly shifted their attack  patterns to exploiting third- and fourth-party supply chain partners. 1  20%  Data breaches motivated  by cyber espionage  2  Incidents motived by  cyber espionage  11,2%  38%  Malicious actors connected  with nation-states  Cyber espionage incidents  involving phishing  63%  4   South Korean’s Ministry of National Defence announced that unknown  hackers had compromised computer systems at the ministry’s  procurement office.  3   The United States Department of Justice announced a foreign state- sponsored operation with a botnet meant to disrupt by targeting  companies in the media, aerospace, financial, and critical infrastructure  sectors.  16   The Norwegian software firm Visma revealed that it had been targeted  by hackers who were attempting to steal trade secrets from the firm’s  clients.  4   Individuals were caught in the early stages of gaining access to  computer systems of several political parties and of the Australian  Federal Parliament.  17   European aerospace company Airbus revealed that it was targeted by  alleged nation-state sponsored hackers who stole personal and IT  identification information of many employees.  19   Following an attack on Indian military forces in Kashmir, Pakistani  hackers targeted almost 100 Indian government websites and critical  systems.  5   Indonesia’s National Election Commission reported that Chinese and  Russian individuals had probed the voters’ database ahead of  presidential and legislative elections in the country.  20   Foreign hackers targeted several European government agencies ahead  of EU elections in May.  21   The Australian Signal Directorate revealed that it had conducted  cyberattacks against ISIS in the Middle East.  22   The Finish police probed a DoS attack against the web service used to  publish the vote tallies from Finland’s elections.  6   Amnesty International’s Hong Kong Office announced that it had been  the victim of an cyberattack.  23   The Israeli Defence Forces launched an airstrike on the Hamas after  they unsuccessfully attempted to hack Israeli targets.  7  Incidents  5   An Iranian network of websites and accounts was allegedly used to  spread out false information about United Sates, Israel and Saudi  Arabia.  24   Croatian government agencies were targeted in a series of attacks by  unidentified state-sponsored hackers. The malware payloads were  Empire backdoor and SilentTrinity, neither of which had been seen  before.  26   Libya arrested two men who were accused of working with a Russian  ‘troll farm’ to influence the elections in several African countries.27   Several major German industrial firms including BASF, Siemens, and  Henkel announced that they had been the victim of a state-sponsored  hacking campaign.  28   A state-sponsored group allegedly conducted a series of cyberattacks  against Egyptian journalists, academics, lawyers, human rights activists,  and politicians.  8   A state-sponsored hacking group targeted diplomats and high-profile  Russian speaking users in Eastern Europe using malware dubbed Attor.  29   An Israeli cybersecurity firm was found to have sold spyware used to  target senior government and military officials in at least 20 countries by  exploiting a vulnerability in WhatsApp.  32   A 7 year campaign by an unidentified Spanish-language espionage  group was revealed to have resulted in the theft of sensitive mapping  files from senior officials in the Venezuelan Army.  10   A state-sponsored cyberespionage group allegedly conducted a  phishing campaign targeting Chinese government agencies and state- owned enterprises for information related to economic trade, defence issues, and foreign relations.  33   The Czech Foreign Ministry fell victim to a cyberattack by an unspecified  foreign state.  34   A non-state actor targeted the British Labour party with a major DDoS attack that temporarily took the party’s computer systems offline ahead  of the national elections’.  36  Xiaoqing Zheng, an American citizen of Chinese descent, was accused of  spying against General Electric (GE). Mr. Zheng allegedly stole GE’s  turbine technology secrets and delivered them to a Chinese business  man who allegedly, delivered them to a Chinese officials. Mr Zheng  worked for GE between 2008 and 2018. 15  The United Sates justice department accused the two men of stealing  information to advance their own business interests in two turbine  research and development companies - Liaoning Tianyi Aviation  Technology Co Ltd and Nanjing Tianyi Avi Tech Co Ltd. 47  The modus operandi of this inside threat actor included:   copying secrets into a USB drive until GE blocked the use of these  devices;   encrypting the secrets and use steganography to hide data files in the  binary code of digital photo files;   plugging an iPhone to the work desktop computer to copy the image;   sending the files to his personal e-mail address.  _ The General Electric case  6  Incidents  7  Because of the comprehensive nature of this threat, several of the  mitigation measures recommended for other threats in this report could  be employed as part of the following baseline mitigation controls 2 :   Identify mission critical roles in the organisation and estimate their  exposure to espionage risks. Evaluate such risks based on business  information (i.e. business intelligence).   Create security policies that accommodate human resource, business  and operational security controls to cater for risk mitigation. These  should include rules and practices for awareness raising, corporate  governance and security operations.   Establish corporate practices to communicate, train staff in the rules  developed.   Develop an evaluation criteria (KPIs) to benchmark the operation and  adapt it to upcoming changes.   Create a Whitelist for critical application services depending on the risk  level assessed.   Assess vulnerabilities and patch the software regularly, especially for  systems that are on the perimeter.   Implement the need-to-know principle for defining access rights and  establish controls to monitor misuse of privileged profiles.   Establish content filtering for all inbound and outbound channels (e.g. e-  mail, web, network traffic).  _ Mitigation measures  8  References  1. “Cyber Threatscape Report. 2019.” IDefense - Accenture.  https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/pdf-107/accenture-security-cyber.pdf  2. “Data Breach Investigations Report 2020” DBR & Verizon.  https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/2019-data-breach-investigations-report- emea.pdf  3.

Established in 2004 and  strengthened by the EU  Cybersecurity Act, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity contributes to EU cyber policy, enhances the trustworthiness of ICT  products, services and processes with cybersecurity certification schemes,  cooperates with Member States and EU bodies, and helps Europe prepare  for the cyber challenges of tomorrow. Through knowledge sharing,  capacity building and awareness raising, the Agency works together with  its key stakeholders to strengthen trust in the connected economy, to  boost resilience of the Union’s infrastructure, and, ultimately, to keep  Europe’s society and citizens digitally secure.

    "document(english)": "1  Introduction  Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) scenarios enable organisations to take advantage of new technologies faster. It also has  the potential to reduce hardware costs and improve organisational productivity and flexibility. However, BYOD also  introduces new risks to an organisation’s business and the security of its information, which need to be carefully  considered before implementation.  Initial considerations  What are the legal implications?  Legislation such as the Privacy Act 1988, Archives Act 1983 and Freedom of Information Act 1982 can affect whether  an organisation is able to implement BYOD in their environment and, if so, what controls need to be implemented to  ensure all legal obligations can be fulfilled.  As BYOD can increase liability risk to an organisation, organisations will need to be ready to manage issues such as  software licencing, inadvertent damage to an employee’s personal data, or expectations of privacy in the event of an  investigation, Freedom of Information request or incident response activity.  What are the financial implications?  Organisations implementing BYOD may benefit from reduced hardware costs should employees pay for their own  devices. However, there can often be an overall cost increase as a result of the need to support a variety of employee  devices, manage security breaches or cover some costs associated with an employee’s device or its use.  What are the security implications?  There are a number of security implications associated with BYOD. For example, employee devices storing unprotected  corporate information could be lost or stolen, or employees could use unapproved applications and cloud services to  handle or store corporate information.  Organisation are also likely to have reduced assurance in the integrity and security posture of devices that are not  corporately managed as employees will often lack the knowledge and motivation to reduce risks associated with their  devices.

Purpose  Take a risk management approach to implementing enterprise mobility. A change in work practices will mean a change  in risk profile. Use a risk management process to balance the benefits of BYOD with associated business and security  risks. Determine whether there is a justifiable business case to allow the use of employee devices to access and  distribute corporate information.  Planning  Consider the different options available and make an informed decision. Ask which employees in your organisation  require enterprise mobility either via the use of organisation‐owned devices or personally-owned devices. What  corporate information do your employees need access to and how will they access it?  Policy  Develop and communicate a sound usage policy. This should be based on a risk assessment and clearly communicate  expected behaviour from employees. Establish what financial and technical support employees can expect to receive.  Be consultative in your approach – the most effective scenarios are jointly developed by business and legal  representatives, security staff, system administrators and employees themselves. This will help your organisation  develop a realistic policy and processes which all stakeholders are willing to adhere to.  Polish  Review your usage policies and monitor your enterprise mobility implementation. Regular reporting to senior  executives will help them understand and address unacceptable risks.  Contact your security team. In particular, seek answers to the following questions:   How do we protect our corporate information from unauthorised access? Do we keep corporate information in a  data centre instead of on employee devices?   How do we protect corporate information on our network? Do we limit and audit the use of employee devices on  the corporate network? Is multi‐factor authentication used for remote access?   How do we protect our networks from malicious software? Is an employee’s personal operating environment  separated from the work environment on their devices (e.g. through use of a managed container)? Does our  organisation require security patching, and limit privileges and access to corporate information from employee  devices?   How do we reduce the risk caused by lost or stolen employee devices? For example, do we have the technical and  legal ability, and employee agreement, to remotely locate or wipe their devices? Are employees required to  regularly backup work data from their devices to organisation‐sanctioned backup servers?  3  Further information  The Information Security Manual is a cyber security framework that organisations can apply to protect their systems  and data from cyber threats. The advice in the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents, along with its Essential  Eight, complements this framework.

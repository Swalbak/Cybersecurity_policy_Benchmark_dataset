General context/the eIDAS Regulation on eID and trust services  Introduction  Regulation (EU) No 910/20141 (hereafter the eIDAS Regulation), on electronic identification and trust  services for electronic transactions in the internal market, provides a regulatory environment for electronic  identification of natural and legal persons and for a set of electronic trust services, namely electronic  signatures, seals, time stamps, registered delivery services and certificates for website authentication2.  The eIDAS Regulation sets the principle of non-discrimination of the legal effects and admissibility of  electronic signatures, electronic seals, electronic time stamps, electronic registered delivery services and  electronic documents as evidence in legal proceedings. Courts (or other bodies in charge of legal  proceedings) cannot discard them as evidence only because they are electronic but have to assess these  electronic tools in the same way they would do for their paper equivalent.  Whether you are a large company, a SME or a citizen trying to complete an electronic transaction in  another EU country, e.g. submit a call for tender or register as a student in another EU Member State (MS),  besides reducing time and costs, the eIDAS Regulation will ensure cross border recognition of notified  national eID mean and qualified trust services supporting your electronic transaction. Hence it will boost  trust, security and convenience.  Since 1 July 2016, most provisions of the eIDAS Regulation are directly applicable in the 28 EU Member  States’ legal framework overcoming problems of fragmented national regimes. It provides legal certainty  and fosters the usage of eID means and trust services for online access and online transactions at EU level.  The eIDAS Regulation will ensure that people and businesses can use their national eIDs to access public  services in other EU countries where eIDs are required for such an access at national level. It also creates  an EU wide internal market for qualified trust services by ensuring their recognition and workability across  borders and considering them equivalent to traditional paper based processes.  Opportunities brought by the eIDAS Regulation  The opportunities reside in leveraging eID and electronic trust services as key enablers for making national  and cross-border electronic transactions more secure, more convenient, trustworthy and benefiting from  legal certainty.  The broader adoption of EU-wide recognised eID means and of electronic trust services will facilitate and  boost the digital transformation of organisations, be it public administrations or businesses, enhance  customer experience, improve the security of electronic transactions and stimulate the provisioning of  new and innovative services.  To this end, a large number of sectors (e.g. finance, banking, transport, insurance, health, sharing  economy, trading, etc.) where obligations exist for security, reliable identification, strong authentication  and legal certainty of evidences, will be positively affected. The eIDAS Regulation will indeed allow citizens,  businesses and public administrations to conveniently meet such obligations for any cross-border  electronic transaction using the recognised eID means and (qualified) trust services of their choice.  1 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/ES/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG  2 See Glossary or Art.3.16 of the eIDAS Regulation for the definition of trust services.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/ES/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  07  Without undergoing identity verification based on physical presence, but by using MS notified eID means  of a level “high”, one should for example be able to use public services in another country or banks may  accept such eID to open a bank account3. By relying on a qualified electronic registered delivery service,  one will benefit, all over the EU, from the presumption of the integrity of the registered data, the sending  of that data by the identified sender, its receipt by the identified addressee and the accuracy of the date  and time of sending and receipt indicated by that qualified trust service.  Specific role of the qualified trust services  To further enhance in particular the trust of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and consumers in  the internal market and to promote the use of trust services and products, the eIDAS Regulation  introduces the notions of qualified trust service and qualified trust service provider with a view to  indicating requirements and obligations that ensure high-level security of whatever qualified trust service  or product is used or provided and, as a consequence, are granted a higher presumption of their legal  effect.  Therefore, when looking for trust services, selecting qualified ones ensures benefiting from a high level of  security and legal certainty of trust services. E.g., qualified electronic time stamp shall enjoy, all over the  EU, the presumption of the accuracy of the date and the time it indicates and the integrity of the data to  which the date and time are bound.  Initiation and supervision of qualified trust services  In order to ensure high-level security of qualified trust services, the eIDAS Regulation foresees an active  supervision scheme of qualified trust service providers (QTSP) and the qualified trust services (QTS) they  provide (hereafter referred to as a QTSP/QTS) by the national competent supervisory body (SB) that  supervises, ex ante and ex post, fulfilment of the QTSP/QTS requirements and obligations. All those  requirements must be met by the QTSP/QTS before providing the very first qualified trust service output,  e.g. before issuing the very first qualified time stamp in the case of QTSP providing qualified time stamping  services.  Before a TSP/TS is granted a qualified status (QTSP/QTS), it will be subject to a pre-authorisation process –  the so called initiation process. QTSPs may only begin to provide the qualified trust service after the  qualified status has been granted by the competent supervisory body and indicated in the national trusted  list. From there, the supervision scheme covers the full life cycle of each QTS and each QTSP, from its  genesis until its termination.  In practice, where TSPs, without qualified status, intend to start providing qualified trust services, they  shall submit to the supervisory body a notification of their intention together with a conformity  assessment report issued by an “eIDAS” accredited conformity assessment body. Before notifying the  competent supervisory body of their intention to start providing qualified trust services, the future  QTSP/QTS must hence successfully pass an external assessment (audit) to confirm it fulfils the eIDAS  requirements. That audit must be conducted by a conformity assessment body specifically accredited to  carry out assessments of QTSP/QTS. The audit results in a formal conformity statement confirming - if such  is the case - that the QTSP/QTS meets all the applicable requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. Based on  the notified information including the report of such an audit, the competent SB will formally verify that  3 National legislations on prevention of money laundering may currently may force identity verification to be based  on physical presence. Furthermore, the use by the private sector of electronic identification means under a notified  scheme is on a voluntarily basis only (see Recital 17 of the eIDAS Regulation).  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  08  the candidate QTSP/QTS meets the applicable eIDAS requirements and, in case of positive verification, it  will undertake the publication of the grant of the qualified status for that QTSP/QTS in the national trusted  list.  It is only when its qualified status is published in the corresponding national trusted list that the QTSP/QTS  is authorised to provide the corresponding QTS.4  Note: A TSP cannot be qualified without providing at least one qualified trust service (Art.3.20 of the  eIDAS Regulation). A TSP is granted a qualified status separately for each type of qualified trust service  covered by the eIDAS Regulation. E.g. a QTSP qualified for the provisioning of qualified certificates for  electronic signatures is not per se granted a qualified status for the issuance of qualified electronic  time stamps; it must first complete the full pre-authorisation process and have its qualified status  granted for the creation of qualified electronic time stamps published explicitly in the national trusted  list before issuing qualified time stamps in addition to the creation of qualified certificates for  electronic signatures. There are nine different types of QTSs defined by the eIDAS Regulation for  which a qualified status is granted separately: creation of qualified certificates for electronic  signatures; creation of qualified certificates for electronic seals, creation of qualified certificates for  website authentication, qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures, qualified  preservation service for qualified electronic seals, qualified validation service for qualified electronic  signatures, qualified validation service for qualified electronic seals, qualified electronic time stamps  services, and qualified electronic registered delivery services.5  Moreover, for a given type of QTS, if a QTSP has already been granted a qualified status for the  provision of one or more such trust services intends to provide another QTS of the same type but  under significantly different practices and/or policies, then it may be required to pass an ad hoc or  complete conformity assessment before been confirmed a qualified status for that new way to  provide such a QTS (Art. 24.2.(a), Art.20.2).  For marketing purposes, once qualified, a QTSP/QTS may use the EU Trust Mark for qualified trust services  when promoting its QTS. That trust mark shown in Figure 1 can only be used by a QTSP to “label” its QTS. It  can be used on any support provided it meets requirements from Art.23 of the eIDAS Regulation (e.g. a link  to the corresponding national trusted list where consumers may verify the granted qualified status must  be displayed on the QTSP’s website) and rules of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/806.6  Basically, this secondary legislation sets the form, colour and size of the EU trust mark, sets the obligation  to clearly indicate the qualified service that the EU trust mark pertains to, and allows association with  other graphical or textual elements provided that certain conditions are met.7  4 The eIDAS Regulation foresees transitional measures (Art.51) that ensures certification-service-provider issuing  qualified certificates to natural persons under Directive 1999/93/EC to be considered as QTSPs issuing certificates for  electronic signatures under the Regulation until they submit a conformity assessment report and the completion of  its assessment by the supervisory body. The submission of that report shall not occur later the 1 July 2017 otherwise  the CSP shall not be considered as a QTSP from 2 July 2017.  5 See Annex A.7 for further details.  6 Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/806 of 22 May 2015 laying down specifications relating to the form  of the EU trust mark for qualified trust services (Text with EEA relevance). OJ L 128, 23.5.2015, p. 13–15.  7 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/eu-trust-mark for more guidance on the use of that trust  mark, downloadable images, user manual and answers to frequently asked questions.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2015.128.01.0013.01.ENG https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/eu-trust-mark  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  09  Figure 1 EU trust mark for qualified trust services  The use of the EU trust mark, which is voluntary, aims to foster transparency of the market and help  consumers distinguishing between qualified trust services and non-qualified ones. Although based on self- assessment, it gives the assurance that the trust service providers and the trust services provided by them  are qualified and comply with the rules set out in the eIDAS Regulation, thus ensuring a high quality which  is regulated throughout the EU.  Once granted a qualified status, QTSPs and their QTSs have the obligation to pass, and submit to the  competent supervisory body a conformity assessment report (CAR) issued by an accredited CAB confirming  at least every 24 months, that the QTSP and the QTSs it provides fulfil the requirements laid down in the  Regulation. Competent supervisory bodies are also allowed, at their own discretion and at any time, to  audit themselves any QTSP/QTS for which they are competent or to request an accredited CAB to perform  an ad hoc audit.  QTSPs and their QTSs are supervised for their entire lifecycle, from their genesis to their termination. In  particular, in order to ensure sustainability and durability of QTSs, as well as to ensure proper termination  and user’s confidence in their provision, QTSPs must maintain, at all times, an up-to-date termination plan.  That plan is to be agreed by the SB upon initiation and regularly checked for compliance during the life of  the QTSP/QTS.  Scope of the present document and relationship with other recommendations  This document is one deliverable out of a series whose objective is to propose guidelines aimed at  facilitating the implementation of the provisions related to trust services of the eIDAS Regulation in the  area of qualified trust services8.  This document proposes guidelines on the initiation of qualified trust services pursuant to Art.21.1 of the  eIDAS Regulation.  It should be read together with the “Guidelines on Supervision of Qualified Trust  Services”9.  The target audience of the document are trust service providers (including individuals, businesses and  public administrations) who intend to start providing qualified trust services, those Member States  supervisory bodies designated to carry out supervisory activities under the eIDAS Regulation, and  conformity assessment bodies.  The objective of the document is to support TSPs intending to provide qualified trust services and  supervisory bodies in their respective tasks and duties during the preparation phase, the notification  phase, the initial verification of compliance with the eIDAS Regulation and the effective grant of the  qualified status through the publication of an updated national trusted list. The guidelines cover the  procedures and formats for initiating a qualified trust service.  The guidelines shall enable supervisory  bodies to clarify the rules, requirements and recommendations for a TSP to notify its intention to start  8 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services/guidelines/  9 See the above footnote.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services/guidelines/  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  10  providing qualified trust services. The guidelines for the notifying TSPs aim to facilitate the implementation  of the preparation of the provision of their qualified trust services and the notification phase of the  initiation process as foreseen by the eIDAS Regulation.  The present document is organised to provide information and guidance with regards to:   The provision of recommendations and guidelines to Supervisory Bodies and to Trust Service Providers  (section 2).   The eIDAS Regulation provisions related to the initiation of Qualified Trust Services (section 3).   The initiation and supervision activities, process flow as well as the accreditation of CABs in accordance  with the eIDAS Regulation (section 4).   The format and procedure for notification under Art.21.1 of the eIDAS Regulation (section 5).   The initial verification of the notified QTSP/QTS with the eIDAS requirements & communication of the  granted qualified status for inclusion in the national TL (section 6).   The Supervisory Body resources and organisational measures (section 7).  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  11  2. Guidelines on the Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  Introduction  The eIDAS Regulation sets the principle of non-discrimination of the legal effects and admissibility of  electronic signatures, electronic seals, electronic time stamps, electronic registered delivery services and  electronic documents as evidence in legal proceedings. Courts (or other bodies in charge of legal  proceedings) cannot discard them as evidence only because they are electronic but have to assess these  electronic tools in the same way they would do for their paper equivalent.  To further enhance in particular the trust of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and consumers in  the internal market and to promote the use of trust services and products, the eIDAS Regulation  introduces the notions of qualified trust service and qualified trust service provider with a view to  indicating requirements and obligations that ensure high-level security and a higher presumption of their  legal effect.  In order to ensure high-level security of qualified trust services, the eIDAS Regulation foresees an active  supervision scheme of qualified trust service providers (QTSP) and the qualified trust services (QTS) they  provide (hereafter referred to as a QTSP/QTS) by the national competent supervisory body (SB) that  supervises, ex ante and ex post, fulfilment of the QTSP/QTS requirements and obligations.  Before a TSP/TS is granted a qualified status (QTSP/QTS), it will be subject to a pre-authorisation process –  the so called initiation process. QTSPs may only begin to provide the qualified trust service after the  qualified status has been granted by the national supervisory body and indicated in the national trusted  list². From there, the supervision scheme covers the full life cycle of each QTS and each QTSP, from its  genesis until its termination.  Initiation of qualified trust services  In practice, the initiation process through which a TSP, without qualified status, that intends to start  providing qualified trust services, is granted a qualified status is made of the following steps (see section 4  for a detailed analysis):  1. Preparation: The TSP designs, sets up, implements, tests and deploys in pre-production the QTS it  intends to provide, in line with the eIDAS requirements. In parallel, the TSP establishes the relevant  documentation that will demonstrate its compliance with the eIDAS requirements. An “eIDAS”  accredited conformity assessment body (CAB)10 assesses the conformity of the TSP and the QTS it  intends to provide with the eIDAS requirements. The conformity assessment report (CAR) must prove  the compliance of the TSP and the QTS it intends to provide with the eIDAS requirements and not with  standards. Standards might nevertheless be a tool used by TSPs to support the demonstration of their  compliance with eIDAS.  2. Notification: The TSP notifies the SB its intention to become qualified together with the conformity  assessment report (CAR) issued by the “eIDAS” accredited CAB.  10 That assessment must be conducted by a CAB specifically accredited by a national accreditation body (NAB) under  Regulation (EC) 765/2008 to carry out assessments of QTSP/QTS against the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation  (Art.3.18).  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  12  3. Initial verification of compliance: The SB verifies whether or not the TSP and the QTS it intends to  provide meet the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation in order to be granted a qualified status. Final  decision is in the hands of the SB. The latter may rely upon the information provided as part of the  notification procedure, including the conformity assessment report, but is equally entitled to request  further information and may take a duly justified decision that goes against the conformity assessment  report. In that case, as for all its decisions, the SB should respect, in particular, the principles of good  administration, including the obligation to give reasons for its decisions, as well as the principle of  proportionality. Upon positive verification by the SB that the TSP and the QTS it intends to provide  meet the eIDAS requirements, the SB grants the qualified status to the TSP/TS and informs the body in  charge of the national trusted list for the purpose of updating this list.  4. Publication of the qualified status in the national trusted list: Upon notification by the SB that the  notifying TSP/TS has been granted a qualified status, the body in charge of the national trusted list  updates the list accordingly.  It is only when its qualified status is published in the corresponding national trusted list that the QTSP is  authorised to provide the corresponding QTS11.  The following sections proposes guidelines12 to SBs, TSPs, and CABs on initiation of qualified trust services  pursuant to Art.21.1 of the eIDAS Regulation.  11 The eIDAS Regulation foresees transitional measures (Art.51) that ensures certification-service-provider issuing  qualified certificates to natural persons under Directive 1999/93/EC to be considered as QTSPs issuing certificates for  electronic signatures under the Regulation until they submit a conformity assessment report and the completion of  its assessment by the supervisory body. The submission of that report shall not occur later the 1 July 2017 otherwise  the CSP shall not be considered as a QTSP from 2 July 2017.  12 The use of specific verbs (SHALL, SHOULD and MAY) are used in accordance with the ETSI-guide,  https://portal.etsi.org/Portals/0/TBpages/edithelp/Docs/AGuideToWritingWorldClassStandards.pdf  https://portal.etsi.org/Portals/0/TBpages/edithelp/Docs/AGuideToWritingWorldClassStandards.pdf  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  13  Recommendations for Supervisory Bodies  The following are recommendations for supervisory bodies in the context of the initiation of QTS:  SB.1 – Supervisory body resources  (a) Make sure to be given the necessary powers and adequate resources for the exercise of its tasks.  (b) Make sure to establish, document and maintain the necessary policies, processes and procedures  for the realisation of the supervisory activities foreseen in the eIDAS Regulation, including those  related to the management of the national trusted lists.  (c) To this extent, follow recommendations provided in section 6 of this document.  SB.2 – Preliminary interactions with prospective QTSPs  (a) In order to allow an efficient initiation process, as stressed by Recital (45) of the eIDAS Regulation,  preliminary interactions between prospective QTSPs and the national SB body are encouraged  with a view to facilitating the due diligence leading to the provisioning of QTSs.  (b) Besides CID (EU) 2015/1505 requirement13 on the publication of specific information on the  underlying supervision scheme, SBs should publicize information about the initiation process and  in particular the notification format and procedure, as well as information on the subsequent  supervision process.  SB.3 – Format and procedure for notification under Art.21.1 of the eIDAS Regulation  (a) Make sure that the specifications and requirements on the format and procedure for notification  under Art.21.1 of the eIDAS Regulation are properly communicated to the candidate TSPs and  made available to the public.  (b) Follow recommendations provided in section 4 of this document on format and procedure for  notification.  SB.4 – Confidentiality between SB and notifying (Q)TSP  (a) Unless already available in the public domain, the SB should limit disclosure of  information/documentation provided by notifying (Q)TSP within its own organisation, to its  directors, officers, members and/or employees having a need to know. Unless otherwise foreseen  by European or national laws, and in particular the eIDAS Regulation, the SB shall not disclose such  information/documentation to any third party.  SB.5 – “eIDAS” accreditation scheme for CABs  (a) Interactions are encouraged between the SB and the local national accreditation body (NAB), and  where applicable the foreign NAB having accredited CAB selected by the TSP notifying its intention  to provide QTS or candidate for such a notification, with a view to facilitating the verification of  correct accreditation of the CAB selected by the notifying TSP to carry its assessment and the  assessment of the notified QTS against the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.  13 See Annex I, Chapter II, Scheme information URI (clause 5.3.7) of Commission Implementing Decision (EU)  2015/1505 of 8 September 2015 laying down technical specifications and formats relating to trusted lists pursuant to  Article 22(5) of the eIDAS Regulation.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  14  (b) Make sure that information about the accredited CABs and the underlying eIDAS accreditation  scheme is available from the NAB website and communicated/notified to the EC (or the body  designated to centralise such information if any).  (c) Make sure to consider as eligible and equivalent all CABs accredited by any NAB signatory of the  European co-operation for Accreditation (EA) Multilateral Agreement (MLA) and all CARs delivered  by them provided they are accredited in accordance with the eIDAS Regulation (Art.3.18, Art.20.1).  Consider any CAB or CAR as non-eligible when this is not the case. See section 3.4 of this document  for further guidance.  SB.6 – QTSP/QTS audit criteria & the structure of the initiation CAR  (a) Both for conducting Art.21 initial verification and for verifying the eligibility of CABs and CARs  notified under Art.21.1, make sure that QTSP/QTS are assessed for compliance against each and  every applicable requirement of the eIDAS Regulation.  (b) Make sure and verify that the CAR explicitly confirms and bears sufficient information  demonstrating that the assessed QTSP/QTS fulfil the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.  (c) Follow recommendations of section 4.5 of this document with regards to the recommended  structure and content of CARs.  SB.7 – Initial verification of the notified QTSP/QTS with the eIDAS requirements  (a) Make sure that the notifying TSP fulfils the requirements on the format and procedure for  notification under Art.21.1 of the eIDAS Regulation and that the QTSP/QTS are assessed for  compliance against each and every applicable requirement of the eIDAS Regulation.  (b) Follow recommendations provided in section 6 of this document when conducting initial  verification.  SB.8 – Communication of the granted qualified status and inclusion in the national trusted list  (a) The SB and the TLSO shall conform to CID 2015/1505/EU. See section 2.4 of this document for  guidance on the granularity of the qualified status assignment.  (b) In particular, the SB and the TLSO shall respect the timing constraints clarified by this CID  (enforcing clause 5.5.5 of ETSI TS 119 612 v2.1.1) making sure that the date, indicated in the  corresponding national trusted list, of the grant of the qualified status, the date of signing of the  trusted list and the effective date of publication of that trusted list are all aligned to the same date  and that no back dating is allowed.  SB.9 – Cooperation with other EU MS SBs  (a) It is recommended that SBs cooperate to the specification of one (or a limited set) of eIDAS  compliant conformity assessment scheme(s) once a sufficient maturity has been reached in the  effective implementation and use of those schemes by accredited CABs to assess QTSP/QTS and by  NABs to accredit CABs in accordance with eIDAS Regulation.  The standardisation of such  scheme(s) would later open the doors to a potential referencing in eIDAS implementing acts  foreseen in Art.20.4.  (b) It is recommended to SBs to cooperate under Art.18 of the eIDAS Regulation to set-up a single and  centralised dissemination point providing to the public, information, and any change thereto,  about each of the EA MLA signatory NABs, whether they operate an accreditation scheme in  accordance with the eIDAS Regulation, details regarding such an accreditation scheme, accredited  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  15  CABs and for which QTPS/QTS, accredited CABs conformity assessment activities (e.g. certification  certificates), etc.  (c) Cooperation under Art.18 with other EU MS SBs is strongly recommended when notifying TSP  activities and operations related to the provision of notified QTS are spread across national  borders. See companion document “guidelines for supervision of qualified trust service providers”  for further guidelines on such cooperation.  SB.10 – Good administration principles  (a) With regards to their activities, SBs should respect, in particular, the principles of good  administration, including the obligation to give reasons for its decisions, as well as the principle of  proportionality.  Recommendations for Trust Service Providers  The following are recommendations for trust service providers in the context of the initiation of QTS:  TSP.1 – Preparation to the provision of QTS as a QTSP  (a) Where TSPs, without qualified status, intend to start providing QTSs, they should design and test  the organisational, physical and technical implementation of those trust services, as well as their  corresponding practices, policies, procedures, processes and documentation in line with the  requirements laid down in the eIDAS Regulation.  (b) For that purpose, TSPs should first consider the publication by the competent SB of the  specifications and requirements on the format and procedure for notification under Art.21.1 of the  eIDAS Regulation. In particular, they should organise their preparation for compliance with the  requirements laid down in the eIDAS Regulation in line with the specifications and  recommendations or requirements from the competent SB on the content and structure of the  CAR they need to obtain from an eIDAS accredited CAB. See section 3.5 of this document for  further details on the recommended structure of an eIDAS CAR.  (c) TSPs can select any CAB accredited in any EU MS provided the CAB has been accredited in  accordance with Art.3.18 of the eIDAS Regulation (see section 0 of this document for further  guidance). Before contracting any such CAB, TSPs should however make sure that the candidate  CAB and the CAR it will issue in case of positive assessment will meet the expectations or  requirements of the eIDAS Regulation and of the competent SB. In particular they shall make sure  that the CAR shall confirm the compliance of the assessed QTSP/QTS with the requirements of the  eIDAS Regulation (e.g. and not with whatever standard; the CAR may however confirm compliance  to any set of standards in addition to confirming that the eIDAS requirements are fulfilled but the  main purpose of CAR submitted to the SB under Art.21.1 of the eIDAS Regulation shall be to  confirm that the assessed QTSP/QTS fulfil the requirements laid down in the eIDAS Regulation).  (d) Appropriate preliminary interactions with the national SB is recommended.  (e) Standards and normative documents may be of great help to ensure best practices are followed  and to maximise interoperability of the implemented services. Specific standards having been  designed aiming to enable compliant implementation meeting the eIDAS Regulation requirements.  ETSI TR 119 00014 is the overview document to obtain information on which CEN or ETSI standards  14 ETSI TR 119 000: “Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI); The framework for standardization of signatures:  overview”.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  16  that may be considered when implementing a specific type of (qualified) trust service. It should be  made clear nevertheless that it is not mandatory and it cannot be made mandatory to comply with  any standard. No standard, at the date of publication of this document has yet been formally  assessed as meeting QTSP/QTS requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. Furthermore ENISA  published an analysis of standards related to TSPs, mapping the eIDAS requirements to existing  standards15. It concluded that the analysed standards usually cover some requirements in part or  whole but also led, however, to a shortlist of gaps where specific eIDAS requirements have yet to  be addressed in EU standards (ETSI/CEN/CENELEC) or international ones.  (f) When notifying TSPs intend to provide QTS so that it meets requirements from another application  domain, provided they are not in contradiction with the eIDAS requirements, they may be required  to comply with specific standards or normative requirements. For example, QTSP providing  services consisting in the issuance of qualified certificates for website authentication (QWACs) may  be required to meet specific standards to meet the CA/Browser Forum requirements and  requirements from Browsers or widely deployed applications owners16. (Q)TSPs willing to benefit  from recognition in both eIDAS and non-eIDAS worlds (e.g. CA/Browser Forum) should ensure that  the conformity assessments they pass to demonstrate compliance with the eIDAS requirements  can be of benefit in the demonstration of their compliance with those non-eIDAS requirements  and that those requirements and their implementation by the (Q)TSP are not in contradiction with  the eIDAS Regulation.  (g) In addition to any applicable national language, all relevant (Q)TSP/(Q)TS documentation should be  made available in UK English in order to facilitate cross-border provision of services.  TSP.2 – Notification of the intention to provide QTS as a QTSP  (a) Where TSPs, without qualified status, intend to start providing QTSs, they need to submit to the SB  a notification of their intention together with a CAR issued by a CAB.  (b) For that purpose, they have to meet the specifications and recommendations or requirements  from the competent SB on the content and structure of the CAR they need to obtain from an  accredited CAB.  (c) See section 4 of this document for guidance on format and procedure for notification.  TSP.3 – Understanding the granularity of the identification of a trust service to which a qualified  status is granted  (a) TSPs and QTSPs should understand the granularity of the identification of a trust service to which a  qualified status is granted, as discussed in section 3.4 of this document, to identify when they are  required to notify the initiation of a new QTS and when they actually need to notify any change to  an existing QTS or that existing service being subject to routine supervision and 2-yearly audits.  TSP.4 – Preliminary interactions with competent SB  15 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/tsp_standards_2015/at_download/fullReport.  16 Users of compliant QTSPs will then benefit from the recognition by CA/Browser Forum member’s applications such  as Internet browser software that will then display enhanced indication of the corresponding certified website  identity by changing the appearance of its display (i.e. colours, icons, animation, and/or additional website  information) to reflect its trustworthiness.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/tsp_standards_2015/at_download/fullReport  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  17  (a) In order to allow an efficient initiation process, as stressed by Recital (45) of the eIDAS Regulation,  preliminary interactions between prospective QTSPs and the national SB are encouraged with a  view to facilitating the due diligence leading to the provisioning of QTSs.  Recommendations for Conformity Assessment Bodies  The following are recommendations for CABs in the context of the assessment of (Q)TSP/(Q)TS:  CAB.1 – eIDAS accreditation requirements for CABs assessing a QTSP/QTS  Make sure to be properly accredited in accordance with the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. In  particular:   Art.3.18 of the eIDAS Regulation requires CABs to be accredited in accordance with Regulation (EC) No  765/2008 in a way that such accreditation ensures the accredited CABs are competent to carry out  conformity assessment of a QTSP/QTS against the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.   The resulting conformity assessment report to be submitted to the supervisory body by the assessed  (Q)TSP, whether in the context of a 2-yearly regular audit (Art.20.1), an ad hoc audit (Art.20.2) or an  initiation audit (Art.21.1) must be such that it confirms, when this is the case, that the assessed  (Q)TSP/(Q)TS fulfil all the applicable QTSP/QTS requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.   The conformity assessment scheme (including requirements on the CAB, requirements on the auditing  rules under which the CAB will carry out their conformity assessment and the effective set of criteria,  control objectives and controls against which it will assess a QTSP/QTS with the aim of confirming that  it fulfils the eIDAS requirements) may be defined by the CAB itself, the EU MS supervisory body, or any  other body possessing the necessary technical competence.  CAB.2 – Structure of eIDAS CAR  Follow recommendations provided in section 4.5 of this document.  CAB.3 – Preliminary interactions with national SBs  In order to facilitate evaluation of CARs notified under the eIDAS Regulation and the evaluation of  (Q)TSP/(Q)TS by the SB of the EU MS in which CABs are active, preliminary interactions between CABs and  those SBs are encouraged.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  18  3. eIDAS Regulation provisions related to the initiation of qualified trust  services  Supervisory bodies  Art. 17 of the eIDAS Regulation requires EU MS to designate a supervisory body established in their  territory (or, upon mutual agreement with another Member State, a supervisory body established in that  other Member State) to be responsible for supervisory tasks in their territory. Each EU MS is further  required to give such a body the necessary powers and adequate resources for the exercise of those  supervisory tasks (see Art.17.4 of the eIDAS Regulation).  QTSP/QTS initiation  The legal obligations related to the initiation of QTSPs/QTSs are mainly derived from Art.21 of the eIDAS  Regulation as listed here after:   Art.21.1. - Where trust service providers, without qualified status, intend to start providing qualified trust  services, they shall submit to the supervisory body a notification of their intention together with a conformity  assessment report issued by a conformity assessment body.   Art.21.2. - The supervisory body shall verify whether the trust service provider and the trust services provided  by it comply with the requirements laid down in this Regulation, and in particular, with the requirements for  qualified trust service providers and for the qualified trust services they provide.  If the supervisory body concludes that the trust service provider and the trust services provided by it comply  with the requirements referred to in the first subparagraph, the supervisory body shall grant qualified status  to the trust service provider and the trust services it provides and inform the body referred to in Article 22(3)  for the purposes of updating the trusted lists referred to in Article 22(1), not later than three months after  notification in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article.  If the verification is not concluded within three months of notification, the supervisory body shall inform the  trust service provider specifying the reasons for the delay and the period within which the verification is to be  concluded.   Art.21.3. - Qualified trust service providers may begin to provide the qualified trust service after the qualified  status has been indicated in the trusted lists referred to in Article 22(1).  Recital (45) of the eIDAS Regulation also states that “in order to allow an efficient initiation process, which  should lead to the inclusion of qualified trust service providers and the qualified trust services they provide  into trusted lists, preliminary interactions between prospective qualified trust service providers and the  competent supervisory body should be encouraged with a view to facilitating the due diligence leading to  the provisioning of qualified trust services”.  CABs and CARs  The conformity assessment body (CAB) and the conformity assessment report (CAR) referred to in Art.21.1  are further specified by or further specifications can be derived from the following:  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  19   Art.3.(18) defines a ‘conformity assessment body’ as a body defined in point 13 of Article 2 of  Regulation (EC) No 765/2008,17,18 which is accredited in accordance with that Regulation as  competent to carry out conformity assessment of a qualified trust service provider and the qualified  trust services it provides.   Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, Art.2.(13) defines:  o a ‘conformity assessment body’ as a body that performs conformity assessment activities  including calibration, testing, certification and inspection”,  o a ‘conformity assessment’ as the process demonstrating whether specified requirements  relating to a product, process, service, system, person or body have been fulfilled,  o ‘accreditation’ as an attestation by a national accreditation body that a conformity  assessment body meets the requirements set by harmonised standards and, where  applicable, any additional requirements including those set out in relevant sectoral  schemes, to carry out a specific conformity assessment activity;  o a ‘national accreditation body’ as the sole body in a Member State that performs  accreditation with authority derived from the State.   Art.20.1 of the eIDAS Regulation requires that the purpose of the audit shall be to confirm that the  qualified trust service providers and the qualified trust services provided by them fulfil the  requirements laid down in this Regulation. Consequently, the resulting conformity assessment  report needs to include a formal conformity statement confirming, when applicable, that the  audited QTSP/QTS meets all the applicable requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.  The Commission did not adopt any implementing act with regards to the supervision of qualified trust  services providers (Art.20.4) or the initiation of qualified trust services (Art.21.4).  Neither the business nor the technical model can be imposed upon the QTSPs nor a specific standard to be  followed for the QTS it provides. (Q)TSP/(Q)TS have to demonstrate their compliance (building upon  standards if it deems it appropriate) with the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation while the supervisory  body cannot refuse to grant the qualified status solely on the grounds that the proposed model does not  comply with a given standard or a given business/technical model. QTSP/QTS are free to define the way to  proceed to the implementation of the eIDAS applicable requirements, whether operationally,  organisationally or technically.  Granularity of qualified status assignment  The present section discusses the granularity of the assignment of a qualified status to a QTSP/QTS, both in  the context of the related information appearing in the national trusted list and its impacts on the need to  process to the Art.21.1 initiation or to the Art.24.2.(a) notification of change in case of any change in the  provision of a QTS.  A TSP cannot be deemed to be of a qualified level without providing at least one qualified trust service  (Art.3.20 of the eIDAS Regulation). The qualified status is granted both to a TSP and to the trust service it  provides when it has been included in the corresponding national trusted list after it has been verified by  the competent supervisory body (SB) that both the TSP and the trust services provided by it (TSP/TS) comply  with the requirements laid down in this Regulation, and in particular, with the requirements for qualified  17 Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the  requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products and repealing  Regulation (EEC) No 339/93 (Text with EEA relevance). OJ L 218, 13.8.2008, p. 30–47.  18 See Annex A.5 for what Regulation (EC) 765/2008 brings as advantages to SBs and to TSPs.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32008R0765  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  20  trust service providers and for the qualified trust services they provide (for QTSP/QTS). A TSP is granted a  qualified status separately for each type of qualified trust service covered by the eIDAS Regulation. The  granularity in terms of what QTS may exist in the sense of this Regulation is limited to that closed list of QTS  for which there are applicable requirements in the Regulation (see Annex A.7).  Example: A TSP that is granted a qualified status for the provision of a service providing qualified  certificates for electronic signatures is not to be considered as qualified for the provision of any other  qualified trust service, including the provision of qualified certificates for electronic seals or for website  authentication, the provision of qualified electronic time stamps, etc., unless it has been granted a  qualified status for such other QTS.  The granularity of the identification in the national trusted lists of the technical instance of the eIDAS  qualified trust service to which the qualified status is granted is actually clarified by Commission  Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/150519. It corresponds to the level of the “Service digital identity” field as  specified in ETSI TS 119 612 v2.1.1 on which the CID relies to establish the content and define the technical  specifications and formats for the national trusted lists. In a trusted list, a qualified trust service to which a  qualified status is granted is identified by the public key20 identified by the “Service digital identity” field of  the corresponding trusted list service entry of a listed TSP entry. The type of qualified trust service for which  the qualified status is granted is identified by the combination of the “Service type identifier” field and the  “additional Service Information” service information extension when present and further specifying the type  of service21.  When based on public key infrastructure (PKI) public key-technology, the public key referring to the “Service  digital identity” field can be associated:   either with the technical unit that is directly issuing, under the name of the listed TSP, the qualified  trust service output (e.g. a qualified certificate for electronic signature, a qualified time stamp, a  qualified electronic delivery evidence, a qualified validation result report on the qualified validation  of a qualified electronic seal, etc.),   or with a technical unit that is issuing digital certificates to one or more technical units that in turn  are directly issuing the qualified trust service output under the name of the listed TSP or from which  a certification path can be established “down to” one or more technical units that are issuing the  qualified trust service output under the name of the listed TSP.  On one hand, to the level of information provided in the trusted list, it is the public key referring to the value  of the “Service digital identity” field that will delimit the boundaries of the so-identified trust service to which  the qualified status is indicated as “granted”22 in the corresponding “Service current status” field (or “Service  previous status” as part of the service status history), irrespective of the fact that a “commercial” qualified  19 Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1505 of 8 September 2015 laying down technical specifications and  formats relating to trusted lists pursuant to Article 22(5) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament  and of the Council on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market  (Text with EEA relevance). OJ L 235, 9.9.2015, p. 26–36.  20 When based on PKI public-key technology (when not based on such technology, an indicator expressed as a URI is  used to identify uniquely and unambiguously the listed service).  21 See clauses 5.5.1 and 5.5.9.4 of ETSI TS 119 612 v2.1.1 on which CID (EU) 2015/1505 relies to lay down technical  specifications and formats relating to national trusted lists.  22 The corresponding identifier expressed as a URI to indicate such grant of a qualified status is  http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/TrustedList/Svcstatus/granted.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015D1505 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015D1505 http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/TrustedList/Svcstatus/granted  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  21  trust service provided by a QTSP may make use of several technical units directly issuing the corresponding  qualified trust service outputs23.  On the other hand, the initiation process foreseen by Art.21 of the eIDAS Regulation is required to be  undergone by a TSP not having already a qualified status for the provision of a specific type of QTS. In that  case it must submit to the supervisory body a notification of its intention together with a conformity  assessment report issued by a conformity assessment body. That eIDAS article is however not applicable to  TSPs being granted a qualified status for the same type of qualified trust service. In case of any change in  the provision of its qualified trust services (incl. affecting existing listed technical units to which the grant of  the qualified status is indicated, or when adding or removing technical units as part of the technical  implementation of the qualified trust service), Art.24.2.(a) applies to the QTSP, which is required to notify  the supervisory body of any change in the provision of its qualified trust services. It will then be up to the  supervisory body to assess the impact of the notified changes on the need to undertake ad hoc audits or to  request a conformity assessment body to perform a conformity assessment of the QTSP, at the expense of  the QTSP, to confirm that the QTSP/QTS fulfils the requirements laid down in this Regulation (Art.17,  Art.20.2). In line with Art.20.3, it is possible for the supervisory body to withdraw the qualified status of the  concerned qualified trust services, in practice to the level of granularity of the identification in the national  trusted lists of the technical instance of the concerned qualified trust service to which the qualified status is  granted.  The above must however be nuanced with regards to the CSPs issuing qualified certificates to natural  persons and migrated as QTSP issuing qualified certificates for electronic signatures under Art.51.3 of the  eIDAS Regulation. For those QTSPs, any change that \"significantly\" deviates from the provision of the  corresponding services as they implemented them before the 1st of July 2016, requires them to go through  the Art.21.1 initiation process as, in that case, they would break the conditions of applicability of the  transitional measures. E.g. a former CSP issuing qualified certificates to natural persons under Directive  1999/93/EC, creating a new issuing CA and/or root CA (compared to the existing listed qualified trust service  corresponding entries in the national trusted list) under different practices24 resulting from significant  changes compared to the one they implemented under the Directive (e.g. in order to be able to meet the  eIDAS requirements), should go through Art.21.1 initiation process before being granted a qualified status  for that new issuing CA/root CA. And if this concerns a qualified trust service already listed, it should be for  that service as well that the CSP/QTSP must go through the Art.21.1 initiation process. However, such a  former CSP only modifying the profile of its end-entity qualified certificates issued to natural persons (i.e.  for electronic signatures) in order to meet requirements of Annex I of the eIDAS Regulation, without  changing significantly anything else with regards to the provision of their services benefiting from the Art.51  measures should not need to go through Art.21.1 initiation process.  Of course, as said, in all cases of application of Art.24.2.(a), a \"classification\" of changes should in practice  be considered, i.e. assessing how \"significant\" is the change and the impact it may have on the provision of  the services to justify an ad hoc audit by the SB or by a CAB at the request of the SB under Art.20.2, the scope  of such an audit.  Art.24.2.(a) of the eIDAS Regulation does not prevent notified changes to be already implemented before  being notified by the QTSP to the supervisory body (on the contrary to the termination where the intention  23 The pros and cons of listing either one or other option are discussed in ETSI TS 119 612 v2.1.1 for trust services  involved in the issuance of digital certificates, i.e. either listing a Root CA or an issuing CA.  24 With those \"practices\" to be understood as including all component services they may use and use differently,  including service factory, devices, registration authorities, certificate validity status information services, etc.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  22  to cease activities is required to be notified, hence, before cessation). Nevertheless, it is recommended to  the QTSP to notify them before implementation so that the supervisory body could be able to approve (or  make comments / indicate possible eIDAS non-conformities on) some significant changes before they are  implemented.  Examples:  (i) When a TSP has been granted a qualified status, hence recognised as a QTSP, for the provision of  qualified certificates for electronic signatures through a qualified trust service identified in the  national trusted list by an issuing technical CA with public key X, whenever that TSP is willing to  generate and operate a new technical issuing CA with public key Y, that TSP needs to notify the  supervisory body of that change under Art.24.2.(a) for its inclusion in the trusted lists as a new entry  as part of the entries related to the qualified trust service25.  (ii) When that same QTSP later decides to implement changes in the provision of the qualified trust  service affecting the issuing technical CA with public key X in a way that requires the supervisory  body to withdraw the qualified status, this can be done at the level of the trusted list entry  corresponding to the issuing technical CA with public key X. When the technical issuing CA with  public key Y would be assessed by the supervisory body as not being impacted in that way, the SB  may decide to keep the qualified status for that service as being granted.  (iii) A TSP is granted a qualified status for the provision of qualified certificates for electronic signatures  through a qualified trust service identified in the national trusted list by a technical root CA with  public key X, under which e.g. a large number of technical issuing CA are used to issue end-entity  certificates:  (a) Whenever that TSP modifies the sub-ordinate and issuing CA topology under the listed root  CA, it needs to notify the supervisory body of such changes.  (b) When adding or discarding technical CAs under the listed root CA, the QTSP needs to notify  the supervisory body of such changes under Art.24.2.(a).  (iv) When a QTSP provides qualified certificates for electronic signatures through a qualified trust service  identified in the national trusted list by an issuing technical CA with public key X, intends to use that  same issuing technical CA with public key X to issue qualified certificates for electronic seals and/or  for website authentication certificates, it must go through Art.21.1 initiation process when not  already given a qualified status for the provision of such other type(s) of qualified certificates or  when that would significantly change the provision of such other type(s) of qualified certificates for  which it has already been given a qualified status. Otherwise that change needs to be notified to the  supervisory body under Art.24.2.(a) for updating the national trusted list when assessment by the  supervisory body would lead to such an update.  (v) When a TSP has been granted a qualified status, hence recognised as a QTSP, for the provision of  qualified time stamps through a qualified trust service identified in the national trusted list by a  technical CA issuing certificates to technical time stamping units (TSUs) that in turn will each issue  qualified time stamps, then whenever that TSP will decide to create a new TSU certified by that listed  CA, it will not need to go through Art.21.1 notification for being granted a qualified status for that  service but will need to notify the competent supervisory body of that change regarding the listed  qualified service as any change in the provision of its qualified service required to be notified as per  Art.24.2.(a) of the eIDAS Regulation.  25 Provisions of clause 5.5.5 of ETSI TS 119 612 v2.1.1 pursuant to CID (EU) 2015/1505 apply with regards to the  allocation of the date to which such a change applies.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  23  See also annex A.4 of this document for guidance on the use of “Service digital identity” field in trusted list  with regards to qualified trust services.  Standards and best practices  As previously stated, neither the business nor the technical model can be imposed on QTSPs nor a specific  standard to be followed for the QTS it provides. The ultimate goal of the conformity assessment report  resulting from the assessment of a QTSP/QTS by a CAB accredited under Regulation (EC) 765/2008 is to  confirm that the QTSP/QTS fulfils the requirements laid down in the eIDAS Regulation (Art.20.1) not that it  complies with a specific standard.  Furthermore, no standard is referenced so far by any eIDAS secondary legislation for the presumption of  compliance with all or parts of the eIDAS requirements applicable to QTSPs and the QTSs they provide.  However, standards developed or still under development by European standardisation organisations  (ESOs) or other international standardisation organisations can be used to support:   CABs, national accreditation bodies (NABs), and SBs in the establishment of the effective eIDAS  QTSP/QTS criteria, the related control objectives, and the controls that will be used for assessing  QTSP/QTS against the eIDAS Regulation;   TSPs when designing, implementing and establishing their demonstration that they and the QTS  they provide or intend to provide meet the applicable requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.  A formal assessment of a candidate standard of its compliance with the requirements set in the Regulation  would in any case be required before its referencing to support the assessment of QTSP/QTS, ideally by the  EC in the context of adopting related implementing acts pursuant to requirements of the eIDAS Regulation,  or when this is not possible, by competent SBs, NABs, or CABs to build conformity assessment schemes  aiming to assess conformity of QTSP/QTS with the eIDAS Regulation requirements.  Nevertheless, standards and normative documents may be of great help to ensure best practices are  followed and to maximise interoperability of the implemented services. A supervisory body may establish  an eIDAS conformity assessment scheme on the basis of referenced technical specifications or standards,  with or without amendments after assessment of their compliance with the requirements set in the  Regulation, so that once the criteria are met by the corresponding QTSP/QTS they may benefit from a  presumption of compliance with the applicable eIDAS requirements with regards to the supervisory body  decision pursuant to Art.21.2 of the eIDAS Regulation.  Specific standards have been designed by CEN and ETSI aiming to enable compliant implementations that  meet the eIDAS Regulation requirements. ETSI TR 119 00026 is the overview document to obtain  information on which CEN or ETSI standards may be considered when implementing a specific type of  (qualified) trust service. While those ETSI and CEN standards are not and cannot be mandatory for a  QTSP/QTS to be followed, they have been developed as a means of best practice for a (Q)TSP to cover the  eIDAS requirements. Moreover ENISA published an analysis of standards related to TSPs, mapping the  eIDAS requirements to existing standards27. It concluded that the analysed standards usually cover some  26 ETSI TR 119 000: “Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI); The framework for standardization of signatures:  overview”.  27 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/tsp_standards_2015/at_download/fullReport  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/tsp_standards_2015/at_download/fullReport  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  24  requirements in part or whole but it also led, however, to a shortlist of gaps, where specific eIDAS  requirements have yet to be addressed in EU standards (ETSI/CEN/CENELEC) or international ones.  The eIDAS Regulation does not mandate compliance with any specific standard, and such compliance  cannot be mandatory. However, it may be appropriate or even required for the notifying TSP intending to  provide QTS to ensure that it complies with specific standards in order to satisfy requirements in another  application domain, provided they are not in contradiction with the eIDAS requirements for QTSP/QTS. For  example, QTSP providing services for the issuance of qualified certificates for website authentication  (QWACs) may be required to meet specific standards to satisfy the CA/Browser Forum28 requirements and  requirements from Browsers or widely deployed applications owners for inclusion in their trusted  certificate root stores. Users of compliant QTSPs will then benefit from the recognition by CA/Browser  Forum members’ applications such as Internet browser software that will then display enhanced indication  of the corresponding certified website identity by changing their appearance (i.e. colours, icons, animation,  and/or additional website information) to reflect its trustworthiness. Those (Q)TSPs willing to benefit from  recognition in both eIDAS and non-eIDAS worlds (e.g. CA/Browser Forum) should ensure that the  conformity assessments they pass to demonstrate compliance with the eIDAS requirements can be of  benefit in the demonstration of their compliance with those non-eIDAS requirements. In the specific  context of QWACs, ETSI EN 319 411 series has been designed to allow for such convergence of the eIDAS  and CA/Browser Forum conformity assessments.  28 The CA/Browser Forum is a voluntary group of certification authorities (CAs), vendors of Internet browser software,  and suppliers of other applications that use X.509 v.3 digital certificates for SSL/TLS and code signing and has  established guidelines to provide greater assurance to Internet users about the web sites they visit by leveraging the  capabilities of SSL/TLS certificates.

Initiation and supervision of QTSPs/QTSs  Initiation and supervision as corner stones of the eIDAS pyramid of trust  The ex-ante and ex-post model for the supervision of qualified trust service providers (QTSPs) and of the  qualified trust services (QTSs) they provide is the foundation of the whole legal and trust model for such  services as defined by the eIDAS Regulation. The eIDAS Regulation is actually setting up a complete  pyramid of trust, which is illustrated in Figure 3.  The most visible part is the “EU trust mark for qualified trust services”, which each qualified trust service  provider may, on a voluntary basis, use to brand and promote the quality and trustworthiness of the  qualified trust services it provides.  Figure 2 eIDAS Regulation building trust in the online environment (Source IAS² - updated)  This EU trust mark is not just another quality logo without any trust foundation (despite the fact that it’s  not verifiable in an automated way). As illustrated in Figure 2 above, the eIDAS Regulation explicitly sets up  a consistent set of quality/security requirements and obligations for QTSPs/QTSs. Those requirements and  obligations aim to enhance the trust of consumers and enterprises, in particular SMEs, in the internal  (electronic) market and to promote the use of such QTSs and related products.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  26  Through ex-ante and ex-post supervisory activities the eIDAS Regulation builds a supervisory regime upon  those quality/security requirements and obligations for QTSs and QTSPs. It aims to ensure that, from  genesis up to termination of such services, the QTSPs and the QTSs they provide indeed meet the  requirements laid down in the Regulation.  This supervisory regime for QTSs and QTSPs is executed by each EU Member State (MS), by a national  supervisory body, and follows common requirements to ensure a comparable security level of QTSs in all  EU Member States (MS).  The supervisory regime covers the entire life-cycle of the QTSP and their QTSs:   It relies on a pre-authorisation mechanism obliging trust service providers intending to provide  QTSs to notify its nationally designated supervisory body of their intention together with a CAR  issued by an accredited CAB confirming that the QTSP and the QTSs it intends to provide meet the  requirements laid down in the Regulation.   It obliges, once granted a qualified status, QTSPs to submit to the designated supervisory body, for  each of their QTSs, a two-yearly conformity assessment report (CAR) issued by an accredited CAB  confirming that the QTSP and the particular QTS it provides fulfil the requirements laid down in the  Regulation.   It allows designated supervisory bodies, at their own discretion and at any time, to audit a  QTSP/QTS or to request an accredited CAB to carry out a conformity assessment of a QTSP/QTS  and to produce a CAR confirming that it fulfils the requirements laid down in the Regulation.   It foresees rules to be followed by QTSP and supervisory activities to be performed in cases where  the QTSP changes or terminates the provisioning of a QTS, or ceases its activities.  The decisions to grant or withdraw a qualified status to trust services and trust service providers, resulting  from the above supervisory activities, are taken by the designated national supervisory bodies.  Those status decisions are published on electronically signed or sealed national trusted lists. Such national  trusted lists are established, maintained and published to disseminate in a trustworthy manner  information related to the qualified trust service providers for which an EU MS is responsible, together  with information related to the qualified trust services provided by them, including the whole history of  the qualified status they have been granted.  The mandatory EU MS national trusted lists are published at least in a form suitable for automated  processing. In practice these are XML files. The “EU trust mark for qualified trust services”, despite the fact  that its use by QTSPs is voluntary, is aimed to be the consumer visible means to convey the same  information to the non-automated mass market. The eIDAS Regulation obliges QTSPs using such a trust  mark to provide, close to it, a link to the corresponding trusted list allowing for verification.  The pyramid of trust in (qualified) trust services established by the eIDAS Regulation further relies on and  is strengthened by the use of best practices and standards. In order to ensure uniform conditions for its  implementation, the Regulation confers implementing powers on the Commission, for specifying  implementation specifications or for referencing numbers of standards the use of which would raise a  presumption of compliance with certain requirements laid down in the eIDAS Regulation (Recital (71)).  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  27  QTSP/QTS initiation and supervision activities  The various steps foreseen in the eIDAS Regulation regarding the initiation of a QTSP and of the QTS it  provides and the related supervisory activities throughout the lifecycle of such services, from genesis until  termination, can be depicted in the Figure 3.  In a nutshell, the initiation step consists in the following phases:   The preparation.   The notification.   Initial compliance verification, including:  o The analysis of the notification (procedure and format).  o The analysis of the submitted conformity assessment report.  o Granting, in case of positive verification, a qualified status to the TSP and to the trust  service(s) they provide.   Publication of the qualified status in the national trusted list.  Once qualified status is granted, the life cycle management of the supervision by the competent  supervisory body to ensure that QTSPs/QTSs meet the requirements laid down in the Regulation can be  split into several phases of related supervisory activities, as they are driven by the following events, each of  which having the possibility to lead to a withdrawal of the qualified status:   Regular (2-yearly) audits.   Events monitored and detected by the SB.   Termination of one, more or all of the qualified trust services.   Other events notified by QTSPs:  o Changes in the provision of a QTS.  o Security breach.  o Personal data breach.  o Results of surveillance audits, when applicable.   Other notified events, e.g.:  o Complaints.  o Request for cooperation from other SBs.  The present document covers the different phases of the initiation step listed above (“preparation”,  “notification”, “initial compliance verification”, and “publication of the qualified status”). More specifically,  it covers the procedures and formats for becoming a qualified trust service provider and for initiating a  qualified trust service.  The companion deliverable of the present document (“Guidelines on Supervision of Qualified Trust  Services”29) aims to provide recommendations to facilitate the implementation of the provisions related to  qualified trust services of the eIDAS Regulation in the area of those phases related to the life cycle  management of their supervision once they have been granted a qualified status.  29 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services/guidelines/.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  28  Figure 3 Overview of the QTSP/QTS initiation and life cycle management of the related qualified status at the trust service level  and the related supervision activities. (Source IAS² - updated)  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  29  The initiation process flow  In order for a TSP/TS to be granted a qualified status, the TSP needs to go through the initiation process.  This process must be executed for each specific type of QTS (as they are specified in the eIDAS Regulation)  of which a TSP intends to start the provision, and for which the TSP has not already received a qualified  status (see Art.3.20 and Art.21.1).  The process has also to take into account the level of granularity addressed in the national trusted list to  correctly reflect the grant a qualified status to the TSP/TS when it passes the initiation process successfully  and is granted such a qualified status.  The initiation process flow can be split into the following steps of related bodies’ activities, as sketched in  Figure 3 and detailed in Figure 4:   The preparation: This step consists for the TSP intending to provide a qualified trust service.  o Design, set-up, implement, test and deploy the (qualified) trust service in pre-production in line  with the requirements laid down in the eIDAS Regulation. As the purpose of the initiation process  will be to demonstrate its compliance to the eIDAS requirements and not to any standard, the TSP  should build the provision of the QTS and document it in a way that facilitates the demonstration  of its conformity with the eIDAS requirements. To this extent, best practices and standards when  they are available may nevertheless be a tool used to facilitate such a demonstration.  o Setting-up the relevant documentation: As said, the documentation related to the provision of  the QTS should be established in a way to support and facilitate the demonstration of conformity  to the eIDAS requirement. As prior to the verification by the national SB of the conformity of the  notifying TSP/TS with the corresponding QTSP/QTS requirements of eIDAS, the TSP/TS will have to  pass an audit by an accredited CAB, TSP should structure their documentation against the eIDAS  requirements (see section 4.5 for further guidance). In a nutshell the documentation should  include:   The risk assessment related documentation aimed to support demonstration of the  requirement of Art.19.1.   A security & personal data breach notification plan aimed to support demonstration of the  requirement of Art.19.2.   The termination plan (Art.24.2.(i)).   Declaration of practices, policies, security concept, procedures and guidelines the TSP will  use to provide the QTS aimed to support demonstration of the other applicable eIDAS  requirements.  o Conformity assessment: That assessment must be conducted by a CAB specifically accredited by a  national accreditation body under Regulation (EC) 765/2008 to carry out assessments of QTSP/QTS  against the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation (Art.3.18).   The notification: The TSP submits to the national SB the ad hoc notification form (as prescribed by the  SB) together with the required documentation, when applicable and together with the conformity  assessment report. That latter must prove the compliance with the requirements of the Regulation.   The initial compliance verification: The SB verifies whether or not the TSP and the QTS it intends to  provide meet the requirements of the Regulation in order to be granted the qualified status. Final  decision is in the hands of the SB. The latter may rely upon the information provided as part of the  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  30  notification procedure, including the conformity assessment report, but is equally entitled to request  further information and may take a duly justified decision that goes against the conformity  assessment report. In that case, as for all its decisions, SB should respect, in particular, the principles  of good administration, including the obligation to give reasons for its decisions, as well as the  principle of proportionality. Upon positive verification by the SB that the TSP and the QTS it intends to  provide meet the eIDAS requirements, the SB grants the qualified status to the TSP/TS and informs  the body in charge of the national trusted list for the purpose of updating it.   The update of the trusted list: Upon notification by the SB that the notifying TSP/TS has been granted  a qualified status, the body in charge of the national trusted list updates the list accordingly.  Figure 4  QTSP/QTS initiation process flow in the context of the eIDAS Regulation  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  31  eIDAS compliant accreditation schemes for CABs  4.4.1 eIDAS requirements for CAB accreditation schemes and for CAR  CABs  As identified in section 2.3, Art.3.18 of the eIDAS Regulation requires CABs to be accredited in accordance  with Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 in a way that such accreditation ensures the accredited CABs are  competent to carry out conformity assessment of a QTSP/QTS against the requirements of the eIDAS  Regulation. Indeed, the conformity assessment is on QTSPs and QTSs which are eIDAS legal terms subject  to requirements stemming from the eIDAS Regulation. They cannot be understood in a different context.  CARs  The resulting conformity assessment report to be submitted to the supervisory body by the assessed  (Q)TSP, whether in the context of a 2-yearly regular audit (Art.20.1), an ad hoc audit (Art.20.2) or an  initiation audit (Art.21.1) must be such that it confirms, when this is the case, that the assessed QTSP/QTS  fulfil the requirements of all the applicable requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.  Provided the above requirements are met, it is a fact that it remains in the hands of MS to determine how  the accreditation is done. In other words, MS remain free to set up any accreditation scheme provided that  they can demonstrate that it fulfils Art.3.18 of the eIDAS Regulation.  Conformity assessment scheme  The conformity assessment scheme (including requirements on the CAB, requirements on the auditing  rules under which the CAB will carry out their conformity assessment and the effective set of criteria,  control objectives and controls against which it will assess a QTSP/QTS with the aim of confirming that it  fulfils the eIDAS requirements) may be defined by the CAB itself, the EU MS supervisory body, or any other  body possessing the necessary technical competence.30  NABs  The eIDAS Regulation requires, as part of the accreditation of the CAB, an evaluation by the competent  NAB of that assessment scheme and of the competence of the CAB employing such an assessment scheme  to carry out conformity assessment of a QTSP/QTS against eIDAS (Art.3.18). The competence of a CAB  cannot be confirmed by any other entity than the competent NAB.  The accreditation of CABs, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, is the exclusive competence of  NABs. CABs established in a EU MS are required to be accredited by the NAB of the EU MS in which they  are established unless that NAB does not have the possibility to do so, in which case the CAB can request  another NAB from another EU MS to conduct its accreditation.  Supervisory bodies  The “procedural” question regarding the eligibility of an eIDAS compliant CAR for its submission to a SB,  and hence its admissibility by the SB under Art.21.1, Art.20.1 ,or Art.20.2 is not whether the report is fine  to demonstrate that the assessed QTSP/QTS complies with the eIDAS requirements but whether it is  formally a conformity assessment report issued by a conformity assessment body which is accredited in  accordance with Regulation 765/2008 as competent to carry out conformity assessment of a qualified trust  30 The entity defining and owning a conformity assessment scheme is denoted as the scheme owner.  A conformity assessment scheme will be called a certification scheme when the CAB is a certification body.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  32  service provider and the qualified trust services it provides against the requirements of the eIDAS  Regulation.  The format and content of a CAR should nevertheless be such that it contains sufficient information to  demonstrate to the SB that each and every applicable requirement from the eIDAS Regulation for QTSPs  and QTSs are indeed fulfilled by the assessed QTSP/QTS.  An eIDAS conformity assessment scheme must be defined in such a way that neither the business nor the  technical model is imposed upon a QTSP/QTS nor a specific standard to be followed. A QTSP providing a  QTS is free to define the way it implements the applicable eIDAS requirements, whether operationally,  organisationally or technically. The (Q)TSP/(Q)TS has to demonstrate its compliance (building upon  standards if it deems it appropriate) with the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation while the supervisory  body cannot refuse to grant the qualified status solely on the grounds that the proposed model does not  comply with a given standard or a given business/technical model. Consequently, in the absence of formal  assessment of one or more technical standards and its/their referencing in an eIDAS implementing act for  the presumption of compliance with the eIDAS requirements, a conformity assessment scheme cannot be  compliant with the eIDAS requirements when the QTSP/QTS audit criteria against which the (Q)TSP/(Q)TS  is assessed is limited to a (set of) standard(s). An eIDAS compliant conformity assessment scheme should  hence be designed in such a way that those QTSP/QTS audit criteria are not defined in a “normative  approach” (i.e. on the basis of a required compliance with a specific standard or on the basis of a specific  technical way to proceed) but in an “outcome based approach” (i.e. ultimately the eIDAS requirements  applicable to QTSP/QTS which are expressed in a technology-neutral way and expressing the goal to be  reached). The definition of an “outcome based” conformity assessment scheme can build on standards or  parts of them when assessed.  4.4.2 The EA promoted accreditation scheme for CABs assessing TSP/TS  The European cooperation for Accreditation (EA), is the body recognised under Regulation (EC) No  765/2008 that manages a peer evaluation system among NABs from the EU Member States and other  European countries. That rigorous and transparent peer evaluation system ensures the equivalence of the  accreditation services delivered by NABs and thus the equivalence of the level of competence of CABs. This  mandatory peer evaluation system facilitates the mutual recognition and promotes the overall acceptance  of accreditation certificates and conformity assessment results issued by accredited bodies. National  authorities shall recognise the equivalence of the services delivered by those accreditation bodies (i.e. the  NABs) which have successfully undergone such peer evaluation, and thereby accept the accreditation  certificates of those bodies and the attestations issued by the CABs accredited by them.  The EA is also the recognised body, under Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, as competent to develop sectoral  or specific accreditation schemes. This may be done on request of the Commission but in the context of  the eIDAS Regulation this has not been the case.  Nevertheless, the EA has promoted31 the ETSI EN 319 40332 standard on requirements for CABs to carry out  conformity assessment of TSPs as one route to demonstrate conformity with relevant requirements of the  31 EA Resolution 2014 (34) 22 and EA document EAGA(14)31.  32 ETSI EN 319 403 V2.2.2 (2015-08): Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI); Trust Service Provider Conformity  Assessment - Requirements for conformity assessment bodies assessing Trust Service Providers. This document builds  on ISO/IEC 17065 to specify additional requirements for CABs and additional auditing rules under which CABs will  have to carry out their conformity assessments of QTSPs and their QTSs  http://www.european-accreditation.org/document/34th-ea-ga-approved-resolutions-  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  33  eIDAS Regulation through assessment by accredited CABs. The EN 319 403 defined accreditation scheme is  such that:  (i) It requires the accreditation of the CAB to be based on ISO/IEC 1706533;  (ii) It supplements the general requirements provided in ISO/IEC 17065 to provide additional  dedicated requirements for CABs performing certification of trust service Providers and the  trust services they provide towards defined criteria against which they claim conformance.  It does not, however, specify those criteria nor the certification scheme and needs to be considered as an  accreditation “framework” for the conformity assessment of TSP against audit criteria. Those criteria need  to be defined in such a way that they should:  (a) take into account specificities of the type of trust service to be assessed;  (b) ensure that all aspects of the TSP activity are fully covered; and  (c) be based on standards, publicly available specifications and/or regulatory requirements.  Consequently, the EA promoted accreditation scheme (ISO/IEC 17065 completed by ETSI EN 319 403)  cannot be implemented unless such effective criteria, the related control objectives and controls are  clearly defined in a way that the NAB can evaluate the competency of the CAB to conduct an assessment  of a QTSP/QTS against them in order to assess its conformity with the eIDAS requirements and so that the  accreditation cannot be contested. Their definition will be the purpose of the conformity assessment  scheme that may be defined by the CAB itself, the EU MS supervisory body, or any other body possessing  the necessary technical competence.34 Individually or collectively, e.g. under mutual assistance foreseen by  Art.18 of the eIDAS Regulation, supervisory bodies could establish such conformity assessment schemes  for assessing QTSP/QTS eIDAS conformity, leveraging on standards, in a way allowing establishing a  presumption of compliance of the assessed QTSP/QTS with eIDAS and of the accreditation of CABs to be  compliant with eIDAS as well.35  It should be noted that the EA promoted accreditation scheme (ISO/IEC 17065 completed by ETSI EN 319  403), still to be completed by an “eIDAS conformity assessment scheme” as explained, is not mandatory  and might not be the only basis for such accreditations as discussed in the next section.  4.4.3 Other conformity assessment schemes (as alternative to the EA promoted scheme)  All NABs from EU Member States and from EEA countries are members of the EA. The EA is also the  recognised body, under Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, as competent to develop sectoral or specific  accreditation schemes. The EA and all its members have promoted unanimously the above described ETSI  33 ISO/IEC 17065:2012: Conformity assessment -- Requirements for bodies certifying products, processes and services.  34 To this extent, ISO/IEC 17065 requires in substance (in its section 7.2.1) that the criteria against which QTSP/QTS  are evaluated shall be those contained in specified standards and other normative documents. ETSI EN 319 403  extends this to “standards, publicly available specifications and/or regulatory requirements” while taking into account  specificities of the type of trust service to be assessed and ensuring that all aspects of the TSP activity are fully  covered). ISO/IEC 17065 also suggests considering ISO/IEC 17007 for guidance for developing normative documents  suitable for the purpose of establishing criteria documents. When explanations are required as to the application of  these documents for a specific certification scheme, ISO/IEC 17065 (in its section 7.2.2) requires them to be  formulated by relevant and impartial committees (or persons) possessing the necessary technical competence, and  made available by the certification body upon request.  35 See last § of section 3.4.4.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  34  EN 319 403 accreditation scheme. Such promotions are not formally binding but makes it a commonly  agreed consensus to use it.  NABs do not specify conformity assessment schemes. A conformity assessment scheme owner could put  forward its scheme for purpose of accreditation of CAB in accordance with the eIDAS Regulation at a  national level and the local NAB would ensure that the scheme meets the accreditation requirements.  However it is likely when such a scheme would deviate from the one promoted at the European level by  the EA, it would need to be recognised being in accordance with the eIDAS requirements (i.e. Art.3.18 and  Art.20.1) and as an appropriate alternative to the EA promoted one in order to ensure the equivalence of  the level of competence of accredited CABs, to facilitate mutual recognition and to promote the overall  acceptance of accreditation certificates and conformity assessment results issued by those accredited  CABs.  To be considered as conformant with the eIDAS Regulation, a conformity assessment scheme:   Must be such that the rules under which the CAB shall carry out QTSP/QTS assessment against those  conformity assessment requirements and the competence of the CAB to carry out such assessments  have been accredited by a competent NAB under Regulation (EU) 765/2008.  o The ETSI framework scheme based on EN 319 403, complementing requirements in ISO/IEC  17065, and an accreditation under ISO 17065 is an option already promoted at the European  level by the EA.  o Alternatives could be based on other accreditation frameworks (e.g. ISO 17043, ISO 17021)  covering inspection bodies or laboratories as CABs provided they are properly completed by  requirements on CABs that ensure the evaluation of their competence in assessing QTSP/QTS  against all the applicable eIDAS requirements.   Must be such that the purpose of the assessment is to confirm that the assessed QTSP/QTS fulfil the  eIDAS requirements applicable to the type of QTSP/QTS being assessed (conformity assessment  requirements).  o The conformity assessment requirements should be designed in accordance with  recommendations made in section 4.4.4 of this document.  o Note that to this extent, the EA promoted ETSI framework accreditation scheme based on EN  319 403 must additionally be completed by the identification of the evaluation criteria against  which the QTSPs/QTSs are to be evaluated and to be judged (in this case, certified) to comply  with the eIDAS requirements. Such a completion can be done by the CAB itself, the EU MS  supervisory body or any other body possessing the necessary technical competence.   Must be such that the CAR includes sufficient demonstration and a formal statement that the  QTSP/QTS meet the requirement laid down in the eIDAS Regulation.  o The CAR report should be structured against recommendations provided in section 4.5 of this  document.  Any conformity assessment scheme competing, with regards to the CAB requirements, with the ETSI EN  319 403 accreditation scheme promoted at EU level by the EA, would be equivalently suitable to that EA  promoted scheme provided it would be promoted for purpose of accreditation at a national level by the  local NAB or at the EU level by the EA and provided that it has been demonstrated that the competing  scheme meets the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation and of Regulation 765/2008.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  35  The adoption, convergence, or migration of schemes for the accreditation of CABs in accordance with the  eIDAS Regulation towards the ETSI EN 319 403 scheme with the accreditation based on ISO/IEC 17065, as  promoted at the EA level, is encouraged by EA document EAGA(14)31.36  When a CAB has been correctly accredited in accordance with the eIDAS Regulation, no SB could reject the  CAR produced by such a CAB for the sole reason that the CAB is not accredited by their national NAB. The  NAB having accredited such a CAB can be the national body of the same EU MS for which the SB is  competent or be from another MS37.  4.4.4 eIDAS QTSP/QTS criteria as part of an eIDAS conformity assessment scheme  With regards to the further definition and clarification of the effective criteria, the effective related control  objectives and controls to be used by an accredited CAB to evaluate QTSP/QTS compliance with the eIDAS  Regulation and for which the competency of the CAB will be accredited by the NAB, it is important to note  that:   First, no standard or normative document has been referenced so far by any secondary legislation  (implementing acts) that would have been adopted pursuant to the eIDAS Regulation and that, when  met, would give a legal presumption of compliance of the QTSP or QTS against all or a specific subset  of the applicable requirements.   Second, any situation that would impose compliance on a QTSP/QTS with a specific standard or  normative document is prohibited as it would be in contradiction with the eIDAS Regulation principles.  The eIDAS Regulation is technologically-neutral and QTSPs/QTSs are free to define the way they  implement those applicable requirements, whether operationally, organisationally or technically.   Third, the resulting CAR and the final and unambiguous conformity statement are the necessary  elements for the QTSP/QTS to be effectively granted a qualified status by the competent SB. It is  ultimately the SB to which the CAR is notified by the assessed QTSP that will take the decision to grant  or not the qualified status to the assessed QTSP/QTS.  Hence the resulting CAR needs to contain  sufficient information to demonstrate, in detail to the SB, that the assessed QTSP/QTS fulfil the  requirements laid down in the eIDAS Regulation and consequently deserves to be granted a qualified  status. It is not regarded as suitable that the SB, which has the obligation to verify the compliance of  the QTSP/QTS with the Regulation, will take its decision on the sole basis of a yes/no conformity  assessment document or CAR.   Fourth, the granularity of the scope of the assessment on the targeted trust service is the one used in  EU Member State trusted lists. That granularity should correspond, per type of QTSP/QTS, to the  “service digital identity” concept as defined by CID (EU) 2015/1505 laying down technical  36 The EA document EAGA (14)31 lays down the migration considerations for both CABs and National Accreditation  Bodies (NABs) in order to transition of EA members existing arrangements for CAB accreditation (e.g. based on EN  45011, ISO/IEC 17021 for delivering certification against ISO 27001 – including fulfilling ISO 27006, ISO 20000)  towards EN 319 403. Unfortunately, this document may be misleading in the sense that it refers to TSP applicable  conformity assessment technical specifications and standards as part of this migration. The identification of those  specifications and standards must not be understood as indicating a mandatory conformance to assess QTSP/QTS  eIDAS requirements; they only indicate migration from former versions of standards to newer standards replacing  them (whenever a conformity assessment against a specific standard is required e.g. in the context of CA/Browser  Forum requirements).  37 This may be the case when a CAB is established in a EU MS where the NAB has not implemented any eIDAS  accreditation scheme and it has been accredited by a NAB from another EU MS or even a third country being an EA  MLA signatory. This may also be the case when the notifying TSP has contracted a CAB from another country that the  one in which it is established.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  36  specifications and formats relating to trusted lists pursuant to Article 22.5 of the eIDAS Regulation.  Indeed, once the SB decides to grant a qualified status to a QTSP/QTS, it shall inform the body  responsible for establishing, maintaining and publishing the national trusted list for the purposes of  updating it accordingly. It is only when that granted qualified status has been indicated in the trusted  list that the assessed QTSP may begin to provide the assessed qualified trust service. Hence it is also  important that the scope of the assessment corresponds to, and identifies clearly, the “service digital  identity(ies)” identifying the trust service to be granted a qualified status, for each type of qualified  trust service considered by the eIDAS Regulation as specified by CID (EU) 2015/1505.  In order to benefit from QTSP/QTS criteria, related control objectives and controls, which are efficient to  demonstrate QTSP/QTS conformity with all the eIDAS requirements, it is recommended:   They are organised per type of QTSP/QTS;   They are organised per requirement of the eIDAS Regulation applicable to a specific type of QTSP/QTS;   They include sufficient set of criteria to confirm that the assessed QTSP/QTS meets the applicable  eIDAS Regulation requirements;   They ensure that all aspects of the TSP activity are fully covered;   They take into account the outcome based approach to the eIDAS requirements and not impose  specific ways, and in particular no specific standard, for the assessed QTSP/QTS to implement the  applicable eIDAS requirements;   In general, and in particular when based on standards or publicly available specifications:  o they are supported by demonstration that the criteria coming from those standards or publicly  available specifications are suitable for confirming that the specific applicable eIDAS  requirement(s) they support an evaluation against are met;  o they allow deviation from strict compliance to standards where the requirements from  standards exceed or contradict the eIDAS requirements.  The effective eIDAS QTSP/QTS criteria may be defined by the CAB itself, the EU MS supervisory body or any  other body possessing the necessary technical competence. As a last resort, it may be up to the CAB to  establish the effective eIDAS QTSP/QTS criteria, related control objectives and controls it will use for  assessing QTSP/QTS against the eIDAS Regulation and to demonstrate to the NAB that they are sufficient  to confirm that a QTSP/QTS is meeting the applicable requirements of the eIDAS Regulation and that they  have the competency to conduct an assessment against those criteria.  NABs do not specify conformity assessment schemes. Those schemes can be put forward by the scheme  owner for purpose of accreditation and the NAB would ensure that the scheme meets the accreditation  requirements. Where this is purely a national scheme this is done by the local NAB. Where, like the ETSI EN  319 403 accreditation scheme, the conformity assessment scheme owner wants it recognised across  Europe it is done through the EA process.  The competent supervisory body may also possess the necessary (technical) competences and be entitled  to define an eIDAS conformity assessment scheme relying on appropriate accreditation requirements. An  argument for SB to define such schemes or to establish requirements on them or to establish reference  number on specific standards with or without any adaptations of their requirements, is that the SB is the  final entity to verify the conformity of QTSP/QTS with the eIDAS requirements and granting or withdrawing  a qualified status. Supervisory bodies, when defining such criteria must pay attention to using an outcome  based approach that does not require any specific (e.g. technical, operational, organisational) way to  proceed and in particular does not require compliance with any specific technical requirement or technical  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  37  standard. A supervisory body may establish an eIDAS conformity assessment scheme on the basis of  referenced technical specifications or standards, with or without amendments after assessment of their  compliance with the requirements set in the Regulation, so that once the criteria are met by the  corresponding QTSP/QTS they may benefit from a presumption of compliance with the applicable eIDAS  requirements with regards to the supervisory body decision under Art.21.2 of the eIDAS Regulation.38  4.4.5 Consequence of the grant of a qualified status by a SB on the basis of a CAB and/or a CAR not  conform the eIDAS Regulation  Considering that the CAR is only a tool facilitating a SB’s task when deciding whether a notifying TSP (and  the QTS it intends to provide) meet the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation and it does not bind the  latter with regards to that decision, it could be considered that providing a CAR resulting from a conform  audit carried out by a conform CAB (Art.3.18) is not a compulsory formality under penalty of nullity  (provided that the information included in the CAR did not lead the SB to take a decision that is not  conform to the eIDAS Regulation). This does not remove the obligation for CARs to meet the requirements  of the eIDAS Regulation.  Withdrawing of a qualified status by a SB, for the sole reason that the SB has granted a qualified status on  the basis of a CAR that was not eIDAS conformant would, nevertheless, not be appropriate (in particular  when the QTSP/QTS does meet the eIDAS requirements) and this would not be considered as good  administration since the competent authority considered, rightly or not, that the requirements regarding  the procedural rules was met creating legitimate expectations from the QTSP and its users. However, in  that case, the SB should be recommended to require an ad hoc audit to be carried out, within a reasonable  short time frame, by a CAB accredited in accordance with the eIDAS Regulation and in compliance with the  eIDAS requirements this time, in order to confirm the qualified status, i.e. that the concerned QTSP/QTS  meet the eIDAS requirements.  Structure and content of the CAR  The conformity assessment report (CAR) referred to in Art.21.1 of the eIDAS Regulation is a prerequisite  for the QTSP/QTS to be effectively granted a qualified status by the competent supervisory body (SB).  Since it is ultimately the supervisory body (SB) to which the CAR is notified by the assessed TSP that will  take the decision to grant or not the qualified status to the assessed TSP/TS, the notified CAR needs to  contain sufficient information to demonstrate, in detail to the SB, that the assessed TSP/TS fulfils the  QTSP/QTS requirements laid down in the eIDAS Regulation and consequently deserves to be granted a  qualified status.  It is in the interest of the TSP to ensure that the CAR it receives from the accredited CAB that conducted its  assessment brings indeed sufficient information that demonstrate that the TSP/TS complies with the  requirements laid down in the eIDAS Regulation, and in particular, with the requirements for QTSP/QTS.  It would also be in the interest of the SB to edit some recommendations on the structure and content of  the CAR referred to by Art.21.1 of the eIDAS Regulation so that it will be easier for the SB, in the  38 See for example, the referenced specification documents applicable to the qualification of trust service providers  and the trust services they provide (those documents are available in French only from the following website:  http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/administration/reglementation/confiance-numerique/le-reglement-eidas/documents- publies-par-lanssi/). For each type of QTSP/QTS, one or several documents provide, explicitly or by reference, a list of  requirements that the French supervisory body consider, once met by QTSP/QTS, as meeting the referenced  applicable eIDAS requirements.  http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/administration/reglementation/confiance-numerique/le-reglement-eidas/documents-publies-par-lanssi/ http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/administration/reglementation/confiance-numerique/le-reglement-eidas/documents-publies-par-lanssi/  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  38  boundaries of the principles of good administration and other similar applicable rules, to verify whether  those requirements are met or not, and to argue that the received CAR does not meet the eIDAS  requirements and/or does not bear sufficient information demonstrating the QTSP/QTS requirements are  met.  The specifications with regards to the structure and content of the CAR referred to in Art.21.1 of the eIDAS  Regulation are recommended to include at least the following39:   [eIDAS – Art.20.1] Bear a clear conformity statement confirming - if such is the case - that the assessed  QTSP/QTS meets all the applicable requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.   [Recommendation] Provide sufficient details to demonstrate that the assessed TSP/TS fulfils the  requirements laid down in the eIDAS Regulation, and in particular, the requirements for QTSP/QTS.  Note: Those details and information demonstrating QTSP/QTS compliance with the eIDAS Regulation  requirements may be included by reference to other reports, e.g. such as audit reports against technical  standards, which contain detailed and herewith sufficient information for the SB to judge the QTSP/QTS  conformity. On top of that the SB may need to refer to the security documentation of the TSP, like the  security concept, its declaration of practices and/or of policies, etc., as it may be referenced in the CAR.   [Recommendations] In order to bear sufficient details to demonstrate such a fulfilment the structure  and the information provided should:  1) Clearly identify the name of the CAB, and where applicable its registration number, as stated in the  official records, its official postal address and its electronic address.  2) Clearly identify the name of the national accreditation body (NAB) having accredited the CAB, and  where applicable the registration number, as stated in the official records, the official postal  address and electronic address of the NAB.  3) Include the accreditation certificate or a link to the location from where the accreditation  certificate issued by the NAB identified in accordance with point (2) together with the detailed  description or a link to the location from where the detailed description of the underlying  accreditation scheme including indication of its relevance to the eIDAS Regulation can be  retrieved.  Note: The CAB accreditation certificate, the CAR should clearly identify the accreditation scheme  under which the CAB has been accredited in the context of Reg.765/2008 (e.g. ISO/IEC 17065  being completed by ETSI EN 319 403) and the conformity assessment scheme for which the CAB  has been accredited to conduct conformity assessment of TSP/TS against the requirements laid  down in the eIDAS Regulation, and in particular, against the requirements for QTSP/QTS.  4) Include the accredited conformity assessment scheme document (i.e. QTSP/QTS audit criteria) or a  link to the location from where that document is available.  5) Clearly identify the name of the CAB lead auditor having issued [and signed] the CAR.  6) Clearly identify the name of the assessed trust service provider, and where applicable its  registration number, as stated in the official records, its official postal address and its electronic  address.  7) Clearly identify the conformity assessment target trust service(s) of the TSP for which the CAR  confirms the conformity with the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. The identification of the  39 Each bullet is preceded by an indication whether the item is a requirement from the eIDAS Regulation or a  recommendation of the present guidance document.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  39  service(s) is to align with CID (EU) 2015/1505 and clause 5.5.1.1 of ETSI TS 119 612 v2.1.1 (note: to  this extent this should include at least the RFC 5280 Subject Key Identifier or the public key of the  target trust services and the Base64 PEM representation of the associated X.509 v3 digital  certificate; additionally it should also distinguish, when applicable, whether specific sets or sub- sets of certificates should be excluded from the confirmation of conformity and on which criteria  they can be identified).  8) Provide for each qualified trust service identified in point (7)40 a detailed description of the (e.g.  PKI) functional architecture or hierarchy with the purpose to allow identification of the service(s)  to be listed in the applicable national trusted list in accordance with CID (EU) 2015/1505.  Such detailed description may be included by reference to other reports. When this is the case, a  precise and non-ambiguous summary of the TSP and the services covered should appear in the  CAR.  That description should also clearly identify which QTS components or service components are  operated by third parties (e.g. subcontractors) and their locations.  Note: A QTSP can make use of third parties, whether (Q)TSPs or not, to operate part or all of the  components or component services of the (Q)TS they provide. In this situation, the QTSP remains  the final entity responsible and liable for the QTS he provides and needs to document and ensure  correct implementation of those component services against his declared practices and policies  and of course against the eIDAS requirements.  9) Identify an exhaustive list of public and TSP internal documents that have been part of the scope  of the audit. The public documents should either be attached to the CAR or publicly accessible  links should be provided allowing for a download of those documents.  Public documents should include, as a minimum:  a) The declaration of the practices used by the TSP to provide the qualified trust services;  b) The qualified trust service policy(ies), i.e. the set of rules that indicates the applicability of  the qualified trust service to a particular community and/or class of application with  common security requirements.  c) Subscriber agreement and related terms and conditions.  Internal documents should include, as a minimum:  a) The termination plan referred to in Art.24.2.(i) of the eIDAS Regulation.  b) The documentation related to the assessment of risks aimed at supporting the  demonstration of the requirements of eIDAS Regulation Art.19.1.  c) A security & personal data breach notification plan aimed to support demonstration of the  requirement of eIDAS Regulation Art.19.2.  d) The list of all internal documents supporting the declaration of the practices used by the  TSP to provide the qualified trust services and the qualified trust service policy(ies).  10) Identify, for each stage of the audit (e.g. documentation audit and implementation audit including  onsite inspections), the period during which the audit has been conducted (elapsed time) and the  effort in man-days engaged by the CAB to conduct the audit.  11) Provide, for each of the following eIDAS requirements, a report on the fulfilment by the TSP and by  the implementation of its qualified trust services of the identified requirement, or when  appropriate, on the existence of proper procedures and management system for handling this  40 See also Annex A.7.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  40  requirement. Those reports should identify the detailed audit controls and control objectives that  have been conducted during the audit to establish them with an indication of each non-conformity  and their level of importance (or a reference to separately available audit reports in which such  information is included; such audit reports shall be attached to the CAR):  a) General requirements for qualified TSPs and for each type of qualified trust services (with  an indication of the relevant articles of the eIDAS Regulation)  i) Data processing and protection (Art.5)  (1) Art.5.1. Processing of personal data shall be carried out in accordance with  Directive 95/46/EC.  ii) Provisions on liabilities meet the Art.13 requirements:  (1) (Art.13.1) The TSP liable for damage caused intentionally or negligently to any  natural or legal person due to a failure to comply with the obligations under this  Regulation  (a) Burden of proving intention/negligence of a non-qualified TSP lies on the  claiming party.  (b) Intention or negligence of a QTSP shall be presumed, unless proven otherwise  by QTSP.  (2) (Art.13.2) When the TSP informed customer in advance on limitations on the use of  their services, & when such limitations are recognisable to third parties, the TSP is  not liable when the limitations have been exceeded.  (3) (Art.13.3) In accordance with national rules on liability.  iii) Accessibility for person with disabilities (Art.15)  iv) Due diligence (Art.19.1)  (1) The TSP shall take appropriate technical and organisational measures to manage  the risks posed to the security of the trust services they provide.  (2) Having regard to the latest technological developments, those measures shall  ensure that the level of security is commensurate to the degree of risk.  (3) Measures shall be taken to prevent and minimize the impact of security incidents  and inform stakeholders of the adverse effects of any such incidents  v) Security & personal data breach notification (Art.19.2)  (1) The TSP shall, without undue delay but in any event within 24 hours after having  become aware of it, notify the supervisory body and, where applicable, other  relevant bodies, such as the competent national body for information security or  the data protection authority, of any breach of security or loss of integrity that has  a significant impact on the trust service provided or on the personal data  maintained therein.  (2) The TSP shall also notify the [likely adversely affected] natural or legal [customer] of  the breach of security or loss of integrity without undue delay.  (3) May be required by the supervisory body to inform the public, when it is in the  public interest.  vi) Art.20 Supervision of qualified trust service providers  (1) The TSP ensures that it is audited at least every 24 months by an accredited CAB in  order to confirm fulfilment of the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.  (2) The TSP allows the competent supervisory body and a CAB to audit the compliance  with the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.  (3) Where the supervisory body requires from the TSP to remedy any failure to fulfil  requirements under the eIDAS Regulation, the TSP will act accordingly within the  set deadline.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  41  vii) Art.23 on the correct use, when applicable, of the EU trust mark for qualified trust  services (including provisions from CIR (EU) 2015/806.  viii) Art.24.2 of the eIDAS Regulation:  (a) Inform SB of any change in QTS provisioning and of intention to cease;  (b) Requirements on staff;  (c) Sufficient financial resources and/or liability insurance, in accordance with national  law;  (d) Consumer information on terms and conditions, incl. limitations on use;  (e) Use trustworthy systems and products;  (f) Use trustworthy systems to store (personal) data;  (g) Take appropriate measures against forgery and theft of data;  (h) Record and keep accessible data related to activities, issued and received, even  after cessation;  (i) Up-to-date termination plan (to be agreed with SB) to ensure continuity of service;  (j) Ensure lawful processing of personal data in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC.  b) Additional specific requirements for the applicable type of qualified trust service  i) Qualified certificate for electronic signatures  (1) Art.24.1.(a) to (d)  (2) Art.24.2.(k)  (3) Art.24.3  (4) Art.24.4  (5) Art.28.1 – Annex I  (6) Art.28.2  (7) Art.28.3  (8) Art.28.4  (9) Art.28.5  ii) Qualified certificate for electronic seals  (1) Art.24.1.(a) to (d)  (2) Art.24.2.(k)  (3) Art.24.3  (4) Art.24.4  (5) Art.38.1 – Annex III  (6) Art.38.2  (7) Art.38.3  (8) Art.38.4  (9) Art.38.5  iii) Qualified certificate for website authentication  (1) Art.24.1.(a) to (d)  (2) Art.24.2.(k)  (3) Art.24.3  (4) Art.24.4  (5) Art.45.1 – Annex IV  iv) Qualified validation service for qualified electronic signatures (Art.33.1)  v) Qualified validation service for qualified electronic seals (Art.40)  vi) Qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures (Art.34.1)  vii) Qualified preservation service for qualified electronic seals (Art.40)  viii) Qualified electronic time stamps (Art.42.1.(a) to (c))  ix) Qualified electronic registered delivery services (Art.44.1.(a) to (f))  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  42  12) Provide, when the conformity is additionally confirmed or certified as compliant against a specific  standard or publicly available specifications, the report on the fulfilment by the TSP and by the  implementation of its qualified trust services against such standard or specifications that has been  conducted during the audit, as separate documents with an indication of the non-conformities and  their level of importance.  13) Detail the list of the third parties entrusted by the TSP to perform all or parts of its processes  supporting the provision of its qualified trust services. The CAR should detail which of these parties  have been subject to the audit.  Note: If already provided otherwise, e.g. in an additional audit report as specified under point (12),  this should not be required to be repeated.  14) Indicate, when required by the applicable accreditation/conformity assessment scheme, by when  the next surveillance audit and the next compliance audit have to be conducted at the latest.41  15) Indicate under which circumstances an accredited conformity assessment body has to be involved  in reassessing the assessed TSP and the qualified trust services in addition to the planned audits.  The CAR should be clearly requested to be protected in integrity (since it is sent by the QTSP and not  directly by the CAB) and to ensure its origin. To this extent, the CAR should be requested to be either  signed using the handwritten signature of the CAB lead auditor, signed using an advanced electronic  signature, sealed with an advanced electronic seal of the CAB, or by some equivalent method.  The confidentiality of the information notified by the (Q)TSP (incl. the CAR) to the SB should be ensured  (since it may contain sensitive information).  Notification of accredited CABs and conformity assessment activities  The eIDAS Regulation does not foresee any obligation for the EU MS or the NABs to notify or inform of the  conformity assessment activities in respect of which accreditation of CAB is operated in accordance with this  Regulation and of any changes thereto, in particular information on the accredited CABs and the  accreditation scheme details.  Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 only foresees an obligation for a NAB to inform the other NABs of the  conformity assessment activities in respect of which it operates accreditation and of any changes thereto,  and not to inform any other body or the Commission of those activities (Art.12.1). That Regulation also  limits the obligation of each EU MS to inform the Commission and the EA on the communication of the  identity of its NAB and of all conformity assessment activities only in respect of which that body operates  accreditation in support of Community harmonisation legislation (Art.12.2). This includes details about the  CABs accredited to carry out third-party conformity assessment tasks, on conformity assessment  activities/modules, products concerned, and attestation of competence. All the notified CABs and the  associated notifications are expected to appear in the NANDO database  (http://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/nando/).  The use of the NANDO database is governed by the EC as it is specifically designed for new approach  directives and notified bodies. Hence, it may not be expected that NANDO will include a specific repository  of eIDAS accredited CABs notified to the Commission by the MS as NANDO is a very specific database that  lists notified bodies. Notified bodies are bodies that have been appointed by Member States to the  Commission and other Member States to carry out conformity assessment activities in the field of so called  41 The annual surveillance audit that may be a requirement coming from the accreditation/conformity assessment  scheme under which CAB are accredited and (Q)TSP/(Q)TS are audited (e.g. §7.9 of ISO 17065 and EN 319 403) is not  a requirement from the eIDAS Regulation.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  43  New Approach and New Legislative Approach Legislation. Only notified bodies are allowed to carry out  these tasks.  It should be clarified (e.g. by the EC) whether either an obligation or a possibility or on the contrary any  prevention would exist for MS to notify the EC for publication in the NANDO database of the CABs  accredited in accordance with the eIDAS Regulation.  As a general recommendation, notified information should also include information, and any change  thereto, about each of the EA MLA signatory NABs, whether they operate an accreditation scheme in  accordance with the eIDAS Regulation, details regarding such an accreditation scheme, accredited CABs  and for which QTPS/QTS, accredited CABs conformity assessment activities (e.g. certification certificates),  etc. The database eventually used for the publication of such information, the practical aspects (e.g.  identification of the notification bodies; location, content and structure of page related to eIDAS  accreditation of CABs) should be organised in such a way that the information could easily be consumed by  relying parties including TSPs and SBs.  On the other hand, in general, conformity assessment certificates, if provided by accredited CABs, need to  carry the logo of the accreditation body that has accredited them. In this respect, it may be possible to find  out whether a certificate has been issued by an accredited CAB or not, by which NAB it has been  accredited and under which accreditation scheme. However, this requires a careful analysis of such  conformity assessment certificates. That may be quite straightforward for SB receiving the initially notified  or 2-yearly CAR but it does not solve the need of TSPs or QTSPs to benefit from market information and  identify which are the candidate CABs being duly accredited to conduct assessment activities in accordance  with the eIDAS Regulation.  It is recommended to NABs, and alternatively to SBs under Art.18 of the eIDAS Regulation, to cooperate to  set-up a single and centralised dissemination point providing to the public, information, and any change  thereto, about each of the EA MLA signatory NABs, whether they operate an accreditation scheme in  accordance with the eIDAS Regulation, details regarding such an eIDAS accreditation scheme, eIDAS  accredited CABs and for which type(s) of QTPS/QTS, eIDAS conformity assessment activities (incl.  certificates when available) carried out by eIDAS accredited CABs, etc.  As an illustrative example for a very limited number of EU MS, that information could be made available as  detailed and displayed in the following figures42.  42 Examples data based on information available by 21.09.2016.

Format and procedure of notification under Art.21.1 of the eIDAS  The procedure for notification under Art.21.1 of the eIDAS Regulation should be clearly established and  communicated to TSPs.  It is recommended that:  (a) Such a procedure is made publicly available from the website of the national supervisory body  (SB).  (b) The notification is supported by a notification form to be completed by the notifying TSP and sent  to the competent SB.  (c) The completed notification form should be either signed using the handwritten signature of a legal  representative of the notifying TSP, or signed using a qualified electronic signature or sealed with  an qualified electronic seal.  (d) Where required by national law, the notifying TSP includes proof that the person signing the  notification form is legally representing the TSP organisation. For example, by including an extract  from official records like a national trade register.  (e) The confidentiality of the information notified by the TSP to the SB should be ensured (as it may  contain sensitive information).  (f) The signature/seal on the notification form should be compliant with the applicable signature  format standard referred to in Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/150643.  (g) The notification form indicates the documentation to be submitted jointly with the notification  form as part of the notification (see below for recommendation on that documentation).  (h) The completed, signed or sealed, notification form and related documentation are sent  electronically to the competent SB, or as an alternative, delivered by hand or postal mail.  (i) The notification form clearly indicates or refers to the relevant fees, when applicable, that the TSP  will have to pay for the competent SB services, from the notification until the termination of the  notified trust services and/or the withdrawal of the qualified status would it be granted by the SB,  and whether those fees are fixed or recurrent fees or a mix of both.  (j) The competent supervisory body acknowledges receipt of the notification within time limit defined  in national law of each MS (e.g. within three working days of its receipt), providing clear indication  to the notifying TSP:  (i) Acknowledgement of receipt should not in any manner be interpreted as signifying that  the SB considers that the TSP complies with the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation and  any other relevant requirements under national legislation;  (ii) The obligations or a reference to the obligations of the competent SB, including, when  applicable, reference to applicable legislation;  (iii) The obligations or a reference to the obligations of the notifying TSP, including, when  applicable, reference to applicable legislation;  (iv) The next steps of the process leading to the grant of a qualified status, when applicable, to  the notified TSP and the notified trust service(s) it intends to provide.  43 Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1506 of 8 September 2015 laying down specifications relating to  formats of advanced electronic signatures and advanced seals to be recognised by public sector bodies pursuant to  Articles 27(5) and 37(5) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on electronic  identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market. OJ L 235, 9.9.2015, p. 37–41.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  47  (k) The notification procedure documentation and/or the notification form should include a reference  to the security breach and personal data breach incident report procedure and form allowing TSPs  to notify the supervisory body in accordance with Art.19.2 of the eIDAS Regulation.  The documentation to be submitted jointly with the notification form as part of the notification under  Art.21.1 of the eIDAS Regulation is recommended to include at least the following:  1) A conformity assessment report (CAR) issued by a conformity assessment body (CAB) duly  accredited as per the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.  Note: The notification form should clearly indicate the expectations, recommendations or  requirement with regards to the required CAR and the issuing CAB, e.g. that:  a) The competent SB recognises a CAB as duly accredited as per the requirements of the eIDAS  Regulation when the CAB has been accredited by a national accreditation body under  Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 and when the accreditation certificate certifies that the CAB:  i) Fulfils the requirements of the standard ISO/IEC 17065:2012, and  ii) Fulfils the requirements of the standard ETSI EN 319 403 V2.2.2 (2015-08), and  iii) Has the skills and competencies to certify that TSP/TS comply with the requirements  laid down in the eIDAS Regulation, and in particular, with the requirements for  QTSP/QTS, on the basis of a conformity assessment scheme for which the CAB is  accredited.  b) The competent SB recognises a CAB as duly accredited as per the requirements of the eIDAS  Regulation when the CAB has been accredited by a national accreditation body under  Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 under another normative scheme as the one specified in 1.(a)  provided such an alternative scheme has been recognised as conform to the eIDAS  requirements (Art.3.18, Art.20.1).  c) The purpose of the CAR is to assess the conformity of TSP/TS with the requirements laid  down in the eIDAS Regulation, and in particular, with the requirements for qualified trust  service providers and for the qualified trust services concerned by the notification.  Consequently, the CAR must bear a clear conformity statement confirming - if such is the  case - that the assessed QTSP/QTS meets all the applicable requirements of the eIDAS  Regulation.  d) The CAR is to provide sufficient details to demonstrate that the assessed QTSP/QTS meets  all the applicable requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.  e) The structure and the information provided in the CAR should be aligned with the  specifications provided in the notification form (see section 4.5 of this document for  guidance on the recommended structure of such a report).  2) Memorandum and Articles of Association of the notifying TSP.  3) Evidence that the notifying TSP maintains sufficient financial resources and/or has obtained  appropriate liability insurance with regards to the provision of the trust services for which a qualified  status is requested, e.g. including  a) Copy of the profit and loss account and balance sheets for the last 3 years for which accounts  have been closed; failing that, appropriate statements from banks44.  44 Subject to applicable national laws, if, for some exceptional reason (to be notified with its justification by the  notifying TSP) which the competent SB considers justified, the notifying TSP is unable to provide one or other of those  documents, it may prove having sufficient financial resources by any other document which the competent SB  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  48  b) Liability insurance statements.  4) Trust service policy(ies) that applies(apply) to the trust services for which a qualified status is  requested.  5) Trust service practice statement that applies(apply) to the trust services for which a qualified status  is requested.  6) Trust service detailed architecture (e.g. PKI hierarchy along with the indication of the supported  trust service policies) of the trust services for which a qualified status is requested.  7) Test samples of all relevant and applicable types of outputs from the qualified trust services the  notifying TSP intends to start providing.  8) List of standards:  a) with which operations are claimed to be compliant.  b) with which operations are audited, evaluated, certified or assessed to be compliant and details  about the underlying audit, evaluation, certification or assessment scheme.  9) Copy of standard end-user agreement the notifying TSP intends to use with regards to the provision  of the trust services for which a qualified status is requested.  10) The documentation related to the assessment of risks aimed at supporting the demonstration of the  requirements of eIDAS Regulation Art.19.1.  11) A security & personal data breach notification plan aimed to support the demonstration of the  requirements of eIDAS Regulation Art.19.2.  12) The termination plan (eIDAS Regulation Art.17.4.(i), Art.24.2.(i)).  In addition to any applicable national language, all relevant documents regarding format and procedure for  notification under Art.21.1 of the eIDAS Regulation should be made available in UK English in order to  facilitate eIDAS Art.18 cooperation between EU MS SBs, when applicable.  The confidentiality of the information notified by the (Q)TSP to the SB should be ensured (since it may  contain sensitive information).  considers appropriate. The competent SB may reserve the right to request any other document enabling it to verify  the TSP's financial resources.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  49  6. Initial verification of the notified QTSP/QTS with the eIDAS  requirements & communication of the granted qualified status for  inclusion in the national TL  As previously stated in the present document, it is ultimately the supervisory body (SB) that will take the  decision to grant or not the qualified status to the notifying QTSP/QTS.  In order to enable and facilitate the task of the SB in taking a proper and informed decision, it is crucial  that the notification submitted by the notifying TSP and in particular that the submitted CAR includes  sufficient information to demonstrate, in detail to the SB, that the assessed QTSP/QTS fulfil the  requirements laid down in the eIDAS Regulation and consequently deserves to be granted a qualified  status. It is not regarded as suitable that the SB, which has the obligation and bears the final liability to  verify the compliance of the QTSP/QTS with the eIDAS Regulation, will take a positive decision on a  Conformity Assessment Report, when the underlying conformity assessment (e.g. certification) has been  done against a specific standard and not against the eIDAS requirements.  In order to allow for an efficient initiation process, as stressed by Recital (45) of the eIDAS Regulation,  preliminary interactions between prospective qualified trust service providers and the competent  supervisory body are encouraged with a view to facilitating the due diligence leading to the provisioning of  qualified trust services.  The following assumptions can be regarded concerning the “initial verification” phase:   The SB has communicated to candidate TSPs the applicable national requirements and  recommendations regarding the notification procedure, the notification form, the accompanying  documentation and the CAR, as recommended in the present document, and   The notifying TSP has implemented those requirements and recommendations.  However, the following recommendations on the steps to be undertaken by the notified SB, can be applied  even the above assumptions are not met:  1) On reception of a notification under Art.21.1 from a TSP intending to start providing qualified trust  services, acknowledge the reception to the TSP (see section 4.(k)).  2) Verify that the notification procedure has been respected, e.g. that the notification form is fully  completed, duly signed, accompanied with the required documentation (see section 4 for guidance  on recommendations for such a documentation) and in particular verify the eligibility of the CAR.  Verification of the eligibility of the CAR includes verification that  (a) The CAR has been issued by a CAB accredited in accordance with the eIDAS Regulation (see  section 0).  (b) The CAR provides sufficient information to demonstrate that the assessed QTSP/QTS fulfil each  of the applicable eIDAS requirements (see section 4.5).  When this verification is not satisfactory, indicate the non-conformities to the notifying TSP as well  as the deadline for correcting these non-conformities.  3) Clearly identify the name of the assessed trust service provider, and where applicable its registration  number, as stated in the official records, its official postal address and its electronic address.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  50  Note: Both the notification form and the CAR should bear that information. The related information  from the notification form and the CAR should of course match.  4) Clearly identify the qualified trust service(s) of the trust service provider for which the CAR confirms  (e.g. certifies) the conformity with the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. The identification of  the service(s) is to align with CID (EU) 2015/1505 and clause 5.5.1.1 of ETSI TS 119 612 v2.1.1.  Note: Both the notification form and the CAR should bear that information. The related  information from the notification form and the CAR should of course match. At least the CAR  should provide that information to the level of details required to allow identification of the  service(s) to be listed in the applicable national trusted list in accordance with CID (EU)  2015/1505 (see section 2.4 of the present document).  5) Taking into account, for each (potentially) qualified trust service identified in point (4),  (a) the detailed description of the functional (e.g. PKI) architecture or hierarchy,  (b) the notified documentation,  (c) the notified CAR (ideally structured as detailed in section 4.5),  verify that the notified TSP and the qualified trust services it intends to provide comply with the  requirements laid down in the eIDAS Regulation, and in particular, with the requirements for  qualified trust service providers and for the qualified trust services they provide. That verification is  to be performed requirement per requirement for each of the applicable eIDAS requirement with  regards to the type of QTSP/QTS. For that purpose, the structure of those requirements provided in  point (11) of section 4.5 of the present document can also be used as a check list for such a  verification by the SB.  The relevance and severity of each non-conformity with any eIDAS requirement45 is to be judged by  the SB as a last resort46.  6) When the relevance and the severity of the identified non-conformity(ies) lead the SB to conclude  that the notified TSP and the trust services it intends to provide as qualified do not comply with the  requirements laid down in the eIDAS Regulation, and in particular, with the requirements for  qualified trust service providers and for the qualified trust services they provide, then the SB shall  inform the trust service provider specifying the reasons for non-granting of the qualified status.  7) In the absence of non-conformities, or when the relevance and the severity of the identified non- conformity(ies) lead the SB to conclude that the notified TSP and the trust services it intends to  provide as qualified do comply with the requirements laid down in the eIDAS Regulation, and in  particular, with the requirements for qualified trust service providers and for the qualified trust  services they provide, then the SB shall grant qualified status to the trust service provider and the  trust services it provides and inform the body referred to in Article 22(3) of the eIDAS Regulation  (hereafter the trusted list scheme operator or TLSO) for the purposes of updating the trusted lists  referred to in its Article 22(1).  8) With respect to point (7) above, the SB and the TLSO shall respect the timing constraints clarified by  CID 2015/1505/EU (in particular enforcing clause 5.5.5 of ETSI TS 119 612 v2.1.1)47 with regards to  45 As a reminder it is important here to distinguish a non-conformity with whatever requirement from whatever  standard (e.g. as potentially reported by the notified CAR) and a non-conformity with a requirement from the eIDAS  Regulation.  46 In that, the decision of the SB may overrule the CAB certification decision or non-conformity decision reported in  the CAR by the CAB.  47 “TLSO shall ensure the consistency of the (re)-issuance of a trusted list and the actual date when a service status has  been updated (e.g. granted or withdrawn), i.e. the 'List issue date and time' (clause 5.3.14), the time of signing the  trusted list and the time of change. The date and time associated to the new current status of a listed service shall not  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  51  date and time of the issuance of the trusted list and the date and time of the grant of the qualified  status to the concerned trust services and as the latter will appear in the trusted list. As the QTSPs  may begin to provide the qualified trust service after the qualified status has been indicated in the  corresponding national trusted list, the date of the grant of the qualified status must be aligned with  the date of publication of that trusted list, no back dating is allowed.  Example: A “CA/QC” service identified by the public key of an issuing technical CA whose  public/private key pair has been generated (and certified) on 01.08.2016 is granted a qualified  status by the SB that came internally to that conclusion on 01.11.2016 based on a notification  received on 01.10.2016. The publication of the qualified status in the corresponding national  trusted list can only occur (for whatever reason) on 6.11.2016. The SB and the TLSO (when they  are different entities) shall make sure that the three dates regarding the date of issuance of the  trusted list (‘List issue date and time' - clause 5.3.14 of ETSI TS 119 612 v2.1.1), the time of  signing the trusted list, and the date of granting the qualified status (‘Current status starting  date and time’ – clause 5.5.5) shall be aligned in this example to 06.11.2016 and make sure that  the updated trusted list is effectively published and available to relying parties on that same  date. In no way, the date appearing in ‘Current status starting date and time’ (clause 5.5.5) can  be back dated to an earlier date (e.g. not 01.08.2016, not 01.11.2016).  9) During the initial verification process, the SB may require additional information from the notifying  TSP and from the CAB having issued the notified CAR.  10) The initial verification process should be concluded within three months meaning that when leading  to a positive conclusion, the total elapsed time between the notification and the effective  publication of the qualified status in the national trusted list should be less than three months.  When the initial verification process would be leading to a negative decision, or would require  additional information from the notifying TSP, the elapsed time between the notification and the  notification of the negative decision or the request for additional information should be as short as  possible and similarly less than three months. If the verification is not concluded within three  months of notification, the SB shall inform the notifying TSP specifying the duly motivated reasons  (see point 11 below) for the delay and the new deadline by which the verification is to be concluded.  11) During the initial verification process, the SB should respect, in particular, the principles of good  administration, including the obligation to give reasons for its decisions, as well as the principle of  proportionality.  be set before the date of (re)issuance of the trusted list as retroactive status change can have undesired effects to  previous validations of listed services and of their outputs”.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  52  7. Supervisory body resources and organisational measures  EU Member States are not obliged by the eIDAS Regulation to have CABs established on their territory or  even to have their existing NAB being able to accredit CABs on their territory. However, Article 17 of the  eIDAS Regulation requires EU MS to designate a supervisory body established in their territory (or, upon  mutual agreement with another Member State, a supervisory body established in that other Member  State) to be responsible for supervisory tasks in their territory. Each EU MS is further required to give such  a body the necessary powers and adequate resources for the exercise of those supervisory tasks (see  Art.17.4).  The tasks of supervisory bodies can be grouped in different categories of activities:   Cooperation (with other SBs - Art.17.4.(a); with data protection authorities - Art.17.4.(f), with NABs)   Analysis of QTSP/QTS and qualified status life-cycle management  o analysis of initial and 2-yearly CAR - Art.17.4.(b).  o grant and withdraw of qualified status (Art.17.4.(g)).  o auditing or requesting audits (Art.17.4.(e)) and analysing resulting ad hoc CAR.  o monitoring deadlines for each QTS from each QTSP (e.g. 2-yearly or ad hoc CAR, request for  complement of information, resolution of notified non-conformities.  o verify the existence and correct application of provisions on termination plans (Art.17.4.(i)).  o monitoring of QTSP/QTS activities (this may include proactive or ex post monitoring and  verification of the provisions, practices and policies of the QTSP/QTS).  o analysing QTSP/QTS provision changes notified under Art.24.2.(a).   Information/reporting (breaches notifications to other SBs and the public - Art.17.4.(c); to data  protection authorities - Art.17.4.(f); activities to EC - Art.17.4.(d).   Management of the documentation related to the supervision activities (including their publication,  e.g. as required under CID (EU) 2015/1505 with regards to the supervision scheme, Art.21.1  notification procedure and form, Art.19 breach notification, etc.).  With regards to the specific activities related to the initiation of qualified trust services, the main tasks are  related to the set-up of the supervision activities and of the related documentation, as well as to the  analysis of the CAR, the decision to grant or not a qualified status, the notification to the notifying TSPs of  the decision and potentially of the non-conformities and/or request for additional information, the update  of the national trusted list, via the trusted list body when different from the SB, when applicable.  Quantifying the resources will basically depend on the number of notifying TSPs, of notified trust services,  of QTSPs and QTSs. SBs may also rely on internal resources and/or on external resources when internal  resources are not sufficient.  Supervisory bodies should employ staff and, if applicable, subcontractors who possess the necessary  expertise, reliability, experience, and qualifications and who have received appropriate training regarding  security and personal data protection rules, as well as regarding to the provision of trust services and the  underlying technology, including trusted lists specifications.  Supervisory bodies or their national government may establish fees to be supported by notifying TSPs and  QTSPs with regards to the notification, verification and supervision tasks they generate. Considering the  notifying TSPs and QTSPs are already supporting the costs of the initial and regular conformity  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  53  assessments, those fees when applied should be reasonable, proportionate, justified and not create  barrier to market entrance.  Specific attention should be paid by SB and EU MS on the potential need for taking over part or all  termination activities in case of failure for the QTSP (or the expected taking over 3rd party) to correctly  execute the termination plan. This may include recommendations on the set up of appropriate legislative  instruments ensuring proper execution of a QTSP/QTS termination plan and in particular proper  implementation of Art.24.2.(h) (e.g. in case of unscheduled termination such as bankruptcy).

The eIDAS Regulation is about trust,  seamless user experience and convenience in online cross-border transactions.  Trusted list  A trusted list is a list including information relating to the qualified trust service providers which are  established in and supervised by an EU Member State, together with information related to the qualified  trust services provided by them, in accordance with the relevant provisions laid down in the eIDAS  Regulation. Those lists have constitutive value and are the primary source of information to validate that a  qualified status has been granted to a QTSP and to the QTS it provides.  Trusted lists are essential elements in building trust among electronic market operators by allowing users  to determine the qualified status and the status history of trust service providers and their services.  Member States may include in the trusted lists information on non-qualified trust service providers,  together with information related to the non-qualified trust services provided by them. It shall be clearly  indicated that they are not qualified according to the eIDAS Regulation.  Member States may include in the trusted lists information on nationally defined trust services of other  types than those defined under Article 3(16) of the eIDAS Regulation. It shall be clearly indicated that they  are not qualified according to the eIDAS Regulation.  QTSP/QTS requirements and obligations  The eIDAS Regulation foresees a set of requirements and obligations for qualified trust service providers  (QTSP) and qualified trust services (QTS) they provide in order to ensure a high level of security for the  qualified trust services. Those obligations include in a nutshell:  - Processing of personal data shall be carried out in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC.  - A Trust service provider (TSP) is liable for damage caused intentionally or negligently to any natural or  legal person due to a failure to comply with the obligations under this Regulation, while the intention  or negligence of a QTSP shall be presumed, unless proven otherwise by the QTSP. When TSP informed  customer in advance on limitations on the use of their services, and when such limitations are  recognisable to third parties, TSP is not liable when limitations have been exceeded.  - Where feasible, services must be accessible for person with disabilities.  - Implementing appropriate technical and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the  security of the trust services they provide. Taking the latest technological developments into account,  those measures shall ensure that the level of security is commensurate to the degree of risk. Measures  shall be taken to prevent and to minimize the impact of security incidents and to inform stakeholders  of the adverse effects of any such incidents.  - Very strict rules regarding the obligation of notifying security & personal data breaches.  - Additional requirements on QTSP operations and practices:  - Inform the SB of any change in QTS provisioning and of intention to cease;  - Have an up-to-date termination plan, agreed with the competent supervisory body (SB), to  ensure continuity of service;  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  56  - Requirements on employed staff and subcontractors, when used;  - Sufficient financial resources and/or liability insurance, in accordance with national law;  - Inform consumers on terms and conditions, incl. on limitations on use;  - Use of trustworthy systems and products ensuring the technical security and reliability of the  supported processes;  - Use of trustworthy systems to store (personal) data in a verifiable form;  - Take appropriate measures against forgery and theft of data; and  - Record and keep accessible all relevant information concerning data issued and received,  even after cessation of activities.  - Specific requirements from the provisions laid down in the eIDAS Regulation with regards to the  provision of a specific type of qualified trust service.  All those requirements must be met by the QTSP/QTS before issuing the very first qualified trust service  output, e.g. before issuing the very first qualified time stamp in the case of QTSP providing qualified time  stamping services.  Once granted a qualified status, the eIDAS Regulation also foresees an active supervision scheme of  qualified trust service providers (QTSP) and qualified trust services (QTS) they provide by the national  competent supervisory body (SB) to monitor the fulfilment of the QTSP/QTS requirements and obligations  throughout their lifetime.  Service digital identity  The granularity of the identification in the national trusted lists of the technical instance of the qualified  trust service to which the qualified status is granted is actually clarified by the Commission Implementing  Decision (EU) 2015/150548. It corresponds to the level of the “Service digital identity” field as specified in  ETSI TS 119 612 v2.1.1 on which the CID relies to establish the content and define the technical  specifications and formats for the national trusted lists. In a trusted list, a qualified trust service to which a  qualified status is granted is identified by the public key49 identified by the “Service digital identity” field of  the corresponding trusted list service entry of a listed TSP entry. The type of qualified trust service for  which the qualified status is granted is identified by the combination of the “Service Type Identifier” field  and the “Additional Service Information” extension when present and further specifying the type of  service.  With regards to service type identifier “TSA/QTST” URI50, instead of assigning it (only) to time stamping  units (TSUs) is it possible to assign it to a service digital identity, i.e. the public key, of an issuing CA  (respectively a Root-CA) that issues (respectively under which are issued) certificates to TSUs that in turn  sign time stamps. Both implementations are actually possible, namely:   Listing a TSU public key (certificate) as “Service digital identity” of a service of type “TSA/QTST” is of  course possible: any time stamp issued by such a listed TSU with a granted qualified status at the time  indicated by the time stamp shall be considered as qualified), and  48 Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1505 of 8 September 2015 laying down technical specifications and  formats relating to trusted lists pursuant to Article 22(5) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament  and of the Council on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market  (Text with EEA relevance). OJ L 235, 9.9.2015, p. 26–36.  49 When based on PKI public-key technology (when not based on such technology, an indicator expressed as a URI is  used to identify uniquely and unambiguously the listed service).  50 http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/Svctype/TSA/QTST  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015D1505 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015D1505 http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/Svctype/TSA/QTST  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  57   The service type identifier “TSA/QTST” URI can also be assigned to a CA public key (certificate) instead  of to a TSU public key (certificate) , but in such case \"O=\" attribute of certificate might not match the  'TSP Name' written within TSL (there are TSPs(QTS) using TSU certificates issued by other TSPs) and  this is required by ETSI TS 119 612 (5.5.3 Note 4 “With regards to X.509 Certificates that are candidates  to represent a public key identifying a listed service, the TLSO shall disregard certificates for which the  \"O=\" attribute does not strictly match the 'TSP Name' value”).  For that to be eligible, all TSUs either listed directly or signed by a CA listed as “TSA/QTST” service must  reach the qualified level, all issued time stamps must be qualified and the corresponding QTSP and its QTS  consisting in issuing qualified time stamps must meet the applicable eIDAS requirements.  When listing a CA with a type “TSA/QTST”, it is de facto required to have that CA issue certificates to  qualified TSUs51 only (to the exclusion of non-qualified TSUs) and to have those TSUs to issue qualified time  stamps only (to the exclusion of non-qualified time stamps) as in the context of time stamps it would be  much more difficult than in the context of certificates to distinguish between those types of time stamps  when the listed CA issue certificates for both types of TSUs, actually:   Best practices and relevant standards require the use of time stamping policy OID indication in the  time stamp but there is only one field allowing one single OID and this can be any proprietary OID or  the “best practices level OID” defined by ETSI EN 319 421. ETSI EN 319 422 defines a time stamp  extension for where to place a \"QtstCompliance\" statement (by analogy with the QcCompliance  statement for qualified certificates) but it is not mandatory and it is not commonly used in existing  implementations. ETSI EN 319 421 further requires that when a TSU issues qualified time stamps, that  TSU shall not issue non-qualified time stamps and TSA should use separate TSU for issuing qualified  and non-qualified time stamps.   In the eIDAS Regulation,  o there is no requirement to indicate in the time stamp itself that it was created as qualified, and  o there is no requirement to implement or comply with any standard.   There is, under the current TL specifications, no possibility for the TLSO in a “TSA/QTST” entry of a  trusted list to further qualify some set of time stamps for being labelled as qualified or not-qualified  when issued under the same TSU or the same (root) CA issuing TSU certificates.  So when a TSA/TSP wants to issue both qualified and non-qualified time stamps, having separate  dedicated TSUs (creating exclusively either qualified or non-qualified time stamps) and grouped under two  separate dedicated CAs (either signing qualified TSUs or non-qualified TSUs) would be a must when using  the approach of listing the CA in the TL as “TSA/QTST” type of service.  Actually, when an issuing CA is not signing exclusively qualified TSUs that issue qualified time stamps  exclusively, then that issuing CA cannot be used as Service Digital Identifier (Sdi) in a “TSA/QTST” entry and  all corresponding qualified TSUs issuing exclusively qualified time stamps must be listed separately.  What does Regulation (EC) 765/2008 bring as advantages to the SBs and to the  TSPs?  Regulation (EC) 765/2008 ensures the equivalence of the level of competence of conformity assessment  bodies (CABs) with the aim of facilitating mutual recognition and of promoting the overall acceptance of  accreditation certificates and conformity assessment results issued by accredited bodies.  51 That same CA would also be entitled to issue QCs, in theory, when meeting the applicable requirements.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  58  All EU MS have one single national accreditation body (NAB) appointed under Regulation (EC) 765/2008,  member and signatory of the EA multilateral agreement52. Accreditation through NABs that are signatories  of the EA MLA provides a further level of confidence that the accredited CABs are independent,  competent, and that they work in a consistent way.  Each NAB is subject to routine and rigorous evaluations by peer evaluation teams in order to verify  continuing compliance with Regulation (EC) 765/2008 and the international standard for accreditation  bodies (ISO/IEC 17011). Each NAB has an obligation to inform the other NABs with regards to the  conformity assessment activities in respect of which it operates accreditations and of any changes thereto.  To that end, it also takes part in regular technical discussions with other NABs to harmonise their activities.  NABs demonstrating conformity with harmonised standards by successful peer evaluation (Art.10) are  presumed to fulfil requirements of Regulation (EC) 765/2008 (Art.8).  Accreditations granted by any Regulation (EC) 765/2008 - compliant NABs are deemed equivalent for a  considered conformity assessment scheme.  NABs manage the accreditation certificate life cycle for each CAB they have granted an accreditation: i.e.  they monitor the accredited CABs, restrict / suspend / withdraw accreditation certificates when required.  NABs are permitted to operate across national borders. In theory, CABs must be accredited by the NAB of  the country in which they are established but in the event the NAB does not provide services for the  expected accreditation scheme then a CAB may request accreditation services from an EA MLA signatory  NAB from another country than the one in which the CAB is established.  Conformity assessment attestations (e.g. certifications) issued by all CAB accredited by Regulation (EC)  765/2008 compliant NABs are deemed equivalent, for a considered conformity assessment scheme (e.g.  certification scheme)53. This means that a TSP, either without qualified status and intending to start  providing QTSs or being a QTSP providing QTS, that is required to provide its national SB with a CAR issued  by an accredited CAB, can choose whatever CAB from whatever EA MLA signatory country that has been  accredited under a valid eIDAS accreditation scheme for obtaining such a CAR. The competent SB cannot  reject the eligibility of the notified CAR because it has not been provided by a CAB established or  accredited in the territory for which the SB is competent.  Trust services defined by the eIDAS Regulation  In its Art.3.16, the eIDAS Regulation defines a ‘trust service’ as an electronic service normally provided for  remuneration which consists of:  (a) the creation, verification, and validation of electronic signatures, electronic seals or electronic time  stamps, electronic registered delivery services and certificates related to those services, or  (b) the creation, verification and validation of certificates for website authentication; or  (c) the preservation of electronic signatures, seals or certificates related to those services.  Which are the qualified trust services defined by the eIDAS Regulation?  52 NAB-Malta signatory in testing except ISO 15189. NAH, the new HU NAB full EA member with effect from 1 April  2016 applied for the EA MLA signatory status and the peer evaluation of NAH is ongoing.  53 See Art.11.2 of Regulation (EC) 765/2008.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  59  Only those trust services listed in Art.3.16 of the eIDAS Regulation for which there are applicable  requirements in the Regulation can benefit from the qualified status. eIDAS regulates the following nine  qualified trust services:  1. The creation of qualified certificates for electronic signatures  Certificates for electronic signature are electronic attestations which link electronic signature  validation data to a natural person and confirm at least the name or the pseudonym of that person.  Since 1 July 2016, an electronic signature can only be used by a natural person to sign, i.e. mainly to  express consent on the signed data/document. This represents a significant difference from the  eSignature Directive 1999/93/EC regime, where an electronic signature, which could be used by legal  persons, was defined as a means of authentication. Under the eIDAS Regulation, the entity who  creates an electronic signature (the so called signatory) will be a natural person. Therefore, certificates  for electronic signature cannot be issued to legal persons anymore. Instead legal persons can use  certificates for electronic seals (see below).  A qualified electronic certificate for electronic signatures is an essential element for a signatory to  create qualified electronic signatures that shall have the equivalent legal effect of a handwritten  signature all over the EU.  2. The creation of qualified certificates for electronic seals  As explained above, since 1 July 2016, legal persons cannot create legally valid (qualified) electronic  signatures anymore and cannot be issued (qualified) certificates for electronic signatures. Instead legal  persons can use certificates for electronic seals, which are electronic attestations that link electronic  seal validation data to a legal person and confirm the name of that person. The aim of an electronic  seal is not to sign but to serve as an evidence that an electronic data/document was issued by a legal  person, ensuring certainty of the data/document’s origin and integrity.  A qualified electronic certificate for electronic seals is an essential element for a legal person to create  qualified electronic seals that shall enjoy, all over the EU, the presumption of integrity of the data and  of correctness of the origin of that data to which the qualified electronic seal is linked.  3. The creation of qualified certificates for website authentication  Certificates for website authentication are issued to ensure the users (in particular citizens and SMEs)  that behind the website there is a legal or natural person identifiable by trustworthy information.  The Regulation sets clear requirements for qualified website authentication certificates to be  considered trustworthy together with obligations for qualified trust service providers of such qualified  certificates with regard to the security of their operations, their liability and their supervision regime.  As a consequence, the Regulation ensures transparency regarding the quality of the service offered to  users, accountability of providers with regards to the security of their services, trustworthiness of the  data associated to qualified authenticated websites and technological neutrality of services and  solutions.  4. Qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures  Such a qualified trust service aims to ensure the long-term data preservation, in order to ensure the  legal validity and trustworthiness of qualified electronic signatures over extended periods of time and  guarantee that they can be validated irrespective of future technological changes.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  60  5. Qualified preservation service for qualified electronic seals  Such a qualified trust service aims to ensure the long-term data preservation, in order to ensure the  legal validity and trustworthiness of qualified electronic seals over extended periods of time and  guarantee that they can be validated irrespective of future technological changes.  6. Qualified validation service for qualified electronic signatures  Validation of electronic signature is an ancillary service to electronic signatures whose process aims to  confirm the validity of an electronic signatures.  Qualified validation services for qualified electronic signatures entail the verification by a qualified  trust service provider that the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation are met by a qualified electronic  signature in order to confirm its validity.  7. Qualified validation service for qualified electronic seals  Validation of electronic seal is an ancillary service to electronic seals whose process aims to confirm  the validity of an electronic seals.  Qualified validation services for qualified electronic seals entail the verification by a qualified trust  service provider that the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation are met by a qualified electronic seal in  order to confirm its validity.  8. Qualified electronic time stamps services  Electronic time stamps are issued to ensure the correctness of the time linked to data/documents.  Qualified electronic time stamps shall enjoy, all over the EU, the presumption of the accuracy of the  date and the time it indicates and the integrity of the data to which the date and time are bound.  9. Qualified electronic registered delivery services  By relying on a qualified electronic registered delivery service, one will benefit, all over the EU, from  the presumption of the integrity of the registered data, the sending of that data by the identified  sender, its receipt by the identified addressee and the accuracy of the date and time of the sending  and the reception indicated by that qualified trust service.  The Regulation sets clear requirements for all such qualified trust services to be considered trustworthy  together with obligations for their qualified trust service providers with regard to the security of their  operations, their liability and their supervision regime.  EA rationale for selecting ISO/IEC 17065 & ETSI EN 319 403 as the CAB accreditation  framework for TSP/TS assessments  It should be noted as well that the EA promoted accreditation scheme requires CABs to be certification  bodies, and not simply inspection bodies or laboratories as CABs are required to certify the conformity of  QTSPs/QTSs against the applicable requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.  The EA justified the choice of ISO/ICE 17065 as a basis for accreditation of CABs for evaluating their  competence in assessing TSP/TS as follows:  EA members unanimously selected ISO/IEC 17065 as the best option as basis for the accreditation  of CABs in the context of conformity assessments of TSPs and trust services they provide, and in  particular assessment of QTSPs/QTSs. EA experience is that ISO/IEC 17020 is not considered  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  61  appropriate to assessment of conformance of requirements for the management system of the  TSP, and it is considered that a review of the security management system of the TSP constitutes an  important part of a TSP audit.  Also, ISO/IEC 17020 does not impose a continued assessment by following deviations of the use of  certification brands. Inspection processes tend to review the status of the items being inspected at  a point in time whereas the requirements for a TSP need a more long term, continuous assessment  as provided by a certification scheme. The issue of certification includes requirements for regular  surveillance activities as well as specific requirements for ongoing quality and service improvement.  On their own ISO/IEC 27006 and 17021 are not considered sufficient to cover assessment of specific  service requirements. However, ISO 17065 was specifically designed to be extended to incorporate  requirements from 17021, but the opposite is not true as ISO/IEC 17065 requirements do not fit  well into ISO/IEC 17021.  The industry requirement for public trust services, such as reflected in the CA/Browser Forum  guidelines and in other national schemes for non-qualified trust services, strongly supports a clear  indication of the technical compliance to good practice in industry. The aim of the ETSI EN 319 403  conformity assessment is also to allow an assessment of conformance to industry good practices as  well as that the technical requirements of the Regulation are met. ETSI/CEN consider that any  scheme which falls short of assessment against industry good practice will bring the acceptability  of qualified trust services into question.  There is no inconsistency between a certification by an accredited CAB and the SB having final decision on  whether or not the (Q)TSP/(Q)TS meets the eIDAS requirements. Art.3.18, referring to Regulation (EC)  765/2008, makes it possible the CAB to be a certification body, or an inspection body, or a laboratory, with  the requirement that the CAB must be accredited for its competences to assess QTSP/QTS against all  requirements of eIDAS. It is worth emphasising that the final decision is in the hands of the SB. The latter  may rely upon the information provided by the (Q)TSP and in particular the CAR but it is equally entitled to  request further information and it may take duly justified decision (e.g. applying good principle of  administration and principle of proportionality) that goes against the conformity assessment report.  It is worth stressing as well that the annual surveillance audit that may be a requirement coming from the  accreditation/certification scheme under which CAB is accredited and (Q)TSP/(Q)TS are audited (e.g. §7.9  of ISO 17065 and EN 319 403) is not a requirement from the eIDAS Regulation. Neither is the requirement  for a continued assessment by the CAB. Those continued assessments and annual surveillance audits are  no substitution of ex post supervisory activities of supervisory bodies.  Is the lack of implementing acts adopted pursuant to Art.20.4 of the eIDAS  Regulation an issue?  It should be noted that the implementing acts foreseen in Art.20.4 are not mandatory but optional. There  is no obligation for the EC to establish such acts. The provisions of the eIDAS Regulation are supposed self- sufficient in order to ensure the applicability of the legal framework. As for all optional implementing act,  those Art.20.4 acts are deemed related to non-essential elements of the Regulation that are not  substantial for the Regulation to work. The need to adopt them must be assessed on a case-by-case basis  in the light of several principles including:  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  62   The eIDAS framework consistency: in the present case adopting Art.20.4 implementing acts would  require to ensure its consistency with other implementing acts granting QTSPs/QTSs with a  presumption of compliance with some legal provisions.   Taking into account stakeholders/market needs: evaluating stakeholders/market's demands and  needs, potential barriers hampering the adoption and take-up of eIDAS.   Favouring a non-regulatory approach, a co-regulatory approach, and a development under other  regulatory frameworks: In this case, as the implementation of an eIDAS accreditation scheme may  be ensured under the framework of Regulation 765/2008/EC, as being set up by EA, the  implementing act foreseen in Art.20.4 may not be needed. Furthermore, adopting a secondary act  means codifying a given technological approach that may quickly become obsolete, requiring a  revision of the adopted act.   Availability and adequacy of standards: Before being able to reference a standard, such a  standard must be available. However, the availability of a given standard or technical specifications  does not automatically entail an obligation for the Commission to list it in an implementing act.  Moreover, once standards become available, it is critical to assess their compliance with the  requirements set in the Regulation before considering a possible reference in secondary acts. Such  a referencing will also be scrutinized in the light of the other principles above.  Art.20.4 only allows the EC to reference standards for the accreditation of CABs under eIDAS, for the CAR  resulting from the audit confirming that the QTSP/QTS fulfil the eIDAS requirements and for the auditing  rules under which CABs will carry out their conformity assessment of the QTSP/QTS. It does not empower  the EC to specify the requirements related to these topics. In particular, the referencing of the ETSI EA  promoted scheme would provide that QTSP/QTS audit criteria (“third layer of the scheme”) to be  standardised in such a way that:   The resulting CAR issued by accredited CABs aims to confirm that the qualified trust service  providers and the qualified trust services provided by them fulfil the requirements laid down in the  eIDAS Regulation.   It consists of one or more separate standards, “outcome based” (see 4.4.1), mapping audit criteria  built as control objectives and controls, against the requirements of the Regulation per type of  qualified trust service. Those criteria shall be used by accredited CABs as a basis for establishing  the conformity assessment report to be issued by them, confirming that the QTSP/QTS they assess  fulfil all applicable requirements of the Regulation.  Those criteria defined in an “outcome based” approach could leverage once assessed as conform  to the eIDAS Regulation, on the check lists specified by or in the context of relevant available  standards (e.g. the check list from ETSI EN 319 411-2 with regards to QTSPs issuing qualified  certificates); it should however be clear that those criteria are for use by CABs as a method to  produce a conformity assessment report on the conformity of the audited QTSPs/QTSs and shall  not presuppose or require QTSPs/QTSs to comply with the standards from which they are derived.  QTSPs/QTSs are free to implement such standards, any other standard or no standard at all.  Current CEN/ETSI standards addressing QTSP and QTS related specifications, including the ETSI EN  319 4x1 series and any other relevant standards, can be used by TSPs on a voluntary basis but  cannot be made (de facto) a mandatory requirement for being granted a qualified status.   Whenever compliance with part of the applicable eIDAS requirements would be deemed satisfied  by compliance with a sub-referenced standard, this would be acknowledged provided the  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  63  conformity with such a sub-referenced standard has been assessed and confirmed by an eIDAS  accredited CABs.  Currently no such QTSPs/QTSs audit criteria outcome based standard conformity exists and no other  conformity assessment scheme owner has undertaken the standardisation of a competing eIDAS compliant  scheme. It would be recommended that once a sufficient maturity in the effective criteria used to accredit  CABs either defined by CABs themselves, by SBs or by any other competent body, the European  Commission could ask CEN/ETSI to leverage on that experience to derive an appropriate standard.  This does not prevent the eIDAS CAB accreditation scheme and corresponding conformity assessment  schemes to be used for accreditation of CABs against specific set of TSP oriented standards so that  QTSPs/QTSs can benefit from confirmation (e.g. certification) of conformity against any of such specific  standards. Such schemes may also be used to additionally confirm (e.g. certify) compliance with standards  for use out of the context of the eIDAS Regulation (e.g. CA/Browser Forum and its associated industry) but  also for attesting compliance with standards possibly referenced in the future in (optional) eIDAS  secondary legislation.

General context/the eIDAS Regulation on eID and trust services  Introduction  Regulation (EU) No 910/20141 (hereafter the eIDAS Regulation), on electronic identification and trust  services for electronic transactions in the internal market, provides a regulatory environment for electronic  identification of natural and legal persons and for a set of electronic trust services, namely electronic  signatures, seals, time stamps, registered delivery services and certificates for website authentication2.  The eIDAS Regulation sets the principle of non-discrimination of the legal effects and admissibility of  electronic signatures, electronic seals, electronic time stamps, electronic registered delivery services and  electronic documents as evidence in legal proceedings. Courts (or other bodies in charge of legal  proceedings) cannot discard them as evidence only because they are electronic but have to assess these  electronic tools in the same way they would do for their paper equivalent.  Whether you are a large company, a SME or a citizen trying to complete an electronic transaction in  another EU country, e.g. submit a call for tender or register as a student in another EU Member State (MS),  besides reducing time and costs, the eIDAS Regulation will ensure cross border recognition of notified  national eID mean and qualified trust services supporting your electronic transaction. Hence it will boost  trust, security and convenience.  Since 1 July 2016, most provisions of the eIDAS Regulation are directly applicable in the 28 EU Member  States’ legal framework overcoming problems of fragmented national regimes. It provides legal certainty  and fosters the usage of eID means and trust services for online access and online transactions at EU level.  The eIDAS Regulation will ensure that people and businesses can use their national eIDs to access public  services in other EU countries where eIDs are required for such an access at national level. It also creates  an EU wide internal market for qualified trust services by ensuring their recognition and workability across  borders and considering them equivalent to traditional paper based processes.  Opportunities brought by the eIDAS Regulation  The opportunities reside in leveraging eID and electronic trust services as key enablers for making national  and cross-border electronic transactions more secure, more convenient, trustworthy and benefiting from  legal certainty.  The broader adoption of EU-wide recognised eID means and of electronic trust services will facilitate and  boost the digital transformation of organisations, be it public administrations or businesses, enhance  customer experience, improve the security of electronic transactions and stimulate the provisioning of  new and innovative services.  To this end, a large number of sectors (e.g. finance, banking, transport, insurance, health, sharing  economy, trading, etc.) where obligations exist for security, reliable identification, strong authentication  and legal certainty of evidences, will be positively affected. The eIDAS Regulation will indeed allow citizens,  businesses and public administrations to conveniently meet such obligations for any cross-border  electronic transaction using the recognised eID means and (qualified) trust services of their choice.  1 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/ES/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG  2 See Glossary or Art.3.16 of the eIDAS Regulation for the definition of trust services.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/ES/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  07  Without undergoing identity verification based on physical presence, but by using MS notified eID means  of a level “high”, one should for example be able to use public services in another country or banks may  accept such eID to open a bank account3. By relying on a qualified electronic registered delivery service,  one will benefit, all over the EU, from the presumption of the integrity of the registered data, the sending  of that data by the identified sender, its receipt by the identified addressee and the accuracy of the date  and time of sending and receipt indicated by that qualified trust service.  Specific role of the qualified trust services  To further enhance in particular the trust of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and consumers in  the internal market and to promote the use of trust services and products, the eIDAS Regulation  introduces the notions of qualified trust service and qualified trust service provider with a view to  indicating requirements and obligations that ensure high-level security of whatever qualified trust service  or product is used or provided and, as a consequence, are granted a higher presumption of their legal  effect.  Therefore, when looking for trust services, selecting qualified ones ensures benefiting from a high level of  security and legal certainty of trust services. E.g., qualified electronic time stamp shall enjoy, all over the  EU, the presumption of the accuracy of the date and the time it indicates and the integrity of the data to  which the date and time are bound.  Initiation and supervision of qualified trust services  In order to ensure high-level security of qualified trust services, the eIDAS Regulation foresees an active  supervision scheme of qualified trust service providers (QTSP) and the qualified trust services (QTS) they  provide (hereafter referred to as a QTSP/QTS) by the national competent supervisory body (SB) that  supervises, ex ante and ex post, fulfilment of the QTSP/QTS requirements and obligations. All those  requirements must be met by the QTSP/QTS before providing the very first qualified trust service output,  e.g. before issuing the very first qualified time stamp in the case of QTSP providing qualified time stamping  services.  Before a TSP/TS is granted a qualified status (QTSP/QTS), it will be subject to a pre-authorisation process –  the so called initiation process. QTSPs may only begin to provide the qualified trust service after the  qualified status has been granted by the competent supervisory body and indicated in the national trusted  list. From there, the supervision scheme covers the full life cycle of each QTS and each QTSP, from its  genesis until its termination.  In practice, where TSPs, without qualified status, intend to start providing qualified trust services, they  shall submit to the supervisory body a notification of their intention together with a conformity  assessment report issued by an “eIDAS” accredited conformity assessment body. Before notifying the  competent supervisory body of their intention to start providing qualified trust services, the future  QTSP/QTS must hence successfully pass an external assessment (audit) to confirm it fulfils the eIDAS  requirements. That audit must be conducted by a conformity assessment body specifically accredited to  carry out assessments of QTSP/QTS. The audit results in a formal conformity statement confirming - if such  is the case - that the QTSP/QTS meets all the applicable requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. Based on  the notified information including the report of such an audit, the competent SB will formally verify that  3 National legislations on prevention of money laundering may currently may force identity verification to be based  on physical presence. Furthermore, the use by the private sector of electronic identification means under a notified  scheme is on a voluntarily basis only (see Recital 17 of the eIDAS Regulation).  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  08  the candidate QTSP/QTS meets the applicable eIDAS requirements and, in case of positive verification, it  will undertake the publication of the grant of the qualified status for that QTSP/QTS in the national trusted  list.  It is only when its qualified status is published in the corresponding national trusted list that the QTSP/QTS  is authorised to provide the corresponding QTS.4  Note: A TSP cannot be qualified without providing at least one qualified trust service (Art.3.20 of the  eIDAS Regulation). A TSP is granted a qualified status separately for each type of qualified trust service  covered by the eIDAS Regulation. E.g. a QTSP qualified for the provisioning of qualified certificates for  electronic signatures is not per se granted a qualified status for the issuance of qualified electronic  time stamps; it must first complete the full pre-authorisation process and have its qualified status  granted for the creation of qualified electronic time stamps published explicitly in the national trusted  list before issuing qualified time stamps in addition to the creation of qualified certificates for  electronic signatures. There are nine different types of QTSs defined by the eIDAS Regulation for  which a qualified status is granted separately: creation of qualified certificates for electronic  signatures; creation of qualified certificates for electronic seals, creation of qualified certificates for  website authentication, qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures, qualified  preservation service for qualified electronic seals, qualified validation service for qualified electronic  signatures, qualified validation service for qualified electronic seals, qualified electronic time stamps  services, and qualified electronic registered delivery services.5  Moreover, for a given type of QTS, if a QTSP has already been granted a qualified status for the  provision of one or more such trust services intends to provide another QTS of the same type but  under significantly different practices and/or policies, then it may be required to pass an ad hoc or  complete conformity assessment before been confirmed a qualified status for that new way to  provide such a QTS (Art. 24.2.(a), Art.20.2).  For marketing purposes, once qualified, a QTSP/QTS may use the EU Trust Mark for qualified trust services  when promoting its QTS. That trust mark shown in Figure 1 can only be used by a QTSP to “label” its QTS. It  can be used on any support provided it meets requirements from Art.23 of the eIDAS Regulation (e.g. a link  to the corresponding national trusted list where consumers may verify the granted qualified status must  be displayed on the QTSP’s website) and rules of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/806.6  Basically, this secondary legislation sets the form, colour and size of the EU trust mark, sets the obligation  to clearly indicate the qualified service that the EU trust mark pertains to, and allows association with  other graphical or textual elements provided that certain conditions are met.7  4 The eIDAS Regulation foresees transitional measures (Art.51) that ensures certification-service-provider issuing  qualified certificates to natural persons under Directive 1999/93/EC to be considered as QTSPs issuing certificates for  electronic signatures under the Regulation until they submit a conformity assessment report and the completion of  its assessment by the supervisory body. The submission of that report shall not occur later the 1 July 2017 otherwise  the CSP shall not be considered as a QTSP from 2 July 2017.  5 See Annex A.7 for further details.  6 Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/806 of 22 May 2015 laying down specifications relating to the form  of the EU trust mark for qualified trust services (Text with EEA relevance). OJ L 128, 23.5.2015, p. 13–15.  7 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/eu-trust-mark for more guidance on the use of that trust  mark, downloadable images, user manual and answers to frequently asked questions.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2015.128.01.0013.01.ENG https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/eu-trust-mark  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  09  Figure 1 EU trust mark for qualified trust services  The use of the EU trust mark, which is voluntary, aims to foster transparency of the market and help  consumers distinguishing between qualified trust services and non-qualified ones. Although based on self- assessment, it gives the assurance that the trust service providers and the trust services provided by them  are qualified and comply with the rules set out in the eIDAS Regulation, thus ensuring a high quality which  is regulated throughout the EU.  Once granted a qualified status, QTSPs and their QTSs have the obligation to pass, and submit to the  competent supervisory body a conformity assessment report (CAR) issued by an accredited CAB confirming  at least every 24 months, that the QTSP and the QTSs it provides fulfil the requirements laid down in the  Regulation. Competent supervisory bodies are also allowed, at their own discretion and at any time, to  audit themselves any QTSP/QTS for which they are competent or to request an accredited CAB to perform  an ad hoc audit.  QTSPs and their QTSs are supervised for their entire lifecycle, from their genesis to their termination. In  particular, in order to ensure sustainability and durability of QTSs, as well as to ensure proper termination  and user’s confidence in their provision, QTSPs must maintain, at all times, an up-to-date termination plan.  That plan is to be agreed by the SB upon initiation and regularly checked for compliance during the life of  the QTSP/QTS.  Scope of the present document and relationship with other recommendations  This document is one deliverable out of a series whose objective is to propose guidelines aimed at  facilitating the implementation of the provisions related to trust services of the eIDAS Regulation in the  area of qualified trust services8.  This document proposes guidelines on the initiation of qualified trust services pursuant to Art.21.1 of the  eIDAS Regulation.  It should be read together with the “Guidelines on Supervision of Qualified Trust  Services”9.  The target audience of the document are trust service providers (including individuals, businesses and  public administrations) who intend to start providing qualified trust services, those Member States  supervisory bodies designated to carry out supervisory activities under the eIDAS Regulation, and  conformity assessment bodies.  The objective of the document is to support TSPs intending to provide qualified trust services and  supervisory bodies in their respective tasks and duties during the preparation phase, the notification  phase, the initial verification of compliance with the eIDAS Regulation and the effective grant of the  qualified status through the publication of an updated national trusted list. The guidelines cover the  procedures and formats for initiating a qualified trust service.  The guidelines shall enable supervisory  bodies to clarify the rules, requirements and recommendations for a TSP to notify its intention to start  8 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services/guidelines/  9 See the above footnote.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services/guidelines/  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  10  providing qualified trust services. The guidelines for the notifying TSPs aim to facilitate the implementation  of the preparation of the provision of their qualified trust services and the notification phase of the  initiation process as foreseen by the eIDAS Regulation.  The present document is organised to provide information and guidance with regards to:   The provision of recommendations and guidelines to Supervisory Bodies and to Trust Service Providers  (section 2).   The eIDAS Regulation provisions related to the initiation of Qualified Trust Services (section 3).   The initiation and supervision activities, process flow as well as the accreditation of CABs in accordance  with the eIDAS Regulation (section 4).   The format and procedure for notification under Art.21.1 of the eIDAS Regulation (section 5).   The initial verification of the notified QTSP/QTS with the eIDAS requirements & communication of the  granted qualified status for inclusion in the national TL (section 6).   The Supervisory Body resources and organisational measures (section 7).  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  11  2. Guidelines on the Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  Introduction  The eIDAS Regulation sets the principle of non-discrimination of the legal effects and admissibility of  electronic signatures, electronic seals, electronic time stamps, electronic registered delivery services and  electronic documents as evidence in legal proceedings. Courts (or other bodies in charge of legal  proceedings) cannot discard them as evidence only because they are electronic but have to assess these  electronic tools in the same way they would do for their paper equivalent.  To further enhance in particular the trust of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and consumers in  the internal market and to promote the use of trust services and products, the eIDAS Regulation  introduces the notions of qualified trust service and qualified trust service provider with a view to  indicating requirements and obligations that ensure high-level security and a higher presumption of their  legal effect.  In order to ensure high-level security of qualified trust services, the eIDAS Regulation foresees an active  supervision scheme of qualified trust service providers (QTSP) and the qualified trust services (QTS) they  provide (hereafter referred to as a QTSP/QTS) by the national competent supervisory body (SB) that  supervises, ex ante and ex post, fulfilment of the QTSP/QTS requirements and obligations.  Before a TSP/TS is granted a qualified status (QTSP/QTS), it will be subject to a pre-authorisation process –  the so called initiation process. QTSPs may only begin to provide the qualified trust service after the  qualified status has been granted by the national supervisory body and indicated in the national trusted  list². From there, the supervision scheme covers the full life cycle of each QTS and each QTSP, from its  genesis until its termination.  Initiation of qualified trust services  In practice, the initiation process through which a TSP, without qualified status, that intends to start  providing qualified trust services, is granted a qualified status is made of the following steps (see section 4  for a detailed analysis):  1. Preparation: The TSP designs, sets up, implements, tests and deploys in pre-production the QTS it  intends to provide, in line with the eIDAS requirements. In parallel, the TSP establishes the relevant  documentation that will demonstrate its compliance with the eIDAS requirements. An “eIDAS”  accredited conformity assessment body (CAB)10 assesses the conformity of the TSP and the QTS it  intends to provide with the eIDAS requirements. The conformity assessment report (CAR) must prove  the compliance of the TSP and the QTS it intends to provide with the eIDAS requirements and not with  standards. Standards might nevertheless be a tool used by TSPs to support the demonstration of their  compliance with eIDAS.  2. Notification: The TSP notifies the SB its intention to become qualified together with the conformity  assessment report (CAR) issued by the “eIDAS” accredited CAB.  10 That assessment must be conducted by a CAB specifically accredited by a national accreditation body (NAB) under  Regulation (EC) 765/2008 to carry out assessments of QTSP/QTS against the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation  (Art.3.18).  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  12  3. Initial verification of compliance: The SB verifies whether or not the TSP and the QTS it intends to  provide meet the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation in order to be granted a qualified status. Final  decision is in the hands of the SB. The latter may rely upon the information provided as part of the  notification procedure, including the conformity assessment report, but is equally entitled to request  further information and may take a duly justified decision that goes against the conformity assessment  report. In that case, as for all its decisions, the SB should respect, in particular, the principles of good  administration, including the obligation to give reasons for its decisions, as well as the principle of  proportionality. Upon positive verification by the SB that the TSP and the QTS it intends to provide  meet the eIDAS requirements, the SB grants the qualified status to the TSP/TS and informs the body in  charge of the national trusted list for the purpose of updating this list.  4. Publication of the qualified status in the national trusted list: Upon notification by the SB that the  notifying TSP/TS has been granted a qualified status, the body in charge of the national trusted list  updates the list accordingly.  It is only when its qualified status is published in the corresponding national trusted list that the QTSP is  authorised to provide the corresponding QTS11.  The following sections proposes guidelines12 to SBs, TSPs, and CABs on initiation of qualified trust services  pursuant to Art.21.1 of the eIDAS Regulation.  11 The eIDAS Regulation foresees transitional measures (Art.51) that ensures certification-service-provider issuing  qualified certificates to natural persons under Directive 1999/93/EC to be considered as QTSPs issuing certificates for  electronic signatures under the Regulation until they submit a conformity assessment report and the completion of  its assessment by the supervisory body. The submission of that report shall not occur later the 1 July 2017 otherwise  the CSP shall not be considered as a QTSP from 2 July 2017.  12 The use of specific verbs (SHALL, SHOULD and MAY) are used in accordance with the ETSI-guide,  https://portal.etsi.org/Portals/0/TBpages/edithelp/Docs/AGuideToWritingWorldClassStandards.pdf  https://portal.etsi.org/Portals/0/TBpages/edithelp/Docs/AGuideToWritingWorldClassStandards.pdf  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  13  Recommendations for Supervisory Bodies  The following are recommendations for supervisory bodies in the context of the initiation of QTS:  SB.1 – Supervisory body resources  (a) Make sure to be given the necessary powers and adequate resources for the exercise of its tasks.  (b) Make sure to establish, document and maintain the necessary policies, processes and procedures  for the realisation of the supervisory activities foreseen in the eIDAS Regulation, including those  related to the management of the national trusted lists.  (c) To this extent, follow recommendations provided in section 6 of this document.  SB.2 – Preliminary interactions with prospective QTSPs  (a) In order to allow an efficient initiation process, as stressed by Recital (45) of the eIDAS Regulation,  preliminary interactions between prospective QTSPs and the national SB body are encouraged  with a view to facilitating the due diligence leading to the provisioning of QTSs.  (b) Besides CID (EU) 2015/1505 requirement13 on the publication of specific information on the  underlying supervision scheme, SBs should publicize information about the initiation process and  in particular the notification format and procedure, as well as information on the subsequent  supervision process.  SB.3 – Format and procedure for notification under Art.21.1 of the eIDAS Regulation  (a) Make sure that the specifications and requirements on the format and procedure for notification  under Art.21.1 of the eIDAS Regulation are properly communicated to the candidate TSPs and  made available to the public.  (b) Follow recommendations provided in section 4 of this document on format and procedure for  notification.  SB.4 – Confidentiality between SB and notifying (Q)TSP  (a) Unless already available in the public domain, the SB should limit disclosure of  information/documentation provided by notifying (Q)TSP within its own organisation, to its  directors, officers, members and/or employees having a need to know. Unless otherwise foreseen  by European or national laws, and in particular the eIDAS Regulation, the SB shall not disclose such  information/documentation to any third party.  SB.5 – “eIDAS” accreditation scheme for CABs  (a) Interactions are encouraged between the SB and the local national accreditation body (NAB), and  where applicable the foreign NAB having accredited CAB selected by the TSP notifying its intention  to provide QTS or candidate for such a notification, with a view to facilitating the verification of  correct accreditation of the CAB selected by the notifying TSP to carry its assessment and the  assessment of the notified QTS against the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.  13 See Annex I, Chapter II, Scheme information URI (clause 5.3.7) of Commission Implementing Decision (EU)  2015/1505 of 8 September 2015 laying down technical specifications and formats relating to trusted lists pursuant to  Article 22(5) of the eIDAS Regulation.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  14  (b) Make sure that information about the accredited CABs and the underlying eIDAS accreditation  scheme is available from the NAB website and communicated/notified to the EC (or the body  designated to centralise such information if any).  (c) Make sure to consider as eligible and equivalent all CABs accredited by any NAB signatory of the  European co-operation for Accreditation (EA) Multilateral Agreement (MLA) and all CARs delivered  by them provided they are accredited in accordance with the eIDAS Regulation (Art.3.18, Art.20.1).  Consider any CAB or CAR as non-eligible when this is not the case. See section 3.4 of this document  for further guidance.  SB.6 – QTSP/QTS audit criteria & the structure of the initiation CAR  (a) Both for conducting Art.21 initial verification and for verifying the eligibility of CABs and CARs  notified under Art.21.1, make sure that QTSP/QTS are assessed for compliance against each and  every applicable requirement of the eIDAS Regulation.  (b) Make sure and verify that the CAR explicitly confirms and bears sufficient information  demonstrating that the assessed QTSP/QTS fulfil the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.  (c) Follow recommendations of section 4.5 of this document with regards to the recommended  structure and content of CARs.  SB.7 – Initial verification of the notified QTSP/QTS with the eIDAS requirements  (a) Make sure that the notifying TSP fulfils the requirements on the format and procedure for  notification under Art.21.1 of the eIDAS Regulation and that the QTSP/QTS are assessed for  compliance against each and every applicable requirement of the eIDAS Regulation.  (b) Follow recommendations provided in section 6 of this document when conducting initial  verification.  SB.8 – Communication of the granted qualified status and inclusion in the national trusted list  (a) The SB and the TLSO shall conform to CID 2015/1505/EU. See section 2.4 of this document for  guidance on the granularity of the qualified status assignment.  (b) In particular, the SB and the TLSO shall respect the timing constraints clarified by this CID  (enforcing clause 5.5.5 of ETSI TS 119 612 v2.1.1) making sure that the date, indicated in the  corresponding national trusted list, of the grant of the qualified status, the date of signing of the  trusted list and the effective date of publication of that trusted list are all aligned to the same date  and that no back dating is allowed.  SB.9 – Cooperation with other EU MS SBs  (a) It is recommended that SBs cooperate to the specification of one (or a limited set) of eIDAS  compliant conformity assessment scheme(s) once a sufficient maturity has been reached in the  effective implementation and use of those schemes by accredited CABs to assess QTSP/QTS and by  NABs to accredit CABs in accordance with eIDAS Regulation.  The standardisation of such  scheme(s) would later open the doors to a potential referencing in eIDAS implementing acts  foreseen in Art.20.4.  (b) It is recommended to SBs to cooperate under Art.18 of the eIDAS Regulation to set-up a single and  centralised dissemination point providing to the public, information, and any change thereto,  about each of the EA MLA signatory NABs, whether they operate an accreditation scheme in  accordance with the eIDAS Regulation, details regarding such an accreditation scheme, accredited  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  15  CABs and for which QTPS/QTS, accredited CABs conformity assessment activities (e.g. certification  certificates), etc.  (c) Cooperation under Art.18 with other EU MS SBs is strongly recommended when notifying TSP  activities and operations related to the provision of notified QTS are spread across national  borders. See companion document “guidelines for supervision of qualified trust service providers”  for further guidelines on such cooperation.  SB.10 – Good administration principles  (a) With regards to their activities, SBs should respect, in particular, the principles of good  administration, including the obligation to give reasons for its decisions, as well as the principle of  proportionality.  Recommendations for Trust Service Providers  The following are recommendations for trust service providers in the context of the initiation of QTS:  TSP.1 – Preparation to the provision of QTS as a QTSP  (a) Where TSPs, without qualified status, intend to start providing QTSs, they should design and test  the organisational, physical and technical implementation of those trust services, as well as their  corresponding practices, policies, procedures, processes and documentation in line with the  requirements laid down in the eIDAS Regulation.  (b) For that purpose, TSPs should first consider the publication by the competent SB of the  specifications and requirements on the format and procedure for notification under Art.21.1 of the  eIDAS Regulation. In particular, they should organise their preparation for compliance with the  requirements laid down in the eIDAS Regulation in line with the specifications and  recommendations or requirements from the competent SB on the content and structure of the  CAR they need to obtain from an eIDAS accredited CAB. See section 3.5 of this document for  further details on the recommended structure of an eIDAS CAR.  (c) TSPs can select any CAB accredited in any EU MS provided the CAB has been accredited in  accordance with Art.3.18 of the eIDAS Regulation (see section 0 of this document for further  guidance). Before contracting any such CAB, TSPs should however make sure that the candidate  CAB and the CAR it will issue in case of positive assessment will meet the expectations or  requirements of the eIDAS Regulation and of the competent SB. In particular they shall make sure  that the CAR shall confirm the compliance of the assessed QTSP/QTS with the requirements of the  eIDAS Regulation (e.g. and not with whatever standard; the CAR may however confirm compliance  to any set of standards in addition to confirming that the eIDAS requirements are fulfilled but the  main purpose of CAR submitted to the SB under Art.21.1 of the eIDAS Regulation shall be to  confirm that the assessed QTSP/QTS fulfil the requirements laid down in the eIDAS Regulation).  (d) Appropriate preliminary interactions with the national SB is recommended.  (e) Standards and normative documents may be of great help to ensure best practices are followed  and to maximise interoperability of the implemented services. Specific standards having been  designed aiming to enable compliant implementation meeting the eIDAS Regulation requirements.  ETSI TR 119 00014 is the overview document to obtain information on which CEN or ETSI standards  14 ETSI TR 119 000: “Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI); The framework for standardization of signatures:  overview”.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  16  that may be considered when implementing a specific type of (qualified) trust service. It should be  made clear nevertheless that it is not mandatory and it cannot be made mandatory to comply with  any standard. No standard, at the date of publication of this document has yet been formally  assessed as meeting QTSP/QTS requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. Furthermore ENISA  published an analysis of standards related to TSPs, mapping the eIDAS requirements to existing  standards15. It concluded that the analysed standards usually cover some requirements in part or  whole but also led, however, to a shortlist of gaps where specific eIDAS requirements have yet to  be addressed in EU standards (ETSI/CEN/CENELEC) or international ones.  (f) When notifying TSPs intend to provide QTS so that it meets requirements from another application  domain, provided they are not in contradiction with the eIDAS requirements, they may be required  to comply with specific standards or normative requirements. For example, QTSP providing  services consisting in the issuance of qualified certificates for website authentication (QWACs) may  be required to meet specific standards to meet the CA/Browser Forum requirements and  requirements from Browsers or widely deployed applications owners16. (Q)TSPs willing to benefit  from recognition in both eIDAS and non-eIDAS worlds (e.g. CA/Browser Forum) should ensure that  the conformity assessments they pass to demonstrate compliance with the eIDAS requirements  can be of benefit in the demonstration of their compliance with those non-eIDAS requirements  and that those requirements and their implementation by the (Q)TSP are not in contradiction with  the eIDAS Regulation.  (g) In addition to any applicable national language, all relevant (Q)TSP/(Q)TS documentation should be  made available in UK English in order to facilitate cross-border provision of services.  TSP.2 – Notification of the intention to provide QTS as a QTSP  (a) Where TSPs, without qualified status, intend to start providing QTSs, they need to submit to the SB  a notification of their intention together with a CAR issued by a CAB.  (b) For that purpose, they have to meet the specifications and recommendations or requirements  from the competent SB on the content and structure of the CAR they need to obtain from an  accredited CAB.  (c) See section 4 of this document for guidance on format and procedure for notification.  TSP.3 – Understanding the granularity of the identification of a trust service to which a qualified  status is granted  (a) TSPs and QTSPs should understand the granularity of the identification of a trust service to which a  qualified status is granted, as discussed in section 3.4 of this document, to identify when they are  required to notify the initiation of a new QTS and when they actually need to notify any change to  an existing QTS or that existing service being subject to routine supervision and 2-yearly audits.  TSP.4 – Preliminary interactions with competent SB  15 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/tsp_standards_2015/at_download/fullReport.  16 Users of compliant QTSPs will then benefit from the recognition by CA/Browser Forum member’s applications such  as Internet browser software that will then display enhanced indication of the corresponding certified website  identity by changing the appearance of its display (i.e. colours, icons, animation, and/or additional website  information) to reflect its trustworthiness.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/tsp_standards_2015/at_download/fullReport  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  17  (a) In order to allow an efficient initiation process, as stressed by Recital (45) of the eIDAS Regulation,  preliminary interactions between prospective QTSPs and the national SB are encouraged with a  view to facilitating the due diligence leading to the provisioning of QTSs.  Recommendations for Conformity Assessment Bodies  The following are recommendations for CABs in the context of the assessment of (Q)TSP/(Q)TS:  CAB.1 – eIDAS accreditation requirements for CABs assessing a QTSP/QTS  Make sure to be properly accredited in accordance with the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. In  particular:   Art.3.18 of the eIDAS Regulation requires CABs to be accredited in accordance with Regulation (EC) No  765/2008 in a way that such accreditation ensures the accredited CABs are competent to carry out  conformity assessment of a QTSP/QTS against the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.   The resulting conformity assessment report to be submitted to the supervisory body by the assessed  (Q)TSP, whether in the context of a 2-yearly regular audit (Art.20.1), an ad hoc audit (Art.20.2) or an  initiation audit (Art.21.1) must be such that it confirms, when this is the case, that the assessed  (Q)TSP/(Q)TS fulfil all the applicable QTSP/QTS requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.   The conformity assessment scheme (including requirements on the CAB, requirements on the auditing  rules under which the CAB will carry out their conformity assessment and the effective set of criteria,  control objectives and controls against which it will assess a QTSP/QTS with the aim of confirming that  it fulfils the eIDAS requirements) may be defined by the CAB itself, the EU MS supervisory body, or any  other body possessing the necessary technical competence.  CAB.2 – Structure of eIDAS CAR  Follow recommendations provided in section 4.5 of this document.  CAB.3 – Preliminary interactions with national SBs  In order to facilitate evaluation of CARs notified under the eIDAS Regulation and the evaluation of  (Q)TSP/(Q)TS by the SB of the EU MS in which CABs are active, preliminary interactions between CABs and  those SBs are encouraged.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  18  3. eIDAS Regulation provisions related to the initiation of qualified trust  services  Supervisory bodies  Art. 17 of the eIDAS Regulation requires EU MS to designate a supervisory body established in their  territory (or, upon mutual agreement with another Member State, a supervisory body established in that  other Member State) to be responsible for supervisory tasks in their territory. Each EU MS is further  required to give such a body the necessary powers and adequate resources for the exercise of those  supervisory tasks (see Art.17.4 of the eIDAS Regulation).  QTSP/QTS initiation  The legal obligations related to the initiation of QTSPs/QTSs are mainly derived from Art.21 of the eIDAS  Regulation as listed here after:   Art.21.1. - Where trust service providers, without qualified status, intend to start providing qualified trust  services, they shall submit to the supervisory body a notification of their intention together with a conformity  assessment report issued by a conformity assessment body.   Art.21.2. - The supervisory body shall verify whether the trust service provider and the trust services provided  by it comply with the requirements laid down in this Regulation, and in particular, with the requirements for  qualified trust service providers and for the qualified trust services they provide.  If the supervisory body concludes that the trust service provider and the trust services provided by it comply  with the requirements referred to in the first subparagraph, the supervisory body shall grant qualified status  to the trust service provider and the trust services it provides and inform the body referred to in Article 22(3)  for the purposes of updating the trusted lists referred to in Article 22(1), not later than three months after  notification in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article.  If the verification is not concluded within three months of notification, the supervisory body shall inform the  trust service provider specifying the reasons for the delay and the period within which the verification is to be  concluded.   Art.21.3. - Qualified trust service providers may begin to provide the qualified trust service after the qualified  status has been indicated in the trusted lists referred to in Article 22(1).  Recital (45) of the eIDAS Regulation also states that “in order to allow an efficient initiation process, which  should lead to the inclusion of qualified trust service providers and the qualified trust services they provide  into trusted lists, preliminary interactions between prospective qualified trust service providers and the  competent supervisory body should be encouraged with a view to facilitating the due diligence leading to  the provisioning of qualified trust services”.  CABs and CARs  The conformity assessment body (CAB) and the conformity assessment report (CAR) referred to in Art.21.1  are further specified by or further specifications can be derived from the following:  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  19   Art.3.(18) defines a ‘conformity assessment body’ as a body defined in point 13 of Article 2 of  Regulation (EC) No 765/2008,17,18 which is accredited in accordance with that Regulation as  competent to carry out conformity assessment of a qualified trust service provider and the qualified  trust services it provides.   Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, Art.2.(13) defines:  o a ‘conformity assessment body’ as a body that performs conformity assessment activities  including calibration, testing, certification and inspection”,  o a ‘conformity assessment’ as the process demonstrating whether specified requirements  relating to a product, process, service, system, person or body have been fulfilled,  o ‘accreditation’ as an attestation by a national accreditation body that a conformity  assessment body meets the requirements set by harmonised standards and, where  applicable, any additional requirements including those set out in relevant sectoral  schemes, to carry out a specific conformity assessment activity;  o a ‘national accreditation body’ as the sole body in a Member State that performs  accreditation with authority derived from the State.   Art.20.1 of the eIDAS Regulation requires that the purpose of the audit shall be to confirm that the  qualified trust service providers and the qualified trust services provided by them fulfil the  requirements laid down in this Regulation. Consequently, the resulting conformity assessment  report needs to include a formal conformity statement confirming, when applicable, that the  audited QTSP/QTS meets all the applicable requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.  The Commission did not adopt any implementing act with regards to the supervision of qualified trust  services providers (Art.20.4) or the initiation of qualified trust services (Art.21.4).  Neither the business nor the technical model can be imposed upon the QTSPs nor a specific standard to be  followed for the QTS it provides. (Q)TSP/(Q)TS have to demonstrate their compliance (building upon  standards if it deems it appropriate) with the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation while the supervisory  body cannot refuse to grant the qualified status solely on the grounds that the proposed model does not  comply with a given standard or a given business/technical model. QTSP/QTS are free to define the way to  proceed to the implementation of the eIDAS applicable requirements, whether operationally,  organisationally or technically.  Granularity of qualified status assignment  The present section discusses the granularity of the assignment of a qualified status to a QTSP/QTS, both in  the context of the related information appearing in the national trusted list and its impacts on the need to  process to the Art.21.1 initiation or to the Art.24.2.(a) notification of change in case of any change in the  provision of a QTS.  A TSP cannot be deemed to be of a qualified level without providing at least one qualified trust service  (Art.3.20 of the eIDAS Regulation). The qualified status is granted both to a TSP and to the trust service it  provides when it has been included in the corresponding national trusted list after it has been verified by  the competent supervisory body (SB) that both the TSP and the trust services provided by it (TSP/TS) comply  with the requirements laid down in this Regulation, and in particular, with the requirements for qualified  17 Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the  requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products and repealing  Regulation (EEC) No 339/93 (Text with EEA relevance). OJ L 218, 13.8.2008, p. 30–47.  18 See Annex A.5 for what Regulation (EC) 765/2008 brings as advantages to SBs and to TSPs.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32008R0765  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  20  trust service providers and for the qualified trust services they provide (for QTSP/QTS). A TSP is granted a  qualified status separately for each type of qualified trust service covered by the eIDAS Regulation. The  granularity in terms of what QTS may exist in the sense of this Regulation is limited to that closed list of QTS  for which there are applicable requirements in the Regulation (see Annex A.7).  Example: A TSP that is granted a qualified status for the provision of a service providing qualified  certificates for electronic signatures is not to be considered as qualified for the provision of any other  qualified trust service, including the provision of qualified certificates for electronic seals or for website  authentication, the provision of qualified electronic time stamps, etc., unless it has been granted a  qualified status for such other QTS.  The granularity of the identification in the national trusted lists of the technical instance of the eIDAS  qualified trust service to which the qualified status is granted is actually clarified by Commission  Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/150519. It corresponds to the level of the “Service digital identity” field as  specified in ETSI TS 119 612 v2.1.1 on which the CID relies to establish the content and define the technical  specifications and formats for the national trusted lists. In a trusted list, a qualified trust service to which a  qualified status is granted is identified by the public key20 identified by the “Service digital identity” field of  the corresponding trusted list service entry of a listed TSP entry. The type of qualified trust service for which  the qualified status is granted is identified by the combination of the “Service type identifier” field and the  “additional Service Information” service information extension when present and further specifying the type  of service21.  When based on public key infrastructure (PKI) public key-technology, the public key referring to the “Service  digital identity” field can be associated:   either with the technical unit that is directly issuing, under the name of the listed TSP, the qualified  trust service output (e.g. a qualified certificate for electronic signature, a qualified time stamp, a  qualified electronic delivery evidence, a qualified validation result report on the qualified validation  of a qualified electronic seal, etc.),   or with a technical unit that is issuing digital certificates to one or more technical units that in turn  are directly issuing the qualified trust service output under the name of the listed TSP or from which  a certification path can be established “down to” one or more technical units that are issuing the  qualified trust service output under the name of the listed TSP.  On one hand, to the level of information provided in the trusted list, it is the public key referring to the value  of the “Service digital identity” field that will delimit the boundaries of the so-identified trust service to which  the qualified status is indicated as “granted”22 in the corresponding “Service current status” field (or “Service  previous status” as part of the service status history), irrespective of the fact that a “commercial” qualified  19 Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1505 of 8 September 2015 laying down technical specifications and  formats relating to trusted lists pursuant to Article 22(5) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament  and of the Council on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market  (Text with EEA relevance). OJ L 235, 9.9.2015, p. 26–36.  20 When based on PKI public-key technology (when not based on such technology, an indicator expressed as a URI is  used to identify uniquely and unambiguously the listed service).  21 See clauses 5.5.1 and 5.5.9.4 of ETSI TS 119 612 v2.1.1 on which CID (EU) 2015/1505 relies to lay down technical  specifications and formats relating to national trusted lists.  22 The corresponding identifier expressed as a URI to indicate such grant of a qualified status is  http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/TrustedList/Svcstatus/granted.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015D1505 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015D1505 http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/TrustedList/Svcstatus/granted  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  21  trust service provided by a QTSP may make use of several technical units directly issuing the corresponding  qualified trust service outputs23.  On the other hand, the initiation process foreseen by Art.21 of the eIDAS Regulation is required to be  undergone by a TSP not having already a qualified status for the provision of a specific type of QTS. In that  case it must submit to the supervisory body a notification of its intention together with a conformity  assessment report issued by a conformity assessment body. That eIDAS article is however not applicable to  TSPs being granted a qualified status for the same type of qualified trust service. In case of any change in  the provision of its qualified trust services (incl. affecting existing listed technical units to which the grant of  the qualified status is indicated, or when adding or removing technical units as part of the technical  implementation of the qualified trust service), Art.24.2.(a) applies to the QTSP, which is required to notify  the supervisory body of any change in the provision of its qualified trust services. It will then be up to the  supervisory body to assess the impact of the notified changes on the need to undertake ad hoc audits or to  request a conformity assessment body to perform a conformity assessment of the QTSP, at the expense of  the QTSP, to confirm that the QTSP/QTS fulfils the requirements laid down in this Regulation (Art.17,  Art.20.2). In line with Art.20.3, it is possible for the supervisory body to withdraw the qualified status of the  concerned qualified trust services, in practice to the level of granularity of the identification in the national  trusted lists of the technical instance of the concerned qualified trust service to which the qualified status is  granted.  The above must however be nuanced with regards to the CSPs issuing qualified certificates to natural  persons and migrated as QTSP issuing qualified certificates for electronic signatures under Art.51.3 of the  eIDAS Regulation. For those QTSPs, any change that \"significantly\" deviates from the provision of the  corresponding services as they implemented them before the 1st of July 2016, requires them to go through  the Art.21.1 initiation process as, in that case, they would break the conditions of applicability of the  transitional measures. E.g. a former CSP issuing qualified certificates to natural persons under Directive  1999/93/EC, creating a new issuing CA and/or root CA (compared to the existing listed qualified trust service  corresponding entries in the national trusted list) under different practices24 resulting from significant  changes compared to the one they implemented under the Directive (e.g. in order to be able to meet the  eIDAS requirements), should go through Art.21.1 initiation process before being granted a qualified status  for that new issuing CA/root CA. And if this concerns a qualified trust service already listed, it should be for  that service as well that the CSP/QTSP must go through the Art.21.1 initiation process. However, such a  former CSP only modifying the profile of its end-entity qualified certificates issued to natural persons (i.e.  for electronic signatures) in order to meet requirements of Annex I of the eIDAS Regulation, without  changing significantly anything else with regards to the provision of their services benefiting from the Art.51  measures should not need to go through Art.21.1 initiation process.  Of course, as said, in all cases of application of Art.24.2.(a), a \"classification\" of changes should in practice  be considered, i.e. assessing how \"significant\" is the change and the impact it may have on the provision of  the services to justify an ad hoc audit by the SB or by a CAB at the request of the SB under Art.20.2, the scope  of such an audit.  Art.24.2.(a) of the eIDAS Regulation does not prevent notified changes to be already implemented before  being notified by the QTSP to the supervisory body (on the contrary to the termination where the intention  23 The pros and cons of listing either one or other option are discussed in ETSI TS 119 612 v2.1.1 for trust services  involved in the issuance of digital certificates, i.e. either listing a Root CA or an issuing CA.  24 With those \"practices\" to be understood as including all component services they may use and use differently,  including service factory, devices, registration authorities, certificate validity status information services, etc.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  22  to cease activities is required to be notified, hence, before cessation). Nevertheless, it is recommended to  the QTSP to notify them before implementation so that the supervisory body could be able to approve (or  make comments / indicate possible eIDAS non-conformities on) some significant changes before they are  implemented.  Examples:  (i) When a TSP has been granted a qualified status, hence recognised as a QTSP, for the provision of  qualified certificates for electronic signatures through a qualified trust service identified in the  national trusted list by an issuing technical CA with public key X, whenever that TSP is willing to  generate and operate a new technical issuing CA with public key Y, that TSP needs to notify the  supervisory body of that change under Art.24.2.(a) for its inclusion in the trusted lists as a new entry  as part of the entries related to the qualified trust service25.  (ii) When that same QTSP later decides to implement changes in the provision of the qualified trust  service affecting the issuing technical CA with public key X in a way that requires the supervisory  body to withdraw the qualified status, this can be done at the level of the trusted list entry  corresponding to the issuing technical CA with public key X. When the technical issuing CA with  public key Y would be assessed by the supervisory body as not being impacted in that way, the SB  may decide to keep the qualified status for that service as being granted.  (iii) A TSP is granted a qualified status for the provision of qualified certificates for electronic signatures  through a qualified trust service identified in the national trusted list by a technical root CA with  public key X, under which e.g. a large number of technical issuing CA are used to issue end-entity  certificates:  (a) Whenever that TSP modifies the sub-ordinate and issuing CA topology under the listed root  CA, it needs to notify the supervisory body of such changes.  (b) When adding or discarding technical CAs under the listed root CA, the QTSP needs to notify  the supervisory body of such changes under Art.24.2.(a).  (iv) When a QTSP provides qualified certificates for electronic signatures through a qualified trust service  identified in the national trusted list by an issuing technical CA with public key X, intends to use that  same issuing technical CA with public key X to issue qualified certificates for electronic seals and/or  for website authentication certificates, it must go through Art.21.1 initiation process when not  already given a qualified status for the provision of such other type(s) of qualified certificates or  when that would significantly change the provision of such other type(s) of qualified certificates for  which it has already been given a qualified status. Otherwise that change needs to be notified to the  supervisory body under Art.24.2.(a) for updating the national trusted list when assessment by the  supervisory body would lead to such an update.  (v) When a TSP has been granted a qualified status, hence recognised as a QTSP, for the provision of  qualified time stamps through a qualified trust service identified in the national trusted list by a  technical CA issuing certificates to technical time stamping units (TSUs) that in turn will each issue  qualified time stamps, then whenever that TSP will decide to create a new TSU certified by that listed  CA, it will not need to go through Art.21.1 notification for being granted a qualified status for that  service but will need to notify the competent supervisory body of that change regarding the listed  qualified service as any change in the provision of its qualified service required to be notified as per  Art.24.2.(a) of the eIDAS Regulation.  25 Provisions of clause 5.5.5 of ETSI TS 119 612 v2.1.1 pursuant to CID (EU) 2015/1505 apply with regards to the  allocation of the date to which such a change applies.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  23  See also annex A.4 of this document for guidance on the use of “Service digital identity” field in trusted list  with regards to qualified trust services.  Standards and best practices  As previously stated, neither the business nor the technical model can be imposed on QTSPs nor a specific  standard to be followed for the QTS it provides. The ultimate goal of the conformity assessment report  resulting from the assessment of a QTSP/QTS by a CAB accredited under Regulation (EC) 765/2008 is to  confirm that the QTSP/QTS fulfils the requirements laid down in the eIDAS Regulation (Art.20.1) not that it  complies with a specific standard.  Furthermore, no standard is referenced so far by any eIDAS secondary legislation for the presumption of  compliance with all or parts of the eIDAS requirements applicable to QTSPs and the QTSs they provide.  However, standards developed or still under development by European standardisation organisations  (ESOs) or other international standardisation organisations can be used to support:   CABs, national accreditation bodies (NABs), and SBs in the establishment of the effective eIDAS  QTSP/QTS criteria, the related control objectives, and the controls that will be used for assessing  QTSP/QTS against the eIDAS Regulation;   TSPs when designing, implementing and establishing their demonstration that they and the QTS  they provide or intend to provide meet the applicable requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.  A formal assessment of a candidate standard of its compliance with the requirements set in the Regulation  would in any case be required before its referencing to support the assessment of QTSP/QTS, ideally by the  EC in the context of adopting related implementing acts pursuant to requirements of the eIDAS Regulation,  or when this is not possible, by competent SBs, NABs, or CABs to build conformity assessment schemes  aiming to assess conformity of QTSP/QTS with the eIDAS Regulation requirements.  Nevertheless, standards and normative documents may be of great help to ensure best practices are  followed and to maximise interoperability of the implemented services. A supervisory body may establish  an eIDAS conformity assessment scheme on the basis of referenced technical specifications or standards,  with or without amendments after assessment of their compliance with the requirements set in the  Regulation, so that once the criteria are met by the corresponding QTSP/QTS they may benefit from a  presumption of compliance with the applicable eIDAS requirements with regards to the supervisory body  decision pursuant to Art.21.2 of the eIDAS Regulation.  Specific standards have been designed by CEN and ETSI aiming to enable compliant implementations that  meet the eIDAS Regulation requirements. ETSI TR 119 00026 is the overview document to obtain  information on which CEN or ETSI standards may be considered when implementing a specific type of  (qualified) trust service. While those ETSI and CEN standards are not and cannot be mandatory for a  QTSP/QTS to be followed, they have been developed as a means of best practice for a (Q)TSP to cover the  eIDAS requirements. Moreover ENISA published an analysis of standards related to TSPs, mapping the  eIDAS requirements to existing standards27. It concluded that the analysed standards usually cover some  26 ETSI TR 119 000: “Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI); The framework for standardization of signatures:  overview”.  27 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/tsp_standards_2015/at_download/fullReport  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/tsp_standards_2015/at_download/fullReport  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  24  requirements in part or whole but it also led, however, to a shortlist of gaps, where specific eIDAS  requirements have yet to be addressed in EU standards (ETSI/CEN/CENELEC) or international ones.  The eIDAS Regulation does not mandate compliance with any specific standard, and such compliance  cannot be mandatory. However, it may be appropriate or even required for the notifying TSP intending to  provide QTS to ensure that it complies with specific standards in order to satisfy requirements in another  application domain, provided they are not in contradiction with the eIDAS requirements for QTSP/QTS. For  example, QTSP providing services for the issuance of qualified certificates for website authentication  (QWACs) may be required to meet specific standards to satisfy the CA/Browser Forum28 requirements and  requirements from Browsers or widely deployed applications owners for inclusion in their trusted  certificate root stores. Users of compliant QTSPs will then benefit from the recognition by CA/Browser  Forum members’ applications such as Internet browser software that will then display enhanced indication  of the corresponding certified website identity by changing their appearance (i.e. colours, icons, animation,  and/or additional website information) to reflect its trustworthiness. Those (Q)TSPs willing to benefit from  recognition in both eIDAS and non-eIDAS worlds (e.g. CA/Browser Forum) should ensure that the  conformity assessments they pass to demonstrate compliance with the eIDAS requirements can be of  benefit in the demonstration of their compliance with those non-eIDAS requirements. In the specific  context of QWACs, ETSI EN 319 411 series has been designed to allow for such convergence of the eIDAS  and CA/Browser Forum conformity assessments.  28 The CA/Browser Forum is a voluntary group of certification authorities (CAs), vendors of Internet browser software,  and suppliers of other applications that use X.509 v.3 digital certificates for SSL/TLS and code signing and has  established guidelines to provide greater assurance to Internet users about the web sites they visit by leveraging the  capabilities of SSL/TLS certificates.

Initiation and supervision of QTSPs/QTSs  Initiation and supervision as corner stones of the eIDAS pyramid of trust  The ex-ante and ex-post model for the supervision of qualified trust service providers (QTSPs) and of the  qualified trust services (QTSs) they provide is the foundation of the whole legal and trust model for such  services as defined by the eIDAS Regulation. The eIDAS Regulation is actually setting up a complete  pyramid of trust, which is illustrated in Figure 3.  The most visible part is the “EU trust mark for qualified trust services”, which each qualified trust service  provider may, on a voluntary basis, use to brand and promote the quality and trustworthiness of the  qualified trust services it provides.  Figure 2 eIDAS Regulation building trust in the online environment (Source IAS² - updated)  This EU trust mark is not just another quality logo without any trust foundation (despite the fact that it’s  not verifiable in an automated way). As illustrated in Figure 2 above, the eIDAS Regulation explicitly sets up  a consistent set of quality/security requirements and obligations for QTSPs/QTSs. Those requirements and  obligations aim to enhance the trust of consumers and enterprises, in particular SMEs, in the internal  (electronic) market and to promote the use of such QTSs and related products.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  26  Through ex-ante and ex-post supervisory activities the eIDAS Regulation builds a supervisory regime upon  those quality/security requirements and obligations for QTSs and QTSPs. It aims to ensure that, from  genesis up to termination of such services, the QTSPs and the QTSs they provide indeed meet the  requirements laid down in the Regulation.  This supervisory regime for QTSs and QTSPs is executed by each EU Member State (MS), by a national  supervisory body, and follows common requirements to ensure a comparable security level of QTSs in all  EU Member States (MS).  The supervisory regime covers the entire life-cycle of the QTSP and their QTSs:   It relies on a pre-authorisation mechanism obliging trust service providers intending to provide  QTSs to notify its nationally designated supervisory body of their intention together with a CAR  issued by an accredited CAB confirming that the QTSP and the QTSs it intends to provide meet the  requirements laid down in the Regulation.   It obliges, once granted a qualified status, QTSPs to submit to the designated supervisory body, for  each of their QTSs, a two-yearly conformity assessment report (CAR) issued by an accredited CAB  confirming that the QTSP and the particular QTS it provides fulfil the requirements laid down in the  Regulation.   It allows designated supervisory bodies, at their own discretion and at any time, to audit a  QTSP/QTS or to request an accredited CAB to carry out a conformity assessment of a QTSP/QTS  and to produce a CAR confirming that it fulfils the requirements laid down in the Regulation.   It foresees rules to be followed by QTSP and supervisory activities to be performed in cases where  the QTSP changes or terminates the provisioning of a QTS, or ceases its activities.  The decisions to grant or withdraw a qualified status to trust services and trust service providers, resulting  from the above supervisory activities, are taken by the designated national supervisory bodies.  Those status decisions are published on electronically signed or sealed national trusted lists. Such national  trusted lists are established, maintained and published to disseminate in a trustworthy manner  information related to the qualified trust service providers for which an EU MS is responsible, together  with information related to the qualified trust services provided by them, including the whole history of  the qualified status they have been granted.  The mandatory EU MS national trusted lists are published at least in a form suitable for automated  processing. In practice these are XML files. The “EU trust mark for qualified trust services”, despite the fact  that its use by QTSPs is voluntary, is aimed to be the consumer visible means to convey the same  information to the non-automated mass market. The eIDAS Regulation obliges QTSPs using such a trust  mark to provide, close to it, a link to the corresponding trusted list allowing for verification.  The pyramid of trust in (qualified) trust services established by the eIDAS Regulation further relies on and  is strengthened by the use of best practices and standards. In order to ensure uniform conditions for its  implementation, the Regulation confers implementing powers on the Commission, for specifying  implementation specifications or for referencing numbers of standards the use of which would raise a  presumption of compliance with certain requirements laid down in the eIDAS Regulation (Recital (71)).  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  27  QTSP/QTS initiation and supervision activities  The various steps foreseen in the eIDAS Regulation regarding the initiation of a QTSP and of the QTS it  provides and the related supervisory activities throughout the lifecycle of such services, from genesis until  termination, can be depicted in the Figure 3.  In a nutshell, the initiation step consists in the following phases:   The preparation.   The notification.   Initial compliance verification, including:  o The analysis of the notification (procedure and format).  o The analysis of the submitted conformity assessment report.  o Granting, in case of positive verification, a qualified status to the TSP and to the trust  service(s) they provide.   Publication of the qualified status in the national trusted list.  Once qualified status is granted, the life cycle management of the supervision by the competent  supervisory body to ensure that QTSPs/QTSs meet the requirements laid down in the Regulation can be  split into several phases of related supervisory activities, as they are driven by the following events, each of  which having the possibility to lead to a withdrawal of the qualified status:   Regular (2-yearly) audits.   Events monitored and detected by the SB.   Termination of one, more or all of the qualified trust services.   Other events notified by QTSPs:  o Changes in the provision of a QTS.  o Security breach.  o Personal data breach.  o Results of surveillance audits, when applicable.   Other notified events, e.g.:  o Complaints.  o Request for cooperation from other SBs.  The present document covers the different phases of the initiation step listed above (“preparation”,  “notification”, “initial compliance verification”, and “publication of the qualified status”). More specifically,  it covers the procedures and formats for becoming a qualified trust service provider and for initiating a  qualified trust service.  The companion deliverable of the present document (“Guidelines on Supervision of Qualified Trust  Services”29) aims to provide recommendations to facilitate the implementation of the provisions related to  qualified trust services of the eIDAS Regulation in the area of those phases related to the life cycle  management of their supervision once they have been granted a qualified status.  29 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services/guidelines/.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  28  Figure 3 Overview of the QTSP/QTS initiation and life cycle management of the related qualified status at the trust service level  and the related supervision activities. (Source IAS² - updated)  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  29  The initiation process flow  In order for a TSP/TS to be granted a qualified status, the TSP needs to go through the initiation process.  This process must be executed for each specific type of QTS (as they are specified in the eIDAS Regulation)  of which a TSP intends to start the provision, and for which the TSP has not already received a qualified  status (see Art.3.20 and Art.21.1).  The process has also to take into account the level of granularity addressed in the national trusted list to  correctly reflect the grant a qualified status to the TSP/TS when it passes the initiation process successfully  and is granted such a qualified status.  The initiation process flow can be split into the following steps of related bodies’ activities, as sketched in  Figure 3 and detailed in Figure 4:   The preparation: This step consists for the TSP intending to provide a qualified trust service.  o Design, set-up, implement, test and deploy the (qualified) trust service in pre-production in line  with the requirements laid down in the eIDAS Regulation. As the purpose of the initiation process  will be to demonstrate its compliance to the eIDAS requirements and not to any standard, the TSP  should build the provision of the QTS and document it in a way that facilitates the demonstration  of its conformity with the eIDAS requirements. To this extent, best practices and standards when  they are available may nevertheless be a tool used to facilitate such a demonstration.  o Setting-up the relevant documentation: As said, the documentation related to the provision of  the QTS should be established in a way to support and facilitate the demonstration of conformity  to the eIDAS requirement. As prior to the verification by the national SB of the conformity of the  notifying TSP/TS with the corresponding QTSP/QTS requirements of eIDAS, the TSP/TS will have to  pass an audit by an accredited CAB, TSP should structure their documentation against the eIDAS  requirements (see section 4.5 for further guidance). In a nutshell the documentation should  include:   The risk assessment related documentation aimed to support demonstration of the  requirement of Art.19.1.   A security & personal data breach notification plan aimed to support demonstration of the  requirement of Art.19.2.   The termination plan (Art.24.2.(i)).   Declaration of practices, policies, security concept, procedures and guidelines the TSP will  use to provide the QTS aimed to support demonstration of the other applicable eIDAS  requirements.  o Conformity assessment: That assessment must be conducted by a CAB specifically accredited by a  national accreditation body under Regulation (EC) 765/2008 to carry out assessments of QTSP/QTS  against the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation (Art.3.18).   The notification: The TSP submits to the national SB the ad hoc notification form (as prescribed by the  SB) together with the required documentation, when applicable and together with the conformity  assessment report. That latter must prove the compliance with the requirements of the Regulation.   The initial compliance verification: The SB verifies whether or not the TSP and the QTS it intends to  provide meet the requirements of the Regulation in order to be granted the qualified status. Final  decision is in the hands of the SB. The latter may rely upon the information provided as part of the  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  30  notification procedure, including the conformity assessment report, but is equally entitled to request  further information and may take a duly justified decision that goes against the conformity  assessment report. In that case, as for all its decisions, SB should respect, in particular, the principles  of good administration, including the obligation to give reasons for its decisions, as well as the  principle of proportionality. Upon positive verification by the SB that the TSP and the QTS it intends to  provide meet the eIDAS requirements, the SB grants the qualified status to the TSP/TS and informs  the body in charge of the national trusted list for the purpose of updating it.   The update of the trusted list: Upon notification by the SB that the notifying TSP/TS has been granted  a qualified status, the body in charge of the national trusted list updates the list accordingly.  Figure 4  QTSP/QTS initiation process flow in the context of the eIDAS Regulation  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  31  eIDAS compliant accreditation schemes for CABs  4.4.1 eIDAS requirements for CAB accreditation schemes and for CAR  CABs  As identified in section 2.3, Art.3.18 of the eIDAS Regulation requires CABs to be accredited in accordance  with Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 in a way that such accreditation ensures the accredited CABs are  competent to carry out conformity assessment of a QTSP/QTS against the requirements of the eIDAS  Regulation. Indeed, the conformity assessment is on QTSPs and QTSs which are eIDAS legal terms subject  to requirements stemming from the eIDAS Regulation. They cannot be understood in a different context.  CARs  The resulting conformity assessment report to be submitted to the supervisory body by the assessed  (Q)TSP, whether in the context of a 2-yearly regular audit (Art.20.1), an ad hoc audit (Art.20.2) or an  initiation audit (Art.21.1) must be such that it confirms, when this is the case, that the assessed QTSP/QTS  fulfil the requirements of all the applicable requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.  Provided the above requirements are met, it is a fact that it remains in the hands of MS to determine how  the accreditation is done. In other words, MS remain free to set up any accreditation scheme provided that  they can demonstrate that it fulfils Art.3.18 of the eIDAS Regulation.  Conformity assessment scheme  The conformity assessment scheme (including requirements on the CAB, requirements on the auditing  rules under which the CAB will carry out their conformity assessment and the effective set of criteria,  control objectives and controls against which it will assess a QTSP/QTS with the aim of confirming that it  fulfils the eIDAS requirements) may be defined by the CAB itself, the EU MS supervisory body, or any other  body possessing the necessary technical competence.30  NABs  The eIDAS Regulation requires, as part of the accreditation of the CAB, an evaluation by the competent  NAB of that assessment scheme and of the competence of the CAB employing such an assessment scheme  to carry out conformity assessment of a QTSP/QTS against eIDAS (Art.3.18). The competence of a CAB  cannot be confirmed by any other entity than the competent NAB.  The accreditation of CABs, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, is the exclusive competence of  NABs. CABs established in a EU MS are required to be accredited by the NAB of the EU MS in which they  are established unless that NAB does not have the possibility to do so, in which case the CAB can request  another NAB from another EU MS to conduct its accreditation.  Supervisory bodies  The “procedural” question regarding the eligibility of an eIDAS compliant CAR for its submission to a SB,  and hence its admissibility by the SB under Art.21.1, Art.20.1 ,or Art.20.2 is not whether the report is fine  to demonstrate that the assessed QTSP/QTS complies with the eIDAS requirements but whether it is  formally a conformity assessment report issued by a conformity assessment body which is accredited in  accordance with Regulation 765/2008 as competent to carry out conformity assessment of a qualified trust  30 The entity defining and owning a conformity assessment scheme is denoted as the scheme owner.  A conformity assessment scheme will be called a certification scheme when the CAB is a certification body.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  32  service provider and the qualified trust services it provides against the requirements of the eIDAS  Regulation.  The format and content of a CAR should nevertheless be such that it contains sufficient information to  demonstrate to the SB that each and every applicable requirement from the eIDAS Regulation for QTSPs  and QTSs are indeed fulfilled by the assessed QTSP/QTS.  An eIDAS conformity assessment scheme must be defined in such a way that neither the business nor the  technical model is imposed upon a QTSP/QTS nor a specific standard to be followed. A QTSP providing a  QTS is free to define the way it implements the applicable eIDAS requirements, whether operationally,  organisationally or technically. The (Q)TSP/(Q)TS has to demonstrate its compliance (building upon  standards if it deems it appropriate) with the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation while the supervisory  body cannot refuse to grant the qualified status solely on the grounds that the proposed model does not  comply with a given standard or a given business/technical model. Consequently, in the absence of formal  assessment of one or more technical standards and its/their referencing in an eIDAS implementing act for  the presumption of compliance with the eIDAS requirements, a conformity assessment scheme cannot be  compliant with the eIDAS requirements when the QTSP/QTS audit criteria against which the (Q)TSP/(Q)TS  is assessed is limited to a (set of) standard(s). An eIDAS compliant conformity assessment scheme should  hence be designed in such a way that those QTSP/QTS audit criteria are not defined in a “normative  approach” (i.e. on the basis of a required compliance with a specific standard or on the basis of a specific  technical way to proceed) but in an “outcome based approach” (i.e. ultimately the eIDAS requirements  applicable to QTSP/QTS which are expressed in a technology-neutral way and expressing the goal to be  reached). The definition of an “outcome based” conformity assessment scheme can build on standards or  parts of them when assessed.  4.4.2 The EA promoted accreditation scheme for CABs assessing TSP/TS  The European cooperation for Accreditation (EA), is the body recognised under Regulation (EC) No  765/2008 that manages a peer evaluation system among NABs from the EU Member States and other  European countries. That rigorous and transparent peer evaluation system ensures the equivalence of the  accreditation services delivered by NABs and thus the equivalence of the level of competence of CABs. This  mandatory peer evaluation system facilitates the mutual recognition and promotes the overall acceptance  of accreditation certificates and conformity assessment results issued by accredited bodies. National  authorities shall recognise the equivalence of the services delivered by those accreditation bodies (i.e. the  NABs) which have successfully undergone such peer evaluation, and thereby accept the accreditation  certificates of those bodies and the attestations issued by the CABs accredited by them.  The EA is also the recognised body, under Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, as competent to develop sectoral  or specific accreditation schemes. This may be done on request of the Commission but in the context of  the eIDAS Regulation this has not been the case.  Nevertheless, the EA has promoted31 the ETSI EN 319 40332 standard on requirements for CABs to carry out  conformity assessment of TSPs as one route to demonstrate conformity with relevant requirements of the  31 EA Resolution 2014 (34) 22 and EA document EAGA(14)31.  32 ETSI EN 319 403 V2.2.2 (2015-08): Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI); Trust Service Provider Conformity  Assessment - Requirements for conformity assessment bodies assessing Trust Service Providers. This document builds  on ISO/IEC 17065 to specify additional requirements for CABs and additional auditing rules under which CABs will  have to carry out their conformity assessments of QTSPs and their QTSs  http://www.european-accreditation.org/document/34th-ea-ga-approved-resolutions-  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  33  eIDAS Regulation through assessment by accredited CABs. The EN 319 403 defined accreditation scheme is  such that:  (i) It requires the accreditation of the CAB to be based on ISO/IEC 1706533;  (ii) It supplements the general requirements provided in ISO/IEC 17065 to provide additional  dedicated requirements for CABs performing certification of trust service Providers and the  trust services they provide towards defined criteria against which they claim conformance.  It does not, however, specify those criteria nor the certification scheme and needs to be considered as an  accreditation “framework” for the conformity assessment of TSP against audit criteria. Those criteria need  to be defined in such a way that they should:  (a) take into account specificities of the type of trust service to be assessed;  (b) ensure that all aspects of the TSP activity are fully covered; and  (c) be based on standards, publicly available specifications and/or regulatory requirements.  Consequently, the EA promoted accreditation scheme (ISO/IEC 17065 completed by ETSI EN 319 403)  cannot be implemented unless such effective criteria, the related control objectives and controls are  clearly defined in a way that the NAB can evaluate the competency of the CAB to conduct an assessment  of a QTSP/QTS against them in order to assess its conformity with the eIDAS requirements and so that the  accreditation cannot be contested. Their definition will be the purpose of the conformity assessment  scheme that may be defined by the CAB itself, the EU MS supervisory body, or any other body possessing  the necessary technical competence.34 Individually or collectively, e.g. under mutual assistance foreseen by  Art.18 of the eIDAS Regulation, supervisory bodies could establish such conformity assessment schemes  for assessing QTSP/QTS eIDAS conformity, leveraging on standards, in a way allowing establishing a  presumption of compliance of the assessed QTSP/QTS with eIDAS and of the accreditation of CABs to be  compliant with eIDAS as well.35  It should be noted that the EA promoted accreditation scheme (ISO/IEC 17065 completed by ETSI EN 319  403), still to be completed by an “eIDAS conformity assessment scheme” as explained, is not mandatory  and might not be the only basis for such accreditations as discussed in the next section.  4.4.3 Other conformity assessment schemes (as alternative to the EA promoted scheme)  All NABs from EU Member States and from EEA countries are members of the EA. The EA is also the  recognised body, under Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, as competent to develop sectoral or specific  accreditation schemes. The EA and all its members have promoted unanimously the above described ETSI  33 ISO/IEC 17065:2012: Conformity assessment -- Requirements for bodies certifying products, processes and services.  34 To this extent, ISO/IEC 17065 requires in substance (in its section 7.2.1) that the criteria against which QTSP/QTS  are evaluated shall be those contained in specified standards and other normative documents. ETSI EN 319 403  extends this to “standards, publicly available specifications and/or regulatory requirements” while taking into account  specificities of the type of trust service to be assessed and ensuring that all aspects of the TSP activity are fully  covered). ISO/IEC 17065 also suggests considering ISO/IEC 17007 for guidance for developing normative documents  suitable for the purpose of establishing criteria documents. When explanations are required as to the application of  these documents for a specific certification scheme, ISO/IEC 17065 (in its section 7.2.2) requires them to be  formulated by relevant and impartial committees (or persons) possessing the necessary technical competence, and  made available by the certification body upon request.  35 See last § of section 3.4.4.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  34  EN 319 403 accreditation scheme. Such promotions are not formally binding but makes it a commonly  agreed consensus to use it.  NABs do not specify conformity assessment schemes. A conformity assessment scheme owner could put  forward its scheme for purpose of accreditation of CAB in accordance with the eIDAS Regulation at a  national level and the local NAB would ensure that the scheme meets the accreditation requirements.  However it is likely when such a scheme would deviate from the one promoted at the European level by  the EA, it would need to be recognised being in accordance with the eIDAS requirements (i.e. Art.3.18 and  Art.20.1) and as an appropriate alternative to the EA promoted one in order to ensure the equivalence of  the level of competence of accredited CABs, to facilitate mutual recognition and to promote the overall  acceptance of accreditation certificates and conformity assessment results issued by those accredited  CABs.  To be considered as conformant with the eIDAS Regulation, a conformity assessment scheme:   Must be such that the rules under which the CAB shall carry out QTSP/QTS assessment against those  conformity assessment requirements and the competence of the CAB to carry out such assessments  have been accredited by a competent NAB under Regulation (EU) 765/2008.  o The ETSI framework scheme based on EN 319 403, complementing requirements in ISO/IEC  17065, and an accreditation under ISO 17065 is an option already promoted at the European  level by the EA.  o Alternatives could be based on other accreditation frameworks (e.g. ISO 17043, ISO 17021)  covering inspection bodies or laboratories as CABs provided they are properly completed by  requirements on CABs that ensure the evaluation of their competence in assessing QTSP/QTS  against all the applicable eIDAS requirements.   Must be such that the purpose of the assessment is to confirm that the assessed QTSP/QTS fulfil the  eIDAS requirements applicable to the type of QTSP/QTS being assessed (conformity assessment  requirements).  o The conformity assessment requirements should be designed in accordance with  recommendations made in section 4.4.4 of this document.  o Note that to this extent, the EA promoted ETSI framework accreditation scheme based on EN  319 403 must additionally be completed by the identification of the evaluation criteria against  which the QTSPs/QTSs are to be evaluated and to be judged (in this case, certified) to comply  with the eIDAS requirements. Such a completion can be done by the CAB itself, the EU MS  supervisory body or any other body possessing the necessary technical competence.   Must be such that the CAR includes sufficient demonstration and a formal statement that the  QTSP/QTS meet the requirement laid down in the eIDAS Regulation.  o The CAR report should be structured against recommendations provided in section 4.5 of this  document.  Any conformity assessment scheme competing, with regards to the CAB requirements, with the ETSI EN  319 403 accreditation scheme promoted at EU level by the EA, would be equivalently suitable to that EA  promoted scheme provided it would be promoted for purpose of accreditation at a national level by the  local NAB or at the EU level by the EA and provided that it has been demonstrated that the competing  scheme meets the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation and of Regulation 765/2008.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  35  The adoption, convergence, or migration of schemes for the accreditation of CABs in accordance with the  eIDAS Regulation towards the ETSI EN 319 403 scheme with the accreditation based on ISO/IEC 17065, as  promoted at the EA level, is encouraged by EA document EAGA(14)31.36  When a CAB has been correctly accredited in accordance with the eIDAS Regulation, no SB could reject the  CAR produced by such a CAB for the sole reason that the CAB is not accredited by their national NAB. The  NAB having accredited such a CAB can be the national body of the same EU MS for which the SB is  competent or be from another MS37.  4.4.4 eIDAS QTSP/QTS criteria as part of an eIDAS conformity assessment scheme  With regards to the further definition and clarification of the effective criteria, the effective related control  objectives and controls to be used by an accredited CAB to evaluate QTSP/QTS compliance with the eIDAS  Regulation and for which the competency of the CAB will be accredited by the NAB, it is important to note  that:   First, no standard or normative document has been referenced so far by any secondary legislation  (implementing acts) that would have been adopted pursuant to the eIDAS Regulation and that, when  met, would give a legal presumption of compliance of the QTSP or QTS against all or a specific subset  of the applicable requirements.   Second, any situation that would impose compliance on a QTSP/QTS with a specific standard or  normative document is prohibited as it would be in contradiction with the eIDAS Regulation principles.  The eIDAS Regulation is technologically-neutral and QTSPs/QTSs are free to define the way they  implement those applicable requirements, whether operationally, organisationally or technically.   Third, the resulting CAR and the final and unambiguous conformity statement are the necessary  elements for the QTSP/QTS to be effectively granted a qualified status by the competent SB. It is  ultimately the SB to which the CAR is notified by the assessed QTSP that will take the decision to grant  or not the qualified status to the assessed QTSP/QTS.  Hence the resulting CAR needs to contain  sufficient information to demonstrate, in detail to the SB, that the assessed QTSP/QTS fulfil the  requirements laid down in the eIDAS Regulation and consequently deserves to be granted a qualified  status. It is not regarded as suitable that the SB, which has the obligation to verify the compliance of  the QTSP/QTS with the Regulation, will take its decision on the sole basis of a yes/no conformity  assessment document or CAR.   Fourth, the granularity of the scope of the assessment on the targeted trust service is the one used in  EU Member State trusted lists. That granularity should correspond, per type of QTSP/QTS, to the  “service digital identity” concept as defined by CID (EU) 2015/1505 laying down technical  36 The EA document EAGA (14)31 lays down the migration considerations for both CABs and National Accreditation  Bodies (NABs) in order to transition of EA members existing arrangements for CAB accreditation (e.g. based on EN  45011, ISO/IEC 17021 for delivering certification against ISO 27001 – including fulfilling ISO 27006, ISO 20000)  towards EN 319 403. Unfortunately, this document may be misleading in the sense that it refers to TSP applicable  conformity assessment technical specifications and standards as part of this migration. The identification of those  specifications and standards must not be understood as indicating a mandatory conformance to assess QTSP/QTS  eIDAS requirements; they only indicate migration from former versions of standards to newer standards replacing  them (whenever a conformity assessment against a specific standard is required e.g. in the context of CA/Browser  Forum requirements).  37 This may be the case when a CAB is established in a EU MS where the NAB has not implemented any eIDAS  accreditation scheme and it has been accredited by a NAB from another EU MS or even a third country being an EA  MLA signatory. This may also be the case when the notifying TSP has contracted a CAB from another country that the  one in which it is established.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  36  specifications and formats relating to trusted lists pursuant to Article 22.5 of the eIDAS Regulation.  Indeed, once the SB decides to grant a qualified status to a QTSP/QTS, it shall inform the body  responsible for establishing, maintaining and publishing the national trusted list for the purposes of  updating it accordingly. It is only when that granted qualified status has been indicated in the trusted  list that the assessed QTSP may begin to provide the assessed qualified trust service. Hence it is also  important that the scope of the assessment corresponds to, and identifies clearly, the “service digital  identity(ies)” identifying the trust service to be granted a qualified status, for each type of qualified  trust service considered by the eIDAS Regulation as specified by CID (EU) 2015/1505.  In order to benefit from QTSP/QTS criteria, related control objectives and controls, which are efficient to  demonstrate QTSP/QTS conformity with all the eIDAS requirements, it is recommended:   They are organised per type of QTSP/QTS;   They are organised per requirement of the eIDAS Regulation applicable to a specific type of QTSP/QTS;   They include sufficient set of criteria to confirm that the assessed QTSP/QTS meets the applicable  eIDAS Regulation requirements;   They ensure that all aspects of the TSP activity are fully covered;   They take into account the outcome based approach to the eIDAS requirements and not impose  specific ways, and in particular no specific standard, for the assessed QTSP/QTS to implement the  applicable eIDAS requirements;   In general, and in particular when based on standards or publicly available specifications:  o they are supported by demonstration that the criteria coming from those standards or publicly  available specifications are suitable for confirming that the specific applicable eIDAS  requirement(s) they support an evaluation against are met;  o they allow deviation from strict compliance to standards where the requirements from  standards exceed or contradict the eIDAS requirements.  The effective eIDAS QTSP/QTS criteria may be defined by the CAB itself, the EU MS supervisory body or any  other body possessing the necessary technical competence. As a last resort, it may be up to the CAB to  establish the effective eIDAS QTSP/QTS criteria, related control objectives and controls it will use for  assessing QTSP/QTS against the eIDAS Regulation and to demonstrate to the NAB that they are sufficient  to confirm that a QTSP/QTS is meeting the applicable requirements of the eIDAS Regulation and that they  have the competency to conduct an assessment against those criteria.  NABs do not specify conformity assessment schemes. Those schemes can be put forward by the scheme  owner for purpose of accreditation and the NAB would ensure that the scheme meets the accreditation  requirements. Where this is purely a national scheme this is done by the local NAB. Where, like the ETSI EN  319 403 accreditation scheme, the conformity assessment scheme owner wants it recognised across  Europe it is done through the EA process.  The competent supervisory body may also possess the necessary (technical) competences and be entitled  to define an eIDAS conformity assessment scheme relying on appropriate accreditation requirements. An  argument for SB to define such schemes or to establish requirements on them or to establish reference  number on specific standards with or without any adaptations of their requirements, is that the SB is the  final entity to verify the conformity of QTSP/QTS with the eIDAS requirements and granting or withdrawing  a qualified status. Supervisory bodies, when defining such criteria must pay attention to using an outcome  based approach that does not require any specific (e.g. technical, operational, organisational) way to  proceed and in particular does not require compliance with any specific technical requirement or technical  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  37  standard. A supervisory body may establish an eIDAS conformity assessment scheme on the basis of  referenced technical specifications or standards, with or without amendments after assessment of their  compliance with the requirements set in the Regulation, so that once the criteria are met by the  corresponding QTSP/QTS they may benefit from a presumption of compliance with the applicable eIDAS  requirements with regards to the supervisory body decision under Art.21.2 of the eIDAS Regulation.38  4.4.5 Consequence of the grant of a qualified status by a SB on the basis of a CAB and/or a CAR not  conform the eIDAS Regulation  Considering that the CAR is only a tool facilitating a SB’s task when deciding whether a notifying TSP (and  the QTS it intends to provide) meet the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation and it does not bind the  latter with regards to that decision, it could be considered that providing a CAR resulting from a conform  audit carried out by a conform CAB (Art.3.18) is not a compulsory formality under penalty of nullity  (provided that the information included in the CAR did not lead the SB to take a decision that is not  conform to the eIDAS Regulation). This does not remove the obligation for CARs to meet the requirements  of the eIDAS Regulation.  Withdrawing of a qualified status by a SB, for the sole reason that the SB has granted a qualified status on  the basis of a CAR that was not eIDAS conformant would, nevertheless, not be appropriate (in particular  when the QTSP/QTS does meet the eIDAS requirements) and this would not be considered as good  administration since the competent authority considered, rightly or not, that the requirements regarding  the procedural rules was met creating legitimate expectations from the QTSP and its users. However, in  that case, the SB should be recommended to require an ad hoc audit to be carried out, within a reasonable  short time frame, by a CAB accredited in accordance with the eIDAS Regulation and in compliance with the  eIDAS requirements this time, in order to confirm the qualified status, i.e. that the concerned QTSP/QTS  meet the eIDAS requirements.  Structure and content of the CAR  The conformity assessment report (CAR) referred to in Art.21.1 of the eIDAS Regulation is a prerequisite  for the QTSP/QTS to be effectively granted a qualified status by the competent supervisory body (SB).  Since it is ultimately the supervisory body (SB) to which the CAR is notified by the assessed TSP that will  take the decision to grant or not the qualified status to the assessed TSP/TS, the notified CAR needs to  contain sufficient information to demonstrate, in detail to the SB, that the assessed TSP/TS fulfils the  QTSP/QTS requirements laid down in the eIDAS Regulation and consequently deserves to be granted a  qualified status.  It is in the interest of the TSP to ensure that the CAR it receives from the accredited CAB that conducted its  assessment brings indeed sufficient information that demonstrate that the TSP/TS complies with the  requirements laid down in the eIDAS Regulation, and in particular, with the requirements for QTSP/QTS.  It would also be in the interest of the SB to edit some recommendations on the structure and content of  the CAR referred to by Art.21.1 of the eIDAS Regulation so that it will be easier for the SB, in the  38 See for example, the referenced specification documents applicable to the qualification of trust service providers  and the trust services they provide (those documents are available in French only from the following website:  http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/administration/reglementation/confiance-numerique/le-reglement-eidas/documents- publies-par-lanssi/). For each type of QTSP/QTS, one or several documents provide, explicitly or by reference, a list of  requirements that the French supervisory body consider, once met by QTSP/QTS, as meeting the referenced  applicable eIDAS requirements.  http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/administration/reglementation/confiance-numerique/le-reglement-eidas/documents-publies-par-lanssi/ http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/administration/reglementation/confiance-numerique/le-reglement-eidas/documents-publies-par-lanssi/  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  38  boundaries of the principles of good administration and other similar applicable rules, to verify whether  those requirements are met or not, and to argue that the received CAR does not meet the eIDAS  requirements and/or does not bear sufficient information demonstrating the QTSP/QTS requirements are  met.  The specifications with regards to the structure and content of the CAR referred to in Art.21.1 of the eIDAS  Regulation are recommended to include at least the following39:   [eIDAS – Art.20.1] Bear a clear conformity statement confirming - if such is the case - that the assessed  QTSP/QTS meets all the applicable requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.   [Recommendation] Provide sufficient details to demonstrate that the assessed TSP/TS fulfils the  requirements laid down in the eIDAS Regulation, and in particular, the requirements for QTSP/QTS.  Note: Those details and information demonstrating QTSP/QTS compliance with the eIDAS Regulation  requirements may be included by reference to other reports, e.g. such as audit reports against technical  standards, which contain detailed and herewith sufficient information for the SB to judge the QTSP/QTS  conformity. On top of that the SB may need to refer to the security documentation of the TSP, like the  security concept, its declaration of practices and/or of policies, etc., as it may be referenced in the CAR.   [Recommendations] In order to bear sufficient details to demonstrate such a fulfilment the structure  and the information provided should:  1) Clearly identify the name of the CAB, and where applicable its registration number, as stated in the  official records, its official postal address and its electronic address.  2) Clearly identify the name of the national accreditation body (NAB) having accredited the CAB, and  where applicable the registration number, as stated in the official records, the official postal  address and electronic address of the NAB.  3) Include the accreditation certificate or a link to the location from where the accreditation  certificate issued by the NAB identified in accordance with point (2) together with the detailed  description or a link to the location from where the detailed description of the underlying  accreditation scheme including indication of its relevance to the eIDAS Regulation can be  retrieved.  Note: The CAB accreditation certificate, the CAR should clearly identify the accreditation scheme  under which the CAB has been accredited in the context of Reg.765/2008 (e.g. ISO/IEC 17065  being completed by ETSI EN 319 403) and the conformity assessment scheme for which the CAB  has been accredited to conduct conformity assessment of TSP/TS against the requirements laid  down in the eIDAS Regulation, and in particular, against the requirements for QTSP/QTS.  4) Include the accredited conformity assessment scheme document (i.e. QTSP/QTS audit criteria) or a  link to the location from where that document is available.  5) Clearly identify the name of the CAB lead auditor having issued [and signed] the CAR.  6) Clearly identify the name of the assessed trust service provider, and where applicable its  registration number, as stated in the official records, its official postal address and its electronic  address.  7) Clearly identify the conformity assessment target trust service(s) of the TSP for which the CAR  confirms the conformity with the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. The identification of the  39 Each bullet is preceded by an indication whether the item is a requirement from the eIDAS Regulation or a  recommendation of the present guidance document.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  39  service(s) is to align with CID (EU) 2015/1505 and clause 5.5.1.1 of ETSI TS 119 612 v2.1.1 (note: to  this extent this should include at least the RFC 5280 Subject Key Identifier or the public key of the  target trust services and the Base64 PEM representation of the associated X.509 v3 digital  certificate; additionally it should also distinguish, when applicable, whether specific sets or sub- sets of certificates should be excluded from the confirmation of conformity and on which criteria  they can be identified).  8) Provide for each qualified trust service identified in point (7)40 a detailed description of the (e.g.  PKI) functional architecture or hierarchy with the purpose to allow identification of the service(s)  to be listed in the applicable national trusted list in accordance with CID (EU) 2015/1505.  Such detailed description may be included by reference to other reports. When this is the case, a  precise and non-ambiguous summary of the TSP and the services covered should appear in the  CAR.  That description should also clearly identify which QTS components or service components are  operated by third parties (e.g. subcontractors) and their locations.  Note: A QTSP can make use of third parties, whether (Q)TSPs or not, to operate part or all of the  components or component services of the (Q)TS they provide. In this situation, the QTSP remains  the final entity responsible and liable for the QTS he provides and needs to document and ensure  correct implementation of those component services against his declared practices and policies  and of course against the eIDAS requirements.  9) Identify an exhaustive list of public and TSP internal documents that have been part of the scope  of the audit. The public documents should either be attached to the CAR or publicly accessible  links should be provided allowing for a download of those documents.  Public documents should include, as a minimum:  a) The declaration of the practices used by the TSP to provide the qualified trust services;  b) The qualified trust service policy(ies), i.e. the set of rules that indicates the applicability of  the qualified trust service to a particular community and/or class of application with  common security requirements.  c) Subscriber agreement and related terms and conditions.  Internal documents should include, as a minimum:  a) The termination plan referred to in Art.24.2.(i) of the eIDAS Regulation.  b) The documentation related to the assessment of risks aimed at supporting the  demonstration of the requirements of eIDAS Regulation Art.19.1.  c) A security & personal data breach notification plan aimed to support demonstration of the  requirement of eIDAS Regulation Art.19.2.  d) The list of all internal documents supporting the declaration of the practices used by the  TSP to provide the qualified trust services and the qualified trust service policy(ies).  10) Identify, for each stage of the audit (e.g. documentation audit and implementation audit including  onsite inspections), the period during which the audit has been conducted (elapsed time) and the  effort in man-days engaged by the CAB to conduct the audit.  11) Provide, for each of the following eIDAS requirements, a report on the fulfilment by the TSP and by  the implementation of its qualified trust services of the identified requirement, or when  appropriate, on the existence of proper procedures and management system for handling this  40 See also Annex A.7.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  40  requirement. Those reports should identify the detailed audit controls and control objectives that  have been conducted during the audit to establish them with an indication of each non-conformity  and their level of importance (or a reference to separately available audit reports in which such  information is included; such audit reports shall be attached to the CAR):  a) General requirements for qualified TSPs and for each type of qualified trust services (with  an indication of the relevant articles of the eIDAS Regulation)  i) Data processing and protection (Art.5)  (1) Art.5.1.

(b) Intention or negligence of a QTSP shall be presumed, unless proven otherwise  by QTSP.  (2) (Art.13.2) When the TSP informed customer in advance on limitations on the use of  their services, & when such limitations are recognisable to third parties, the TSP is  not liable when the limitations have been exceeded.  (3) (Art.13.3) In accordance with national rules on liability.  iii) Accessibility for person with disabilities (Art.15)  iv) Due diligence (Art.19.1)  (1) The TSP shall take appropriate technical and organisational measures to manage  the risks posed to the security of the trust services they provide.  (2) Having regard to the latest technological developments, those measures shall  ensure that the level of security is commensurate to the degree of risk.  (3) Measures shall be taken to prevent and minimize the impact of security incidents  and inform stakeholders of the adverse effects of any such incidents  v) Security & personal data breach notification (Art.19.2)  (1) The TSP shall, without undue delay but in any event within 24 hours after having  become aware of it, notify the supervisory body and, where applicable, other  relevant bodies, such as the competent national body for information security or  the data protection authority, of any breach of security or loss of integrity that has  a significant impact on the trust service provided or on the personal data  maintained therein.  (2) The TSP shall also notify the [likely adversely affected] natural or legal [customer] of  the breach of security or loss of integrity without undue delay.  (3) May be required by the supervisory body to inform the public, when it is in the  public interest.  vi) Art.20 Supervision of qualified trust service providers  (1) The TSP ensures that it is audited at least every 24 months by an accredited CAB in  order to confirm fulfilment of the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.  (2) The TSP allows the competent supervisory body and a CAB to audit the compliance  with the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.  (3) Where the supervisory body requires from the TSP to remedy any failure to fulfil  requirements under the eIDAS Regulation, the TSP will act accordingly within the  set deadline.

The CAR should detail which of these parties  have been subject to the audit.  Note: If already provided otherwise, e.g. in an additional audit report as specified under point (12),  this should not be required to be repeated.  14) Indicate, when required by the applicable accreditation/conformity assessment scheme, by when  the next surveillance audit and the next compliance audit have to be conducted at the latest.41  15) Indicate under which circumstances an accredited conformity assessment body has to be involved  in reassessing the assessed TSP and the qualified trust services in addition to the planned audits.  The CAR should be clearly requested to be protected in integrity (since it is sent by the QTSP and not  directly by the CAB) and to ensure its origin. To this extent, the CAR should be requested to be either  signed using the handwritten signature of the CAB lead auditor, signed using an advanced electronic  signature, sealed with an advanced electronic seal of the CAB, or by some equivalent method.  The confidentiality of the information notified by the (Q)TSP (incl. the CAR) to the SB should be ensured  (since it may contain sensitive information).  Notification of accredited CABs and conformity assessment activities  The eIDAS Regulation does not foresee any obligation for the EU MS or the NABs to notify or inform of the  conformity assessment activities in respect of which accreditation of CAB is operated in accordance with this  Regulation and of any changes thereto, in particular information on the accredited CABs and the  accreditation scheme details.  Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 only foresees an obligation for a NAB to inform the other NABs of the  conformity assessment activities in respect of which it operates accreditation and of any changes thereto,  and not to inform any other body or the Commission of those activities (Art.12.1). That Regulation also  limits the obligation of each EU MS to inform the Commission and the EA on the communication of the  identity of its NAB and of all conformity assessment activities only in respect of which that body operates  accreditation in support of Community harmonisation legislation (Art.12.2). This includes details about the  CABs accredited to carry out third-party conformity assessment tasks, on conformity assessment  activities/modules, products concerned, and attestation of competence. All the notified CABs and the  associated notifications are expected to appear in the NANDO database  (http://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/nando/).  The use of the NANDO database is governed by the EC as it is specifically designed for new approach  directives and notified bodies. Hence, it may not be expected that NANDO will include a specific repository  of eIDAS accredited CABs notified to the Commission by the MS as NANDO is a very specific database that  lists notified bodies. Notified bodies are bodies that have been appointed by Member States to the  Commission and other Member States to carry out conformity assessment activities in the field of so called  41 The annual surveillance audit that may be a requirement coming from the accreditation/conformity assessment  scheme under which CAB are accredited and (Q)TSP/(Q)TS are audited (e.g. §7.9 of ISO 17065 and EN 319 403) is not  a requirement from the eIDAS Regulation.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  43  New Approach and New Legislative Approach Legislation. Only notified bodies are allowed to carry out  these tasks.  It should be clarified (e.g. by the EC) whether either an obligation or a possibility or on the contrary any  prevention would exist for MS to notify the EC for publication in the NANDO database of the CABs  accredited in accordance with the eIDAS Regulation.  As a general recommendation, notified information should also include information, and any change  thereto, about each of the EA MLA signatory NABs, whether they operate an accreditation scheme in  accordance with the eIDAS Regulation, details regarding such an accreditation scheme, accredited CABs  and for which QTPS/QTS, accredited CABs conformity assessment activities (e.g. certification certificates),  etc. The database eventually used for the publication of such information, the practical aspects (e.g.  identification of the notification bodies; location, content and structure of page related to eIDAS  accreditation of CABs) should be organised in such a way that the information could easily be consumed by  relying parties including TSPs and SBs.  On the other hand, in general, conformity assessment certificates, if provided by accredited CABs, need to  carry the logo of the accreditation body that has accredited them. In this respect, it may be possible to find  out whether a certificate has been issued by an accredited CAB or not, by which NAB it has been  accredited and under which accreditation scheme. However, this requires a careful analysis of such  conformity assessment certificates. That may be quite straightforward for SB receiving the initially notified  or 2-yearly CAR but it does not solve the need of TSPs or QTSPs to benefit from market information and  identify which are the candidate CABs being duly accredited to conduct assessment activities in accordance  with the eIDAS Regulation.  It is recommended to NABs, and alternatively to SBs under Art.18 of the eIDAS Regulation, to cooperate to  set-up a single and centralised dissemination point providing to the public, information, and any change  thereto, about each of the EA MLA signatory NABs, whether they operate an accreditation scheme in  accordance with the eIDAS Regulation, details regarding such an eIDAS accreditation scheme, eIDAS  accredited CABs and for which type(s) of QTPS/QTS, eIDAS conformity assessment activities (incl.  certificates when available) carried out by eIDAS accredited CABs, etc.  As an illustrative example for a very limited number of EU MS, that information could be made available as  detailed and displayed in the following figures42.  42 Examples data based on information available by 21.09.2016.

Format and procedure of notification under Art.21.1 of the eIDAS  The procedure for notification under Art.21.1 of the eIDAS Regulation should be clearly established and  communicated to TSPs.  It is recommended that:  (a) Such a procedure is made publicly available from the website of the national supervisory body  (SB).  (b) The notification is supported by a notification form to be completed by the notifying TSP and sent  to the competent SB.  (c) The completed notification form should be either signed using the handwritten signature of a legal  representative of the notifying TSP, or signed using a qualified electronic signature or sealed with  an qualified electronic seal.  (d) Where required by national law, the notifying TSP includes proof that the person signing the  notification form is legally representing the TSP organisation. For example, by including an extract  from official records like a national trade register.  (e) The confidentiality of the information notified by the TSP to the SB should be ensured (as it may  contain sensitive information).  (f) The signature/seal on the notification form should be compliant with the applicable signature  format standard referred to in Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/150643.  (g) The notification form indicates the documentation to be submitted jointly with the notification  form as part of the notification (see below for recommendation on that documentation).  (h) The completed, signed or sealed, notification form and related documentation are sent  electronically to the competent SB, or as an alternative, delivered by hand or postal mail.  (i) The notification form clearly indicates or refers to the relevant fees, when applicable, that the TSP  will have to pay for the competent SB services, from the notification until the termination of the  notified trust services and/or the withdrawal of the qualified status would it be granted by the SB,  and whether those fees are fixed or recurrent fees or a mix of both.  (j) The competent supervisory body acknowledges receipt of the notification within time limit defined  in national law of each MS (e.g. within three working days of its receipt), providing clear indication  to the notifying TSP:  (i) Acknowledgement of receipt should not in any manner be interpreted as signifying that  the SB considers that the TSP complies with the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation and  any other relevant requirements under national legislation;  (ii) The obligations or a reference to the obligations of the competent SB, including, when  applicable, reference to applicable legislation;  (iii) The obligations or a reference to the obligations of the notifying TSP, including, when  applicable, reference to applicable legislation;  (iv) The next steps of the process leading to the grant of a qualified status, when applicable, to  the notified TSP and the notified trust service(s) it intends to provide.  43 Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1506 of 8 September 2015 laying down specifications relating to  formats of advanced electronic signatures and advanced seals to be recognised by public sector bodies pursuant to  Articles 27(5) and 37(5) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on electronic  identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market. OJ L 235, 9.9.2015, p. 37–41.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  47  (k) The notification procedure documentation and/or the notification form should include a reference  to the security breach and personal data breach incident report procedure and form allowing TSPs  to notify the supervisory body in accordance with Art.19.2 of the eIDAS Regulation.  The documentation to be submitted jointly with the notification form as part of the notification under  Art.21.1 of the eIDAS Regulation is recommended to include at least the following:  1) A conformity assessment report (CAR) issued by a conformity assessment body (CAB) duly  accredited as per the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.  Note: The notification form should clearly indicate the expectations, recommendations or  requirement with regards to the required CAR and the issuing CAB, e.g. that:  a) The competent SB recognises a CAB as duly accredited as per the requirements of the eIDAS  Regulation when the CAB has been accredited by a national accreditation body under  Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 and when the accreditation certificate certifies that the CAB:  i) Fulfils the requirements of the standard ISO/IEC 17065:2012, and  ii) Fulfils the requirements of the standard ETSI EN 319 403 V2.2.2 (2015-08), and  iii) Has the skills and competencies to certify that TSP/TS comply with the requirements  laid down in the eIDAS Regulation, and in particular, with the requirements for  QTSP/QTS, on the basis of a conformity assessment scheme for which the CAB is  accredited.  b) The competent SB recognises a CAB as duly accredited as per the requirements of the eIDAS  Regulation when the CAB has been accredited by a national accreditation body under  Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 under another normative scheme as the one specified in 1.(a)  provided such an alternative scheme has been recognised as conform to the eIDAS  requirements (Art.3.18, Art.20.1).  c) The purpose of the CAR is to assess the conformity of TSP/TS with the requirements laid  down in the eIDAS Regulation, and in particular, with the requirements for qualified trust  service providers and for the qualified trust services concerned by the notification.  Consequently, the CAR must bear a clear conformity statement confirming - if such is the  case - that the assessed QTSP/QTS meets all the applicable requirements of the eIDAS  Regulation.  d) The CAR is to provide sufficient details to demonstrate that the assessed QTSP/QTS meets  all the applicable requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.  e) The structure and the information provided in the CAR should be aligned with the  specifications provided in the notification form (see section 4.5 of this document for  guidance on the recommended structure of such a report).  2) Memorandum and Articles of Association of the notifying TSP.  3) Evidence that the notifying TSP maintains sufficient financial resources and/or has obtained  appropriate liability insurance with regards to the provision of the trust services for which a qualified  status is requested, e.g. including  a) Copy of the profit and loss account and balance sheets for the last 3 years for which accounts  have been closed; failing that, appropriate statements from banks44.  44 Subject to applicable national laws, if, for some exceptional reason (to be notified with its justification by the  notifying TSP) which the competent SB considers justified, the notifying TSP is unable to provide one or other of those  documents, it may prove having sufficient financial resources by any other document which the competent SB  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  48  b) Liability insurance statements.  4) Trust service policy(ies) that applies(apply) to the trust services for which a qualified status is  requested.  5) Trust service practice statement that applies(apply) to the trust services for which a qualified status  is requested.  6) Trust service detailed architecture (e.g. PKI hierarchy along with the indication of the supported  trust service policies) of the trust services for which a qualified status is requested.  7) Test samples of all relevant and applicable types of outputs from the qualified trust services the  notifying TSP intends to start providing.  8) List of standards:  a) with which operations are claimed to be compliant.  b) with which operations are audited, evaluated, certified or assessed to be compliant and details  about the underlying audit, evaluation, certification or assessment scheme.  9) Copy of standard end-user agreement the notifying TSP intends to use with regards to the provision  of the trust services for which a qualified status is requested.  10) The documentation related to the assessment of risks aimed at supporting the demonstration of the  requirements of eIDAS Regulation Art.19.1.  11) A security & personal data breach notification plan aimed to support the demonstration of the  requirements of eIDAS Regulation Art.19.2.  12) The termination plan (eIDAS Regulation Art.17.4.(i), Art.24.2.(i)).  In addition to any applicable national language, all relevant documents regarding format and procedure for  notification under Art.21.1 of the eIDAS Regulation should be made available in UK English in order to  facilitate eIDAS Art.18 cooperation between EU MS SBs, when applicable.  The confidentiality of the information notified by the (Q)TSP to the SB should be ensured (since it may  contain sensitive information).  considers appropriate. The competent SB may reserve the right to request any other document enabling it to verify  the TSP's financial resources.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  49  6. Initial verification of the notified QTSP/QTS with the eIDAS  requirements & communication of the granted qualified status for  inclusion in the national TL  As previously stated in the present document, it is ultimately the supervisory body (SB) that will take the  decision to grant or not the qualified status to the notifying QTSP/QTS.  In order to enable and facilitate the task of the SB in taking a proper and informed decision, it is crucial  that the notification submitted by the notifying TSP and in particular that the submitted CAR includes  sufficient information to demonstrate, in detail to the SB, that the assessed QTSP/QTS fulfil the  requirements laid down in the eIDAS Regulation and consequently deserves to be granted a qualified  status. It is not regarded as suitable that the SB, which has the obligation and bears the final liability to  verify the compliance of the QTSP/QTS with the eIDAS Regulation, will take a positive decision on a  Conformity Assessment Report, when the underlying conformity assessment (e.g. certification) has been  done against a specific standard and not against the eIDAS requirements.  In order to allow for an efficient initiation process, as stressed by Recital (45) of the eIDAS Regulation,  preliminary interactions between prospective qualified trust service providers and the competent  supervisory body are encouraged with a view to facilitating the due diligence leading to the provisioning of  qualified trust services.  The following assumptions can be regarded concerning the “initial verification” phase:   The SB has communicated to candidate TSPs the applicable national requirements and  recommendations regarding the notification procedure, the notification form, the accompanying  documentation and the CAR, as recommended in the present document, and   The notifying TSP has implemented those requirements and recommendations.  However, the following recommendations on the steps to be undertaken by the notified SB, can be applied  even the above assumptions are not met:  1) On reception of a notification under Art.21.1 from a TSP intending to start providing qualified trust  services, acknowledge the reception to the TSP (see section 4.(k)).  2) Verify that the notification procedure has been respected, e.g. that the notification form is fully  completed, duly signed, accompanied with the required documentation (see section 4 for guidance  on recommendations for such a documentation) and in particular verify the eligibility of the CAR.  Verification of the eligibility of the CAR includes verification that  (a) The CAR has been issued by a CAB accredited in accordance with the eIDAS Regulation (see  section 0).  (b) The CAR provides sufficient information to demonstrate that the assessed QTSP/QTS fulfil each  of the applicable eIDAS requirements (see section 4.5).  When this verification is not satisfactory, indicate the non-conformities to the notifying TSP as well  as the deadline for correcting these non-conformities.  3) Clearly identify the name of the assessed trust service provider, and where applicable its registration  number, as stated in the official records, its official postal address and its electronic address.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  50  Note: Both the notification form and the CAR should bear that information. The related information  from the notification form and the CAR should of course match.  4) Clearly identify the qualified trust service(s) of the trust service provider for which the CAR confirms  (e.g. certifies) the conformity with the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. The identification of  the service(s) is to align with CID (EU) 2015/1505 and clause 5.5.1.1 of ETSI TS 119 612 v2.1.1.  Note: Both the notification form and the CAR should bear that information. The related  information from the notification form and the CAR should of course match. At least the CAR  should provide that information to the level of details required to allow identification of the  service(s) to be listed in the applicable national trusted list in accordance with CID (EU)  2015/1505 (see section 2.4 of the present document).  5) Taking into account, for each (potentially) qualified trust service identified in point (4),  (a) the detailed description of the functional (e.g. PKI) architecture or hierarchy,  (b) the notified documentation,  (c) the notified CAR (ideally structured as detailed in section 4.5),  verify that the notified TSP and the qualified trust services it intends to provide comply with the  requirements laid down in the eIDAS Regulation, and in particular, with the requirements for  qualified trust service providers and for the qualified trust services they provide. That verification is  to be performed requirement per requirement for each of the applicable eIDAS requirement with  regards to the type of QTSP/QTS. For that purpose, the structure of those requirements provided in  point (11) of section 4.5 of the present document can also be used as a check list for such a  verification by the SB.  The relevance and severity of each non-conformity with any eIDAS requirement45 is to be judged by  the SB as a last resort46.  6) When the relevance and the severity of the identified non-conformity(ies) lead the SB to conclude  that the notified TSP and the trust services it intends to provide as qualified do not comply with the  requirements laid down in the eIDAS Regulation, and in particular, with the requirements for  qualified trust service providers and for the qualified trust services they provide, then the SB shall  inform the trust service provider specifying the reasons for non-granting of the qualified status.  7) In the absence of non-conformities, or when the relevance and the severity of the identified non- conformity(ies) lead the SB to conclude that the notified TSP and the trust services it intends to  provide as qualified do comply with the requirements laid down in the eIDAS Regulation, and in  particular, with the requirements for qualified trust service providers and for the qualified trust  services they provide, then the SB shall grant qualified status to the trust service provider and the  trust services it provides and inform the body referred to in Article 22(3) of the eIDAS Regulation  (hereafter the trusted list scheme operator or TLSO) for the purposes of updating the trusted lists  referred to in its Article 22(1).  8) With respect to point (7) above, the SB and the TLSO shall respect the timing constraints clarified by  CID 2015/1505/EU (in particular enforcing clause 5.5.5 of ETSI TS 119 612 v2.1.1)47 with regards to  45 As a reminder it is important here to distinguish a non-conformity with whatever requirement from whatever  standard (e.g. as potentially reported by the notified CAR) and a non-conformity with a requirement from the eIDAS  Regulation.  46 In that, the decision of the SB may overrule the CAB certification decision or non-conformity decision reported in  the CAR by the CAB.  47 “TLSO shall ensure the consistency of the (re)-issuance of a trusted list and the actual date when a service status has  been updated (e.g. granted or withdrawn), i.e. the 'List issue date and time' (clause 5.3.14), the time of signing the  trusted list and the time of change. The date and time associated to the new current status of a listed service shall not  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  51  date and time of the issuance of the trusted list and the date and time of the grant of the qualified  status to the concerned trust services and as the latter will appear in the trusted list. As the QTSPs  may begin to provide the qualified trust service after the qualified status has been indicated in the  corresponding national trusted list, the date of the grant of the qualified status must be aligned with  the date of publication of that trusted list, no back dating is allowed.  Example: A “CA/QC” service identified by the public key of an issuing technical CA whose  public/private key pair has been generated (and certified) on 01.08.2016 is granted a qualified  status by the SB that came internally to that conclusion on 01.11.2016 based on a notification  received on 01.10.2016. The publication of the qualified status in the corresponding national  trusted list can only occur (for whatever reason) on 6.11.2016. The SB and the TLSO (when they  are different entities) shall make sure that the three dates regarding the date of issuance of the  trusted list (‘List issue date and time' - clause 5.3.14 of ETSI TS 119 612 v2.1.1), the time of  signing the trusted list, and the date of granting the qualified status (‘Current status starting  date and time’ – clause 5.5.5) shall be aligned in this example to 06.11.2016 and make sure that  the updated trusted list is effectively published and available to relying parties on that same  date. In no way, the date appearing in ‘Current status starting date and time’ (clause 5.5.5) can  be back dated to an earlier date (e.g. not 01.08.2016, not 01.11.2016).  9) During the initial verification process, the SB may require additional information from the notifying  TSP and from the CAB having issued the notified CAR.  10) The initial verification process should be concluded within three months meaning that when leading  to a positive conclusion, the total elapsed time between the notification and the effective  publication of the qualified status in the national trusted list should be less than three months.  When the initial verification process would be leading to a negative decision, or would require  additional information from the notifying TSP, the elapsed time between the notification and the  notification of the negative decision or the request for additional information should be as short as  possible and similarly less than three months. If the verification is not concluded within three  months of notification, the SB shall inform the notifying TSP specifying the duly motivated reasons  (see point 11 below) for the delay and the new deadline by which the verification is to be concluded.  11) During the initial verification process, the SB should respect, in particular, the principles of good  administration, including the obligation to give reasons for its decisions, as well as the principle of  proportionality.  be set before the date of (re)issuance of the trusted list as retroactive status change can have undesired effects to  previous validations of listed services and of their outputs”.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  52  7. Supervisory body resources and organisational measures  EU Member States are not obliged by the eIDAS Regulation to have CABs established on their territory or  even to have their existing NAB being able to accredit CABs on their territory. However, Article 17 of the  eIDAS Regulation requires EU MS to designate a supervisory body established in their territory (or, upon  mutual agreement with another Member State, a supervisory body established in that other Member  State) to be responsible for supervisory tasks in their territory. Each EU MS is further required to give such  a body the necessary powers and adequate resources for the exercise of those supervisory tasks (see  Art.17.4).  The tasks of supervisory bodies can be grouped in different categories of activities:   Cooperation (with other SBs - Art.17.4.(a); with data protection authorities - Art.17.4.(f), with NABs)   Analysis of QTSP/QTS and qualified status life-cycle management  o analysis of initial and 2-yearly CAR - Art.17.4.(b).  o grant and withdraw of qualified status (Art.17.4.(g)).  o auditing or requesting audits (Art.17.4.(e)) and analysing resulting ad hoc CAR.  o monitoring deadlines for each QTS from each QTSP (e.g. 2-yearly or ad hoc CAR, request for  complement of information, resolution of notified non-conformities.  o verify the existence and correct application of provisions on termination plans (Art.17.4.(i)).  o monitoring of QTSP/QTS activities (this may include proactive or ex post monitoring and  verification of the provisions, practices and policies of the QTSP/QTS).  o analysing QTSP/QTS provision changes notified under Art.24.2.(a).   Information/reporting (breaches notifications to other SBs and the public - Art.17.4.(c); to data  protection authorities - Art.17.4.(f); activities to EC - Art.17.4.(d).   Management of the documentation related to the supervision activities (including their publication,  e.g. as required under CID (EU) 2015/1505 with regards to the supervision scheme, Art.21.1  notification procedure and form, Art.19 breach notification, etc.).  With regards to the specific activities related to the initiation of qualified trust services, the main tasks are  related to the set-up of the supervision activities and of the related documentation, as well as to the  analysis of the CAR, the decision to grant or not a qualified status, the notification to the notifying TSPs of  the decision and potentially of the non-conformities and/or request for additional information, the update  of the national trusted list, via the trusted list body when different from the SB, when applicable.  Quantifying the resources will basically depend on the number of notifying TSPs, of notified trust services,  of QTSPs and QTSs. SBs may also rely on internal resources and/or on external resources when internal  resources are not sufficient.  Supervisory bodies should employ staff and, if applicable, subcontractors who possess the necessary  expertise, reliability, experience, and qualifications and who have received appropriate training regarding  security and personal data protection rules, as well as regarding to the provision of trust services and the  underlying technology, including trusted lists specifications.  Supervisory bodies or their national government may establish fees to be supported by notifying TSPs and  QTSPs with regards to the notification, verification and supervision tasks they generate. Considering the  notifying TSPs and QTSPs are already supporting the costs of the initial and regular conformity  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  53  assessments, those fees when applied should be reasonable, proportionate, justified and not create  barrier to market entrance.  Specific attention should be paid by SB and EU MS on the potential need for taking over part or all  termination activities in case of failure for the QTSP (or the expected taking over 3rd party) to correctly  execute the termination plan. This may include recommendations on the set up of appropriate legislative  instruments ensuring proper execution of a QTSP/QTS termination plan and in particular proper  implementation of Art.24.2.(h) (e.g. in case of unscheduled termination such as bankruptcy).

The eIDAS Regulation is about trust,  seamless user experience and convenience in online cross-border transactions.  Trusted list  A trusted list is a list including information relating to the qualified trust service providers which are  established in and supervised by an EU Member State, together with information related to the qualified  trust services provided by them, in accordance with the relevant provisions laid down in the eIDAS  Regulation. Those lists have constitutive value and are the primary source of information to validate that a  qualified status has been granted to a QTSP and to the QTS it provides.  Trusted lists are essential elements in building trust among electronic market operators by allowing users  to determine the qualified status and the status history of trust service providers and their services.  Member States may include in the trusted lists information on non-qualified trust service providers,  together with information related to the non-qualified trust services provided by them. It shall be clearly  indicated that they are not qualified according to the eIDAS Regulation.  Member States may include in the trusted lists information on nationally defined trust services of other  types than those defined under Article 3(16) of the eIDAS Regulation. It shall be clearly indicated that they  are not qualified according to the eIDAS Regulation.  QTSP/QTS requirements and obligations  The eIDAS Regulation foresees a set of requirements and obligations for qualified trust service providers  (QTSP) and qualified trust services (QTS) they provide in order to ensure a high level of security for the  qualified trust services. Those obligations include in a nutshell:  - Processing of personal data shall be carried out in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC.  - A Trust service provider (TSP) is liable for damage caused intentionally or negligently to any natural or  legal person due to a failure to comply with the obligations under this Regulation, while the intention  or negligence of a QTSP shall be presumed, unless proven otherwise by the QTSP. When TSP informed  customer in advance on limitations on the use of their services, and when such limitations are  recognisable to third parties, TSP is not liable when limitations have been exceeded.  - Where feasible, services must be accessible for person with disabilities.  - Implementing appropriate technical and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the  security of the trust services they provide. Taking the latest technological developments into account,  those measures shall ensure that the level of security is commensurate to the degree of risk. Measures  shall be taken to prevent and to minimize the impact of security incidents and to inform stakeholders  of the adverse effects of any such incidents.  - Very strict rules regarding the obligation of notifying security & personal data breaches.  - Additional requirements on QTSP operations and practices:  - Inform the SB of any change in QTS provisioning and of intention to cease;  - Have an up-to-date termination plan, agreed with the competent supervisory body (SB), to  ensure continuity of service;  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  56  - Requirements on employed staff and subcontractors, when used;  - Sufficient financial resources and/or liability insurance, in accordance with national law;  - Inform consumers on terms and conditions, incl. on limitations on use;  - Use of trustworthy systems and products ensuring the technical security and reliability of the  supported processes;  - Use of trustworthy systems to store (personal) data in a verifiable form;  - Take appropriate measures against forgery and theft of data; and  - Record and keep accessible all relevant information concerning data issued and received,  even after cessation of activities.  - Specific requirements from the provisions laid down in the eIDAS Regulation with regards to the  provision of a specific type of qualified trust service.  All those requirements must be met by the QTSP/QTS before issuing the very first qualified trust service  output, e.g. before issuing the very first qualified time stamp in the case of QTSP providing qualified time  stamping services.  Once granted a qualified status, the eIDAS Regulation also foresees an active supervision scheme of  qualified trust service providers (QTSP) and qualified trust services (QTS) they provide by the national  competent supervisory body (SB) to monitor the fulfilment of the QTSP/QTS requirements and obligations  throughout their lifetime.  Service digital identity  The granularity of the identification in the national trusted lists of the technical instance of the qualified  trust service to which the qualified status is granted is actually clarified by the Commission Implementing  Decision (EU) 2015/150548. It corresponds to the level of the “Service digital identity” field as specified in  ETSI TS 119 612 v2.1.1 on which the CID relies to establish the content and define the technical  specifications and formats for the national trusted lists. In a trusted list, a qualified trust service to which a  qualified status is granted is identified by the public key49 identified by the “Service digital identity” field of  the corresponding trusted list service entry of a listed TSP entry. The type of qualified trust service for  which the qualified status is granted is identified by the combination of the “Service Type Identifier” field  and the “Additional Service Information” extension when present and further specifying the type of  service.  With regards to service type identifier “TSA/QTST” URI50, instead of assigning it (only) to time stamping  units (TSUs) is it possible to assign it to a service digital identity, i.e. the public key, of an issuing CA  (respectively a Root-CA) that issues (respectively under which are issued) certificates to TSUs that in turn  sign time stamps. Both implementations are actually possible, namely:   Listing a TSU public key (certificate) as “Service digital identity” of a service of type “TSA/QTST” is of  course possible: any time stamp issued by such a listed TSU with a granted qualified status at the time  indicated by the time stamp shall be considered as qualified), and  48 Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1505 of 8 September 2015 laying down technical specifications and  formats relating to trusted lists pursuant to Article 22(5) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament  and of the Council on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market  (Text with EEA relevance). OJ L 235, 9.9.2015, p. 26–36.  49 When based on PKI public-key technology (when not based on such technology, an indicator expressed as a URI is  used to identify uniquely and unambiguously the listed service).  50 http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/Svctype/TSA/QTST  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015D1505 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015D1505 http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/Svctype/TSA/QTST  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  57   The service type identifier “TSA/QTST” URI can also be assigned to a CA public key (certificate) instead  of to a TSU public key (certificate) , but in such case \"O=\" attribute of certificate might not match the  'TSP Name' written within TSL (there are TSPs(QTS) using TSU certificates issued by other TSPs) and  this is required by ETSI TS 119 612 (5.5.3 Note 4 “With regards to X.509 Certificates that are candidates  to represent a public key identifying a listed service, the TLSO shall disregard certificates for which the  \"O=\" attribute does not strictly match the 'TSP Name' value”).  For that to be eligible, all TSUs either listed directly or signed by a CA listed as “TSA/QTST” service must  reach the qualified level, all issued time stamps must be qualified and the corresponding QTSP and its QTS  consisting in issuing qualified time stamps must meet the applicable eIDAS requirements.  When listing a CA with a type “TSA/QTST”, it is de facto required to have that CA issue certificates to  qualified TSUs51 only (to the exclusion of non-qualified TSUs) and to have those TSUs to issue qualified time  stamps only (to the exclusion of non-qualified time stamps) as in the context of time stamps it would be  much more difficult than in the context of certificates to distinguish between those types of time stamps  when the listed CA issue certificates for both types of TSUs, actually:   Best practices and relevant standards require the use of time stamping policy OID indication in the  time stamp but there is only one field allowing one single OID and this can be any proprietary OID or  the “best practices level OID” defined by ETSI EN 319 421. ETSI EN 319 422 defines a time stamp  extension for where to place a \"QtstCompliance\" statement (by analogy with the QcCompliance  statement for qualified certificates) but it is not mandatory and it is not commonly used in existing  implementations. ETSI EN 319 421 further requires that when a TSU issues qualified time stamps, that  TSU shall not issue non-qualified time stamps and TSA should use separate TSU for issuing qualified  and non-qualified time stamps.   In the eIDAS Regulation,  o there is no requirement to indicate in the time stamp itself that it was created as qualified, and  o there is no requirement to implement or comply with any standard.   There is, under the current TL specifications, no possibility for the TLSO in a “TSA/QTST” entry of a  trusted list to further qualify some set of time stamps for being labelled as qualified or not-qualified  when issued under the same TSU or the same (root) CA issuing TSU certificates.  So when a TSA/TSP wants to issue both qualified and non-qualified time stamps, having separate  dedicated TSUs (creating exclusively either qualified or non-qualified time stamps) and grouped under two  separate dedicated CAs (either signing qualified TSUs or non-qualified TSUs) would be a must when using  the approach of listing the CA in the TL as “TSA/QTST” type of service.  Actually, when an issuing CA is not signing exclusively qualified TSUs that issue qualified time stamps  exclusively, then that issuing CA cannot be used as Service Digital Identifier (Sdi) in a “TSA/QTST” entry and  all corresponding qualified TSUs issuing exclusively qualified time stamps must be listed separately.  What does Regulation (EC) 765/2008 bring as advantages to the SBs and to the  TSPs?  Regulation (EC) 765/2008 ensures the equivalence of the level of competence of conformity assessment  bodies (CABs) with the aim of facilitating mutual recognition and of promoting the overall acceptance of  accreditation certificates and conformity assessment results issued by accredited bodies.  51 That same CA would also be entitled to issue QCs, in theory, when meeting the applicable requirements.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  58  All EU MS have one single national accreditation body (NAB) appointed under Regulation (EC) 765/2008,  member and signatory of the EA multilateral agreement52. Accreditation through NABs that are signatories  of the EA MLA provides a further level of confidence that the accredited CABs are independent,  competent, and that they work in a consistent way.  Each NAB is subject to routine and rigorous evaluations by peer evaluation teams in order to verify  continuing compliance with Regulation (EC) 765/2008 and the international standard for accreditation  bodies (ISO/IEC 17011). Each NAB has an obligation to inform the other NABs with regards to the  conformity assessment activities in respect of which it operates accreditations and of any changes thereto.  To that end, it also takes part in regular technical discussions with other NABs to harmonise their activities.  NABs demonstrating conformity with harmonised standards by successful peer evaluation (Art.10) are  presumed to fulfil requirements of Regulation (EC) 765/2008 (Art.8).  Accreditations granted by any Regulation (EC) 765/2008 - compliant NABs are deemed equivalent for a  considered conformity assessment scheme.  NABs manage the accreditation certificate life cycle for each CAB they have granted an accreditation: i.e.  they monitor the accredited CABs, restrict / suspend / withdraw accreditation certificates when required.  NABs are permitted to operate across national borders. In theory, CABs must be accredited by the NAB of  the country in which they are established but in the event the NAB does not provide services for the  expected accreditation scheme then a CAB may request accreditation services from an EA MLA signatory  NAB from another country than the one in which the CAB is established.  Conformity assessment attestations (e.g. certifications) issued by all CAB accredited by Regulation (EC)  765/2008 compliant NABs are deemed equivalent, for a considered conformity assessment scheme (e.g.  certification scheme)53. This means that a TSP, either without qualified status and intending to start  providing QTSs or being a QTSP providing QTS, that is required to provide its national SB with a CAR issued  by an accredited CAB, can choose whatever CAB from whatever EA MLA signatory country that has been  accredited under a valid eIDAS accreditation scheme for obtaining such a CAR. The competent SB cannot  reject the eligibility of the notified CAR because it has not been provided by a CAB established or  accredited in the territory for which the SB is competent.  Trust services defined by the eIDAS Regulation  In its Art.3.16, the eIDAS Regulation defines a ‘trust service’ as an electronic service normally provided for  remuneration which consists of:  (a) the creation, verification, and validation of electronic signatures, electronic seals or electronic time  stamps, electronic registered delivery services and certificates related to those services, or  (b) the creation, verification and validation of certificates for website authentication; or  (c) the preservation of electronic signatures, seals or certificates related to those services.  Which are the qualified trust services defined by the eIDAS Regulation?  52 NAB-Malta signatory in testing except ISO 15189. NAH, the new HU NAB full EA member with effect from 1 April  2016 applied for the EA MLA signatory status and the peer evaluation of NAH is ongoing.  53 See Art.11.2 of Regulation (EC) 765/2008.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  59  Only those trust services listed in Art.3.16 of the eIDAS Regulation for which there are applicable  requirements in the Regulation can benefit from the qualified status. eIDAS regulates the following nine  qualified trust services:  1. The creation of qualified certificates for electronic signatures  Certificates for electronic signature are electronic attestations which link electronic signature  validation data to a natural person and confirm at least the name or the pseudonym of that person.  Since 1 July 2016, an electronic signature can only be used by a natural person to sign, i.e. mainly to  express consent on the signed data/document. This represents a significant difference from the  eSignature Directive 1999/93/EC regime, where an electronic signature, which could be used by legal  persons, was defined as a means of authentication. Under the eIDAS Regulation, the entity who  creates an electronic signature (the so called signatory) will be a natural person. Therefore, certificates  for electronic signature cannot be issued to legal persons anymore. Instead legal persons can use  certificates for electronic seals (see below).  A qualified electronic certificate for electronic signatures is an essential element for a signatory to  create qualified electronic signatures that shall have the equivalent legal effect of a handwritten  signature all over the EU.  2. The creation of qualified certificates for electronic seals  As explained above, since 1 July 2016, legal persons cannot create legally valid (qualified) electronic  signatures anymore and cannot be issued (qualified) certificates for electronic signatures. Instead legal  persons can use certificates for electronic seals, which are electronic attestations that link electronic  seal validation data to a legal person and confirm the name of that person. The aim of an electronic  seal is not to sign but to serve as an evidence that an electronic data/document was issued by a legal  person, ensuring certainty of the data/document’s origin and integrity.  A qualified electronic certificate for electronic seals is an essential element for a legal person to create  qualified electronic seals that shall enjoy, all over the EU, the presumption of integrity of the data and  of correctness of the origin of that data to which the qualified electronic seal is linked.  3. The creation of qualified certificates for website authentication  Certificates for website authentication are issued to ensure the users (in particular citizens and SMEs)  that behind the website there is a legal or natural person identifiable by trustworthy information.  The Regulation sets clear requirements for qualified website authentication certificates to be  considered trustworthy together with obligations for qualified trust service providers of such qualified  certificates with regard to the security of their operations, their liability and their supervision regime.  As a consequence, the Regulation ensures transparency regarding the quality of the service offered to  users, accountability of providers with regards to the security of their services, trustworthiness of the  data associated to qualified authenticated websites and technological neutrality of services and  solutions.  4. Qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures  Such a qualified trust service aims to ensure the long-term data preservation, in order to ensure the  legal validity and trustworthiness of qualified electronic signatures over extended periods of time and  guarantee that they can be validated irrespective of future technological changes.  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  60  5. Qualified preservation service for qualified electronic seals  Such a qualified trust service aims to ensure the long-term data preservation, in order to ensure the  legal validity and trustworthiness of qualified electronic seals over extended periods of time and  guarantee that they can be validated irrespective of future technological changes.  6. Qualified validation service for qualified electronic signatures  Validation of electronic signature is an ancillary service to electronic signatures whose process aims to  confirm the validity of an electronic signatures.  Qualified validation services for qualified electronic signatures entail the verification by a qualified  trust service provider that the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation are met by a qualified electronic  signature in order to confirm its validity.  7. Qualified validation service for qualified electronic seals  Validation of electronic seal is an ancillary service to electronic seals whose process aims to confirm  the validity of an electronic seals.  Qualified validation services for qualified electronic seals entail the verification by a qualified trust  service provider that the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation are met by a qualified electronic seal in  order to confirm its validity.  8. Qualified electronic time stamps services  Electronic time stamps are issued to ensure the correctness of the time linked to data/documents.  Qualified electronic time stamps shall enjoy, all over the EU, the presumption of the accuracy of the  date and the time it indicates and the integrity of the data to which the date and time are bound.  9. Qualified electronic registered delivery services  By relying on a qualified electronic registered delivery service, one will benefit, all over the EU, from  the presumption of the integrity of the registered data, the sending of that data by the identified  sender, its receipt by the identified addressee and the accuracy of the date and time of the sending  and the reception indicated by that qualified trust service.  The Regulation sets clear requirements for all such qualified trust services to be considered trustworthy  together with obligations for their qualified trust service providers with regard to the security of their  operations, their liability and their supervision regime.  EA rationale for selecting ISO/IEC 17065 & ETSI EN 319 403 as the CAB accreditation  framework for TSP/TS assessments  It should be noted as well that the EA promoted accreditation scheme requires CABs to be certification  bodies, and not simply inspection bodies or laboratories as CABs are required to certify the conformity of  QTSPs/QTSs against the applicable requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.  The EA justified the choice of ISO/ICE 17065 as a basis for accreditation of CABs for evaluating their  competence in assessing TSP/TS as follows:  EA members unanimously selected ISO/IEC 17065 as the best option as basis for the accreditation  of CABs in the context of conformity assessments of TSPs and trust services they provide, and in  particular assessment of QTSPs/QTSs. EA experience is that ISO/IEC 17020 is not considered  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  61  appropriate to assessment of conformance of requirements for the management system of the  TSP, and it is considered that a review of the security management system of the TSP constitutes an  important part of a TSP audit.  Also, ISO/IEC 17020 does not impose a continued assessment by following deviations of the use of  certification brands. Inspection processes tend to review the status of the items being inspected at  a point in time whereas the requirements for a TSP need a more long term, continuous assessment  as provided by a certification scheme. The issue of certification includes requirements for regular  surveillance activities as well as specific requirements for ongoing quality and service improvement.  On their own ISO/IEC 27006 and 17021 are not considered sufficient to cover assessment of specific  service requirements. However, ISO 17065 was specifically designed to be extended to incorporate  requirements from 17021, but the opposite is not true as ISO/IEC 17065 requirements do not fit  well into ISO/IEC 17021.  The industry requirement for public trust services, such as reflected in the CA/Browser Forum  guidelines and in other national schemes for non-qualified trust services, strongly supports a clear  indication of the technical compliance to good practice in industry. The aim of the ETSI EN 319 403  conformity assessment is also to allow an assessment of conformance to industry good practices as  well as that the technical requirements of the Regulation are met. ETSI/CEN consider that any  scheme which falls short of assessment against industry good practice will bring the acceptability  of qualified trust services into question.  There is no inconsistency between a certification by an accredited CAB and the SB having final decision on  whether or not the (Q)TSP/(Q)TS meets the eIDAS requirements. Art.3.18, referring to Regulation (EC)  765/2008, makes it possible the CAB to be a certification body, or an inspection body, or a laboratory, with  the requirement that the CAB must be accredited for its competences to assess QTSP/QTS against all  requirements of eIDAS. It is worth emphasising that the final decision is in the hands of the SB. The latter  may rely upon the information provided by the (Q)TSP and in particular the CAR but it is equally entitled to  request further information and it may take duly justified decision (e.g. applying good principle of  administration and principle of proportionality) that goes against the conformity assessment report.  It is worth stressing as well that the annual surveillance audit that may be a requirement coming from the  accreditation/certification scheme under which CAB is accredited and (Q)TSP/(Q)TS are audited (e.g. §7.9  of ISO 17065 and EN 319 403) is not a requirement from the eIDAS Regulation. Neither is the requirement  for a continued assessment by the CAB. Those continued assessments and annual surveillance audits are  no substitution of ex post supervisory activities of supervisory bodies.  Is the lack of implementing acts adopted pursuant to Art.20.4 of the eIDAS  Regulation an issue?  It should be noted that the implementing acts foreseen in Art.20.4 are not mandatory but optional. There  is no obligation for the EC to establish such acts. The provisions of the eIDAS Regulation are supposed self- sufficient in order to ensure the applicability of the legal framework. As for all optional implementing act,  those Art.20.4 acts are deemed related to non-essential elements of the Regulation that are not  substantial for the Regulation to work. The need to adopt them must be assessed on a case-by-case basis  in the light of several principles including:  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  62   The eIDAS framework consistency: in the present case adopting Art.20.4 implementing acts would  require to ensure its consistency with other implementing acts granting QTSPs/QTSs with a  presumption of compliance with some legal provisions.   Taking into account stakeholders/market needs: evaluating stakeholders/market's demands and  needs, potential barriers hampering the adoption and take-up of eIDAS.   Favouring a non-regulatory approach, a co-regulatory approach, and a development under other  regulatory frameworks: In this case, as the implementation of an eIDAS accreditation scheme may  be ensured under the framework of Regulation 765/2008/EC, as being set up by EA, the  implementing act foreseen in Art.20.4 may not be needed. Furthermore, adopting a secondary act  means codifying a given technological approach that may quickly become obsolete, requiring a  revision of the adopted act.   Availability and adequacy of standards: Before being able to reference a standard, such a  standard must be available. However, the availability of a given standard or technical specifications  does not automatically entail an obligation for the Commission to list it in an implementing act.  Moreover, once standards become available, it is critical to assess their compliance with the  requirements set in the Regulation before considering a possible reference in secondary acts. Such  a referencing will also be scrutinized in the light of the other principles above.  Art.20.4 only allows the EC to reference standards for the accreditation of CABs under eIDAS, for the CAR  resulting from the audit confirming that the QTSP/QTS fulfil the eIDAS requirements and for the auditing  rules under which CABs will carry out their conformity assessment of the QTSP/QTS. It does not empower  the EC to specify the requirements related to these topics. In particular, the referencing of the ETSI EA  promoted scheme would provide that QTSP/QTS audit criteria (“third layer of the scheme”) to be  standardised in such a way that:   The resulting CAR issued by accredited CABs aims to confirm that the qualified trust service  providers and the qualified trust services provided by them fulfil the requirements laid down in the  eIDAS Regulation.   It consists of one or more separate standards, “outcome based” (see 4.4.1), mapping audit criteria  built as control objectives and controls, against the requirements of the Regulation per type of  qualified trust service. Those criteria shall be used by accredited CABs as a basis for establishing  the conformity assessment report to be issued by them, confirming that the QTSP/QTS they assess  fulfil all applicable requirements of the Regulation.  Those criteria defined in an “outcome based” approach could leverage once assessed as conform  to the eIDAS Regulation, on the check lists specified by or in the context of relevant available  standards (e.g. the check list from ETSI EN 319 411-2 with regards to QTSPs issuing qualified  certificates); it should however be clear that those criteria are for use by CABs as a method to  produce a conformity assessment report on the conformity of the audited QTSPs/QTSs and shall  not presuppose or require QTSPs/QTSs to comply with the standards from which they are derived.  QTSPs/QTSs are free to implement such standards, any other standard or no standard at all.  Current CEN/ETSI standards addressing QTSP and QTS related specifications, including the ETSI EN  319 4x1 series and any other relevant standards, can be used by TSPs on a voluntary basis but  cannot be made (de facto) a mandatory requirement for being granted a qualified status.   Whenever compliance with part of the applicable eIDAS requirements would be deemed satisfied  by compliance with a sub-referenced standard, this would be acknowledged provided the  Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services  December 2017  63  conformity with such a sub-referenced standard has been assessed and confirmed by an eIDAS  accredited CABs.  Currently no such QTSPs/QTSs audit criteria outcome based standard conformity exists and no other  conformity assessment scheme owner has undertaken the standardisation of a competing eIDAS compliant  scheme. It would be recommended that once a sufficient maturity in the effective criteria used to accredit  CABs either defined by CABs themselves, by SBs or by any other competent body, the European  Commission could ask CEN/ETSI to leverage on that experience to derive an appropriate standard.  This does not prevent the eIDAS CAB accreditation scheme and corresponding conformity assessment  schemes to be used for accreditation of CABs against specific set of TSP oriented standards so that  QTSPs/QTSs can benefit from confirmation (e.g. certification) of conformity against any of such specific  standards. Such schemes may also be used to additionally confirm (e.g. certify) compliance with standards  for use out of the context of the eIDAS Regulation (e.g. CA/Browser Forum and its associated industry) but  also for attesting compliance with standards possibly referenced in the future in (optional) eIDAS  secondary legislation.

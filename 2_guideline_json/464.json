By ratifying a definite number of obligations across the EU, the Directive will help ensure a con- sistent approach to cybersecurity “with a view to achieving a high common level of security of networks and  information systems within the Union so as to improve the functioning of the internal market”. The main  points of the NIS Directive can be summarised as follows: improved cybersecurity capabilities at national  level, increased EU-level cooperation, security measures and incident reporting obligations for Operators  of Essential Services (OES) and Digital Service Providers (DSP). The scope of this study is limited to relevant  provisions of the NIS Directive on Digital Service Providers (DSPs) and their current activities in this field.  According to one of the provisions of the NISD, Member States must ensure that DSPs notify the competent  authority without undue delay of any incident having a substantial impact on the provision of a service. In  determining the “substantial impact”, the Directive mentions just five indicators to be used without provid- ing other details.  As the Directive provides only a sketchy description of the incident notification concepts and the overall  process, the main goal of this document is to develop a set of guidelines for all concerned stakeholders (EU  level authorities, public, private), aimed at supporting the implementation of the NIS Directive requirements  regarding mandatory incident notification for Digital Service Providers.  A useful description of the roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders involved is provided. From DSPs to  EU level bodies involved, each part plays an important role in securing EU’s cyber future. National authorities  are responsible for managing the process at their level, while the Cooperation Group is established as a body  that will support and facilitate strategic cooperation and the exchange of information among Member  States. The interaction between involved bodies becomes crucial as the information flow regarding incidents  must be properly assured throughout EU.  Establishing a clear view of the incident notification process, is a must for a proper implementation. Such a  view, compiled from all requirements of the Directive, is included in this document. Certain aspects such as  the main EU establishment of an DSP, cross border cooperation, the public awareness about incidents, rela- tionship with law-enforcement are all explained. For a better understanding, the possible place occupied by  the mandatory incident notification process within the generic incident management practices is explained.  Knowing what incidents have to be reported is equally important in the reporting process. As the Directive  provides only some theoretical concepts that must be followed when reporting incidents, the current guide- lines give an exhaustive description of the incident types covered by the NISD.  Further on, clarifications on the parameters that must be used when notifying are also important in the  reporting process. The notions provided by the Directive are supplemented with technical interpretations  and tips on how to apply them. A simple notion as “number of users” can raise multiple issues when trying  to apply it to search engines or cloud providers.  Although at first sight we might consider the incident reporting topic as straightforward and easy-going, the  current study has uncovered serious issues that must be addressed while implementing the DSP incident  reporting provisions of the NISD. The multitude of technical approaches mirrored the numerous discrepan- cies between types of DSPs and the corresponding business models adopted, thus creating a deep pool of  sometimes incompatible variables that must be taken into account when approaching such a regulation. For  example, a simple parameter imposed by the Directive, such as “number of users”, can mean different things  to different types of providers, from simple visitors or registered individuals to corporate users and depend- ant services.  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  05  EU’s first DSP incident notification requirements as part of the first EU wide set of rules on cyber-security  are a major step forward towards achieving a common level of cyber-security across the Union. In a perpet- ually fluctuating technological landscape that affects our livelihoods while having increasing economic and  societal impact as a whole, a first step, in understanding the real threats and vulnerabilities that we have to  confront, has been taken through the adoption of the NISD along with its two main requirements: mandatory  incident notification and minimum security measures. From now on, a “small steps” approach must be ap- plied in implementing the Directive, that has to undergo periodic reviews and updates.  This document provides preliminary guidelines on how incident notification provisions for DSPs could be  effectively implemented across the EU. Based on valuable input from Member States and companies directly  impacted by the Directive, this guideline arises from their good practices in matters such as identifying types  of incidents, parameters and thresholds. The overall result is an outline technical proposal that can tenta- tively be used in the implementation process.  At the same time, this guideline serves as a technical input to the foregoing process of adopting the imple- menting act that will further specify details regarding the incident notification provisions of the NISD.  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  06  1. Introduction  Goal and Objectives  The main goal of this document is to develop a set of guidelines for all concerned stakeholders (EU level  authorities, public, private), aimed at supporting the implementation of the NIS Directive (hereafter referred  to as “the Directive” or “NISD”) requirements regarding mandatory incident notification. The scope of this  study is limited to relevant provisions of the NIS Directive on Digital Service Providers (DSPs) and their cur- rent activities in this field.  Target audience  The target audience of this work is as follows:   EU Commission, as this document will serve as a technical input to the process of defining the imple- menting act following up the Directive.   Relevant EU national authorities, as this document can provide guidelines and good practices for imple- menting the NISD provisions at national level.   Digital Service Providers (DSPs), as this document can provide guidelines and good practices on properly  implementing the NISD provisions at provider level.  Methodology  The underlying study presented in this report involved a three-tiered methodology, thus consisting of a pri- mary desktop research reviewing the relevant literature, a subsequent online questionnaire-based infor- mation-gathering tier that included DSPs and national authorities as interviewees, and a final set of in-depth  interviews to address more nuanced and detailed issues that could not have been captured in the survey.  The approach aimed to collect all the available information regarding the practices employed by EU national  agencies and DSPs in their capacity of incident management and response actors as well as their views on  how incident notification could be implemented efficiently in the context of the provisions prescribed by the  NISD. This approach facilitated the structuring of a basic documentation that was later adjusted within the  context of the NIS Directive (NISD) and based on previous ENISA expertise in the area on incident reporting.  Number of participants member  states  22  Number of participants DSPs 20  Additional documentation used  ENISA work within the areas:  - Incident reporting for telecom sector (Art. 13a).  - Incident reporting for trust services providers (Art. 19 eIDAS).  NOTE: ENISA generally employs in-depth QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS (deep dive) to describe, in detail, specific  situation using policy analysis tools such as interviews, surveys and desktop research and provide insights  into the problem or helps to develop ideas or hypotheses for potential quantitative research. ENISA is not  a research agency and does not engage in extensive statistical analyses. ENISA is a technical advisory  agency to the European Commission and to the EU Member States and, in this capacity, uses the simplest  appropriate methods to measure variables that are conclusive for the decision making process and for pol-  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/for-telcos https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/for-trust-providers  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  07  icy implementation. Therefore, the agency’s focus is not that the samples used ought to be statistically sig- nificant but that the policy process involves all relevant stakeholders and that the consultation process is  comprehensive and thorough. Policymaking and policy implementation generally involve a constant bar- gaining process between decision makers and policy implementers, and here is where ENISA engages in  enhancing the constructive dialogue and clarifying technicalities in order to increase the chances of  smooth implementation and achievement of policy goals.

General information about the NISD  Background of the NISD  2.1.1 Short history  The current approach to CIIP and resilience within the EU has its roots in the Commission Communication of  2009 entitled ‘Protecting Europe from large-scale cyber-attacks and disruptions: enhancing preparedness,  security and resilience ‘1, together with a number of accompanying policy documents that essentially built  up and further refined this approach.234  Subsequently, in 2013, the Commission released the Cybersecurity Strategy of the EU5, which laid out a  number of fundamental principles underlying the EU approach to cybersecurity followed by 5 strategic pri- orities. The proposal for the NIS Directive was thus made under the first strategic priority ‘Achieving Cyber  resilience’.  From 2013 through to 2015, the Commission, the Parliament and the Council, in the framework of the EU  legislative process, discussed the Directive intensely. Consequently, the European institutions reached an  informal political agreement on the NIS Directive on December 7, 2015. Member States (the Committee of  Permanent Representatives (COREPER)) endorsed this agreement on December 18. On January 14, the Eu- ropean Parliament’s IMCO committee voted in favour of the NIS Directive (34-2).  The Directive entered into force in August 2016, and the Member States must transpose it to national legis-  lation by May 9, 2018.  2.1.2 Overview  The NIS Directive is the first piece of EU legislation specifically aimed at improving cybersecurity throughout  the Union. This in itself represents a very significant step in the approach to securing EU information systems.  By ratifying a definite number of obligations across the EU, the Directive will help ensure a consistent ap- proach to cybersecurity ‘with a view to achieving a high common level of security of networks and infor- mation systems within the Union so as to improve the functioning of the internal market’.  The main points of the NIS Directive can be summarised as follows:   Improved cybersecurity capabilities at national level: Each Member State should take actions in the follow- ing areas:  o Adopt a national strategy on the security of network and information systems defining the strategic  objectives and appropriate policy and regulatory measures.  o Designate one or more national competent authorities for the NIS Directive and a national single point  of contact, to monitor the application of the Directive at national level.  1 Commission Communication of March 2009, “Protecting Europe from large-scale cyber-attacks and disruptions: en- hancing preparedness, security and resilience”, COM (2009)149.  2  \"Achievements and next steps: towards global cyber-security\" adopted on 31 March 2011 and the Council  Conclusion on CIIP of May 2011 ( http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/11/st10/st10299.en11.pdf )  3 Council resolution of 18 December, 2009 ‘On a collaborative approach to network and information security (2009/C  321 01)  4 Council Conclusion on CIIP of May 2011 ( http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/11/st10/st10299.en11.pdf )  5 Joint Communication on the Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace, available at:  http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/11/st10/st10299.en11.pdf http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/11/st10/st10299.en11.pdf http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  09  o Designate one or more Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) for comprehensive inci- dent management nationwide.   Increased EU-level cooperation:  o Establishes an EU level Cooperation Group, to support and facilitate strategic cooperation and the ex-  change of information among Member States and to develop trust and confidence.  o Establishes an EU level network of the national CSIRTs and CERT-EU, in order to contribute to the de-  velopment of confidence and trust between the Member States and to promote swift and effective  operational cooperation. ENISA will provide the secretariat of the group.   Security measures and incident reporting obligations for operators of essential services and digital service  providers:  o Identified operators of essential services (OESs) and digital service providers (DSPs) will have to take  appropriate security measures and to notify serious incidents to the relevant national authority.  Fig. 1 - Graphical overview of the NIS Directive.  2.1.3 The light-touch approach  In light of the NISD provisions, it is considered that the operators of essential services (OES) are critical for  the proper functioning of the internal market. On the other hand, DSPs, as first hand providers for the OES,  should have lighter provisions in place, i.e. not as strict as the OES. To this extent, a light-touch approach is  deemed appropriate for DSPs.  Although recital 60 of the NISD introduces the concept of light-touch approach and reactive ex-post super- visory activities, the notions were not perceived by the community as being sufficiently explained, leaving  plenty of room for interpretation. Amongst the related references, we could mention “competent authority  concerned should therefore only take action when provided with evidence […] that a digital service provider  is not complying with the requirements of this Directive, in particular following the occurrence of an incident.  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  10  The competent authority should therefore have no general obligation to supervise digital service provid- ers”6.  However, applying a light touch approach should not prevent a specific authority from being fully able to  exercise its supervision authority upon a DSP, should the case require it. For example, applying fewer provi- sions for DSPs as compared to OES might not be beneficial if certain limits are exceeded. Overall, securing  the unabridged chain of services that support the internal market should be the top priority when imple- menting the NISD.  In this respect, the light-touch approach aims at avoiding overburdening the DSPs while not hampering the  capacity of the EU to react to cybersecurity incidents in a swift and efficient manner. Therefore, there are  reasons to be concerned that a significant lowering in the requirements of incident notification (types of  incidents, parameters to be used) could result in hindering the capacity (at EU or national level) to follow up  on specific incidents threatening the functioning of the internal market at various levels. For instance, a  hostile attack (or even a malfunction) that affects a financial system by means of a number of anomalies  produced at the level of a specific cloud service provider (that provides services to the financial system)  might not be appropriately comprehended if not all accountable entities went by the same incident report- ing policies. The financial entity would then report issues related to the could provider, but the reporting  system would not allow a clear and full understanding of the overall causes that led to damages to the in- ternal market.  The prevalent understanding of the ‘light-touch’ approach is as follows:   Member States are not allowed to impose any further security or notification requirements on digital  service providers, besides the ones foreseen in the directive (Art. 16 (10) ).   Jurisdiction is based on the criteria of main establishment of a DSP within only one Member State, mean- ing that it has to comply only with the national rules of one MS.  (art. 18). If the DSP does not have an  establishment within EU, it can choose one Member State.   Only ex-post supervision is allowed from the competent authority (art. 17 (1) ), when provided with  evidence that a digital service provider does not meet the requirements laid down in Article 16. There is  no general obligation to supervise digital service providers on a regular basis.   The minimum security requirements for DSPs should be lighter than those of the OES, and they should  remain free to take the measures that they deem appropriate.  This interpretation of the light-touch approach was presented by Commission’s representatives, during  ENISA’s Network and Information Security Workshop in Bratislava, 17-18.10.2016.  Stakeholders involved  The DSPs incident notification process, as described by the NISD, exposes a number of stakeholders involved.  This subchapter identifies them, for a better understanding of their role.  2.2.1 Digital service providers (DSPs)  A “digital service” is defined by the Directive (EU) 2015/1535 as “any service normally provided for remu- neration, at a distance, by electronic means and at the individual request of a recipient of services”7. None- theless, for the scope of the NISD, DSPs are limited to only three types of services: cloud, online market  places and search engines.  Their inclusion within the NISD is not purposeless as the aim of the directive is to “achieve a high common  level of security of network and information systems within EU, so as to improve the functioning of the  6 NIS Directive, Recital 60.  7 point (b) of Article 1(1) of Directive (EU) 2015/1535.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/network-and-information-security-workshop/network-and-information-security-workshop  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  11  internal market”. Given that most of these systems are privately operated, their inclusion in the provisions  of the NISD was more than necessary. As they are the owners or administrators of the underlying systems  of what we currently name Internet or Digital Society, it is reasonable to believe that they have to play an  important role in assuring the cyber-security of our digital market and they will be the first ones having to  adopt measures. Recitals 35 and 44 of the NISD provide some insights in this respect.  Baseline security measures and mandatory incident notification will be applied to DSPs within the context  of the NIS Directive. Further explanations on DSPs and their services can be found in section 2.2.1.  Digital Service Providers (DSPs) as for the purpose of the Directive are providers of the following three types  of digital services: online marketplace, online search engine, cloud-computing service. The main technical  characteristics of a digital service, as defined by Directive (EU) 2015/1535 are the following:  - Offered at a distance.  - Offered by electronic means.  - Offered at the individual request of the recipient of services.  These three particular types of DSPs were selected for regulation through the NISD due to their importance  (or, better said, criticality) for the smooth functioning of many EU businesses (internal market). As men- tioned by recital 48 of the Directive “a disruption of such a digital service could prevent the provision of other  services which rely on it, and could, thus have an impact on key economic and societal activities in the Union.  Such digital services might therefore be of crucial importance for the smooth functioning of businesses that  depend on them and, moreover, for the participation of such businesses in the internal market and cross-  border trade across the Union”.  To conclude, the three types of services were chosen to be regulated due  to the increasing number of businesses carried on in the Union that fundamentally rely on them for the  provision of their own services.  Given their cross-border nature, recital 57 states that Member States should not proceed with any identifi- cation of the DSPs as the directive will apply to all providers in scope. Yet, the directive refers chiefly to their  legal identification, which should be carried out through the Directive itself or its subsequent implementing  acts. Nonetheless, the technical identification and classification is a necessity for every national authority,  so that cases where DSPs evade the provisions of the Directive (because of improper identification) can be  avoided.  The identification is a critical issue due to the cross-border nature of the providers. One provider can operate  within many Member States but with only one main establishment within the Union, as explained by recital  64. In such cases, the national authority supervising the main establishment is responsible for overseeing  the activities of the particular DSPs and the services provided in the EU.  Given the light touch approach for DSPs, micro and small businesses will be excluded from implementing  the NISD. Governmental services (i.e. cloud) are also excluded from the NISD.  The following subchapters represent a non-binding technical description that aims at supporting national  authorities in properly identifying, from a technical point of view, the DSPs and their provisioned services, in  the specific context of the NISD.  2.2.1.1 Online market places  Recital 15 and art. 4. (17) of the NISD try to shape a definition of online market places meaning services that  “allow consumers and traders to conclude online sales or service contracts with traders, and is the final  destination for the conclusion of those contracts”. Intermediaries and price comparison services are ex- cluded from this definition, leaving only platforms where the actual online shopping can be concluded. There  are no special provisions as to what can be sold through online market places, so it applies to all types of  contracts (products and services). Although from a technical perspective most online marketplaces use a  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  12  website or web related technologies for delivering their services, it should not be a restriction in this sense,  as mobile application stores make use of other technologies also.  The technical identification of online market places should not be an issue, as all necessary details are pro- vided by the regulation itself.  Below you can find a series of example lists of online marketplaces. These lists are not exhaustive and are  only provided for illustrative purposes, and should not, by any means, be taken as exhaustive when imple- menting the NISD.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mobile_software_distribution_platforms   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_online_marketplaces   http://myappmag.com/online-shopping-websites/   http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/the-uk-s-top-100-shopping-websites-603428  2.2.1.2 Search engines  Recital 16 together with art. 4 (18) provide a comprehensive definition of search engines: “a digital service  that allows users to perform searches of, in principle, all websites or websites in a particular language on the  basis of a query on any subject in the form of a keyword, phrase or other input, and returns links in which  information related to the requested content can be found”. It is also very clearly mentioned that search  functionalities limited to in-site search and price comparison websites should not be considered search en- gines.  Therefore, the technical identification of search engines is not considered problematic.  The link below provides a sample list of search engines. The list is not exhaustive and only for illustrative  purposes, and should not be taken as exhaustive when implementing the NISD:   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_search_engines  2.2.1.3 Cloud computing services  Recital 17 and art. 4 (19) provide a clear and straightforward theoretical definition of cloud computing.  The cloud computing is a particular type of computing service that uses shared resources in order to process  data on-demand. Through the shared resources, we hereby refer to any kind of hardware or software com- ponents (e.g. networks, servers or other infrastructure, storage, applications and services) that are released  on-demand to users for processing data. The NISD mentions three properties that a cloud computing service  must display in order to be technically identified as a cloud service:   shareable computing resources: computing resources that are provided to multiple users who share  a common access to the service, but where the processing is carried out separately for each user,  although the service is provided from the same electronic equipment. In a nutshell, when many users  are utilizing the same physical infrastructure for processing data the first property is met.   scalable resources: computing resources that are flexibly allocated by the cloud service provider,  irrespective of the geographical location of the resources, in order to handle fluctuations in demand.  This means that the pool of resources used by the provider can be extended or reduced at any time,  depending on the user requirements. Thus, data centres or single components within one data cen- tre could possibly be added or removed if the total amount of computing or storage capacity needs  an update.   elastic pool of resources: computing resources that are provisioned and released according to de- mand in order to rapidly increase and decrease resources available, depending on workload. A more  straightforward definition could be: “the  degree  to  which  a  system  is  able  to adapt to workload  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mobile_software_distribution_platforms https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_online_marketplaces http://myappmag.com/online-shopping-websites/ http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/the-uk-s-top-100-shopping-websites-603428 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_search_engines  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  13  changes by provisioning and de-provisioning  resources  in  an  autonomic  manner, such  that  at  each  point  in  time  the  available  resources match the current demand as closely as possible”8.  ENISA has been covering the cloud area for several years now9. Comprehensive guidelines on specific topics  within the cloud area can be found here. Seemingly, one useful guideline on the basics of cloud computing  can be found here.  Fig. 2 – Service models and assets in cloud computing  One provider can apply three classic cloud service models10, as listed below. Since the NISD did not exclude  any of the three, the provisions will be applicable to each type of service model.   Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): the provider delivers computing resources (virtual hardware), ac- cessible online. There are two types of resources: processing power (including network resources),  and (block) storage (memory resources). In this model, the user usually has access to components  such as virtual machines, physical servers, storage, load balancers, network equipment etc. Exam- ples include Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud, Google’s Compute Engine, Amazon Simple Storage  Service, Rackspace etc.  An indicative list of IaaS providers in the EU can be found here.   Platform as a Service (PaaS): the provider delivers a platform, or more precisely, servers, for cus- tomers to run applications on. PaaS providers sometimes offer a software development tool for the  platform. Examples of applications running on these platforms are scripts (PHP, Python, e.g.) or byte  code (Java servlets, C#). In this model, the user usually has access to components such as web serv- ers, application servers, development tools, databases etc. Examples include Google App engine,  Microsoft Azure, Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, etc.  8 Nikolas Roman Herbst, Samuel Kounev, Ralf Reussner, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, “Elasticity in Cloud Compu- ting: What It Is, and What It Is Not”, available at: https://sdqweb.ipd.kit.edu/publications/pdfs/HeKoRe2013-ICAC- Elasticity.pdf  9 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cloud-and-big-data/cloud-security  10 ENISA, Could Security Guide for SMEs, available at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-security- guide-for-smes  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cloud-and-big-data/cloud-security https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-security-guide-for-smes https://www.channele2e.com/2016/03/10/top-10-european-cloud-services-providers-csps-for-iaas-list/ https://sdqweb.ipd.kit.edu/publications/pdfs/HeKoRe2013-ICAC-Elasticity.pdf https://sdqweb.ipd.kit.edu/publications/pdfs/HeKoRe2013-ICAC-Elasticity.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-security-guide-for-smes https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-security-guide-for-smes  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  14  An indicative list of PaaS providers in the EU can be found here.   Software as a Service (SaaS): the provider delivers full-fledged software or applications, via the in- ternet. Applications range from email, document editors, customer relationship management (CRM)  systems, virtual desktops, games and so on. SaaS can often be accessed with a browser or a web  services client. Duly note should be taken that it is quite common for SaaS providers to run their  applications on an IaaS or PaaS from another provider. An example is the video streaming site Netflix  (SaaS) which runs on Amazon AWS computing services (PaaS/IaaS).  There are also several classic cloud deployment models. Although the technical architectures are similar  (even identical in some cases) the business model applied provides the following classification:   Public cloud: Typical cloud open to the public (individuals and companies), generally accessible from  the Internet.   Private cloud: a cloud operated for a single organisation. Typical for large organisations that want  to remove some privacy or other security related concerns that characterize public clouds.   Hybrid cloud: A mixture between public and private (e.g. private cloud making use of several func- tionalities offered by a public cloud).   Community cloud: cloud used by several stakeholders/organisations (e.g. within the same industry).  The NISD does not differentiate the various deployment models, but considering the definition of the digital  service (see 2.2.1) we can sensibly conclude that the Directive aims at regulating mainly the public clouds.  Nevertheless, depending on particular circumstances, hybrid and community clouds can also be included in  the NISD provisions.  2.2.2 National authorities  As main responsible for driving, improving and securing the digital market, national governments are also  considered key stakeholders in assuring the security of network and information services. They are account- able for developing the legal and institutional framework capable of managing the security of their national  digital market. Thus, from identifying the key players and current threats to imposing minimum security  measures and mandatory incident notification requirements, their overall role is to ensure that the level  playing field (in terms of cyber-security) at the national level is achieved.  Moreover, national authorities are all governmental bodies operating at national level that are responsible  for the implementation and monitoring of the NIS directive. Consequently, according to the directive, each  Member State shall assign at least three roles relevant for network and information security. These roles are  as follows:   Single point of contact: each Member State shall designate a national single point of contact on the  security of network and information systems that shall exercise a liaison function to ensure cross– border cooperation with the relevant authorities in other Member States and with other EU level  bodies. Member States may assign this role to an already existing authority. Where a Member State  will designate only one competent authority, that competent authority shall also be the single point  of contact.   National CSIRT: Each Member State must designate one or more CSIRTs, which shall comply with  the requirements set out in point (1) of Annex I to the Directive, covering at least the sectors referred  to within the directive (shown in Fig. 1).   National competent authorities: in order to cover all requirements of the NISD, all Member States  must designate one or more national competent authorities on the security of network and infor- mation systems covering at least the sectors referred to in Annex II and the services referred to in  Annex III. Countries can decide for nominating just one authority covering all sectors and services  described in the NISD, or many covering specific areas/sectors/services.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service#Providers  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  15  Therefore, as inferred from the text of the Directive, several configurations are possible. Member States can  have only one body covering all requirements (it must be a national CSIRT, a single point of contact and cover  all sectors), two or more bodies, splitting the roles amongst each other.  2.2.3 Cooperation group  As defined within the Directive, the role of the Cooperation Group (CG) is to support and facilitate strategic  cooperation and the exchange of information among Member States and to develop trust and confidence.  As cross-border cooperation is a key factor in achieving an EU wide high common level of security of net- works and information systems, the existence of this group is a real necessity.  The CG shall be composed of Member States representatives, the EU Commission and ENISA. The Commis- sion shall provide the Secretariat. Where appropriate, the Cooperation Group may invite representatives of  the relevant stakeholders to participate to its works.  Among the tasks that fall within the CG’s competencies are:   Provide strategic guidance for the activities of the CSIRT network.   Exchange best practices on topics related to: capacity building, incident notification, security  measures, awareness raising, training, R&D.   Discuss capabilities and preparedness of Member States.   On a voluntary basis, evaluate national strategies on the security of network and information sys- tems and the effectiveness of CSIRTs.   Collect and examine, on an annual basis, the incident summary reports sent by Member States.   -   Discuss about standardization issues with representatives from the relevant European Standardiza- tion Organizations.   Exchanging best practice with regard to the identification of operators of essential services by the  Member States, with ENISA’s assistance.  2.2.4 CSIRTs Network  The work undergone at the strategic level by the CG is to be complemented by a technical/operational part  developed by the CSIRTs network. The official role of the CSIRTs network is to contribute to the development  of confidence and trust between the Member States and to promote effective operational cooperation.  The CSIRTs network is composed of representatives from Member States’ national CSIRTs, ENISA and CERT– EU. ENISA will provide the secretariat of the group and the Commission can take part in the network as an  observer.  Among the tasks that fall within the CSIRTs Network’s competencies are:   Exchange information on services, operations and cooperation capabilities.   Exchange and discussing information related to incidents and associated risks (on request, on a  voluntary basis).   Identify a coordinated response to an incident (on request).   Providing MS support in addressing cross–border incidents (on a voluntary basis).   Issue guidelines concerning operational cooperation.   Discuss, explore and identify further forms of operational cooperation (risks and incidents, early  warnings, mutual assistance, coordination).   Discuss the capabilities and preparedness of certain CSIRTs (on request from that CSIRT).  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  16  2.2.5 ENISA  With more than 10 years of experience in dealing with cyber-security issues across EU, ENISA has touched  upon almost all areas and sectors regulated through the NISD. Because of the work it has carried out in the  past, ENISA is ideally positioned to assist the Member States in implementing the NIS Directive once it is  adopted. The role of ENISA is to assist all stakeholders in implementing the NISD.  2.2.6 European Commission  The European Commission is the executive body of the European Union and it represents the interests of all  EU Member States. One of its main roles is to put forward legislation, which is then adopted by the co- legislators, the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers, as in the case of the NISD.  Digital Society, Trust and Cybersecurity within is one of the areas where the Commission (DG CONNECT) has  an active role, through the NISD but also through other legislative acts.  Through the NISD, the Commission will assure the secretariat of the Cooperation Group and will follow up  on the effective implementation of the new regulation across EU. It will also have to adopt the secondary  level legislation, meaning the implementing acts necessary to assure the uniform implementation of the  directive across EU.  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  17  3. Incident notification process for DSPs  The NISD incident notification provisions for DSPs  The incident notification requirements for DSPs are defined within Art. 16, (4) to (9). The incident notification  process should be in line with the following requirements:   Member States must ensure that DSPs notify the competent authority without undue delay of any  incident having a substantial impact on the provision of a service. The notification must include all  information necessary so that the national authority can determine the significance and any cross- border impact. Although not directly specified within the NISD it is reasonable to take into account  a two-step notification process: one immediate with a small amount of information and one with  full details, at a later stage.   By reason of the light touch approach that has to be followed when implementing the Directive, the  DSPs will have to comply only with the regulation within one Member State, the one where the main  establishment is located. In this way, a certain level of harmonisation ought to be achieved as pro- viders will have to relate to only one authority and one set of rules across EU.   In determining the “substantial impact” incidents, the following indicators will be used: the number  of users affected by the incident (with a focus on the ones relying on the service for the provision of  their own services); (b) the duration of the incident; (c) the geographical spread with regard to the  area affected by the incident; (d) the extent of the disruption of the functioning of the service; (e)  the extent of the impact on economic and societal activities. It is understandable that the provider  must have access to all this information, so that the reporting can be done properly.   Significant incidents affecting OES networks and systems caused by incidents affecting DSPs’ infra- structures are theoretically considered distinct incidents, therefore the reporting activities should  also be distinct.   If one incident concerns two or more Member States, the responsible authority shall inform the  authorities within the other Member States. Moreover, although not specifically mentioned within  the NISD, the communication should take place only through the national authorities or national  CSIRTs.   The public should be informed about individual incidents by the national authorities or by the pro- vider, in case “public awareness is necessary in order to prevent an incident or to deal with an on- going incident, or where disclosure of the incident is otherwise in the public interest”11.   The single points of contact should submit an annual incident summary report to the Cooperation  Group (CG). The report should contain the number of notifications, their nature and actions taken  (Art. 10 (3) ).   The Commission will further specify applicable parameters and thresholds though implementing  acts. Formats and procedures relevant for notification requirements could also be further specified  through implementing acts, if necessary.   Any incidents related to criminal activities should be reported to law enforcement authorities, as  encouraged by recital 62 of the NISD. “Where appropriate, it is desirable that coordination between  competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of different Member States be facilitated  by the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) and ENISA”12.   Given the light touch approach for DSPs, micro and small DSPs will be excluded from implementing  the incident notification provisions. Governmental services (i.e. cloud) are also excluded.  11 Art. 16 (7), NISD.  12 NISD, Recital 62  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  18  Fig. 3  -  The overall incident notification process at EU level  3.1.1 Incident notification as part of the overall incident management process  Information security incident management is defined by ISO/IEC 27000:2016 as “processes for detecting,  reporting, assessing, responding to, dealing with, and learning from information security incidents”. The  importance of the topic is also thoroughly acknowledged through another specific standard ISO/IEC 27035,  totally dedicated to information security incident management. In fact, 65% of the DSPs that responded to  our stock-taking exercise declared using at least one of the two standards in their internal incident manage- ment activities, with ISO/IEC 27035 being the most common of the two.  According to the ISO/IEC 27035 standard, the incident management process is divided in five phases, as  follows:   Plan and Prepare – policies, plans, procedures, commitment at top management.   Detect and Report – monitor, detect and report.   Assessment and Decision – analysis and decision regarding course of action.   Response – containment, eradication, recovery, resolution, closure.   Lesson Learnt – improvements.  Due note should be taken when deciding where the new reporting activities provisioned in the Directive  should be registered. Although there is a “Detect and report” phase this mostly refers to inside reporting,  i.e. activities undergone within the organisation. Unfortunately, the outside reporting for compliance is  rarely touched by the standards in use.  The incident notification process brought by the NISD is, first of all, mandatory, therefore DSPs have to com- ply with it as a consequence of them operating in the EU. As a consequence, it could work in the standard  as an additional “incident notification for compliance”. On the other hand, reporting in the sense of the  provisions of the Directive, has to be carried out “without undue delay”. Thus, introducing this additional  phase within the overall organisational incident management process might become problematic when  dealing with time constraints.  In these particular cases, incident notification for compliance could constitute  part of the “Detect and Report” phase, the “Assessment and Decision” or “Response” phases, depending on  the internal structure, policies and procedures of a particular organisation.  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  19  Types of incidents covered by the NIS directive  Defining the scope in terms of types of incidents to be covered is difficult as long as terms are not properly  clarified and there is no direct mention in the legislation. In order to help the cybersecurity professional  community to get an accurate response to several issues that might arise during the implementation of the  NISD, various definitions and provisions must be revisited. Therefore, in the following, we will try to summa- rize the basic applicable concepts.  As mentioned by the NISD (Art. 4 - definitions) an incident “means any event having an actual adverse effect  on the security of network and information systems”.  Similarly, article (4) defines the network and information systems, by which we understand interconnected  systems that process, transmit and store data so as to provide a digital service.  Further, security of network and information systems is defined as the “ability of network and information  systems to resist, at a given level of confidence, any action that compromises the availability, authenticity,  integrity or confidentiality of stored or transmitted or processed data or the related services offered by, or  accessible via, those network and information systems”.  On the other hand, adverse effect is a concept not defined within the Directive. Nonetheless, we can con- sider the general sense of the words that is preventing success or development, harmful, unfavourable13.  In addition to the definitions above, a notion that needs clarification is substantial impact, a concept that  clearly marks the starting point of incident reporting activities. The notion is used in Art. 16 (4) that states  that DSPs will have to “notify […] without undue delay […] any incident having a substantial impact on the  provision of a service”. Furthermore, the directive indicates that substantial impact must be determined  based on 5 parameters (explained in next subchapter).  By combining the 5 notions highlighted above one can develop a comprehensive idea on the types of inci- dents that have to be considered within the context of the NISD. An overall definition can be summarised as  follows:  Any incident affecting the availability, authenticity, integrity or confidentiality of data stored, transmit- ted or processed by a digital service provider (DSP) through network and information systems, which  has a substantial impact on the provision of the digital service offered.  For clarity, in the following, we will try to depict various examples and specific types of incidents that we  consider that shall be reported when reaching the critical thresholds.  In case of availability, the interpretation is quite straightforward. If the services provided become unavaila- ble to the customers for a certain period, then the incident should be reported under the provisions of the  Directive.  As an example, we could consider the 2016 Dyn incident. The outcome of this particular attack was that  several DSP services became unavailable worldwide (mostly North America and Europe) due to a DDoS at- tack against a common DNS service provider (Dyn) that was servicing the numerous DSPs affected. Conse- quently, the failing of the Dyn DNS services triggered an outage in the services offered by the DSPs that were  using this particular DSN service in order to provide their own services. Were this kind of incident to happen  in the EU after the transposition of the NISD into national legislation, all affected DSPs should report the  13 https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/adverse  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Dyn_cyberattack https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/adverse  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  20  outage. Meanwhile individual DNS service providers can be identified as operators of essential services (OES)  under the NISD, in this specific situation the biggest blow was felt at the DSP level.  In the case of confidentiality, the situation becomes slightly more complicated mostly because we have  additional regulations in place that can overlap with the NISD (e.g. GDPR). Although we can probably draw  a theoretical line between incidents falling under GDPR and the ones under NISD, the situation might differ  in practice. DSPs might have to report the same incident to both authorities responsible. In theory, GDPR  covers the privacy of personal data and the NISD covers the confidentiality of the service offered and the  underlying data (which in most cases is personal data). The GDPR has no notion of a ‘light touch approach’  as used by the NISD.  A common pattern for incidents affecting confidentiality under the NISD could be the following: a cloud  service provider suffers sudden breaches of the confidentiality of their customer’s data (not necessarily per- sonal data) either during transit or at rest (“man in the middle” type attacks). In this case, continuation of  provision of the service could seriously damage the confidentiality of customer data (e.g. product technical  specifications, commercial secrets, business plans, commercial contracts etc.) leading to serious impact on  their business. Thus, when the confidentiality of services delivered cannot be guaranteed and the critical  threshold has been reached, the incident should be reported. On the other hand, incidents that can be clas- sified as simple data breaches but the proper provision of the service is not affected by the breach, should  not be reported under the NISD.  An example is provided by the 2011 Dropbox bug14 that left all their clients at risk for several hours. The  renowned cloud storage provider generated a confidentiality incident as a consequence of making an update  to its code that supressed the authentication method allowing users to access the data without passwords.  For several hours’ users were able to log on to the platform only with the username. This glitch exposed all  of their customers to an extent that is unknown or was not yet made public.15  Integrity of the service or, better said, client data processed through the service is also a type of issue cov- ered by the NISD. It cannot be considered safe to use a cloud service where the integrity of client data or  service cannot be assured because of a breach, a technical failure or any other issue. Any kind of event that  affects the integrity of client data, if it reaches the critical thresholds to be deemed substantial, has to be  reported. A clear case in point was the 2016 Salesforce incident that led to a complete disruption of services  and a system crash that consequently led to the temporary wipe out of important customer transactions  information. Thus, besides the availability of the service, the integrity of customer data was temporarily  affected during the recovery process.16  Finally, authenticity is defined by ISO IEC 27000:2016 as the “property that an entity is what it claims to be”.  Proving the online identity of an entity is mostly done through digital certificates, meaning that incidents  falling under the “authenticity” classification have to affect, to some extent, the digital certificate used to  prove the digital identity of a particular service. Compromising the digital certificate used by a service can  indeed give birth to several other issues, from man in the middle attacks to the risk that the client might be  deceived towards using a completely different service (forged). Usually, these incidents can also be classified  within other categories. Compromised digital certificates can very well fall within the provisions of the Art.  19 of the eIDAS regulation17, depending on the circumstances.  Note: For the rest of the document, for simplicity, we will refer to availability, confidentiality, integrity or  authenticity, as the 4 properties or protection goals that a digital service must assure under the NISD.  14 https://blogs.dropbox.com/dropbox/2011/06/yesterdays-authentication-bug/  15 Additional resources: here and here.  16 Additional resources:  here and here.  17 https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/content/eidas-regulation-regulation-eu-ndeg9102014  https://blogs.dropbox.com/dropbox/2011/06/yesterdays-authentication-bug/ https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewSolution?urlname=Root-Cause-Message-for-Disruption-of-Service-on-NA14-May-2016&language=en_US https://blogs.dropbox.com/dropbox/2011/06/yesterdays-authentication-bug/ http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/21/dropbox-security-bug-passwords_n_881085.html https://blogs.dropbox.com/dropbox/2011/06/yesterdays-authentication-bug/ http://www.informationweek.com/cloud/platform-as-a-service/salesforce-outage-can-customers-trust-the-cloud/d/d-id/1325499 http://diginomica.com/2016/05/12/customer-data-lost-as-salesforce-us-outage-rumbles-on-with-degraded-performance/ https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/content/eidas-regulation-regulation-eu-ndeg9102014  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  21  Besides the theoretical concepts explained above a standard list of incident types would have been very  helpful in this case. Nevertheless, such a list cannot be either comprehensive and could create more confu- sion at this point. Although some types of incidents might be considered clear enough to be classified as  reportable according to the NISD (e.g. DDoS), as the examples above show us, the interpretation might be  quite difficult in some cases. An incident must fulfil many requirements in terms of parameters, thresholds  and protection goals affected so that it can be categorised as reportable. In this respect a thorough analysis  is recommended case by case.  When asked the opinion of DSPs about types of incidents and their root causes that might fall under the  NISD, they indicated that most of the issues are not necessarily related to cyber-attacks but more to system  failures or human errors. For more details, pls. see charts below.

Parameters used to measure impact of incidents  In order to ensure a high common level of network and information security across all the EU Member States,  the NISD introduces mandatory incident notification obligations, amongst several other requirements. To  this end, mainly art. 16 (3) indicates that “digital service providers notify the competent authority or the  CSIRT without undue delay of any incident having a substantial impact on the provision of a service […]  offered within the Union”. An exact definition of a substantial impact of an incident was not included in the  approved version of the NISD, however a definite list of parameters that must be taken into account when  determining the impact of the incidents are prescribed as follows:   (a) the number of users affected by the incident, in particular users relying on the service for the  provision of their own services;   (b) the duration of the incident;   (c) the geographical spread with regard to the area affected by the incident;   (d) the extent of the disruption of the functioning of the service;   (e) the extent of the impact on economic and societal activities.  As a result of our communication with the community of professionals that will be involved in the imple- mentation of the NISD provisions, we introduce in the following subchapters some explanatory notes on  each of the parameters together with potential ways in which they could be measured.  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80% Hardware/Software failure/bug  Configuration Error  Third party failure  DDoS  Outage  Malware  Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)  Information Corruption  Other  Data breaches  Information Loss  System compromise  Session Hijacking  Rogue certificates  Cable cuts  Industrial Espionage  Natural disasters  Physical damage / theft / loss  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  23  Fig. 6 – Usage of parameters for measuring the impact of incidents (DSP view).  3.3.1 Number of users affected by the incident  Measurement of the number of users reportedly impacted by a cyber-incident is one of the most important  variables in determining its significance. As resulted from the stocktaking we carried out, roughly 85% of the  DSPs that responded to our survey are currently using this parameter for measuring impact.  Although it might seem an easy task at a first glance, counting the affected users is not usually an easy task.  The text of the NISD does not provide extensive details on how this parameter should be measured and,  following our analysis we have taken stock of numerous methods (measuring units) used in practice for  counting the actual users affected by an incident. Driven by a business model approach, the DSPs are using  methodologies that count users such as normal anonymous visitors to corporate users or even other de- pending services (through application programming interfaces - APIs).  In summary, the following measurement units were identified during the analysis:   Corporate subscribers (companies, corporate services) - used by 95% of the respondents; depending  on the services offered it might mean one account used by one client (company) or multiple ac- counts per client (company) used by different individuals.   Non-subscribers (visitors) – used by 60% of the respondents, mostly in the cases where they provide  free services, such as search engines. Non-subscribers are non-registered users that access the ser- vice intermittently. Not too much information is stored regarding this type of user and their exact  number might not be known at a particular point in time (such as in the case of an incident). Gener- ally, estimations are used when needed to identify the number of users at different time intervals.   Reliant services (dependant services) - used by 50% of the respondents to the survey, these are  counts of online services that rely on the use of a particular service offered by a DSP (e.g. an online  market place stored in cloud, an email service stored in cloud, a search engine that uses services  provided by other search engines etc.) In such cases, the real number of end users is usually indefi- nite for the primary provider, and is known only to the depending provider.   Individual subscribers/accounts (persons) – used by 45% of the respondents, these subscribers are  representing individuals that usually use the services for their personal interest (home users, indi- vidual persons).  In most cases, the DSPs have visibility only at the first layer of users benefiting from the rendered service or  any other secondary service based on the initial service, i.e. only the users/clients that have directly accessed  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  100% Duration of the incident  Extent of the disruption  Number of users affected  Geographical spread  Number of users relying on the service  Extent of the impact on economic and societal activities  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  24  the initial services and are considered users by the initial DSP are measured. For example, the users of an  online store that uses cloud infrastructure to provide its services are only known to the online market place  provider. The cloud provider sees just one user/client, the online market place. Below a tentative definition  of users within the NISD:  Users = a person, organization, or other entity that employs a digital service provided by a DSP through  network and information systems.  Within the multitude of user types, the importance/priority of some users over others (therefore priority for  data recovery in case of an incident) is mostly business driven, based on contractual agreements and not  necessarily based on the importance of the user for the society (i.e. governmental services, financial institu- tions, critical infrastructures etc.). In fact, most of the respondents are not even aware if they offer services  to such entities. Roughly 60% of the DSPs involved in the survey mentioned being aware they provided ser- vices to other DSPs, but the percentage got significantly lower when they got asked if they were aware of  providing services to essential service operators.  Fig 7 - Answers to the question: “Which of the following sectors are you aware of using your services in EU countries?”  Based on the type of the DSP, we could identify a significant variation in the methodology for user counts.  For example, cloud service providers were usually more aware of the type and number of users at a partic- ular point in time than search engines were. On the other hand, search engine providers were fully capable  of measuring the dependant services (through APIs) but had difficulties with visitors accessing their services  sporadically.  Considering the findings above together with the NISD provision as by art. 16 (4) stating that “the obligation  to notify an incident shall only apply where the digital service provider has access to the information needed  to assess the impact of an incident […]”, we must point out that the approach to measure the number of  users affected by an incident should be simple and pragmatic, so that DSPs can comply. Asking DSPs to pro- vide information that they cannot obtain or for which they should make considerable efforts to obtain would  eventually backfire and practically exclude them from the incident notification obligations.  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70% Other digital service providers  Banking/Financial  Health Sector  Energy Suppliers (Electricity, Oil, Gas)  Transport (Air, Rail, Water/Maritime)  Digital infrastructure (IXP, DNS, TDL)  Water Supply  Do not know  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  25  3.3.2 Duration of the incident  Duration (time interval) is a parameter considered of utmost importance and used by all of the respondents.  Nonetheless, even for this arguably basic parameter, the survey responses revealed differing practical ap- proaches as to what regards measuring duration and the diverse thresholds applied.  For instance, depending on the incident type, the timer might start from the identification of the breach, or  from the service degradation notice. Finalising the incident might be considered the time where all services  have been fully recovered (time to recover) or the time when the systems were fully disinfected (in case of  malware infections).  In the context of the NISD, since the focus is on the continuity of the service, thus availability and security of  provision (in terms of confidentiality, integrity and authenticity) the duration of the incident should be meas- ured (and consequently reported) as starting from the moment when the provision of the service was af- fected up until the time of full recovery. The reporting should contain the number of minutes (or hours) in  which the service provided was not available or, although it was available, it did not meet the confidentiality,  integrity or authenticity requirements. For the purpose of respecting the reporting provisions of the Di- rective, the general term “downtime” might not be a proper term to use as it refers only to availability. Thus  we propose the use of “NIS downtime” or “NIS impairment time” to describe this particular parameter.  Duration of an incident (NIS downtime) = the period of time when a digital service provided by a DSP is  unavailable or unsecured (confidentiality, integrity or authenticity affected).  3.3.3 Geographical spread  The geographical spread is an equally important piece of information to have in order to determine the level  of impact. In circumstances where multiple countries are affected by one incident, identifying the causes  and finding the best remedies can only be done when a clear picture of the geographical area affected is  obtained.  Surprisingly, for the DSPs, the geographical spread is not necessarily a must but rather a nice to have piece  of data. Only 40% of the respondents declared using this parameter, but the surprise is even bigger when it  comes to how it is measured.  Some providers do use “geographical area affected” as an established parameter to measure impact of inci- dents, but not necessarily in the conventional political way we think of, meaning identifying regions or coun- tries. The intense use of web related technologies has made this task exceedingly difficult. For a DSP that  offers online web access to its services, the identification of the exact countries or geographical areas af- fected might be impossible without the use of estimations based on previous data.  Regions served by a data centre might be used as a reference, or in some cases continental regions, but  these are not limited to EU borders. Although Internet fragmentation18 is a fact nowadays, whether from  technical, commercial or political standpoints, this is not necessarily embraced by DSPs unless there is a  business need in this sense. Thus, the capability of identifying the exact countries affected by a particular  incident was mentioned by only one participant to the survey.  In terms of applicability, the NISD reporting provisions cover only the 28 EU countries and it might apply in  the future to other candidate countries. Needless to say that the DSPs did not build their current technical  architecture based on political criteria, and thus they could face some issues in refining the data for reporting  purposes only.  18 http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_FII_Internet_Fragmentation_An_Overview_2016.pdf  http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_FII_Internet_Fragmentation_An_Overview_2016.pdf  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  26  Therefore, reporting the geographical area affected by an incident might be challenging for most of the DSPs,  especially if they provide services internationally. A simple approach that can be applied by all providers,  operating internationally or nationally, is a must in this case. Consequently, a scale of detailing can be ap- plied, starting from a bottom level where only a yes/no answer can be submitted if the incident has affected  EU regions, and ending with a top detailed level where countries and regions can be specified, if known.  In any case, asking from DSPs information that they cannot obtain might exclude them from the incident  notification obligations.  A tentative definition of the parameter geographical spread, in the context of the Directive is as follows:  Geographical spread = Member States or regions within EU where users were affected  by impairments  (NIS downtime) of the digital service provided by a DSP.  3.3.4 Extent of the disruption of the functioning of the service  The extent of the disruption is a parameter used frequently by DSPs. 95% of the respondents to our stock- taking declared using this parameter.  The extent of the disruption is particularly important because it measures the extent of the damage pro- duced by a particular incident. Not surprisingly, here too DSPs are using a business driven approach, custom- ised depending on the technical particularities of the services provided. The following approaches for meas- uring the extent of the disruption have been identified during the stocktaking:   Percentage of services lost (in case of multiple services);   Percentage of the unavailable infrastructure (servers, datacentres etc.);   Service degradation (delays in response, intermittent access, acceptable degradation, total disrup- tion)  All approaches are correct and could reasonably be applied when providing any kind of service, not neces- sarily the ones that are DSP specific. In addition, as one may notice, the term is mostly used to describe  availability related issues, although the notion of “disturbance” does not necessarily refer to total disrup- tions, but also perturbance of normal operation.  In this respect and considering the NISD context, the notion of disturbance ought to be adjusted. First of all,  the extent of the disruption from an availability standpoint can only cover total disruption of the service or  degradation that makes the service unusable. The percentage of infrastructure unavailable, the delays in  response or any other related parameters cannot be really taken into account unless the users cannot use  the service for a particular period, thus rendering the incident reportable.  Secondly, besides availability the NISD also mentions 3 other protection goals that must be taken into ac- count when assessing the extent of the disruption upon a service: confidentiality, integrity and authenticity.  Each of them can be broken down into different levels of detail but for simplicity, it could result better to  treat them in a binary approach (yes/no). Consequently, if one or more of the protection goals are affected,  and the thresholds are exceeded, incidents should be reported. Nevertheless, sophistication levels can be  applied based on a combination of affected protection goals, from one goal affected for the first level, to 4  goals affected for the last level. A detailed description of this approach in presented in Annex A.  Below is a tentative definition of the parameter, in the context of the Directive:  Extent of the disruption of the functioning of the service = the number of protection goals affected due  to an incident disturbing a digital service offered by a DSP.  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  27  3.3.5 Extent of the impact on economic and societal activities  Among all parameters enacted in the directive, the extent of the impact on economic and societal activities  is the least utilized by the industry. Only 25% of the respondents mentioned measuring such a parameter.  In all reported cases the measurement unit was related to the internal resources spent for fixing the prob- lem. Service credits or amounts deducted from the monthly invoice for the periods of inactivity are men- tioned as conducts of measuring the economic impact upon a particular DSP.  Nevertheless, in the context of the NISD, by impact on economic and societal activities we refer to possible  damages brought to the functioning of the EU internal market, meaning the encompassing markets in the  EU's 28 member states. Individual economic impact on a single DSP might not be relevant in this context.  The summed up individual impact felt by each of the affected users might be a response in this case, but this  type of information is generally unknown to the DSPs.  In this respect, the problem becomes fairly difficult for the DSPs, as they are often unable to determine this  kind of impact. Asking the DSP to collect all this data is probably unreasonable and could require plenty of  additional resources and could ultimately prove impossible to do, as affected parties do not always want to  share such information. On the other hand, asking the government to collect this data appears also unrea- sonable as this might be considered as an intrusive approach. In conclusion, measuring the real impact on  economic and societal activities in this way is an activity that requires many resources and has high proba- bility of failing due to inconsistent or incomplete data.  As compliance must be achieved and in order to avoid excluding DSPs from the incident notification obliga- tions due to the impossibility to obtain the data, a simple yet straightforward approach should be applied.  For example, determining the societal and economic impact based on the recorded effects onto predefined  thresholds of users might be an option. Absolute thresholds (e.g. 1 mil users.) or relative thresholds (per- centages of population) could therefore be used. You can find a detailed proposal on this topic in Annex A.  Below you can find a tentative definition of the parameter, in the context of the Directive:  Extent of the impact on economic and societal activities = the effects produced by a cybersecurity inci- dent at DSP level that, as a result, affected the overall community, disrupting its normal functioning,  generating either economic or social negative consequences.  3.3.6 Other issues related to parameters  During the stocktaking with private sector and public authorities within EU, several concerns were raised  regarding some of the provisions that were considered not sufficiently explained within the text of the di- rective.  One of them is the noticeable distinction on many areas between the different types of DSPs. Although the  NISD does not strike a difference between the three types of DSPs, most of the private respondents have  clearly stated that there should be a rigorous distinction between them due to different factors such as  criticality, technical particularities in use and economic and societal impact. At the same time, the NISD does  not restrict the adoption of subsequent policies that distinguish between the types of DSPs.  Cloud services are considered the most critical out of the three categories due to their obvious potential for  captive consumer patterns. In case of failure, users cannot instantly migrate to another cloud provider.  Obtaining the necessary products and services on time, through online market places, is utterly important,  especially for businesses that rely on this kind of service. Nevertheless, in most of the cases (besides the  ones where exclusivity is offered to certain online market places) the services or products needed can be  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  28  found in similar stores, of course at different prices and maybe different delivery times. However, nowadays  business good practices regarding supply chain security encourage companies as well as consumers to have  at least two alternatives when purchasing certain products or services. Considering this, we may infer that,  to some extent, online market places are not generally as critical as cloud services could be, at least not in  the majority of the cases.  As for the search engines, the situation is considered even less critical, by the providers themselves even.  You can always turn to another provider in case of failure by your favourite search engine. Indeed, it might  be an issue in both cases (online marketplaces and search engines) if some other services are dependent on  particular providers. Overall though, from total dependency to partial dependency, there are several aspects  that the private sector deems important be included in the provisions.  Last, but not least, one issue relates to the possibility of using different reporting formats and procedures  per type of provider. As explained also in the previous subchapters, there are some technical particularities  for each of the three types of providers concerned by the NISD. Not addressing them early on might even- tually prove to be a mistake, as some parameters required by the directive cannot be measured in the same  way for the different providers (e.g. number of users further explained here). It is indeed the expressed  opinion of most of the private sector respondents, along with some Member States respondents, that this  technical concern regarding incident reporting for DSPs should be addressed in the implementing act. To  this end, different measurement units and different thresholds might be applied, based on the DSP type.  The proposal within Annex A takes this requirement into account.  Determining substantial incidents  Art. 16 (3) of the NISD requires DSPs to notify with undue delay “any incident having a substantial impact on  the provision of a service”. Further, paragraph (4) of the same article mentions that in order to determine if  an incident is substantial, a series of parameters must be taken into account. All those parameters have been  explained in section 2.5, but the definition of “substantial impact” lies nowhere within the directive. Like- wise, the use of thresholds is not properly mentioned within the NISD, neither provisioned nor certainly  forbidden. This leaves some room for adaption and customization at national decision-making level, when  building second level legislation or other policies in the field.  However, in order to develop an efficient and useful EU-wide incident reporting policy, one must take into  account the following:   The objective of the NISD is to assure a high common level of network and information security  across EU. Achieving a common level between Member States usually means adopting some sort of  common denominators or, at least, common values to be mutually adopted by all players. This is  particularly important for levelling the security across EU countries and offering the community a  set of reference values to work with.   As stated in recital 49 of the NISD “because of their cross-border nature, digital service providers  should be subject to a more harmonised approach at Union level”. In this respect, the adoption of  implementing acts should facilitate the specification and implementation of such measures in a  more harmonised way. To achieve the harmonisation objective DSPs should first undertake a com- mon minimum set of security measures and the same set of incident notification provisions across  EU, irrespective of the authority governing upon their activity.   Article 16 (4) mentions that, in order to determine substantial incidents, a unique set of parameters  should be applied no matter the country where the DSP operates. Again, it is reasonable to assume  that common thresholds must accompany the adoption of common parameters so that the meas- urement and, most importantly, interpretations can be reliable, representative and can inform fur- ther policy decisions in all Member States.  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  29  As a practical and rational conclusion to all three points explained above, it is our understanding that the  adoption of common thresholds is necessary in achieving EU level harmonisation in terms of incident notifi- cation.  Applying an incident notification policy across EU without having proper thresholds would not help achieve  many of the objectives of the directive, i.e. “common level of network and information security”. An incident  notification policy without thresholds would only create further confusion and possible discriminatory prac- tices against DSPs due to different approaches adopted by the Member States.  A comprehensive approach based on relative and absolute thresholds should therefore be applied to identify  EU-wide incidents that indeed might have a substantial impact on the internal market.  The section below and Annex A contains a full non-binding proposal on how to determine the impact of  incidents based on parameters and thresholds.  3.4.1 Proposed procedure/algorithm for determining the impact of incidents  The NISD leaves plenty of room for interpretation in what regards incident notification provisions for DSPs.  Through this paper we tried to further explain some key concepts and fill in some gaps, with the belief that  it could improve the conditions for smooth implementation of the incident notification provisions. One of  the main proposals that we presented in section 2.6 was the introduction of thresholds in the incident re- porting process.  The purpose of this annex is to describe our non-binding proposal on how thresholds could be applied  within the context of the NISD.  When reading the current proposal, please take into account the following aspects:   All requirements of the NISD were taken into account, so that the proposal can seamlessly fit the  necessities (i.e. the proposal is based on all parameters proposed by the directive).   A three level scale of criticality was introduced to better classify incidents according to their impact.  Please read Annex A for an explanation of all three levels (RED, ORANGE, YELLOW). Reporting starts  from YELLOW.   A simple yet comprehensive approach was embraced. Simplicity was needed to avoid overburdening  the DSPs and national authorities with obtaining data that was not collected organically.   Due to the diversified (and sometimes contradictory) set of approaches observed from the industry  and Member States, identifying a common denominator only by compiling the answers was impossi- ble. The private sector has a business driven approach, sometimes using parameters and thresholds  that are not entirely relevant in the context of the NISD (e.g. parameter: percentage of lost services).  In this respect, previous ENISA experience in incident reporting schemes was very useful in fine-tuning  the results obtained with the overall context of the Directive.   The proposal is organised as a logical scheme, an algorithm, where all steps must be fulfilled before  reaching the final result.   All thresholds proposed are based on the results of the survey and ENISA’s previous experience. We  do understand that in particular cases updates could be needed to reflect real life situations, but this  task was beyond ENISA’s capabilities given the resources the time constraints. We do acknowledge  that further effort needs to be deployed by ENISA within the Cooperation Group as well as to assist  the Comitology Committee’s work in order to achieve optimal values.   A 2 step reporting approach is proposed, with a preliminary reporting in due time after the incident  and a full reporting in 2-3 days after detection.  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  30  When trying to determine the impact of an incident the following steps should be applied (graphical view  Fig. 8):  1. STEP 1: Identify the geographical spread of the incident  At this level, a DSP should identify if the provision of the service concerned (NIS downtime) was affected  within the EU political borders. If a positive result will come out, the countries affected should be iden- tified. Based on the number of countries affected, the colour code of this parameter is to be assigned.  At this stage there is no need to identify if users were indeed affected within EU borders, but just to  identify if the service was properly accessible in EU Member States.  Question to answer on STEP 1: Does the incident affect the proper accessibility of the service within  EU?  2. STEP 2: Determine the extent of the disruption  The extent of the disruption must be analysed taking into account the 4 protection goals expressed  within the Directive: integrity affected (information or output provided altered), confidentiality affected  (interception, unauthorized access), availability affected (service degraded, interrupted and/or unusa- ble), authenticity affected (cannot be trusted). Based on the number of affected protection goals the  impact colour code is assigned. If an incident can be identified as affecting at least one of the 4 proper- ties above, it shall be classified as YELLOW. If more properties are affected the colour code is attributed  accordingly.  Question to answer on STEP 2: Is the service unavailable, unusable or unsafe to use due to the inci- dent?  3. STEP 3: Determining the USERTIME  The two parameters “number of users affected” and “duration of the incident” were merged into a  single one entitled USERTIME. We considered the merge necessary for achieving better flexibility in  covering real life scenarios (very long incidents with few users affected or very short incidents with  many users affected). USERTIME is based on relative and absolute thresholds. The relative one refers  to the percentage of the population being affected in one Member State. In our example it starts from  more than 5% for at least one hour, or more than 1% for at least 4 hours. The absolute threshold is  measured in fixed values and it has to reach more than 60 million user-minutes per incident. For more  details, please see Annex A. For this parameter, no colour code is to be applied. If the critical threshold  is exceeded, the incident should be reported. For the purpose of reporting, any type of user can be  included, but a classification (based on the types enumerated in section 2.5.1) is to be preferred if the  DSP is able to provide one.  Question to answer on STEP 3: Does the impairment caused by the incident is above the absolute or  relative thresholds in terms of USERTIME?  4. STEP 4: Determining the extent of the impact on economic and societal activities  The overall purpose of the NISD is to protect the internal market from damages produced by cyber- incidents. Identifying the real economic and societal impact for every incident is challenging for both  DSPs and national authorities, as most of the information needed resides outside their organisations.  Therefore, this is mainly an estimative exercise aiming at giving the EU authorities a glimpse into the  potential disruptive effects upon the internal market and EU citizens. In this respect, the approach pro- posed in step 4 is based on predefined levels of affected users. The more users are affected the bigger  the potential impact. We do understand that the numbers provided might not be very illustrative for all  Member States and further adjusting might be necessary during implementation.

Conclusions  The current study has uncovered serious issues that must be addressed while implementing the DSP incident  reporting provisions of the NISD. The multitude of technical approaches mirrored the numerous discrepancies  between types of DSPs and the corresponding business models adopted, thus creating a deep pool of some- times incompatible variables that must be taken into account when approaching such a regulation. For example,  a simple parameter imposed by the Directive, such as “number of users”, can mean different things to different  types of providers, from simple visitors or registered individuals to corporate users and dependant services.  Achieving convergence between the myriad of existing approaches while sticking to the formal requirements  might be troublesome. Nevertheless, the EU’s first DSP incident notification requirements as part of the first  EU wide set of rules on cyber-security are a major step forward towards achieving a common level of cyber- security across the Union. In a perpetually fluctuating technological landscape that affects our livelihoods while  having increasing economic and societal impact as a whole, a first step, in understanding the real threats and  vulnerabilities that we have to confront, has been taken through the adoption of the NISD along with its two  main requirements: mandatory incident notification and minimum security measures. From now on, a “small  steps” approach must be applied in implementing the Directive, that has to undergo periodic reviews and up- dates.  This document provides a preliminary guideline on how incident notification provisions for DSPs could be ef- fectively implemented across EU. Based on valuable input from Member States and companies directly im- pacted by the Directive, this guideline arises from their good practices in matters such as identifying types of  incidents, parameters and thresholds and results in an outline technical proposal that can tentatively be applied  across EU.  At the same time, this guideline serves as a technical input to the foregoing process of adopting the implement- ing act that will further specify details regarding the incident notification provisions of the NISD.

Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  34  Table 1 - Proposal for measuring impact of incidents within the NISD  Explanation: If the values provided by DSPs (users, time) are above the relative OR absolute thresholds,  the incident can be considered as fulfilling the requirements of the third step of the algorithm (P3). NO  color codes shall be applied here.  Algorithm: Incidents above the relative thresholds (Table 1, percentage of the population or percentage  of their user base) are reportable. Incidents that are NOT above the relative threshold, but are above the  absolute threshold are also reportable. The universal absolute threshold is 60 mil. user minutes per inci- dent but only if it affects more than 25.000/10.000 users or lasts more than one hour. The user minutes  are obtained by multiplying the nr. of users affected with the duration of the incident.  Examples:  - 25.000 users X 60 mins=1.200.000 userminutes=NOT REPORTABLE.  - 25.000 users X 2.400 mins=60.000.000 userminutes=REPORTABLE.  - 1.000.000 users X 59 mins=70.800.000 userminutes=NOT REPORTABLE.  - 1.000.000 USERS X 60 mins=60.000.000 userminutes=REPORTABLE.

As determining the real impact might be troublesome for DSPs and Mem- ber States also, the proposal is to measure only the number of users affected and use the color code form  the next column.

By ratifying a definite number of obligations across the EU, the Directive will help ensure a con- sistent approach to cybersecurity “with a view to achieving a high common level of security of networks and  information systems within the Union so as to improve the functioning of the internal market”. The main  points of the NIS Directive can be summarised as follows: improved cybersecurity capabilities at national  level, increased EU-level cooperation, security measures and incident reporting obligations for Operators  of Essential Services (OES) and Digital Service Providers (DSP). The scope of this study is limited to relevant  provisions of the NIS Directive on Digital Service Providers (DSPs) and their current activities in this field.  According to one of the provisions of the NISD, Member States must ensure that DSPs notify the competent  authority without undue delay of any incident having a substantial impact on the provision of a service. In  determining the “substantial impact”, the Directive mentions just five indicators to be used without provid- ing other details.  As the Directive provides only a sketchy description of the incident notification concepts and the overall  process, the main goal of this document is to develop a set of guidelines for all concerned stakeholders (EU  level authorities, public, private), aimed at supporting the implementation of the NIS Directive requirements  regarding mandatory incident notification for Digital Service Providers.  A useful description of the roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders involved is provided. From DSPs to  EU level bodies involved, each part plays an important role in securing EU’s cyber future. National authorities  are responsible for managing the process at their level, while the Cooperation Group is established as a body  that will support and facilitate strategic cooperation and the exchange of information among Member  States. The interaction between involved bodies becomes crucial as the information flow regarding incidents  must be properly assured throughout EU.  Establishing a clear view of the incident notification process, is a must for a proper implementation. Such a  view, compiled from all requirements of the Directive, is included in this document. Certain aspects such as  the main EU establishment of an DSP, cross border cooperation, the public awareness about incidents, rela- tionship with law-enforcement are all explained. For a better understanding, the possible place occupied by  the mandatory incident notification process within the generic incident management practices is explained.  Knowing what incidents have to be reported is equally important in the reporting process. As the Directive  provides only some theoretical concepts that must be followed when reporting incidents, the current guide- lines give an exhaustive description of the incident types covered by the NISD.  Further on, clarifications on the parameters that must be used when notifying are also important in the  reporting process. The notions provided by the Directive are supplemented with technical interpretations  and tips on how to apply them. A simple notion as “number of users” can raise multiple issues when trying  to apply it to search engines or cloud providers.  Although at first sight we might consider the incident reporting topic as straightforward and easy-going, the  current study has uncovered serious issues that must be addressed while implementing the DSP incident  reporting provisions of the NISD. The multitude of technical approaches mirrored the numerous discrepan- cies between types of DSPs and the corresponding business models adopted, thus creating a deep pool of  sometimes incompatible variables that must be taken into account when approaching such a regulation. For  example, a simple parameter imposed by the Directive, such as “number of users”, can mean different things  to different types of providers, from simple visitors or registered individuals to corporate users and depend- ant services.  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  05  EU’s first DSP incident notification requirements as part of the first EU wide set of rules on cyber-security  are a major step forward towards achieving a common level of cyber-security across the Union. In a perpet- ually fluctuating technological landscape that affects our livelihoods while having increasing economic and  societal impact as a whole, a first step, in understanding the real threats and vulnerabilities that we have to  confront, has been taken through the adoption of the NISD along with its two main requirements: mandatory  incident notification and minimum security measures. From now on, a “small steps” approach must be ap- plied in implementing the Directive, that has to undergo periodic reviews and updates.  This document provides preliminary guidelines on how incident notification provisions for DSPs could be  effectively implemented across the EU. Based on valuable input from Member States and companies directly  impacted by the Directive, this guideline arises from their good practices in matters such as identifying types  of incidents, parameters and thresholds. The overall result is an outline technical proposal that can tenta- tively be used in the implementation process.  At the same time, this guideline serves as a technical input to the foregoing process of adopting the imple- menting act that will further specify details regarding the incident notification provisions of the NISD.

Introduction  Goal and Objectives  The main goal of this document is to develop a set of guidelines for all concerned stakeholders (EU level  authorities, public, private), aimed at supporting the implementation of the NIS Directive (hereafter referred  to as “the Directive” or “NISD”) requirements regarding mandatory incident notification. The scope of this  study is limited to relevant provisions of the NIS Directive on Digital Service Providers (DSPs) and their cur- rent activities in this field.  Target audience  The target audience of this work is as follows:   EU Commission, as this document will serve as a technical input to the process of defining the imple- menting act following up the Directive.   Relevant EU national authorities, as this document can provide guidelines and good practices for imple- menting the NISD provisions at national level.   Digital Service Providers (DSPs), as this document can provide guidelines and good practices on properly  implementing the NISD provisions at provider level.  Methodology  The underlying study presented in this report involved a three-tiered methodology, thus consisting of a pri- mary desktop research reviewing the relevant literature, a subsequent online questionnaire-based infor- mation-gathering tier that included DSPs and national authorities as interviewees, and a final set of in-depth  interviews to address more nuanced and detailed issues that could not have been captured in the survey.  The approach aimed to collect all the available information regarding the practices employed by EU national  agencies and DSPs in their capacity of incident management and response actors as well as their views on  how incident notification could be implemented efficiently in the context of the provisions prescribed by the  NISD. This approach facilitated the structuring of a basic documentation that was later adjusted within the  context of the NIS Directive (NISD) and based on previous ENISA expertise in the area on incident reporting.

Therefore, the agency’s focus is not that the samples used ought to be statistically sig- nificant but that the policy process involves all relevant stakeholders and that the consultation process is  comprehensive and thorough. Policymaking and policy implementation generally involve a constant bar- gaining process between decision makers and policy implementers, and here is where ENISA engages in  enhancing the constructive dialogue and clarifying technicalities in order to increase the chances of  smooth implementation and achievement of policy goals.

General information about the NISD  Background of the NISD  2.1.1 Short history  The current approach to CIIP and resilience within the EU has its roots in the Commission Communication of  2009 entitled ‘Protecting Europe from large-scale cyber-attacks and disruptions: enhancing preparedness,  security and resilience ‘1, together with a number of accompanying policy documents that essentially built  up and further refined this approach.234  Subsequently, in 2013, the Commission released the Cybersecurity Strategy of the EU5, which laid out a  number of fundamental principles underlying the EU approach to cybersecurity followed by 5 strategic pri- orities. The proposal for the NIS Directive was thus made under the first strategic priority ‘Achieving Cyber  resilience’.  From 2013 through to 2015, the Commission, the Parliament and the Council, in the framework of the EU  legislative process, discussed the Directive intensely. Consequently, the European institutions reached an  informal political agreement on the NIS Directive on December 7, 2015. Member States (the Committee of  Permanent Representatives (COREPER)) endorsed this agreement on December 18. On January 14, the Eu- ropean Parliament’s IMCO committee voted in favour of the NIS Directive (34-2).  The Directive entered into force in August 2016, and the Member States must transpose it to national legis-  lation by May 9, 2018.  2.1.2 Overview  The NIS Directive is the first piece of EU legislation specifically aimed at improving cybersecurity throughout  the Union. This in itself represents a very significant step in the approach to securing EU information systems.  By ratifying a definite number of obligations across the EU, the Directive will help ensure a consistent ap- proach to cybersecurity ‘with a view to achieving a high common level of security of networks and infor- mation systems within the Union so as to improve the functioning of the internal market’.  The main points of the NIS Directive can be summarised as follows:   Improved cybersecurity capabilities at national level: Each Member State should take actions in the follow- ing areas:  o Adopt a national strategy on the security of network and information systems defining the strategic  objectives and appropriate policy and regulatory measures.  o Designate one or more national competent authorities for the NIS Directive and a national single point  of contact, to monitor the application of the Directive at national level.  1 Commission Communication of March 2009, “Protecting Europe from large-scale cyber-attacks and disruptions: en- hancing preparedness, security and resilience”, COM (2009)149.  2  \"Achievements and next steps: towards global cyber-security\" adopted on 31 March 2011 and the Council  Conclusion on CIIP of May 2011 ( http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/11/st10/st10299.en11.pdf )  3 Council resolution of 18 December, 2009 ‘On a collaborative approach to network and information security (2009/C  321 01)  4 Council Conclusion on CIIP of May 2011 ( http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/11/st10/st10299.en11.pdf )  5 Joint Communication on the Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace, available at:  http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/11/st10/st10299.en11.pdf http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/11/st10/st10299.en11.pdf http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  09  o Designate one or more Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) for comprehensive inci- dent management nationwide.   Increased EU-level cooperation:  o Establishes an EU level Cooperation Group, to support and facilitate strategic cooperation and the ex-  change of information among Member States and to develop trust and confidence.  o Establishes an EU level network of the national CSIRTs and CERT-EU, in order to contribute to the de-  velopment of confidence and trust between the Member States and to promote swift and effective  operational cooperation. ENISA will provide the secretariat of the group.   Security measures and incident reporting obligations for operators of essential services and digital service  providers:  o Identified operators of essential services (OESs) and digital service providers (DSPs) will have to take  appropriate security measures and to notify serious incidents to the relevant national authority.  Fig. 1 - Graphical overview of the NIS Directive.  2.1.3 The light-touch approach  In light of the NISD provisions, it is considered that the operators of essential services (OES) are critical for  the proper functioning of the internal market. On the other hand, DSPs, as first hand providers for the OES,  should have lighter provisions in place, i.e. not as strict as the OES. To this extent, a light-touch approach is  deemed appropriate for DSPs.  Although recital 60 of the NISD introduces the concept of light-touch approach and reactive ex-post super- visory activities, the notions were not perceived by the community as being sufficiently explained, leaving  plenty of room for interpretation. Amongst the related references, we could mention “competent authority  concerned should therefore only take action when provided with evidence […] that a digital service provider  is not complying with the requirements of this Directive, in particular following the occurrence of an incident.  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  10  The competent authority should therefore have no general obligation to supervise digital service provid- ers”6.  However, applying a light touch approach should not prevent a specific authority from being fully able to  exercise its supervision authority upon a DSP, should the case require it. For example, applying fewer provi- sions for DSPs as compared to OES might not be beneficial if certain limits are exceeded. Overall, securing  the unabridged chain of services that support the internal market should be the top priority when imple- menting the NISD.  In this respect, the light-touch approach aims at avoiding overburdening the DSPs while not hampering the  capacity of the EU to react to cybersecurity incidents in a swift and efficient manner. Therefore, there are  reasons to be concerned that a significant lowering in the requirements of incident notification (types of  incidents, parameters to be used) could result in hindering the capacity (at EU or national level) to follow up  on specific incidents threatening the functioning of the internal market at various levels. For instance, a  hostile attack (or even a malfunction) that affects a financial system by means of a number of anomalies  produced at the level of a specific cloud service provider (that provides services to the financial system)  might not be appropriately comprehended if not all accountable entities went by the same incident report- ing policies. The financial entity would then report issues related to the could provider, but the reporting  system would not allow a clear and full understanding of the overall causes that led to damages to the in- ternal market.  The prevalent understanding of the ‘light-touch’ approach is as follows:   Member States are not allowed to impose any further security or notification requirements on digital  service providers, besides the ones foreseen in the directive (Art. 16 (10) ).   Jurisdiction is based on the criteria of main establishment of a DSP within only one Member State, mean- ing that it has to comply only with the national rules of one MS.  (art. 18). If the DSP does not have an  establishment within EU, it can choose one Member State.   Only ex-post supervision is allowed from the competent authority (art. 17 (1) ), when provided with  evidence that a digital service provider does not meet the requirements laid down in Article 16. There is  no general obligation to supervise digital service providers on a regular basis.   The minimum security requirements for DSPs should be lighter than those of the OES, and they should  remain free to take the measures that they deem appropriate.  This interpretation of the light-touch approach was presented by Commission’s representatives, during  ENISA’s Network and Information Security Workshop in Bratislava, 17-18.10.2016.  Stakeholders involved  The DSPs incident notification process, as described by the NISD, exposes a number of stakeholders involved.  This subchapter identifies them, for a better understanding of their role.  2.2.1 Digital service providers (DSPs)  A “digital service” is defined by the Directive (EU) 2015/1535 as “any service normally provided for remu- neration, at a distance, by electronic means and at the individual request of a recipient of services”7. None- theless, for the scope of the NISD, DSPs are limited to only three types of services: cloud, online market  places and search engines.  Their inclusion within the NISD is not purposeless as the aim of the directive is to “achieve a high common  level of security of network and information systems within EU, so as to improve the functioning of the  6 NIS Directive, Recital 60.  7 point (b) of Article 1(1) of Directive (EU) 2015/1535.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/network-and-information-security-workshop/network-and-information-security-workshop  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  11  internal market”. Given that most of these systems are privately operated, their inclusion in the provisions  of the NISD was more than necessary. As they are the owners or administrators of the underlying systems  of what we currently name Internet or Digital Society, it is reasonable to believe that they have to play an  important role in assuring the cyber-security of our digital market and they will be the first ones having to  adopt measures. Recitals 35 and 44 of the NISD provide some insights in this respect.  Baseline security measures and mandatory incident notification will be applied to DSPs within the context  of the NIS Directive. Further explanations on DSPs and their services can be found in section 2.2.1.  Digital Service Providers (DSPs) as for the purpose of the Directive are providers of the following three types  of digital services: online marketplace, online search engine, cloud-computing service. The main technical  characteristics of a digital service, as defined by Directive (EU) 2015/1535 are the following:  - Offered at a distance.  - Offered by electronic means.  - Offered at the individual request of the recipient of services.  These three particular types of DSPs were selected for regulation through the NISD due to their importance  (or, better said, criticality) for the smooth functioning of many EU businesses (internal market). As men- tioned by recital 48 of the Directive “a disruption of such a digital service could prevent the provision of other  services which rely on it, and could, thus have an impact on key economic and societal activities in the Union.  Such digital services might therefore be of crucial importance for the smooth functioning of businesses that  depend on them and, moreover, for the participation of such businesses in the internal market and cross-  border trade across the Union”.  To conclude, the three types of services were chosen to be regulated due  to the increasing number of businesses carried on in the Union that fundamentally rely on them for the  provision of their own services.  Given their cross-border nature, recital 57 states that Member States should not proceed with any identifi- cation of the DSPs as the directive will apply to all providers in scope. Yet, the directive refers chiefly to their  legal identification, which should be carried out through the Directive itself or its subsequent implementing  acts. Nonetheless, the technical identification and classification is a necessity for every national authority,  so that cases where DSPs evade the provisions of the Directive (because of improper identification) can be  avoided.  The identification is a critical issue due to the cross-border nature of the providers. One provider can operate  within many Member States but with only one main establishment within the Union, as explained by recital  64. In such cases, the national authority supervising the main establishment is responsible for overseeing  the activities of the particular DSPs and the services provided in the EU.  Given the light touch approach for DSPs, micro and small businesses will be excluded from implementing  the NISD. Governmental services (i.e. cloud) are also excluded from the NISD.  The following subchapters represent a non-binding technical description that aims at supporting national  authorities in properly identifying, from a technical point of view, the DSPs and their provisioned services, in  the specific context of the NISD.  2.2.1.1 Online market places  Recital 15 and art. 4. (17) of the NISD try to shape a definition of online market places meaning services that  “allow consumers and traders to conclude online sales or service contracts with traders, and is the final  destination for the conclusion of those contracts”. Intermediaries and price comparison services are ex- cluded from this definition, leaving only platforms where the actual online shopping can be concluded. There  are no special provisions as to what can be sold through online market places, so it applies to all types of  contracts (products and services). Although from a technical perspective most online marketplaces use a  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  12  website or web related technologies for delivering their services, it should not be a restriction in this sense,  as mobile application stores make use of other technologies also.  The technical identification of online market places should not be an issue, as all necessary details are pro- vided by the regulation itself.  Below you can find a series of example lists of online marketplaces. These lists are not exhaustive and are  only provided for illustrative purposes, and should not, by any means, be taken as exhaustive when imple- menting the NISD.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mobile_software_distribution_platforms   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_online_marketplaces   http://myappmag.com/online-shopping-websites/   http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/the-uk-s-top-100-shopping-websites-603428  2.2.1.2 Search engines  Recital 16 together with art. 4 (18) provide a comprehensive definition of search engines: “a digital service  that allows users to perform searches of, in principle, all websites or websites in a particular language on the  basis of a query on any subject in the form of a keyword, phrase or other input, and returns links in which  information related to the requested content can be found”. It is also very clearly mentioned that search  functionalities limited to in-site search and price comparison websites should not be considered search en- gines.  Therefore, the technical identification of search engines is not considered problematic.  The link below provides a sample list of search engines. The list is not exhaustive and only for illustrative  purposes, and should not be taken as exhaustive when implementing the NISD:   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_search_engines  2.2.1.3 Cloud computing services  Recital 17 and art. 4 (19) provide a clear and straightforward theoretical definition of cloud computing.  The cloud computing is a particular type of computing service that uses shared resources in order to process  data on-demand. Through the shared resources, we hereby refer to any kind of hardware or software com- ponents (e.g. networks, servers or other infrastructure, storage, applications and services) that are released  on-demand to users for processing data. The NISD mentions three properties that a cloud computing service  must display in order to be technically identified as a cloud service:   shareable computing resources: computing resources that are provided to multiple users who share  a common access to the service, but where the processing is carried out separately for each user,  although the service is provided from the same electronic equipment. In a nutshell, when many users  are utilizing the same physical infrastructure for processing data the first property is met.   scalable resources: computing resources that are flexibly allocated by the cloud service provider,  irrespective of the geographical location of the resources, in order to handle fluctuations in demand.  This means that the pool of resources used by the provider can be extended or reduced at any time,  depending on the user requirements. Thus, data centres or single components within one data cen- tre could possibly be added or removed if the total amount of computing or storage capacity needs  an update.   elastic pool of resources: computing resources that are provisioned and released according to de- mand in order to rapidly increase and decrease resources available, depending on workload. A more  straightforward definition could be: “the  degree  to  which  a  system  is  able  to adapt to workload  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mobile_software_distribution_platforms https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_online_marketplaces http://myappmag.com/online-shopping-websites/ http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/the-uk-s-top-100-shopping-websites-603428 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_search_engines  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  13  changes by provisioning and de-provisioning  resources  in  an  autonomic  manner, such  that  at  each  point  in  time  the  available  resources match the current demand as closely as possible”8.  ENISA has been covering the cloud area for several years now9. Comprehensive guidelines on specific topics  within the cloud area can be found here. Seemingly, one useful guideline on the basics of cloud computing  can be found here.  Fig. 2 – Service models and assets in cloud computing  One provider can apply three classic cloud service models10, as listed below. Since the NISD did not exclude  any of the three, the provisions will be applicable to each type of service model.   Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): the provider delivers computing resources (virtual hardware), ac- cessible online. There are two types of resources: processing power (including network resources),  and (block) storage (memory resources). In this model, the user usually has access to components  such as virtual machines, physical servers, storage, load balancers, network equipment etc. Exam- ples include Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud, Google’s Compute Engine, Amazon Simple Storage  Service, Rackspace etc.  An indicative list of IaaS providers in the EU can be found here.   Platform as a Service (PaaS): the provider delivers a platform, or more precisely, servers, for cus- tomers to run applications on. PaaS providers sometimes offer a software development tool for the  platform. Examples of applications running on these platforms are scripts (PHP, Python, e.g.) or byte  code (Java servlets, C#). In this model, the user usually has access to components such as web serv- ers, application servers, development tools, databases etc. Examples include Google App engine,  Microsoft Azure, Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, etc.  8 Nikolas Roman Herbst, Samuel Kounev, Ralf Reussner, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, “Elasticity in Cloud Compu- ting: What It Is, and What It Is Not”, available at: https://sdqweb.ipd.kit.edu/publications/pdfs/HeKoRe2013-ICAC- Elasticity.pdf  9 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cloud-and-big-data/cloud-security  10 ENISA, Could Security Guide for SMEs, available at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-security- guide-for-smes  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cloud-and-big-data/cloud-security https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-security-guide-for-smes https://www.channele2e.com/2016/03/10/top-10-european-cloud-services-providers-csps-for-iaas-list/ https://sdqweb.ipd.kit.edu/publications/pdfs/HeKoRe2013-ICAC-Elasticity.pdf https://sdqweb.ipd.kit.edu/publications/pdfs/HeKoRe2013-ICAC-Elasticity.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-security-guide-for-smes https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-security-guide-for-smes  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  14  An indicative list of PaaS providers in the EU can be found here.   Software as a Service (SaaS): the provider delivers full-fledged software or applications, via the in- ternet. Applications range from email, document editors, customer relationship management (CRM)  systems, virtual desktops, games and so on. SaaS can often be accessed with a browser or a web  services client. Duly note should be taken that it is quite common for SaaS providers to run their  applications on an IaaS or PaaS from another provider. An example is the video streaming site Netflix  (SaaS) which runs on Amazon AWS computing services (PaaS/IaaS).  There are also several classic cloud deployment models. Although the technical architectures are similar  (even identical in some cases) the business model applied provides the following classification:   Public cloud: Typical cloud open to the public (individuals and companies), generally accessible from  the Internet.   Private cloud: a cloud operated for a single organisation. Typical for large organisations that want  to remove some privacy or other security related concerns that characterize public clouds.   Hybrid cloud: A mixture between public and private (e.g. private cloud making use of several func- tionalities offered by a public cloud).   Community cloud: cloud used by several stakeholders/organisations (e.g. within the same industry).  The NISD does not differentiate the various deployment models, but considering the definition of the digital  service (see 2.2.1) we can sensibly conclude that the Directive aims at regulating mainly the public clouds.  Nevertheless, depending on particular circumstances, hybrid and community clouds can also be included in  the NISD provisions.  2.2.2 National authorities  As main responsible for driving, improving and securing the digital market, national governments are also  considered key stakeholders in assuring the security of network and information services. They are account- able for developing the legal and institutional framework capable of managing the security of their national  digital market. Thus, from identifying the key players and current threats to imposing minimum security  measures and mandatory incident notification requirements, their overall role is to ensure that the level  playing field (in terms of cyber-security) at the national level is achieved.  Moreover, national authorities are all governmental bodies operating at national level that are responsible  for the implementation and monitoring of the NIS directive. Consequently, according to the directive, each  Member State shall assign at least three roles relevant for network and information security. These roles are  as follows:   Single point of contact: each Member State shall designate a national single point of contact on the  security of network and information systems that shall exercise a liaison function to ensure cross– border cooperation with the relevant authorities in other Member States and with other EU level  bodies. Member States may assign this role to an already existing authority. Where a Member State  will designate only one competent authority, that competent authority shall also be the single point  of contact.   National CSIRT: Each Member State must designate one or more CSIRTs, which shall comply with  the requirements set out in point (1) of Annex I to the Directive, covering at least the sectors referred  to within the directive (shown in Fig. 1).   National competent authorities: in order to cover all requirements of the NISD, all Member States  must designate one or more national competent authorities on the security of network and infor- mation systems covering at least the sectors referred to in Annex II and the services referred to in  Annex III. Countries can decide for nominating just one authority covering all sectors and services  described in the NISD, or many covering specific areas/sectors/services.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service#Providers  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  15  Therefore, as inferred from the text of the Directive, several configurations are possible. Member States can  have only one body covering all requirements (it must be a national CSIRT, a single point of contact and cover  all sectors), two or more bodies, splitting the roles amongst each other.  2.2.3 Cooperation group  As defined within the Directive, the role of the Cooperation Group (CG) is to support and facilitate strategic  cooperation and the exchange of information among Member States and to develop trust and confidence.  As cross-border cooperation is a key factor in achieving an EU wide high common level of security of net- works and information systems, the existence of this group is a real necessity.  The CG shall be composed of Member States representatives, the EU Commission and ENISA. The Commis- sion shall provide the Secretariat. Where appropriate, the Cooperation Group may invite representatives of  the relevant stakeholders to participate to its works.  Among the tasks that fall within the CG’s competencies are:   Provide strategic guidance for the activities of the CSIRT network.   Exchange best practices on topics related to: capacity building, incident notification, security  measures, awareness raising, training, R&D.   Discuss capabilities and preparedness of Member States.   On a voluntary basis, evaluate national strategies on the security of network and information sys- tems and the effectiveness of CSIRTs.   Collect and examine, on an annual basis, the incident summary reports sent by Member States.   -   Discuss about standardization issues with representatives from the relevant European Standardiza- tion Organizations.   Exchanging best practice with regard to the identification of operators of essential services by the  Member States, with ENISA’s assistance.  2.2.4 CSIRTs Network  The work undergone at the strategic level by the CG is to be complemented by a technical/operational part  developed by the CSIRTs network. The official role of the CSIRTs network is to contribute to the development  of confidence and trust between the Member States and to promote effective operational cooperation.  The CSIRTs network is composed of representatives from Member States’ national CSIRTs, ENISA and CERT– EU. ENISA will provide the secretariat of the group and the Commission can take part in the network as an  observer.  Among the tasks that fall within the CSIRTs Network’s competencies are:   Exchange information on services, operations and cooperation capabilities.   Exchange and discussing information related to incidents and associated risks (on request, on a  voluntary basis).   Identify a coordinated response to an incident (on request).   Providing MS support in addressing cross–border incidents (on a voluntary basis).   Issue guidelines concerning operational cooperation.   Discuss, explore and identify further forms of operational cooperation (risks and incidents, early  warnings, mutual assistance, coordination).   Discuss the capabilities and preparedness of certain CSIRTs (on request from that CSIRT).  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  16  2.2.5 ENISA  With more than 10 years of experience in dealing with cyber-security issues across EU, ENISA has touched  upon almost all areas and sectors regulated through the NISD. Because of the work it has carried out in the  past, ENISA is ideally positioned to assist the Member States in implementing the NIS Directive once it is  adopted. The role of ENISA is to assist all stakeholders in implementing the NISD.  2.2.6 European Commission  The European Commission is the executive body of the European Union and it represents the interests of all  EU Member States. One of its main roles is to put forward legislation, which is then adopted by the co- legislators, the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers, as in the case of the NISD.  Digital Society, Trust and Cybersecurity within is one of the areas where the Commission (DG CONNECT) has  an active role, through the NISD but also through other legislative acts.  Through the NISD, the Commission will assure the secretariat of the Cooperation Group and will follow up  on the effective implementation of the new regulation across EU. It will also have to adopt the secondary  level legislation, meaning the implementing acts necessary to assure the uniform implementation of the  directive across EU.  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  17  3. Incident notification process for DSPs  The NISD incident notification provisions for DSPs  The incident notification requirements for DSPs are defined within Art. 16, (4) to (9). The incident notification  process should be in line with the following requirements:   Member States must ensure that DSPs notify the competent authority without undue delay of any  incident having a substantial impact on the provision of a service. The notification must include all  information necessary so that the national authority can determine the significance and any cross- border impact. Although not directly specified within the NISD it is reasonable to take into account  a two-step notification process: one immediate with a small amount of information and one with  full details, at a later stage.   By reason of the light touch approach that has to be followed when implementing the Directive, the  DSPs will have to comply only with the regulation within one Member State, the one where the main  establishment is located. In this way, a certain level of harmonisation ought to be achieved as pro- viders will have to relate to only one authority and one set of rules across EU.   In determining the “substantial impact” incidents, the following indicators will be used: the number  of users affected by the incident (with a focus on the ones relying on the service for the provision of  their own services); (b) the duration of the incident; (c) the geographical spread with regard to the  area affected by the incident; (d) the extent of the disruption of the functioning of the service; (e)  the extent of the impact on economic and societal activities. It is understandable that the provider  must have access to all this information, so that the reporting can be done properly.   Significant incidents affecting OES networks and systems caused by incidents affecting DSPs’ infra- structures are theoretically considered distinct incidents, therefore the reporting activities should  also be distinct.   If one incident concerns two or more Member States, the responsible authority shall inform the  authorities within the other Member States. Moreover, although not specifically mentioned within  the NISD, the communication should take place only through the national authorities or national  CSIRTs.   The public should be informed about individual incidents by the national authorities or by the pro- vider, in case “public awareness is necessary in order to prevent an incident or to deal with an on- going incident, or where disclosure of the incident is otherwise in the public interest”11.   The single points of contact should submit an annual incident summary report to the Cooperation  Group (CG). The report should contain the number of notifications, their nature and actions taken  (Art. 10 (3) ).   The Commission will further specify applicable parameters and thresholds though implementing  acts. Formats and procedures relevant for notification requirements could also be further specified  through implementing acts, if necessary.   Any incidents related to criminal activities should be reported to law enforcement authorities, as  encouraged by recital 62 of the NISD. “Where appropriate, it is desirable that coordination between  competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of different Member States be facilitated  by the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) and ENISA”12.   Given the light touch approach for DSPs, micro and small DSPs will be excluded from implementing  the incident notification provisions. Governmental services (i.e. cloud) are also excluded.  11 Art. 16 (7), NISD.  12 NISD, Recital 62  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  18  Fig. 3  -  The overall incident notification process at EU level  3.1.1 Incident notification as part of the overall incident management process  Information security incident management is defined by ISO/IEC 27000:2016 as “processes for detecting,  reporting, assessing, responding to, dealing with, and learning from information security incidents”. The  importance of the topic is also thoroughly acknowledged through another specific standard ISO/IEC 27035,  totally dedicated to information security incident management. In fact, 65% of the DSPs that responded to  our stock-taking exercise declared using at least one of the two standards in their internal incident manage- ment activities, with ISO/IEC 27035 being the most common of the two.  According to the ISO/IEC 27035 standard, the incident management process is divided in five phases, as  follows:   Plan and Prepare – policies, plans, procedures, commitment at top management.   Detect and Report – monitor, detect and report.   Assessment and Decision – analysis and decision regarding course of action.   Response – containment, eradication, recovery, resolution, closure.   Lesson Learnt – improvements.  Due note should be taken when deciding where the new reporting activities provisioned in the Directive  should be registered. Although there is a “Detect and report” phase this mostly refers to inside reporting,  i.e. activities undergone within the organisation. Unfortunately, the outside reporting for compliance is  rarely touched by the standards in use.  The incident notification process brought by the NISD is, first of all, mandatory, therefore DSPs have to com- ply with it as a consequence of them operating in the EU. As a consequence, it could work in the standard  as an additional “incident notification for compliance”. On the other hand, reporting in the sense of the  provisions of the Directive, has to be carried out “without undue delay”. Thus, introducing this additional  phase within the overall organisational incident management process might become problematic when  dealing with time constraints.  In these particular cases, incident notification for compliance could constitute  part of the “Detect and Report” phase, the “Assessment and Decision” or “Response” phases, depending on  the internal structure, policies and procedures of a particular organisation.  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  19  Types of incidents covered by the NIS directive  Defining the scope in terms of types of incidents to be covered is difficult as long as terms are not properly  clarified and there is no direct mention in the legislation. In order to help the cybersecurity professional  community to get an accurate response to several issues that might arise during the implementation of the  NISD, various definitions and provisions must be revisited. Therefore, in the following, we will try to summa- rize the basic applicable concepts.  As mentioned by the NISD (Art. 4 - definitions) an incident “means any event having an actual adverse effect  on the security of network and information systems”.  Similarly, article (4) defines the network and information systems, by which we understand interconnected  systems that process, transmit and store data so as to provide a digital service.  Further, security of network and information systems is defined as the “ability of network and information  systems to resist, at a given level of confidence, any action that compromises the availability, authenticity,  integrity or confidentiality of stored or transmitted or processed data or the related services offered by, or  accessible via, those network and information systems”.  On the other hand, adverse effect is a concept not defined within the Directive. Nonetheless, we can con- sider the general sense of the words that is preventing success or development, harmful, unfavourable13.  In addition to the definitions above, a notion that needs clarification is substantial impact, a concept that  clearly marks the starting point of incident reporting activities. The notion is used in Art. 16 (4) that states  that DSPs will have to “notify […] without undue delay […] any incident having a substantial impact on the  provision of a service”. Furthermore, the directive indicates that substantial impact must be determined  based on 5 parameters (explained in next subchapter).  By combining the 5 notions highlighted above one can develop a comprehensive idea on the types of inci- dents that have to be considered within the context of the NISD. An overall definition can be summarised as  follows:  Any incident affecting the availability, authenticity, integrity or confidentiality of data stored, transmit- ted or processed by a digital service provider (DSP) through network and information systems, which  has a substantial impact on the provision of the digital service offered.  For clarity, in the following, we will try to depict various examples and specific types of incidents that we  consider that shall be reported when reaching the critical thresholds.  In case of availability, the interpretation is quite straightforward. If the services provided become unavaila- ble to the customers for a certain period, then the incident should be reported under the provisions of the  Directive.  As an example, we could consider the 2016 Dyn incident. The outcome of this particular attack was that  several DSP services became unavailable worldwide (mostly North America and Europe) due to a DDoS at- tack against a common DNS service provider (Dyn) that was servicing the numerous DSPs affected. Conse- quently, the failing of the Dyn DNS services triggered an outage in the services offered by the DSPs that were  using this particular DSN service in order to provide their own services. Were this kind of incident to happen  in the EU after the transposition of the NISD into national legislation, all affected DSPs should report the  13 https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/adverse  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Dyn_cyberattack https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/adverse  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  20  outage. Meanwhile individual DNS service providers can be identified as operators of essential services (OES)  under the NISD, in this specific situation the biggest blow was felt at the DSP level.  In the case of confidentiality, the situation becomes slightly more complicated mostly because we have  additional regulations in place that can overlap with the NISD (e.g. GDPR). Although we can probably draw  a theoretical line between incidents falling under GDPR and the ones under NISD, the situation might differ  in practice. DSPs might have to report the same incident to both authorities responsible. In theory, GDPR  covers the privacy of personal data and the NISD covers the confidentiality of the service offered and the  underlying data (which in most cases is personal data). The GDPR has no notion of a ‘light touch approach’  as used by the NISD.  A common pattern for incidents affecting confidentiality under the NISD could be the following: a cloud  service provider suffers sudden breaches of the confidentiality of their customer’s data (not necessarily per- sonal data) either during transit or at rest (“man in the middle” type attacks). In this case, continuation of  provision of the service could seriously damage the confidentiality of customer data (e.g. product technical  specifications, commercial secrets, business plans, commercial contracts etc.) leading to serious impact on  their business. Thus, when the confidentiality of services delivered cannot be guaranteed and the critical  threshold has been reached, the incident should be reported. On the other hand, incidents that can be clas- sified as simple data breaches but the proper provision of the service is not affected by the breach, should  not be reported under the NISD.  An example is provided by the 2011 Dropbox bug14 that left all their clients at risk for several hours. The  renowned cloud storage provider generated a confidentiality incident as a consequence of making an update  to its code that supressed the authentication method allowing users to access the data without passwords.  For several hours’ users were able to log on to the platform only with the username. This glitch exposed all  of their customers to an extent that is unknown or was not yet made public.15  Integrity of the service or, better said, client data processed through the service is also a type of issue cov- ered by the NISD. It cannot be considered safe to use a cloud service where the integrity of client data or  service cannot be assured because of a breach, a technical failure or any other issue. Any kind of event that  affects the integrity of client data, if it reaches the critical thresholds to be deemed substantial, has to be  reported. A clear case in point was the 2016 Salesforce incident that led to a complete disruption of services  and a system crash that consequently led to the temporary wipe out of important customer transactions  information. Thus, besides the availability of the service, the integrity of customer data was temporarily  affected during the recovery process.16  Finally, authenticity is defined by ISO IEC 27000:2016 as the “property that an entity is what it claims to be”.  Proving the online identity of an entity is mostly done through digital certificates, meaning that incidents  falling under the “authenticity” classification have to affect, to some extent, the digital certificate used to  prove the digital identity of a particular service. Compromising the digital certificate used by a service can  indeed give birth to several other issues, from man in the middle attacks to the risk that the client might be  deceived towards using a completely different service (forged). Usually, these incidents can also be classified  within other categories. Compromised digital certificates can very well fall within the provisions of the Art.  19 of the eIDAS regulation17, depending on the circumstances.  Note: For the rest of the document, for simplicity, we will refer to availability, confidentiality, integrity or  authenticity, as the 4 properties or protection goals that a digital service must assure under the NISD.  14 https://blogs.dropbox.com/dropbox/2011/06/yesterdays-authentication-bug/  15 Additional resources: here and here.  16 Additional resources:  here and here.  17 https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/content/eidas-regulation-regulation-eu-ndeg9102014  https://blogs.dropbox.com/dropbox/2011/06/yesterdays-authentication-bug/ https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewSolution?urlname=Root-Cause-Message-for-Disruption-of-Service-on-NA14-May-2016&language=en_US https://blogs.dropbox.com/dropbox/2011/06/yesterdays-authentication-bug/ http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/21/dropbox-security-bug-passwords_n_881085.html https://blogs.dropbox.com/dropbox/2011/06/yesterdays-authentication-bug/ http://www.informationweek.com/cloud/platform-as-a-service/salesforce-outage-can-customers-trust-the-cloud/d/d-id/1325499 http://diginomica.com/2016/05/12/customer-data-lost-as-salesforce-us-outage-rumbles-on-with-degraded-performance/ https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/content/eidas-regulation-regulation-eu-ndeg9102014  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  21  Besides the theoretical concepts explained above a standard list of incident types would have been very  helpful in this case. Nevertheless, such a list cannot be either comprehensive and could create more confu- sion at this point. Although some types of incidents might be considered clear enough to be classified as  reportable according to the NISD (e.g. DDoS), as the examples above show us, the interpretation might be  quite difficult in some cases. An incident must fulfil many requirements in terms of parameters, thresholds  and protection goals affected so that it can be categorised as reportable. In this respect a thorough analysis  is recommended case by case.  When asked the opinion of DSPs about types of incidents and their root causes that might fall under the  NISD, they indicated that most of the issues are not necessarily related to cyber-attacks but more to system  failures or human errors. For more details, pls. see charts below.

Parameters used to measure impact of incidents  In order to ensure a high common level of network and information security across all the EU Member States,  the NISD introduces mandatory incident notification obligations, amongst several other requirements. To  this end, mainly art. 16 (3) indicates that “digital service providers notify the competent authority or the  CSIRT without undue delay of any incident having a substantial impact on the provision of a service […]  offered within the Union”. An exact definition of a substantial impact of an incident was not included in the  approved version of the NISD, however a definite list of parameters that must be taken into account when  determining the impact of the incidents are prescribed as follows:   (a) the number of users affected by the incident, in particular users relying on the service for the  provision of their own services;   (b) the duration of the incident;   (c) the geographical spread with regard to the area affected by the incident;   (d) the extent of the disruption of the functioning of the service;   (e) the extent of the impact on economic and societal activities.  As a result of our communication with the community of professionals that will be involved in the imple- mentation of the NISD provisions, we introduce in the following subchapters some explanatory notes on  each of the parameters together with potential ways in which they could be measured.  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80% Hardware/Software failure/bug  Configuration Error  Third party failure  DDoS  Outage  Malware  Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)  Information Corruption  Other  Data breaches  Information Loss  System compromise  Session Hijacking  Rogue certificates  Cable cuts  Industrial Espionage  Natural disasters  Physical damage / theft / loss  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  23  Fig. 6 – Usage of parameters for measuring the impact of incidents (DSP view).  3.3.1 Number of users affected by the incident  Measurement of the number of users reportedly impacted by a cyber-incident is one of the most important  variables in determining its significance. As resulted from the stocktaking we carried out, roughly 85% of the  DSPs that responded to our survey are currently using this parameter for measuring impact.  Although it might seem an easy task at a first glance, counting the affected users is not usually an easy task.  The text of the NISD does not provide extensive details on how this parameter should be measured and,  following our analysis we have taken stock of numerous methods (measuring units) used in practice for  counting the actual users affected by an incident. Driven by a business model approach, the DSPs are using  methodologies that count users such as normal anonymous visitors to corporate users or even other de- pending services (through application programming interfaces - APIs).  In summary, the following measurement units were identified during the analysis:   Corporate subscribers (companies, corporate services) - used by 95% of the respondents; depending  on the services offered it might mean one account used by one client (company) or multiple ac- counts per client (company) used by different individuals.   Non-subscribers (visitors) – used by 60% of the respondents, mostly in the cases where they provide  free services, such as search engines. Non-subscribers are non-registered users that access the ser- vice intermittently. Not too much information is stored regarding this type of user and their exact  number might not be known at a particular point in time (such as in the case of an incident). Gener- ally, estimations are used when needed to identify the number of users at different time intervals.   Reliant services (dependant services) - used by 50% of the respondents to the survey, these are  counts of online services that rely on the use of a particular service offered by a DSP (e.g. an online  market place stored in cloud, an email service stored in cloud, a search engine that uses services  provided by other search engines etc.) In such cases, the real number of end users is usually indefi- nite for the primary provider, and is known only to the depending provider.   Individual subscribers/accounts (persons) – used by 45% of the respondents, these subscribers are  representing individuals that usually use the services for their personal interest (home users, indi- vidual persons).  In most cases, the DSPs have visibility only at the first layer of users benefiting from the rendered service or  any other secondary service based on the initial service, i.e. only the users/clients that have directly accessed  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  100% Duration of the incident  Extent of the disruption  Number of users affected  Geographical spread  Number of users relying on the service  Extent of the impact on economic and societal activities  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  24  the initial services and are considered users by the initial DSP are measured. For example, the users of an  online store that uses cloud infrastructure to provide its services are only known to the online market place  provider. The cloud provider sees just one user/client, the online market place. Below a tentative definition  of users within the NISD:  Users = a person, organization, or other entity that employs a digital service provided by a DSP through  network and information systems.  Within the multitude of user types, the importance/priority of some users over others (therefore priority for  data recovery in case of an incident) is mostly business driven, based on contractual agreements and not  necessarily based on the importance of the user for the society (i.e. governmental services, financial institu- tions, critical infrastructures etc.). In fact, most of the respondents are not even aware if they offer services  to such entities. Roughly 60% of the DSPs involved in the survey mentioned being aware they provided ser- vices to other DSPs, but the percentage got significantly lower when they got asked if they were aware of  providing services to essential service operators.  Fig 7 - Answers to the question: “Which of the following sectors are you aware of using your services in EU countries?”  Based on the type of the DSP, we could identify a significant variation in the methodology for user counts.  For example, cloud service providers were usually more aware of the type and number of users at a partic- ular point in time than search engines were. On the other hand, search engine providers were fully capable  of measuring the dependant services (through APIs) but had difficulties with visitors accessing their services  sporadically.  Considering the findings above together with the NISD provision as by art. 16 (4) stating that “the obligation  to notify an incident shall only apply where the digital service provider has access to the information needed  to assess the impact of an incident […]”, we must point out that the approach to measure the number of  users affected by an incident should be simple and pragmatic, so that DSPs can comply. Asking DSPs to pro- vide information that they cannot obtain or for which they should make considerable efforts to obtain would  eventually backfire and practically exclude them from the incident notification obligations.  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70% Other digital service providers  Banking/Financial  Health Sector  Energy Suppliers (Electricity, Oil, Gas)  Transport (Air, Rail, Water/Maritime)  Digital infrastructure (IXP, DNS, TDL)  Water Supply  Do not know  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  25  3.3.2 Duration of the incident  Duration (time interval) is a parameter considered of utmost importance and used by all of the respondents.  Nonetheless, even for this arguably basic parameter, the survey responses revealed differing practical ap- proaches as to what regards measuring duration and the diverse thresholds applied.  For instance, depending on the incident type, the timer might start from the identification of the breach, or  from the service degradation notice. Finalising the incident might be considered the time where all services  have been fully recovered (time to recover) or the time when the systems were fully disinfected (in case of  malware infections).  In the context of the NISD, since the focus is on the continuity of the service, thus availability and security of  provision (in terms of confidentiality, integrity and authenticity) the duration of the incident should be meas- ured (and consequently reported) as starting from the moment when the provision of the service was af- fected up until the time of full recovery. The reporting should contain the number of minutes (or hours) in  which the service provided was not available or, although it was available, it did not meet the confidentiality,  integrity or authenticity requirements. For the purpose of respecting the reporting provisions of the Di- rective, the general term “downtime” might not be a proper term to use as it refers only to availability. Thus  we propose the use of “NIS downtime” or “NIS impairment time” to describe this particular parameter.  Duration of an incident (NIS downtime) = the period of time when a digital service provided by a DSP is  unavailable or unsecured (confidentiality, integrity or authenticity affected).  3.3.3 Geographical spread  The geographical spread is an equally important piece of information to have in order to determine the level  of impact. In circumstances where multiple countries are affected by one incident, identifying the causes  and finding the best remedies can only be done when a clear picture of the geographical area affected is  obtained.  Surprisingly, for the DSPs, the geographical spread is not necessarily a must but rather a nice to have piece  of data. Only 40% of the respondents declared using this parameter, but the surprise is even bigger when it  comes to how it is measured.  Some providers do use “geographical area affected” as an established parameter to measure impact of inci- dents, but not necessarily in the conventional political way we think of, meaning identifying regions or coun- tries. The intense use of web related technologies has made this task exceedingly difficult. For a DSP that  offers online web access to its services, the identification of the exact countries or geographical areas af- fected might be impossible without the use of estimations based on previous data.  Regions served by a data centre might be used as a reference, or in some cases continental regions, but  these are not limited to EU borders. Although Internet fragmentation18 is a fact nowadays, whether from  technical, commercial or political standpoints, this is not necessarily embraced by DSPs unless there is a  business need in this sense. Thus, the capability of identifying the exact countries affected by a particular  incident was mentioned by only one participant to the survey.  In terms of applicability, the NISD reporting provisions cover only the 28 EU countries and it might apply in  the future to other candidate countries. Needless to say that the DSPs did not build their current technical  architecture based on political criteria, and thus they could face some issues in refining the data for reporting  purposes only.  18 http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_FII_Internet_Fragmentation_An_Overview_2016.pdf  http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_FII_Internet_Fragmentation_An_Overview_2016.pdf  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  26  Therefore, reporting the geographical area affected by an incident might be challenging for most of the DSPs,  especially if they provide services internationally. A simple approach that can be applied by all providers,  operating internationally or nationally, is a must in this case. Consequently, a scale of detailing can be ap- plied, starting from a bottom level where only a yes/no answer can be submitted if the incident has affected  EU regions, and ending with a top detailed level where countries and regions can be specified, if known.  In any case, asking from DSPs information that they cannot obtain might exclude them from the incident  notification obligations.  A tentative definition of the parameter geographical spread, in the context of the Directive is as follows:  Geographical spread = Member States or regions within EU where users were affected  by impairments  (NIS downtime) of the digital service provided by a DSP.  3.3.4 Extent of the disruption of the functioning of the service  The extent of the disruption is a parameter used frequently by DSPs. 95% of the respondents to our stock- taking declared using this parameter.  The extent of the disruption is particularly important because it measures the extent of the damage pro- duced by a particular incident. Not surprisingly, here too DSPs are using a business driven approach, custom- ised depending on the technical particularities of the services provided. The following approaches for meas- uring the extent of the disruption have been identified during the stocktaking:   Percentage of services lost (in case of multiple services);   Percentage of the unavailable infrastructure (servers, datacentres etc.);   Service degradation (delays in response, intermittent access, acceptable degradation, total disrup- tion)  All approaches are correct and could reasonably be applied when providing any kind of service, not neces- sarily the ones that are DSP specific. In addition, as one may notice, the term is mostly used to describe  availability related issues, although the notion of “disturbance” does not necessarily refer to total disrup- tions, but also perturbance of normal operation.  In this respect and considering the NISD context, the notion of disturbance ought to be adjusted. First of all,  the extent of the disruption from an availability standpoint can only cover total disruption of the service or  degradation that makes the service unusable. The percentage of infrastructure unavailable, the delays in  response or any other related parameters cannot be really taken into account unless the users cannot use  the service for a particular period, thus rendering the incident reportable.  Secondly, besides availability the NISD also mentions 3 other protection goals that must be taken into ac- count when assessing the extent of the disruption upon a service: confidentiality, integrity and authenticity.  Each of them can be broken down into different levels of detail but for simplicity, it could result better to  treat them in a binary approach (yes/no). Consequently, if one or more of the protection goals are affected,  and the thresholds are exceeded, incidents should be reported. Nevertheless, sophistication levels can be  applied based on a combination of affected protection goals, from one goal affected for the first level, to 4  goals affected for the last level. A detailed description of this approach in presented in Annex A.  Below is a tentative definition of the parameter, in the context of the Directive:  Extent of the disruption of the functioning of the service = the number of protection goals affected due  to an incident disturbing a digital service offered by a DSP.  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  27  3.3.5 Extent of the impact on economic and societal activities  Among all parameters enacted in the directive, the extent of the impact on economic and societal activities  is the least utilized by the industry. Only 25% of the respondents mentioned measuring such a parameter.  In all reported cases the measurement unit was related to the internal resources spent for fixing the prob- lem. Service credits or amounts deducted from the monthly invoice for the periods of inactivity are men- tioned as conducts of measuring the economic impact upon a particular DSP.  Nevertheless, in the context of the NISD, by impact on economic and societal activities we refer to possible  damages brought to the functioning of the EU internal market, meaning the encompassing markets in the  EU's 28 member states. Individual economic impact on a single DSP might not be relevant in this context.  The summed up individual impact felt by each of the affected users might be a response in this case, but this  type of information is generally unknown to the DSPs.  In this respect, the problem becomes fairly difficult for the DSPs, as they are often unable to determine this  kind of impact. Asking the DSP to collect all this data is probably unreasonable and could require plenty of  additional resources and could ultimately prove impossible to do, as affected parties do not always want to  share such information. On the other hand, asking the government to collect this data appears also unrea- sonable as this might be considered as an intrusive approach. In conclusion, measuring the real impact on  economic and societal activities in this way is an activity that requires many resources and has high proba- bility of failing due to inconsistent or incomplete data.  As compliance must be achieved and in order to avoid excluding DSPs from the incident notification obliga- tions due to the impossibility to obtain the data, a simple yet straightforward approach should be applied.  For example, determining the societal and economic impact based on the recorded effects onto predefined  thresholds of users might be an option. Absolute thresholds (e.g. 1 mil users.) or relative thresholds (per- centages of population) could therefore be used. You can find a detailed proposal on this topic in Annex A.  Below you can find a tentative definition of the parameter, in the context of the Directive:  Extent of the impact on economic and societal activities = the effects produced by a cybersecurity inci- dent at DSP level that, as a result, affected the overall community, disrupting its normal functioning,  generating either economic or social negative consequences.  3.3.6 Other issues related to parameters  During the stocktaking with private sector and public authorities within EU, several concerns were raised  regarding some of the provisions that were considered not sufficiently explained within the text of the di- rective.  One of them is the noticeable distinction on many areas between the different types of DSPs. Although the  NISD does not strike a difference between the three types of DSPs, most of the private respondents have  clearly stated that there should be a rigorous distinction between them due to different factors such as  criticality, technical particularities in use and economic and societal impact. At the same time, the NISD does  not restrict the adoption of subsequent policies that distinguish between the types of DSPs.  Cloud services are considered the most critical out of the three categories due to their obvious potential for  captive consumer patterns. In case of failure, users cannot instantly migrate to another cloud provider.  Obtaining the necessary products and services on time, through online market places, is utterly important,  especially for businesses that rely on this kind of service. Nevertheless, in most of the cases (besides the  ones where exclusivity is offered to certain online market places) the services or products needed can be  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  28  found in similar stores, of course at different prices and maybe different delivery times. However, nowadays  business good practices regarding supply chain security encourage companies as well as consumers to have  at least two alternatives when purchasing certain products or services. Considering this, we may infer that,  to some extent, online market places are not generally as critical as cloud services could be, at least not in  the majority of the cases.  As for the search engines, the situation is considered even less critical, by the providers themselves even.  You can always turn to another provider in case of failure by your favourite search engine. Indeed, it might  be an issue in both cases (online marketplaces and search engines) if some other services are dependent on  particular providers. Overall though, from total dependency to partial dependency, there are several aspects  that the private sector deems important be included in the provisions.  Last, but not least, one issue relates to the possibility of using different reporting formats and procedures  per type of provider. As explained also in the previous subchapters, there are some technical particularities  for each of the three types of providers concerned by the NISD. Not addressing them early on might even- tually prove to be a mistake, as some parameters required by the directive cannot be measured in the same  way for the different providers (e.g. number of users further explained here). It is indeed the expressed  opinion of most of the private sector respondents, along with some Member States respondents, that this  technical concern regarding incident reporting for DSPs should be addressed in the implementing act. To  this end, different measurement units and different thresholds might be applied, based on the DSP type.  The proposal within Annex A takes this requirement into account.  Determining substantial incidents  Art. 16 (3) of the NISD requires DSPs to notify with undue delay “any incident having a substantial impact on  the provision of a service”. Further, paragraph (4) of the same article mentions that in order to determine if  an incident is substantial, a series of parameters must be taken into account. All those parameters have been  explained in section 2.5, but the definition of “substantial impact” lies nowhere within the directive. Like- wise, the use of thresholds is not properly mentioned within the NISD, neither provisioned nor certainly  forbidden. This leaves some room for adaption and customization at national decision-making level, when  building second level legislation or other policies in the field.  However, in order to develop an efficient and useful EU-wide incident reporting policy, one must take into  account the following:   The objective of the NISD is to assure a high common level of network and information security  across EU. Achieving a common level between Member States usually means adopting some sort of  common denominators or, at least, common values to be mutually adopted by all players. This is  particularly important for levelling the security across EU countries and offering the community a  set of reference values to work with.   As stated in recital 49 of the NISD “because of their cross-border nature, digital service providers  should be subject to a more harmonised approach at Union level”. In this respect, the adoption of  implementing acts should facilitate the specification and implementation of such measures in a  more harmonised way. To achieve the harmonisation objective DSPs should first undertake a com- mon minimum set of security measures and the same set of incident notification provisions across  EU, irrespective of the authority governing upon their activity.   Article 16 (4) mentions that, in order to determine substantial incidents, a unique set of parameters  should be applied no matter the country where the DSP operates. Again, it is reasonable to assume  that common thresholds must accompany the adoption of common parameters so that the meas- urement and, most importantly, interpretations can be reliable, representative and can inform fur- ther policy decisions in all Member States.  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  29  As a practical and rational conclusion to all three points explained above, it is our understanding that the  adoption of common thresholds is necessary in achieving EU level harmonisation in terms of incident notifi- cation.  Applying an incident notification policy across EU without having proper thresholds would not help achieve  many of the objectives of the directive, i.e. “common level of network and information security”. An incident  notification policy without thresholds would only create further confusion and possible discriminatory prac- tices against DSPs due to different approaches adopted by the Member States.  A comprehensive approach based on relative and absolute thresholds should therefore be applied to identify  EU-wide incidents that indeed might have a substantial impact on the internal market.  The section below and Annex A contains a full non-binding proposal on how to determine the impact of  incidents based on parameters and thresholds.  3.4.1 Proposed procedure/algorithm for determining the impact of incidents  The NISD leaves plenty of room for interpretation in what regards incident notification provisions for DSPs.  Through this paper we tried to further explain some key concepts and fill in some gaps, with the belief that  it could improve the conditions for smooth implementation of the incident notification provisions. One of  the main proposals that we presented in section 2.6 was the introduction of thresholds in the incident re- porting process.  The purpose of this annex is to describe our non-binding proposal on how thresholds could be applied  within the context of the NISD.  When reading the current proposal, please take into account the following aspects:   All requirements of the NISD were taken into account, so that the proposal can seamlessly fit the  necessities (i.e. the proposal is based on all parameters proposed by the directive).   A three level scale of criticality was introduced to better classify incidents according to their impact.  Please read Annex A for an explanation of all three levels (RED, ORANGE, YELLOW). Reporting starts  from YELLOW.   A simple yet comprehensive approach was embraced. Simplicity was needed to avoid overburdening  the DSPs and national authorities with obtaining data that was not collected organically.   Due to the diversified (and sometimes contradictory) set of approaches observed from the industry  and Member States, identifying a common denominator only by compiling the answers was impossi- ble. The private sector has a business driven approach, sometimes using parameters and thresholds  that are not entirely relevant in the context of the NISD (e.g. parameter: percentage of lost services).  In this respect, previous ENISA experience in incident reporting schemes was very useful in fine-tuning  the results obtained with the overall context of the Directive.   The proposal is organised as a logical scheme, an algorithm, where all steps must be fulfilled before  reaching the final result.   All thresholds proposed are based on the results of the survey and ENISA’s previous experience. We  do understand that in particular cases updates could be needed to reflect real life situations, but this  task was beyond ENISA’s capabilities given the resources the time constraints. We do acknowledge  that further effort needs to be deployed by ENISA within the Cooperation Group as well as to assist  the Comitology Committee’s work in order to achieve optimal values.   A 2 step reporting approach is proposed, with a preliminary reporting in due time after the incident  and a full reporting in 2-3 days after detection.  Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  30  When trying to determine the impact of an incident the following steps should be applied (graphical view  Fig. 8):  1. STEP 1: Identify the geographical spread of the incident  At this level, a DSP should identify if the provision of the service concerned (NIS downtime) was affected  within the EU political borders. If a positive result will come out, the countries affected should be iden- tified. Based on the number of countries affected, the colour code of this parameter is to be assigned.  At this stage there is no need to identify if users were indeed affected within EU borders, but just to  identify if the service was properly accessible in EU Member States.  Question to answer on STEP 1: Does the incident affect the proper accessibility of the service within  EU?  2. STEP 2: Determine the extent of the disruption  The extent of the disruption must be analysed taking into account the 4 protection goals expressed  within the Directive: integrity affected (information or output provided altered), confidentiality affected  (interception, unauthorized access), availability affected (service degraded, interrupted and/or unusa- ble), authenticity affected (cannot be trusted). Based on the number of affected protection goals the  impact colour code is assigned. If an incident can be identified as affecting at least one of the 4 proper- ties above, it shall be classified as YELLOW. If more properties are affected the colour code is attributed  accordingly.  Question to answer on STEP 2: Is the service unavailable, unusable or unsafe to use due to the inci- dent?  3. STEP 3: Determining the USERTIME  The two parameters “number of users affected” and “duration of the incident” were merged into a  single one entitled USERTIME. We considered the merge necessary for achieving better flexibility in  covering real life scenarios (very long incidents with few users affected or very short incidents with  many users affected). USERTIME is based on relative and absolute thresholds. The relative one refers  to the percentage of the population being affected in one Member State. In our example it starts from  more than 5% for at least one hour, or more than 1% for at least 4 hours. The absolute threshold is  measured in fixed values and it has to reach more than 60 million user-minutes per incident. For more  details, please see Annex A. For this parameter, no colour code is to be applied. If the critical threshold  is exceeded, the incident should be reported. For the purpose of reporting, any type of user can be  included, but a classification (based on the types enumerated in section 2.5.1) is to be preferred if the  DSP is able to provide one.  Question to answer on STEP 3: Does the impairment caused by the incident is above the absolute or  relative thresholds in terms of USERTIME?  4. STEP 4: Determining the extent of the impact on economic and societal activities  The overall purpose of the NISD is to protect the internal market from damages produced by cyber- incidents. Identifying the real economic and societal impact for every incident is challenging for both  DSPs and national authorities, as most of the information needed resides outside their organisations.  Therefore, this is mainly an estimative exercise aiming at giving the EU authorities a glimpse into the  potential disruptive effects upon the internal market and EU citizens. In this respect, the approach pro- posed in step 4 is based on predefined levels of affected users. The more users are affected the bigger  the potential impact. We do understand that the numbers provided might not be very illustrative for all  Member States and further adjusting might be necessary during implementation.

Conclusions  The current study has uncovered serious issues that must be addressed while implementing the DSP incident  reporting provisions of the NISD. The multitude of technical approaches mirrored the numerous discrepancies  between types of DSPs and the corresponding business models adopted, thus creating a deep pool of some- times incompatible variables that must be taken into account when approaching such a regulation. For example,  a simple parameter imposed by the Directive, such as “number of users”, can mean different things to different  types of providers, from simple visitors or registered individuals to corporate users and dependant services.  Achieving convergence between the myriad of existing approaches while sticking to the formal requirements  might be troublesome. Nevertheless, the EU’s first DSP incident notification requirements as part of the first  EU wide set of rules on cyber-security are a major step forward towards achieving a common level of cyber- security across the Union. In a perpetually fluctuating technological landscape that affects our livelihoods while  having increasing economic and societal impact as a whole, a first step, in understanding the real threats and  vulnerabilities that we have to confront, has been taken through the adoption of the NISD along with its two  main requirements: mandatory incident notification and minimum security measures. From now on, a “small  steps” approach must be applied in implementing the Directive, that has to undergo periodic reviews and up- dates.  This document provides a preliminary guideline on how incident notification provisions for DSPs could be ef- fectively implemented across EU. Based on valuable input from Member States and companies directly im- pacted by the Directive, this guideline arises from their good practices in matters such as identifying types of  incidents, parameters and thresholds and results in an outline technical proposal that can tentatively be applied  across EU.  At the same time, this guideline serves as a technical input to the foregoing process of adopting the implement- ing act that will further specify details regarding the incident notification provisions of the NISD.

Incident notification for DSPs in the context of the NIS Directive  FEBRUARY 2017  34  Table 1 - Proposal for measuring impact of incidents within the NISD  Explanation: If the values provided by DSPs (users, time) are above the relative OR absolute thresholds,  the incident can be considered as fulfilling the requirements of the third step of the algorithm (P3). NO  color codes shall be applied here.  Algorithm: Incidents above the relative thresholds (Table 1, percentage of the population or percentage  of their user base) are reportable. Incidents that are NOT above the relative threshold, but are above the  absolute threshold are also reportable. The universal absolute threshold is 60 mil. user minutes per inci- dent but only if it affects more than 25.000/10.000 users or lasts more than one hour. The user minutes  are obtained by multiplying the nr. of users affected with the duration of the incident.  Examples:  - 25.000 users X 60 mins=1.200.000 userminutes=NOT REPORTABLE.  - 25.000 users X 2.400 mins=60.000.000 userminutes=REPORTABLE.  - 1.000.000 users X 59 mins=70.800.000 userminutes=NOT REPORTABLE.  - 1.000.000 USERS X 60 mins=60.000.000 userminutes=REPORTABLE.

As determining the real impact might be troublesome for DSPs and Mem- ber States also, the proposal is to measure only the number of users affected and use the color code form  the next column.

ITL develops tests, test 97  methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance 98  the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the 99  development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for 100  the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in 101  federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research, 102  guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities 103  with industry, government, and academic organizations. 104  Abstract 105  This document provides guidance on how to secure operational technology (OT), while 106  addressing their unique performance, reliability, and safety requirements. OT encompasses a 107  broad range of programmable systems and devices that interact with the physical environment 108  (or manage devices that interact with the physical environment). These systems and devices 109  detect or cause a direct change through monitoring and/or control of devices, processes, and 110  events. Examples include industrial control systems, building automation systems, transportation 111  systems, physical access control systems, physical environment monitoring systems, and 112  physical environment measurement systems. The document provides an overview of OT and 113  typical system topologies, identifies typical threats and vulnerabilities to these systems, and 114  provides recommended security countermeasures to mitigate the associated risks. 115  Keywords  116  Computer security; distributed control systems (DCS); industrial control systems (ICS); 117  information security; network security; operational technology (OT); programmable logic 118  controllers (PLC); risk management; security controls; supervisory control and data acquisition 119  (SCADA) systems 120  121  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  iii  Acknowledgments for DRAFT Revision 3 122  The authors gratefully acknowledge and appreciate the significant contributions from Sallie 123  Edwards, Blaine Jefferies, Adam Hahn, John Hoyt, Stephanie Saravia, Aslam Sherule, and 124  Michael Thompson from The MITRE Corporation, and Megan Corso and Brett Ramsay from the 125  Department of Defense.

PUBLIC DRAFT  xv  Executive Summary  482  This document provides guidance for establishing secure operational technology (OT)1 while 483  addressing OT’s unique performance, reliability, and safety requirements. OT encompasses a 484  broad range of programmable systems and devices that interact with the physical environment 485  (or manage devices that interact with the physical environment). These systems and devices 486  detect or cause a direct change through monitoring and/or control of devices, processes, and 487  events. Examples include industrial control systems (ICS), building automation systems, 488  transportation systems, physical access control systems, physical environment monitoring 489  systems, and physical environment measurement systems. The document provides an overview 490  of OT and typical system topologies, identifies typical threats and vulnerabilities for these 491  systems, and recommends security countermeasures to mitigate the associated risks. 492  OT is critical to the operation of U.S. critical infrastructures, which are often highly 493  interconnected, mutually dependent systems. It is important to note that while federal agencies 494  operate many of the nation’s critical infrastructures, many others are privately owned and 495  operated. Additionally, critical infrastructures are often referred to as a “system of systems” 496  because of the interdependencies that exist between various industrial sectors as well as 497  interconnections between business partners. 498  Initially, OT had little resemblance to traditional information technology (IT) systems in that OT 499  systems were isolated, ran proprietary control protocols, and used specialized hardware and 500  software. As OT are adopting IT solutions to promote corporate business systems connectivity 501  and remote access capabilities, and being designed and implemented using industry-standard 502  computers, operating systems (OSs), and network protocols, they are starting to resemble IT 503  systems. This integration supports new IT capabilities, but it provides significantly less isolation 504  for OT from the outside world than predecessor systems, creating a greater need to secure OT 505  systems. The increasing use of wireless networking places OT implementations at greater risk 506  from adversaries who are in relatively close physical proximity but do not have direct physical 507  access to the equipment. While security solutions have been designed to deal with these issues in 508  typical IT systems, special precautions must be taken when introducing these same solutions to 509  OT environments. In some cases, new security solutions are needed that are tailored to the OT 510  environment. 511  Although some characteristics are similar, OT also have characteristics that differ from 512  traditional information processing systems. Many of these differences stem from the fact that 513  logic executing in OT has a direct effect on the physical world. Some of these characteristics 514  include significant risk to the health and safety of human lives and serious damage to the 515  environment, as well as serious financial issues such as production losses, negative impact to a 516  nation’s economy, and compromise of proprietary information. OT have unique performance and 517  reliability requirements and often use OSs and applications that may be considered 518  unconventional to typical IT personnel. Furthermore, the goals of safety and efficiency 519  sometimes conflict with security in the design and operation of OT systems. 520  1  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/operational-technology-security  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/operational-technology-security  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  xvi  OT cybersecurity programs should always be part of broader OT safety and reliability programs 521  at both industrial sites and enterprise cybersecurity programs, because cybersecurity is essential 522  to the safe and reliable operation of modern industrial processes. Threats to OT systems can 523  come from numerous sources, including hostile governments, terrorist groups, disgruntled 524  employees, malicious intruders, complexities, accidents, and natural disasters as well as 525  malicious actions by insiders. OT security objectives typically follow the priority of integrity and 526  availability, followed by confidentiality. 527  Possible incidents an OT system may face include the following: 528   Blocked or delayed flow of information through OT networks, which could disrupt OT 529  operation. 530   Unauthorized changes to instructions, commands, or alarm thresholds, which could damage, 531  disable, or shut down equipment, create environmental impacts, and/or endanger human life. 532   Inaccurate information sent to system operators, either to disguise unauthorized changes or to 533  cause operators to initiate inappropriate actions, which could have various negative effects. 534   Modified OT software or configuration settings, or OT software infected with malware, 535  which could have various negative effects. 536   Interference with the operation of equipment protection systems, which could endanger 537  costly and difficult-to-replace equipment. 538   Interference with the operation of safety systems, which could endanger human life. 539  Major security objectives for an OT implementation should include the following: 540   Restrict logical access to the OT network, network activity, and systems. This may 541  include using unidirectional gateways, utilizing a demilitarized zone (DMZ) network 542  architecture with firewalls to prevent network traffic from passing directly between the 543  corporate and OT networks, and having separate authentication mechanisms and credentials 544  for users of the corporate and OT networks. The OT system should also use a network 545  topology that has multiple layers, with the most critical communications occurring in the 546  most secure and reliable layer.  547   Restrict physical access to the OT network and devices. Unauthorized physical access to 548  components could cause serious disruption of the OT’s functionality. A combination of 549  physical access controls should be used, such as locks, card readers, and/or guards.  550   Protect individual OT components from exploitation. This includes deploying security 551  patches in as expeditious a manner as possible after testing them under field conditions; 552  disabling all unused ports and services and assuring that they remain disabled; restricting OT 553  user privileges to only those that are required for each user’s role; tracking and monitoring 554  audit trails; and using security controls such as antivirus software and file integrity checking 555  software where technically feasible to prevent, deter, detect, and mitigate malware. Keys of 556  OT assets like programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and safety systems should be in the 557  “Run” position at all times unless they are being actively programmed. 558  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  xvii   Restrict unauthorized modification of data. This includes data that is in transit (at least 559  across network boundaries) and at rest. 560   Detect security events and incidents. Detecting security events, which have not yet 561  escalated into incidents, can help defenders break the attack chain before attackers attain their 562  objectives. This includes the capability to detect failed OT components, unavailable services, 563  and exhausted resources that are important to provide proper and safe functioning of the OT 564  system. 565   Maintain functionality during adverse conditions. This involves designing the OT system 566  so that each critical component has a redundant counterpart. Additionally, if a component 567  fails, it should fail in a manner that does not generate unnecessary traffic on the OT or other 568  networks, nor causes another problem elsewhere, such as a cascading event. The OT system 569  should also allow for graceful degradation such as moving from “normal operation” with full 570  automation to “emergency operation” with operators more involved and less automation to 571  “manual operation” with no automation. 572   Restore the system after an incident. Incidents are inevitable and an incident response plan 573  is essential. A major characteristic of a good security program is how quickly the system can 574  be recovered after an incident has occurred. 575  To properly address security in an OT system, it is essential for a cross-functional cybersecurity 576  team to share their varied domain knowledge and experience to evaluate and mitigate risk to the 577  OT system. The cybersecurity team should consist of a member of the organization’s IT staff, 578  control engineer, control system operator, network and system security expert, a member of the 579  management staff, and a member of the physical security department at a minimum. For 580  continuity and completeness, the cybersecurity team should consult with the control system 581  vendor and/or system integrator as well. The cybersecurity team should coordinate closely with 582  site management (e.g., facility superintendent) and the company’s Chief Information Officer 583  (CIO) or Chief Security Officer (CSO), who in turn, along with the Chief Executive Officer 584  (CEO) or Chief Operating Officer (COO), accepts complete responsibility and accountability for 585  the cybersecurity of the OT system and for any safety incidents, reliability incidents, or 586  equipment damage caused directly or indirectly by cyber incidents. An effective cybersecurity 587  program for an OT system should apply a strategy known as “defense-in-depth,” layering 588  security mechanisms such that the impact of a failure in any one mechanism is minimized. 589  Organizations should not rely on “security by obscurity.” 590  In a typical OT system this means a defense-in-depth strategy that includes:   Developing security policies, procedures, training and educational material that apply  specifically to the OT system.   Considering OT security policies and procedures based on the National Terrorism Advisory  System, deploying increasingly heightened security postures as the Threat Level increases.   Addressing security throughout the life cycle of the OT system, including architecture  design, procurement, installation, maintenance, and decommissioning.  https://www.dhs.gov/national-terrorism-advisory-system https://www.dhs.gov/national-terrorism-advisory-system  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  xviii   Implementing a network topology for the OT system that has multiple layers, with the most  critical communications occurring in the most secure and reliable layer.   Providing logical separation between the corporate and OT networks (e.g., stateful  inspection firewall(s) between the networks, unidirectional gateways).   Employing a DMZ network architecture (e.g., prevent direct traffic between the corporate  and OT networks).   Ensuring that critical components are redundant and are on redundant networks.   Designing critical systems for graceful degradation (fault tolerant) to prevent catastrophic  cascading events.   Disabling unused ports and services on OT devices after assuring through testing that it will  not impact OT operation.   Restricting physical access to the OT network and devices.   Restricting OT user privileges to only those that are required to perform each user’s function  (e.g., establishing role-based access control, configuring each role based on the principle of  least privilege).   Using separate authentication mechanisms and credentials for users of the OT network and  the corporate network (i.e., OT network accounts do not use corporate network user  accounts).   Using modern technology, such as smart cards for user authentication   Implementing security controls such as intrusion detection software, antivirus software and  file integrity checking software, where technically feasible, to prevent, deter, detect, and  mitigate the introduction, exposure, and propagation of malicious software to, within, and  from the OT system.   Applying security techniques such as encryption and/or cryptographic hashes to OT data  storage and communications where determined appropriate.   Expeditiously deploying security patches after testing all patches under field conditions on a  test system if possible, before installation on the OT system.   Tracking and monitoring audit trails on critical areas of the OT system.   Employing reliable and secure network protocols and services where feasible.  NIST, in cooperation with the public and private sector OT community, has developed specific 591  guidance on the application of the security controls in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 592  Revision 5, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations [SP800-593  53r5], to OT. This guidance is included in Appendix F of this document. 594  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  xix  While many of the controls in Appendix F of SP 800-53 Rev. 5 are applicable to OT as written, 595  some controls require OT-specific interpretation and/or augmentation by adding one or more of 596  the following to the control: 597   OT Discussion provides organizations with additional information on the application of the 598  security controls and control enhancements in Appendix F to OT and the environments in 599  which these specialized systems operate. The guidance also provides information as to why a 600  particular security control or control enhancement may not be applicable in some OT 601  environments or may be a candidate for tailoring (i.e., the application of scoping guidance 602  and/or compensating controls). OT Discussion does not replace the original Supplemental 603  Guidance in Appendix F. 604   Control Enhancements (one or more) provide augmentations to the original control that 605  may be required for some OT systems. 606  The most successful method for securing OT systems is to gather industry recommended  practices and engage in a proactive, collaborative effort between management, the OT  engineers and operators, the IT organization, and a trusted OT advisor. This team should  draw upon the wealth of information available from ongoing federal government, industry  groups, and vendor and standards activities listed in Appendix D.  607  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  1  1 Introduction 608  1.1 Purpose and Scope 609  The purpose of this document is to provide guidance for establishing secure operational 610  technology (OT)2 while addressing OT’s unique performance, reliability, and safety 611  requirements. The document gives an overview of OT systems and typical system topologies, 612  identifies typical threats and vulnerabilities for these systems, and recommends security 613  countermeasures to mitigate the associated risks. Additionally, it presents an OT-tailored security 614  control overlay based on NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 Rev. 5 [SP800-53r5] that 615  customizes controls for the unique characteristics of the OT domain. The body of the document 616  provides context for the overlay, but the overlay is intended to stand alone. 617  Because there are many types of OT with varying levels of potential risk and impact, this 618  document provides a list of many methods and techniques for securing OT systems. The 619  document should not be used purely as a checklist to secure a specific system. Readers are 620  encouraged to perform a risk-based assessment on their systems and to tailor the recommended 621  guidelines and solutions to meet their specific security, business and operational requirements. 622  The range of applicability of the basic concepts for securing OT systems presented in this 623  document continues to expand. 624  1.2 Audience 625  This document covers details specific to OT systems. Readers of this document should be 626  acquainted with general computer security concepts and with communication protocols such as 627  those used in networking. The document is technical in nature; however, it provides the 628  necessary background to understand the topics that are discussed.  629  The intended audience is varied and includes the following: 630   Control engineers, integrators, and architects who design or implement OT systems 631   System administrators, engineers, and other information technology (IT) professionals who 632  administer, patch, or secure OT systems 633   Security consultants who perform security assessments and penetration testing of OT systems 634   Managers who are responsible for OT systems 635   Senior management who need to better understand risk for OT systems as they justify and 636  apply an OT cybersecurity program 637   Researchers and analysts who are trying to understand the unique security needs of OT 638  systems 639  2  The acronym “OT” can stand for either “operational technology” or “operational technologies.” The context around the  acronym, especially the use of singular or plural words, will indicate which meaning is intended.  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  2   Vendors that are developing products that will be deployed as part of an OT system 640  1.3 Document Structure 641  The remainder of this document is divided into the following major sections: 642   Section 2 gives an overview of OT, including a comparison between OT and IT systems. 643   Section 3 discusses the development and deployment of an OT cybersecurity program to 644  mitigate risk for the vulnerabilities identified in Appendix C. 645   Section 4 examines OT security risk management and applying the Risk Management 646  Framework to OT systems. 647   Section 5 provides recommendations for integrating security into network architectures 648  typically found in OT systems, with an emphasis on network segmentation and separation 649  practices. 650   Section 6 offers guidance on applying the Cybersecurity Framework to OT systems. 651   The References section provides a list of references used in the development of this 652  document. 653  The guide also contains several appendices with supporting material, as follows: 654   Appendix A lists acronyms and abbreviations used in this document. 655   Appendix B contains a glossary of terms used in this document. 656   Appendix C discusses OT threat sources, vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions, threat 657  events, and incidents. 658   Appendix D presents lists and descriptions of OT security organizations, research, and 659  activities. 660   Appendix E discusses various OT security capabilities and tools. 661   Appendix F defines an SP 800-53, Revision 5 OT overlay, listing security controls, 662  enhancements, and supplemental guidance that apply specifically to OT systems.  663  664  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  3  2 OT Overview 665  Operational technology (OT)3 encompasses a broad range of programmable systems and devices 666  that interact with the physical environment (or manage devices that interact with the physical 667  environment). These systems and devices detect or cause a direct change through monitoring 668  and/or control of devices, processes, and events. Examples include industrial control systems, 669  building automation systems, transportation systems, physical access control systems, physical 670  environment monitoring systems, and physical environment measurement systems.  671  OT systems consist of combinations of control components (e.g., electrical, mechanical, 672  hydraulic, pneumatic) that act together to achieve an objective (e.g., manufacturing, 673  transportation of matter or energy). The part of the system primarily concerned with producing 674  an output is referred to as the process. The part of the system primarily concerned with 675  maintaining conformance with specifications is referred to as the controller (or control). The 676  control components of the system include the specification of the desired output or performance. 677  The system can be configured in one of three ways: 678   open-loop: the output is controlled by established settings 679   closed-loop: the output has an effect on the input in such a way as to maintain the desired 680  control objective 681   manual mode: the system is controlled completely by humans 682  This section provides an overview of several types of common OT systems, including 683  supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), distributed control systems (DCS), 684  programmable logic controllers (PLCs), building automation systems (BAS), physical access 685  control systems (PACS), and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Diagrams depict the typical 686  network topology, connections, components, and protocols typically used for each system type. 687  These examples only attempt to identify notional topology concepts. Actual implementations of 688  these types of control systems may be hybrids that blur the lines between them. Note that the 689  diagrams in this section do not focus on securing OT. Security architecture and security controls 690  are discussed in Section 5 and Appendix F of this document, respectively. 691  2.1 Evolution of OT 692  Much of today’s OT evolved from the insertion of IT capabilities into existing physical systems, 693  often replacing or supplementing physical control mechanisms. For example, embedded digital 694  controls replaced analog mechanical controls in rotating machines and engines. Improvements in 695  cost and performance have encouraged this evolution, resulting in many of today’s “smart” 696  technologies such as the smart electric grid, smart transportation, smart buildings, smart 697  manufacturing, and the Internet of Things. While this increases the connectivity and criticality of 698  these systems, it also creates a greater need for their adaptability, resilience, safety, and security. 699  Engineering of OT continues to evolve to provide new capabilities while maintaining the typical 700  long life cycles of these systems. The introduction of IT capabilities into physical systems 701  3  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/operational-technology-security  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/operational-technology-security  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  4  presents emergent behavior that has security implications. Engineering models and analysis are 702  evolving to address these emergent properties, including safety, security, privacy, and 703  environmental impact interdependencies.  704  2.2 OT-Based Systems and Their Interdependencies 705  OT is used in many industries and critical infrastructures, including those identified by the 706  Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) as critical infrastructure sectors listed 707  below. Critical infrastructures that typically contain OT are bolded. 708   Chemical Sector 709   Commercial Facilities Sector 710   Communications Sector 711   Critical Manufacturing Sector 712   Dams Sector 713   Defense Industrial Base Sector 714   Emergency Services Sector 715   Energy Sector 716   Financial Services Sector 717   Food and Agriculture Sector 718   Government Facilities Sector 719   Healthcare and Public Health Sector 720   Information Technology Sector 721   Nuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste Sector 722   Transportation Systems Sector 723   Water and Wastewater Systems Sector 724  OT is critical to the operation of the U.S. critical infrastructures that are often highly 725  interconnected and mutually dependent systems. It is important to note that while federal 726  agencies operate many of the critical infrastructures mentioned above, many others are privately 727  owned and operated. Additionally, critical infrastructures are often referred to as a “system of 728  systems” because of the interdependencies that exist between various industrial sectors and the 729  interconnections between business partners [Peerenboom][Rinaldi]. Overall, critical 730  infrastructures are highly interconnected and mutually dependent in complex ways, both 731  physically and through a host of information and communications technologies. An incident in 732  one infrastructure can directly and indirectly affect other infrastructures through cascading and 733  escalating failures. 734  For example, both the electrical power transmission and distribution grid industries use 735  geographically distributed SCADA control technology to operate highly interconnected and 736  https://www.cisa.gov/critical-infrastructure-sectors  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  5  dynamic systems consisting of thousands of public and private utilities and rural cooperatives for 737  supplying electricity to end users. Some SCADA systems monitor and control electricity 738  distribution by collecting data from and issuing commands to geographically remote field control 739  stations from a centralized location. SCADA systems are also used to monitor and control water, 740  oil, and natural gas distribution, including pipelines, ships, trucks, and rail systems, as well as 741  wastewater collection systems. 742  SCADA systems and DCS are often networked together. This is the case for electric power 743  control centers and electric power generation facilities. Although electric power generation 744  facility operation is controlled by a DCS, the DCS must communicate with the SCADA system 745  to coordinate production output with transmission and distribution demands. 746  Electric power is often thought to be one of the most prevalent sources of disruptions of 747  interdependent critical infrastructures. As an example, a cascading failure can be initiated by a 748  disruption of the microwave communications network used for an electric power transmission 749  SCADA system. The lack of monitoring and control capabilities could cause a large generating 750  unit to be taken offline, an event that would lead to loss of power at a transmission substation. 751  This loss could cause a major imbalance, triggering a cascading failure across the power grid. 752  This could result in large area blackouts that could potentially affect oil and natural gas 753  production, refinery operations, water treatment systems, wastewater collection systems, and 754  pipeline transport systems that rely on the grid for electric power. 755  2.3 OT System Operation, Architectures, and Components 756  As Figure 1 depicts, a typical OT system contains numerous control loops, human-machine 757  interfaces, and remote diagnostics and maintenance tools. The system is built using an array of 758  network protocols on layered network architectures. Some critical processes may also include 759  safety systems.  760  A control loop utilizes sensors, actuators, and controllers to manipulate some controlled process. 761  A sensor is a device that produces a measurement of some physical property and then sends this 762  information as controlled variables to the controller. The controller interprets the signals and 763  generates corresponding manipulated variables, based on a control algorithm and target set 764  points, which it transmits to the actuators. Actuators such as control valves, breakers, switches, 765  and motors are used to directly manipulate the controlled process based on commands from the 766  controller.  767  In a typical monitoring system, there are no direct connections between the sensors and any 768  actuators. Sensor values are transmitted to a monitoring station to be analyzed by a human. 769  However, these types of systems can still be considered OT systems (albeit with a human-in-the-770  loop) because the objective of the monitoring system is likely to identify and ultimately mitigate 771  an event or condition (e.g., a door alerting that it has been forced opened, resulting in security 772  personnel being sent to investigate; an environmental sensor alerting to high temperatures in a 773  server room, resulting in control center personnel activating an auxiliary air conditioning unit).  774  Operators and engineers use human-machine interfaces (HMIs) to monitor and configure set 775  points, control algorithms, and adjust and establish parameters in the controller. The HMI also 776  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  6  displays process status information and historical information. Diagnostics and maintenance 777  utilities are used to prevent, identify, and recover from abnormal operation or failures.  778  Sometimes control loops are nested and/or cascading, whereby the set point for one loop is based 779  on the process variable determined by another loop. Supervisory-level loops and lower-level 780  loops operate continuously over the duration of a process, with cycle times ranging on the order 781  of milliseconds to minutes. 782  783  Figure 1: Basic operation of a typical OT system 784  2.3.1 OT System Design Considerations 785  The design of an OT system, including whether a SCADA, DCS, or PLC-based topology is used 786  depends on many factors. This section identifies key factors that drive design decisions regarding 787  the control, communication, reliability, and redundancy properties of the OT system. Because 788  these factors heavily influence the design of the OT system, they also help determine the 789  system’s security needs.  790   Control Timing Requirements. System processes have a wide range of time-related 791  requirements, including very high speed, consistency, regularity, and synchronization. 792  Humans may not be able to reliably and consistently meet these requirements; automated 793  controllers may be necessary. Some systems may require computation to be performed as 794  close to sensors and actuators as possible to reduce communication latency and perform 795  necessary control actions on time.  796  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  7   Geographic Distribution. Systems have varying degrees of distribution, ranging from a 797  small system (e.g., local PLC-controlled process) to large, distributed systems (e.g., oil 798  pipelines, electric power grids). Greater distribution typically implies a need for wide area 799  networking (e.g., leased lines, circuit switching, packet switching) and mobile 800  communication.  801   Hierarchy. Supervisory control is used to provide a central location that can aggregate data 802  from multiple locations to support control decisions based on the current state of the system. 803  Often a hierarchical/centralized control is used to provide human operators with a 804  comprehensive view of the entire system.  805   Control Complexity. Often control functions can be performed by simple controllers and 806  preset algorithms. However, more complex systems (e.g., air traffic control) require human 807  operators to ensure that all control actions are appropriate for meeting the larger objectives of 808  the system. 809   Availability. Availability (i.e., reliability) requirements of the system are also an important 810  factor in design. Systems with strong availability/up-time requirements may require more 811  redundancy or alternate implementations across all communications and control. 812   Impact of Failures. The failure of a control function could cause substantially different 813  impacts across domains. Systems with greater impacts often require the ability to continue 814  operations through redundant controls or to operate in a degraded state. The design needs to 815  address these requirements. 816   Safety. The system’s safety requirements are an important factor in design. Systems must be 817  able to detect unsafe conditions and trigger actions to reduce unsafe conditions to safe ones. 818  In most safety-critical operations, human oversight and control of a potentially dangerous 819  process is an essential part of the safety system. 820  2.3.2 SCADA Systems 821  Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems are used to control dispersed assets 822  where centralized data acquisition is as important as control [Bailey][Boyer]. These systems are 823  used in distribution systems such as water distribution and wastewater collection systems, oil and 824  natural gas pipelines, electrical utility transmission and distribution systems, and rail and other 825  public transportation systems. SCADA systems integrate data acquisition systems with data 826  transmission systems and HMI software to provide a centralized monitoring and control system 827  for numerous process inputs and outputs. SCADA systems are designed to collect field 828  information, transfer it to a control center, and display the information to the operator graphically 829  or textually, thereby allowing the operator to monitor or control an entire system from a central 830  location in near real-time. Based on the sophistication and setup of the individual system, control 831  of any individual system, operation, or task can be automatic, or it can be performed by operator 832  commands.  833  Typical hardware includes a control server placed at a control center, communications equipment 834  (e.g., radio, telephone line, cable, or satellite), and one or more geographically distributed field 835  sites consisting of remote terminal units (RTUs) and/or PLCs, which control actuators and/or 836  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  8  monitor sensors. The control server stores and processes the information from RTU inputs and 837  outputs, while the RTU or PLC controls the local process. The communications hardware allows 838  the transfer of information and data back and forth between the control server and the RTUs or 839  PLCs. The software is programmed to tell the system what and when to monitor, what parameter 840  ranges are acceptable, and what response to initiate when a process variable changes outside 841  acceptable values. An intelligent electronic device (IED), such as a protective relay, may 842  communicate directly to the control server, or a local RTU may poll the IEDs to collect the data 843  and pass it to the control server. IEDs provide a direct interface to control and monitor 844  equipment and sensors. IEDs may be directly polled and controlled by the control server and in 845  most cases have local programming that allows for the IED to act without direct instructions 846  from the control center. SCADA systems are usually designed to be fault-tolerant systems with 847  significant redundancy built into the system, although redundancy may not be a sufficient 848  countermeasure in the face of malicious attack.  849  Figure 2 shows the components and general configuration of a SCADA system. The control 850  center at the top of the diagram houses a control server and the communications routers. Other 851  control center components include the HMI, engineering workstations, and the data historian, 852  which are all connected by a local area network (LAN). The control center collects and logs 853  information gathered by the field sites, displays information to the HMI, and may generate 854  actions based upon detected events. The control center is also responsible for centralized 855  alarming, trend analyses, and reporting.  856  The field sites at the bottom of Figure 2 perform local control of actuators and monitor sensors. 857  Field sites are often equipped with a remote access capability to allow operators to perform 858  remote diagnostics and repairs, usually over a separate dial-up modem or wide area network 859  (WAN) connection. Standard and proprietary communication protocols running over serial and 860  network communications are used to transport information between the control center and field 861  sites using telemetry techniques such as telephone line, cable, fiber, and radio frequencies (e.g., 862  broadcast, microwave, satellite). 863  SCADA communication topologies vary among implementations. The various topologies used, 864  including point-to-point, series, series-star, and multi-drop [AGA12], are shown in Figure 3. 865  Point-to-point is functionally the simplest type; however, it can be expensive because of the 866  individual channels needed for each connection. In a series configuration, the number of 867  channels used is reduced; however, channel sharing has an impact on the efficiency and 868  complexity of SCADA operations. Similarly, the series-star and multi-drop configurations’ use 869  of one channel per device results in decreased efficiency and increased system complexity.  870  The four basic SCADA topologies shown in Figure 3 can be further augmented by using 871  dedicated devices to manage communication exchanges and perform message switching and 872  buffering. Large SCADA systems containing hundreds of RTUs often employ a sub-control 873  server to alleviate the burden on the primary server. This type of topology is shown in Figure 4. 874  Figure 5 shows an example SCADA system implementation. This particular SCADA system 875  consists of a primary control center and three field sites. A second backup control center 876  provides redundancy in the event of a primary control center malfunction. Point-to-point 877  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  9  connections are used for all control center to field site communications, with two connections 878  using radio telemetry. The third field site is local to the control center and uses the WAN for 879  communications. A regional control center resides above the primary control center for a higher 880  level of supervisory control. The corporate enterprise network has access to all control centers 881  through the WAN, and field sites can be accessed remotely for troubleshooting and maintenance 882  operations. The primary control center polls field devices for data at defined intervals (e.g., 5 883  seconds, 60 seconds) and can send new set points to field devices as required. In addition to 884  polling and issuing high-level commands, the control server also watches for priority interrupts 885  coming from field site alarm systems. 886  887  Figure 2: A general SCADA system layout showing control center devices, communications equipment, and 888  field sites 889  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  10  890  891  Figure 3: Examples of point-to-point, series, series-star, and multi-drop SCADA communications topologies 892  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  11  893  Figure 4: Example SCADA topology to support a large number of remote stations 894  895  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  12  896  Figure 5: A comprehensive SCADA system implementation example897  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  13  Figure 6 shows an example implementation for rail monitoring and control. This example 898  includes a rail control center that houses the SCADA system and three sections of a rail system. 899  The SCADA system polls the rail sections for information such as the status of the trains, signal 900  systems, traction electrification systems, and ticket vending machines. This information is also 901  fed to operator consoles at the HMI stations within the rail control center. The SCADA system 902  monitors operator inputs at the rail control center and disperses high-level operator commands to 903  the rail section components. In addition, the SCADA system monitors conditions at the 904  individual rail sections and issues commands based on these conditions (e.g., stopping a train to 905  prevent it from entering an area that has been determined to be flooded or occupied by another 906  train based on condition monitoring). 907  908  Figure 6: An example rail monitoring and control SCADA system implementation 909  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  14  2.3.3 Distributed Control Systems 910  Distributed control systems (DCS) are used to control production systems within the same 911  geographic location for industries such as oil refineries, water and wastewater treatment, electric 912  power generation, chemical manufacturing, automotive production, and pharmaceutical 913  processing. These systems are usually process control or discrete part control systems.  914  DCS are integrated as a control architecture containing a supervisory level of control overseeing 915  multiple, integrated sub-systems that are responsible for controlling the details of a localized 916  process. A DCS uses a centralized supervisory control loop to mediate a group of localized 917  controllers that share the overall tasks of carrying out an entire production process [Erickson]. 918  Product and process control are usually achieved by deploying feedback or feedforward control 919  loops, whereby key product and/or process conditions are automatically maintained around a 920  desired set point. To accomplish the desired product and/or process tolerance around a specified 921  set point, specific process controllers or more capable PLCs are employed in the field and are 922  tuned to provide the desired tolerance as well as the rate of self-correction during process upsets. 923  By modularizing the production system, a DCS reduces the impact of a single fault on the overall 924  system. In many modern systems, the DCS is interfaced with the corporate enterprise network to 925  give business operations a view of production. 926  An example implementation showing the components and general configuration of a DCS is 927  depicted in Figure 7. This DCS encompasses an entire facility from the bottom-level production 928  processes up to the corporate enterprise layer. In this example, a supervisory controller (control 929  server) communicates to its subordinates via a control network. The supervisor sends set points 930  to and requests data from the distributed field controllers. The distributed controllers control their 931  process actuators based on control server commands and sensor feedback from process sensors.  932  Figure 7 gives examples of low-level controllers found on a DCS system. The field control 933  devices shown include a machine controller, a PLC, and a process controller. The machine 934  controller interfaces with sensors and actuators using point-to-point wiring, while the other three 935  field devices incorporate fieldbus networks to interface with process sensors and actuators. 936  Fieldbus networks eliminate the need for point-to-point wiring between a controller and 937  individual field sensors and actuators. Additionally, a fieldbus allows greater functionality 938  beyond control, including field device diagnostics, and can accomplish control algorithms within 939  the fieldbus, thereby avoiding signal routing back to the PLC for every control operation. 940  Standard industrial communication protocols designed by industry groups such as Modbus and 941  Fieldbus [Berge] are often used on control networks and fieldbus networks. 942  In addition to the supervisory-level and field-level control loops, intermediate levels of control 943  may also exist. For example, in the case of a DCS controlling a discrete part manufacturing 944  facility, there could be an intermediate level supervisor for each cell within the plant. This 945  supervisor encompasses a manufacturing cell containing a machine controller that processes a 946  part and a robot controller that handles raw stock and final products. There could be several of 947  these cells that manage field-level controllers under the main DCS supervisory control loop. 948  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  15  949  950  Figure 7: A comprehensive DCS implementation example951  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  16  2.3.4 Programmable Logic Controller-Based Topologies 952  PLCs are used in both SCADA and DCS systems as the control components of an overall 953  hierarchical system to provide local management of processes through feedback control, as 954  described in the sections above. In the case of SCADA systems, they may provide similar 955  functionality to RTUs. When used in DCS, PLCs are implemented as local controllers within a 956  supervisory control scheme.  957  In addition to PLC usage in SCADA and DCS, PLCs can be implemented as the primary 958  controller in smaller OT system configurations to provide operational control of discrete 959  processes (e.g., automobile assembly lines, process controllers). These topologies differ from 960  SCADA and DCS in that they generally lack a central control server or HMI and, therefore, 961  primarily provide closed-loop control with minimal human involvement. PLCs have a user-962  programmable memory for storing instructions for the purpose of implementing specific 963  functions such as I/O control, logic, timing, counting, three mode proportional-integral-964  derivative (PID) control, communication, arithmetic, and data and file processing.  965  Figure 8 shows control of a manufacturing process being performed by a PLC over a fieldbus 966  network. The PLC is accessible via a programming interface located on an engineering 967  workstation, and data is stored in a data historian, all connected on a LAN. 968  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  17  969  970  Figure 8: A PLC control system implementation example 971  2.3.5 Building Automation Systems  972  Building automation systems (BAS) are a type of OT used to control many systems used in a 973  building, including heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), fire, electrical, lighting, 974  physical access control, physical security, and other utility systems. Most modern buildings 975  contain some form of a BAS when they are constructed; however, older buildings and equipment 976  may have to be retrofitted to take advantage of the benefits BAS provide. 977  Some of the most common functions of BAS are maintaining the environmental conditions for 978  occupant comfort, reducing energy consumption, reducing operating and maintenance costs, 979  increasing security, recording historical data (e.g., temperature, humidity), and performing 980  general equipment monitoring (e.g., provide alerts to building personnel upon device failure or 981  an alarm condition).  982  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  18  An example of a BAS is shown in Figure 9. The architecture can be compared to a DCS, as it has 983  a similar structure and distributed elements (typically throughout a building or buildings) which 984  may communicate over wired or wireless paths to controllers or gateways. For example, 985  environmental control sensors can provide the temperature and humidity to a building controller. 986  If the sensor values are outside of the set points, the controller can signal a variable air volume 987  (VAV) box to increase or decrease airflow and bring the temperature to the desired state. 988  Similarly, a building occupant scanning their identification badge at a badge reader can result in 989  the credentials being sent to the access control controller and application control server to 990  determine if access should be granted. 991  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  19  992  Figure 9: A comprehensive Building Automation System implementation example993  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  20  2.3.6 Physical Access Control Systems  994  Physical access control systems (PACS) are a type of physical security system designed to 995  control access to an area. Unlike standard physical barriers, physical access control can control 996  who is granted access, when the access is granted, and how long the access should last.  997  An access point is the entrance/barrier where access control is required. Some common physical 998  access control examples of access points are doors and locks, security gates, turnstiles, and 999  vehicular gate arms. Depending on the type of facility there can be a single access point (e.g., for 1000  high-security areas) or many (e.g., for a large office building).  1001  An identification (ID) or personal credential is used to identify the authorized user trying to gain 1002  access to the area or facility. Most PACS require a user to have credentials to gain entrance to a 1003  facility or access sensitive data. Examples of identification credentials include simple controls 1004  (e.g., PIN codes, passwords, key fobs, key cards) and more advanced credentials (e.g., encrypted 1005  badges, mobile credentials). Identification credentials allow the system to know who is 1006  attempting to gain access and to maintain access logs.  1007  Readers and/or keypads are typically located at the access point. The reader reads the data and 1008  sends it to a door controller to validate the credential to determine if access should be authorized. 1009  If a keypad or biometric reader is also required (i.e., for multi-factor authentication), the user will 1010  enter their PIN or perform the biometric scan following their credential scan.  1011  1012  Figure 10: A Physical Access Control System implementation example 1013  An example of a PACS is shown in Figure 10. In this example, the door controller receives 1014  credential data from the reader and verifies the identification credential. If the credential is 1015  approved by the access control server, the control panel transmits the command to authorize 1016  access and the door will be unlocked. If the credential is denied, the door will remain locked, and 1017  the user will not be able to gain entry. All access attempts are logged by the door controller(s) 1018  and ultimately the access control server. The access control server is the repository for user 1019  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  21  information, access privileges, and audit logs. Depending on the system, the server might be on-1020  premises or managed in the cloud.  1021  2.3.7 Safety Systems  1022  Many of the physical processes that OT systems control have the potential to create hazardous 1023  situations to life and safety, property, and the environment. Safety systems are designed to 1024  reduce the likelihood and/or consequence of these potentially hazardous situations by bringing 1025  the system to a safe state. There are several types of safety systems related to OT environments, 1026  including emergency shut down (ESD), process safety shutdown (PSS), and fire and gas systems 1027  (FGS). 1028  One of the more well-known types of safety system is the Safety Instrumented System (SIS). An 1029  SIS is a system that is composed of one or more Safety Instrumented Functions (SIFs). An SIF is 1030  an engineered system typically comprised of sensors, logic solvers, and final control elements 1031  (e.g., actuators) whose purpose is to bring a system to a safe state when predetermined thresholds 1032  are violated. They are implemented as part of an overall risk reduction strategy which is intended 1033  to reduce the likelihood and/or potential consequences of a previously identified event so it is 1034  within the organization’s risk tolerance. Numerous other terms are associated with safety 1035  systems; however, the SIS is specifically designed in accordance with IEC 61511 [IEC61511]. 1036  SIS are typically found in chemical, refinery, and nuclear processes.  1037  SIS are typically independent from all other control systems in such a manner that a failure of the 1038  Basic Process Control System (BPCS) will not impact SIS functionality in a deleterious manner. 1039  Historically, SIS were designed to be standalone, physically and logically separated, and air 1040  gapped from the rest of the control system. In the configuration shown in Figure 11, the SIS and 1041  BPCS operated completely independent of each other with no direct communication between the 1042  systems. However, some modern SIS have been designed to allow communication with the 1043  control system. These types of SIS are called Integrated Control and Safety Systems (ICSS). An 1044  ICSS solution may be an all-in-one device from a single vendor or may incorporate multiple 1045  devices from multiple vendors. While ICSS combine the functionality of both control and safety 1046  systems, the SIS still must comply with the requirements outlined in IEC 61511. One of the 1047  advantages to this ICSS methodology is the ability to communicate information from the SIS to 1048  the BPCS. 1049  1050  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  22  1051  Figure 11: A Safety Instrumented System implementation example 1052  2.3.8 Industrial Internet of Things 1053  The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) consists of sensors, instruments, machines, and other 1054  devices that are networked together and use internet connectivity to enhance industrial and 1055  manufacturing business processes and applications [Berge]. As IT and OT systems continue to 1056  converge and the systems become even more interconnected, control of physical processes 1057  remains a relatively unique and critical concept of OT.  1058  The Industrial IoT Consortium proposes a three-tier system architecture model for representing 1059  IIoT systems [IIRA19], consisting of the Edge Tier, Platform Tier, and Enterprise Tier. Each tier 1060  plays a specific role in processing the data flows and control flows involved in usage activities. 1061  The tiers are connected by three networks: the Proximity Network, Access Network, and Service 1062  Network. An example architecture is shown in Figure 12. 1063  The Enterprise Tier implements domain-specific applications and decision support systems, 1064  provides interfaces to end-users, receives data flows from the other tiers, and issues control 1065  commands to the other tiers. 1066  The Platform Tier receives, processes, and forwards control commands from the Enterprise Tier 1067  to the Edge Tier. It consolidates processes and analyzes data flows from the other tiers, provides 1068  management functions for devices and assets, and offers non-domain specific services such as 1069  data query and analytics. Based on the specific implementation, these functions can be 1070  implemented on the IIoT Platform that is deployed in an on-site datacenter, an off-site 1071  datacenter, or in the cloud. 1072  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  23  The Edge Tier collects data from the edge nodes using the proximity network. The architectural 1073  characteristics of this tier vary depending on the specific implementation (e.g., geographical 1074  distribution, physical location, governance scope). It is a logical layer rather than a true physical 1075  division. From the business perspective, the location of the edge depends on the business 1076  objectives.  1077  1078  Figure 12: A three-tiered Industrial Internet of Things system architecture 1079  Edge computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure in which computing resources and 1080  application services can be distributed along the communication path between the data source 1081  and the cloud. It exists vertically within the full stack (i.e., from the device to the cloud) and 1082  horizontally across IIoT subsystems. The edge is not merely a way to collect data for 1083  transmission to the datacenter or cloud; it also processes, analyzes, and acts on data collected at 1084  the edge and is, therefore, essential for optimizing industrial data at every aspect of an operation. 1085  The IIoT system architecture is fully distributed and can support a wide range of interactions and 1086  communication paradigms, including:  1087  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  24   Peer-to-peer networking (e.g., security cameras communicating about identified objects)  1088   Edge-device collaboration (e.g., wind turbines in remote locations)  1089   Distributed queries across data stored in devices, in the cloud, and anywhere in between  1090   Distributed data management, defining where and what data is to be stored, and for how long 1091   Data governance including quality, discovery, usability, privacy and security 1092  The Proximity Network connects edge nodes (e.g., sensors, actuators, devices, OT systems and 1093  assets) to the stack. It typically connects these edge nodes as one or more clusters to a gateway 1094  that bridges to other networks. The Access Network enables connectivity for data and control 1095  flow between the Edge and Platform Tiers. This connection may be a corporate network, or an 1096  overlay private network over the public Internet or a 4G/5G network. The Service Network 1097  enables connectivity between the services in the Platform Tier, the Enterprise Tier, and the 1098  services within each tier. This connectivity may be an overlay private network over the public 1099  Internet or the Internet itself, allowing enterprise-grade security between end-users and services. 1100  2.4 Comparing OT and IT System Security 1101  OT has many characteristics that differ from traditional IT systems, including different risks and 1102  priorities. Some of these include significant risk to the health and safety of human lives, serious 1103  damage to the environment, and financial issues such as production losses. OT has different 1104  performance and reliability requirements and uses OSs and applications that may be considered 1105  unconventional in a typical IT network environment. Security protections must be implemented 1106  in a way that maintains system integrity during normal operations as well as during times of 1107  cyber-attack [Knapp]. 1108  Initially, OT systems had little resemblance to IT systems in that OT were isolated systems 1109  running proprietary control protocols using specialized hardware and software. Widely available, 1110  low-cost Ethernet, Internet Protocol (IP), and wireless devices are now replacing the older 1111  proprietary technologies, which increases the likelihood of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and 1112  incidents. As OT continues to adopt IT technologies to promote corporate connectivity and 1113  remote access capabilities, such as using industry standard computers, OSs, and network 1114  protocols, OT systems and devices are increasingly resembling IT systems. This integration 1115  supports new IT capabilities, but it provides significantly less isolation for OT from the outside 1116  world than predecessor systems, creating a greater need to secure them. While security solutions 1117  have been designed to deal with these issues in typical IT systems, special precautions must be 1118  taken when introducing these same solutions to OT environments. In some cases, new security 1119  solutions are needed that are tailored to the OT environment. 1120  The following lists some special considerations when considering security for OT: 1121   Timeliness and Performance Requirements. OT are generally time-critical, with the 1122  criterion for acceptable levels of delay and jitter dictated by the individual installation. Some 1123  systems require reliable, deterministic responses. High throughput is typically not essential to 1124  OT. In contrast, IT systems typically require high throughput, and they can typically 1125  withstand some level of delay and jitter. For some OT, automated response time or system 1126  response to human interaction is very critical. Many OT utilize real-time OSs (RTOS), where 1127  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  25  real-time refers to timeliness requirements. The units of real-time are highly application-1128  dependent and must be explicitly stated. 1129   Availability Requirements. Many OT processes are continuous in nature. Unexpected 1130  outages of systems that control industrial processes are not acceptable. Outages often must be 1131  planned and scheduled days or weeks in advance. Exhaustive pre-deployment testing is 1132  essential to ensure high availability (i.e., reliability) for the OT. OT systems often cannot be 1133  stopped and started without affecting production. In some cases, the products produced or 1134  equipment being used are more important than the information being relayed. Therefore, 1135  typical IT strategies (e.g., rebooting a component) are usually not acceptable for OT due to 1136  the adverse impact on the requirements for high availability, reliability, and maintainability. 1137  Some OT employ redundant components, often running in parallel, to provide continuity 1138  when primary components are unavailable.  1139   Risk Management Requirements. In a typical IT system, primary concerns include data 1140  confidentiality and integrity. For OT, primary concerns include human safety, fault tolerance 1141  to prevent loss of life or endangerment of public health or confidence, regulatory compliance, 1142  loss of equipment, loss of intellectual property, or lost or damaged products. The personnel 1143  responsible for operating, securing, and maintaining OT must understand the important link 1144  between safety and security. Any security measure that impairs safety is unacceptable. 1145   Physical Effects. Field devices (e.g., PLCs, operator stations, DCS controllers) are directly 1146  responsible for controlling physical processes. OT can have complex interactions with 1147  physical processes and consequences in the OT domain that can manifest in physical events. 1148  Understanding these potential physical effects often requires communication between experts 1149  in OT and experts of the particular physical domain.  1150   System Operation. OT OSs and control networks are often quite different from their IT 1151  counterparts, requiring different skill sets, experience, and levels of expertise. Control 1152  networks are typically managed by control engineers, not IT personnel. Assumptions that 1153  differences are insignificant can have disastrous consequences on system operations. 1154   Resource Constraints. OT and their RTOS are often resource-constrained systems that do 1155  not include typical contemporary IT security capabilities. Legacy systems are often lacking 1156  resources common on modern IT systems. Many systems may not have desired features 1157  including encryption capabilities, error logging, and password protection. Indiscriminate use 1158  of IT security practices in OT may cause availability and timing disruptions. There may not 1159  be computing resources available on OT components to retrofit these systems with current 1160  security capabilities. Adding resources or features may not be possible. 1161   Communications. Communication protocols and media used by OT environments for field 1162  device control and intra-processor communication are typically different from IT 1163  environments and may be proprietary.  1164   Change Management. Change management is paramount to maintaining the integrity of 1165  both IT and OT systems. Unpatched software represents one of the greatest vulnerabilities to 1166  a system. Software updates on IT systems, including security patches, are typically applied in 1167  a timely fashion based on appropriate security policy and procedures. In addition, these 1168  procedures are often automated using server-based tools. Software updates on OT cannot 1169  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  26  always be implemented on a timely basis. These updates need to be thoroughly tested by both 1170  the vendor and the end user of the industrial control application before being implemented. 1171  Additionally, the OT owner must plan and schedule OT outages days/weeks in advance. The 1172  OT may also require revalidation as part of the update process. Another issue is that many 1173  OT utilize older versions of OSs that are no longer supported by the vendor through patches. 1174  Change management is also applicable to hardware and firmware. The change management 1175  process, when applied to OT, requires careful assessment by OT experts (e.g., control 1176  engineers) working in conjunction with security and IT personnel.  1177   Managed Support. Typical IT systems allow for diversified support styles, perhaps 1178  supporting disparate but interconnected technology architectures. For OT, service support is 1179  in some instances available only from a single vendor. In some instances, third-party security 1180  solutions are not allowed due to OT vendor licensing and service agreements, and loss of 1181  service support can occur if third-party applications are installed without vendor 1182  acknowledgement or approval. 1183   Component Lifetime. Typical IT components have a lifetime on the order of three to five 1184  years due to the quick evolution of technology. For OT where technology has been 1185  developed in many cases for specific uses and implementations, the lifetime of the deployed 1186  technology is often in the order of 10 to 15 years, and sometimes longer. 1187   Component Location. Most IT components and some OT components are located in 1188  business and commercial facilities physically accessible by local transportation. Remote 1189  locations may be utilized for backup facilities. Distributed OT components may be isolated, 1190  remote, and require extensive transportation effort to reach. Component location also needs 1191  to consider necessary physical and environmental security measures.  1192  Table 1 summarizes some of the typical differences between IT and OT systems. 1193  Table 1: Summary of typical differences between IT and OT systems 1194  Category Information Technology  Operational Technology  Performance  Requirements  • Non-real time  • Response must be consistent.  • High throughput is demanded.  • High delay and jitter may be acceptable.  • Emergency interaction is less critical.  • Tightly restricted access control can be  implemented to the degree necessary  for security.  • Real-time  • Response is time-critical.  • Modest throughput is acceptable.  • High delay and/or jitter is not acceptable.  • Response to human and other  emergency interaction is critical.  • Access to OT should be strictly controlled  but should not hamper or interfere with  human-machine interaction.  Availability  (Reliability)  Requirements  • Responses such as rebooting are  acceptable.  • Availability deficiencies can often be  tolerated, depending on the system’s  operational requirements.  • Responses such as rebooting may not be  acceptable because of process  availability requirements.  • Availability requirements may necessitate  redundant systems.  • Outages must be planned and scheduled  days/weeks in advance.  • High availability requires exhaustive pre- deployment testing.  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  27  Category Information Technology  Operational Technology  Risk  Management  Requirements  • Manage data  • Data confidentiality and integrity is  paramount.  • Fault tolerance is less important –  momentary downtime is not a major risk.  • Major risk impact is delay of business  operations.  • Control physical world  • Human safety is paramount, followed by  protection of the process.  • Fault tolerance is essential; even  momentary downtime may not be  acceptable.  • Major risk impacts are regulatory non- compliance, environmental impacts, and  loss of life, equipment, or production.  System  Operation  • Systems are designed for use with  typical OSs.  • Upgrades are straightforward with the  availability of automated deployment  tools.  • Systems often use differing and possibly  proprietary OSs, sometimes without  security capabilities built in.  • Software changes must be carefully  made, usually by software vendors,  because of the specialized control  algorithms and perhaps modified  hardware and software involved.  Resource  Constraints  • Systems are specified with enough  resources to support the addition of  third-party applications such as security  solutions.  • Systems are designed to support the  intended industrial process and may not  have enough memory and computing  resources to support the addition of  security capabilities.  Communications • Standard communications protocols  • Primarily wired networks with some  localized wireless capabilities  • Typical IT networking practices  • Many proprietary and standard  communication protocols  • Several types of communications media  used, including dedicated wire and  wireless (radio and satellite)  • Complex networks that sometimes  require the expertise of control engineers  Change  Management  • Software changes are applied in a  timely fashion in the presence of good  security policy and procedures. The  procedures are often automated.  • Software changes must be thoroughly  tested and deployed incrementally  throughout a system to ensure that the  integrity of the OT system is maintained.  OT outages often must be planned and  scheduled days/weeks in advance. OT  may use OSs that are no longer  supported.

Component  Lifetime  • Lifetime on the order of three to five  years  • Lifetime on the order of 10 to 15 years  Components  Location  • Components are usually local and easy  to access.  • Components can be isolated, remote,  and require extensive physical effort to  gain access to them.  1195  In summary, the operational and risk differences between IT and OT systems create the need for 1196  increased sophistication in applying cybersecurity and operational strategies. A cross-functional 1197  team of control engineers, control system operators, and IT security professionals must work 1198  closely to understand the possible implications of the installation, operation, and maintenance of 1199  security solutions in conjunction with control system operation. IT professionals working with 1200  OT need to understand the reliability impacts of information security technologies before 1201  deployment. Some of the OSs and applications running on OT may not operate correctly with 1202  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  28  commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) IT cybersecurity solutions because of their unique 1203  requirements. 1204  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  29  3 OT Cybersecurity Program Development  1205  To mitigate cybersecurity risk to their OT systems, organizations need to develop and deploy an 1206  OT cybersecurity program. It should be consistent and integrated with existing IT cybersecurity 1207  programs and practices, but also account for the specific requirements and characteristics of OT 1208  systems and environments. Organizations should review and update their OT cybersecurity plans 1209  and programs regularly to reflect changes in technologies, operations, standards, regulations, and 1210  the security needs of specific facilities. 1211  Effective integration of cybersecurity into the operation of OT requires defining and executing a 1212  comprehensive program that addresses all aspects of cybersecurity. This includes defining the 1213  objectives and scope of the program, establishing a cross functional team that understands OT 1214  and cybersecurity, defining policies and procedures, identifying the cyber risk management 1215  capabilities that include people, process, and technology, as well as identifying day-to-day 1216  operations of event monitoring and auditing for compliance and improvement. 1217  When a new system is being designed and installed, it is imperative to take the time to address 1218  security throughout the life cycle, including architecture, procurement, installation, maintenance, 1219  and decommissioning. Deploying systems to the field based on the assumption that these systems 1220  will be secured later introduces significant risk to the systems and the organization. If there 1221  aren’t sufficient time and resources to secure the system properly before deployment, it is 1222  unlikely that security will be addressed at a later time. Since new OT systems are designed and 1223  deployed less frequently than IT systems, it is much more common to improve, expand, or 1224  update an existing OT system than to design a new one.  1225  This section introduces the basic process for developing an OT cybersecurity program and 1226  applies to new and deployed OT systems. Additional guidance for developing the specific 1227  elements of an OT cybersecurity program can be found in the Sections listed in Section 3.3.10. 1228  Organizations may also wish to consult ISA-62443-2-1, Security for Industrial Automation and 1229  Control Systems: Security Program Requirements for IACS Asset Owners, which describes 1230  another view of the elements of a cybersecurity program for use in the OT environment. It 1231  provides guidance on how to meet the cybersecurity requirements described for each element of 1232  the cybersecurity program [ISA62443]. 1233  3.1 Establish a Charter for OT Cybersecurity Program 1234  Senior management must demonstrate a clear commitment to cybersecurity and should 1235  communicate its importance throughout the organization. Cybersecurity is a business 1236  responsibility shared by all members of the organization and especially by its leaders and IT and 1237  OT teams. Commitment to cybersecurity, both IT and OT, can be demonstrated by establishing a 1238  charter for a cybersecurity program with adequate funding, visibility, governance, and support 1239  from senior leaders. A cybersecurity program that has commitment from senior management is 1240  more likely to achieve the mission and business goals of the organization. 1241  A charter for a cybersecurity program is a plain-language high-level description that establishes 1242  clear ownership and accountability for protecting the OT resources and provides a mandate for 1243  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  30  the most senior person responsible to establish and maintain the cybersecurity program (e.g., 1244  CISO). In this section, the focus is on the OT-specific program. However, the OT cybersecurity 1245  program should be integrated with the overall cybersecurity program for the organization. 1246  A cybersecurity program charter should include program objectives, scope, and responsibilities. 1247  Senior management establishes the OT cybersecurity program charter and identifies an OT 1248  cybersecurity manager with appropriate scope, responsibility, and authority to lead the OT 1249  cybersecurity program. The OT cybersecurity manager should define the roles and 1250  responsibilities of system owners, mission/business process managers, and users. The OT 1251  cybersecurity manager should document the objectives and scope of the OT security program, 1252  including the business organizations affected, the systems and networks involved, the budget and 1253  resources required, and the division of responsibilities.  1254  The organization may already have an information security program in place or have developed 1255  one for its IT systems. The OT cybersecurity manager should identify which existing practices to 1256  leverage, and which practices are specific to the OT system. In the long run, it will be more 1257  effective if the team can share resources with others in the organization that have similar 1258  objectives. 1259  3.2 Business Case for OT Cybersecurity Program 1260  The cybersecurity of OT systems is a critical component in the overall security for the 1261  organization. An OT cybersecurity program considers the characteristics of OT systems that 1262  differ from IT systems, necessitating special consideration in securing OT.  1263  Attacks on OT systems are increasing and can cause physical damage or even halt production. 1264  As OT systems are increasingly being connected to IT networks, relying on traditional measures 1265  is not enough to protect such systems from cyber-attack. e.g., traditional measures like air gap 1266  are no longer realistic as systems are more connected to the enterprise network for productivity 1267  or efficiency reasons. Also, OT systems can be used as an entry point to the organizational IT 1268  systems and other enterprise systems. Therefore, security measures tailored to the OT system are 1269  required to protect the organization. The OT cybersecurity program can provide an organization-1270  wide strategy to secure the system. 1271  The ability to perform its missions and goals is an important requirement for many organizations 1272  and OT operators. Managing the risk of the OT system to ensure the organization meets its goals 1273  and missions is a high priority for these OT operators. The potential impact of a cybersecurity 1274  event could be severe—it could impact the organization’s mission and objectives, the 1275  environment, regulatory compliance, and even human safety. An OT cybersecurity program can 1276  provide a methodology and strategy to mitigate the risks.  1277  3.2.1 Benefits of Cybersecurity investments 1278  OT cybersecurity supports the mission and business functions of the organization. Investment in 1279  OT cybersecurity can provide additional benefits, including:  1280   Improving OT system safety, reliability, and availability 1281  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  31   Improving OT system efficiency  1282   Reducing community concerns 1283   Reducing legal liabilities 1284   Meeting regulatory requirements 1285   Helping with insurance coverage and cost 1286  A strong OT cybersecurity program is fundamental to a sustainable business operation. An OT 1287  cybersecurity program with OT-specific security policies can potentially enhance system 1288  reliability and availability. This also includes minimizing unintentional OT system information 1289  security impacts from inappropriate testing, policies, and misconfigured systems. The importance 1290  of secure systems should be further emphasized as business reliance on interconnectivity 1291  increases. Denial of service (DoS) attacks and malware (e.g., worms, viruses) have become very 1292  common and have already impacted OT systems. Cyber-attacks can have significant physical 1293  and consequential impacts. The major categories of impacts are as follows: 1294   Physical Impacts. Physical impacts encompass the set of direct consequences of OT failure. 1295  The potential effects of paramount importance include personal injury and loss of life. Other 1296  effects include the loss of property (including data) and potential damage to the environment. 1297   Economic Impacts. Economic impacts are a second-order effect from physical impacts 1298  ensuing from an OT incident. Physical impacts could result in repercussions to system 1299  operations, which in turn inflict a greater economic loss on the facility, organization, or 1300  others dependent on the OT systems. Unavailability of critical infrastructure (e.g., electrical 1301  power, transportation) can have economic impact far beyond the systems sustaining direct 1302  and physical damage. These effects could negatively impact the local, regional, national, or 1303  possibly global economy. 1304   Social Impacts. Another second-order effect, the consequence from the loss of national or 1305  public confidence in an organization, is many times overlooked. It is, however, a very real 1306  consequence that could result from an OT incident. 1307  Examples of potential consequences of an OT incident are listed below. Note that items in this 1308  list are not independent. For example, release of hazardous material can lead to injury or death. 1309   Impact on national security—facilitate an act of terrorism 1310   Reduction or loss of production at one site or multiple sites simultaneously 1311   Injury or death of employees 1312   Injury or death of persons in the community 1313   Damage to equipment 1314   Release, diversion, or theft of hazardous materials 1315   Environmental damage 1316   Violation of regulatory requirements 1317   Product contamination 1318  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  32   Criminal or civil legal liabilities 1319   Loss of proprietary or confidential information 1320   Loss of brand image or customer confidence 1321  Undesirable incidents of any sort detract from the value of an organization, but safety and 1322  security incidents can have negative impacts that last longer than other types of incidents on all 1323  stakeholders—employees, shareholders, customers, and the communities in which an 1324  organization operates. The list of potential business consequences needs to be prioritized to focus 1325  on the consequences that senior management will find the most compelling. The highest priority 1326  items should be evaluated to estimate the annual business impact, preferably but not necessarily 1327  in financial terms. 1328  3.2.2 Building an OT Cybersecurity Business Case 1329  A well-defined business case for an OT cybersecurity program is essential for management buy-1330  in to ensure the long-term commitment of the organization and allocation of resources needed for 1331  development, implementation, and maintenance of the program. Without a strong commitment 1332  by senior management, it may be difficult to prioritize the allocation of resources to sustain the 1333  program. 1334  The first step in developing an OT security program is to identify the business objectives and 1335  missions of the organization, and how the cybersecurity program can lower risk and protect the 1336  organization’s ability to perform its mission. The business case should capture the business 1337  concerns of senior management and provide the business impact and financial justification for 1338  creating an integrated organizational cybersecurity program. It should include detailed 1339  information about the following: 1340   Benefits of creating an integrated security program 1341   Potential costs and failure scenarios if an OT cybersecurity program is not implemented 1342   High-level overview of the process required to implement, operate, monitor, review, 1343  maintain, and improve the information security program 1344  Costs and resources required to develop, implement, and maintain the security program should 1345  be considered. The economics benefit of the cybersecurity program may be evaluated similar to 1346  worker health and safety programs. However, an attack on the OT system could have significant 1347  consequences that far exceed the monetary costs. 1348  3.2.3 Resources for Building Business Case 1349  Significant resources can be found in external resources from other organizations in similar lines 1350  of business—either individually or in information sharing exchanges, trade and standards 1351  organizations, consulting firms, and internal resources in related risk management programs or 1352  engineering and operations. External organizations can often provide useful tips as to what 1353  factors most strongly influenced management to support their efforts and what resources within 1354  their organizations proved most helpful. For different industries these factors may be different, 1355  but there may be similarities in the roles that other risk management specialists can play. 1356  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  33  Appendix D provides a list and short descriptions of some of the current activities in OT 1357  security. 1358  Internal resources in related risk management efforts (e.g., information security, health, safety 1359  and environmental risk, physical security, business continuity) can provide tremendous 1360  assistance based on their experiences with related incidents in the organization. This information 1361  is helpful from the standpoint of prioritizing threats and estimating business impact. These 1362  resources can also provide insight into which managers are focused on dealing with which risks 1363  and, thus, which managers might be the most appropriate or receptive to serving as a champion.  1364  3.2.4 Presenting the OT Cybersecurity Business Case to Leadership 1365  It is critical for the success of the OT cybersecurity program that it receives senior management 1366  buy-in and that they actively participate in the program. Organization-level management that 1367  encompasses both IT and OT operations has the perspective to understand the risks and the 1368  authority to assume responsibility for them. 1369  Senior management will be responsible for approving and driving information security policies, 1370  assigning security roles and responsibilities, and implementing the information security program 1371  across the organization. Funding for the entire program can usually be done in phases. While 1372  some funding may be required to start the program, additional funding can be obtained later as 1373  the security vulnerabilities and needs of the program are better understood and additional 1374  strategies are developed. Additionally, costs should be considered for retrofitting the OT for 1375  security versus addressing security to begin with. 1376  Often, a good approach to obtain management buy-in is to base the business case on a successful 1377  example. The business case should inform management that the other organization had the same 1378  problem and then present the solution they have found and how they were able to solve it. This 1379  will often prompt management to ask how this solution might be applicable to their organization. 1380  When presenting the business case to leadership, it may be helpful to mention the specific 1381  challenges in securing the OT systems: 1382   OT systems operate under different environments and requirements than IT systems. For 1383  example, OT systems tend to prioritize availability and safety over other factors like 1384  confidentiality. 1385   IT programs or tools may not be suitable for OT systems. The security measures or tools that 1386  work well with IT systems may not work effectively in the OT environment.  1387   Compensatory measures may be an effective solution to secure an OT system without 1388  affecting system performance.  1389   Protecting OT systems is critical, and a cybersecurity incident on an OT system may have 1390  catastrophic consequences that affect human life and the environment. 1391  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  34  3.3 OT Cybersecurity Program Content 1392  This section provides recommendations for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and 1393  continually improving an OT cybersecurity program. These recommendations, when 1394  implemented and maintained, provide a security roadmap that helps to manage OT cybersecurity 1395  risk. These recommendations are independent, which allows the organization to select 1396  approaches and technologies most suitable to their needs. 1397  An OT cybersecurity program typically tailors to a specific OT environment. An organization 1398  may have multiple sites, each with multiple specific OT environments. In such a situation, it is 1399  recommended that an organizational-level OT security program be defined whose 1400  recommendations cascade down and adapt to the needs of individual sites and OT environments.  1401  The effectiveness of an OT cybersecurity program is often enhanced through coordination or 1402  integration with the organization’s processes and information security program. The 1403  organizational information security program typically focuses on confidentiality, integrity, and 1404  availability, in that order, of information for the entire organization. Information security 1405  programs generally do not specifically address all the security and operational needs of an OT 1406  environment. In the OT environment, the focus is usually on safety, availability, integrity, and 1407  confidentiality, in that order. This difference in focus and priorities between IT and OT security 1408  programs should be kept in mind. NIST SP 800-100, Information Security Handbook: A Guide 1409  for Managers [SP800-100], provides a broad overview of information security program elements 1410  to assist in establishing and implementing an information security program in an organization. 1411  The lifespan of an OT system can exceed twenty years. As a result, many legacy systems may 1412  contain hardware and software that are no longer supported by the vendors and cannot be 1413  patched or updated to protect against known vulnerabilities. In that case, the security program 1414  should tailor to the unique characteristics of the legacy system to determine if the controls are 1415  applicable. In situations where security controls are not supported by the legacy OT system, 1416  compensating controls should be considered. For example, anti-malware software may not be 1417  available for systems such as PLCs and DCS, which means that malware protection requirements 1418  cannot be applied to these endpoints. In this case, a compensating control should be considered, 1419  e.g., using a firewall with deep packet inspection capability that can monitor and block advanced 1420  threats like malware, disabling unused ports in switches, or physically securing switches. 1421  The primary purpose of investing in a cybersecurity program is risk management. Risk to 1422  operations exists because of the potential of threat actors exploiting the vulnerabilities in the 1423  applications and infrastructures. Therefore, the most appropriate decision regarding what to 1424  include in the scope of a cybersecurity program can be made if investments in this program are 1425  viewed through the lens of corporate risk management. To help design and drive a cybersecurity 1426  program with a risk management perspective, the risk management framework defined by NIST 1427  800-37r2 [SP800-37r2] is used to define the core tasks and the processes for implementing a 1428  cybersecurity program. This is briefly summarized in the subsection “Implement an OT Security 1429  RMF” and further elaborated in Section 4. 1430  The OT cybersecurity program also needs to address policy exceptions and deviations. In a 1431  demanding OT environment, situations may arise that require a temporary deviation from the 1432  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  35  security policy in order to maintain the mission or goal of the OT system. Such deviations or 1433  exceptions must be handled with great care and receive approval from management and the 1434  cross-functional team. The security program can establish a policy and procedure for handling 1435  policy exceptions. All of these guidance documents recognize that one size does not fit all; 1436  rather, domain knowledge combined with site-specific constraints should be applied in adapting 1437  the guidance to the specific organization. 1438  3.3.1 Establish OT Cybersecurity Governance 1439  The governance should include policies, procedures, and processes to manage the organization’s 1440  regulatory, legal, risk, environmental, and operational requirements. The governance should 1441  ensure that the policies, procedures, and processes are well understood by the staff and inform 1442  the management of OT cybersecurity risk. To establish an effective OT cybersecurity 1443  governance capability, develop a process and assign the responsibility and accountability to the 1444  appropriate role in the corporate risk management function to ensure that the various elements of 1445  an OT cybersecurity program are operational and effective, and that it is integrated with the 1446  corporate risk management function. Typically, a cybersecurity governance process should 1447  include the following: 1448   Ensure that OT cybersecurity policy is established and communicated 1449   Ensure that OT cybersecurity roles and responsibilities are coordinated and aligned with 1450  internal roles and external partners 1451   Ensure that legal and regulatory requirements regarding OT cybersecurity, including privacy, 1452  are understood and managed 1453   Ensure that cybersecurity risks are integrated with corporate risk management processes  1454  Further guidance for establishing OT cybersecurity guidance can be found in Section 6. 1455  Additional details with specific examples for establishing a cybersecurity governance capability 1456  are also provided in NIST Internal Report (NISTIR) 8183A, Cybersecurity Framework 1457  Manufacturing Profile - Low Impact Level Example Implementations Guide [IR8183A]. 1458  3.3.2 Build and Train a Cross-Functional Team to Implement OT Cybersecurity 1459  Program 1460  It is essential for a cross-functional cybersecurity team to share their varied domain knowledge 1461  and experience to evaluate and manage risk in OT. The OT cybersecurity team should consist of 1462  representatives of the following departments: IT staff, control engineer, control system operator, 1463  security subject matter expert, and enterprise risk management. For completeness, the 1464  information security team should also include any cybersecurity service provider.  1465  From a safety perspective, there are serious consequences relating to major accident hazards and 1466  loss of containment due to equipment failure or operator mistakes. Cybersecurity is another 1467  threat to the safety and reliability of industrial processes, so including the safety experts as part 1468  of the cybersecurity team will be beneficial in identifying potential impact areas due to cyber 1469  vulnerabilities. Their insight into OT design and safety considerations will also help in 1470  formulating cyber mitigations.  1471  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  36  While the control engineers will play a large role in securing OT, they will not be able to do so 1472  without collaboration and support from both the IT department and management. IT often has 1473  years of cybersecurity experience, much of which is applicable to OT. As the cultures of control 1474  engineering and IT are often significantly different, their integration will be essential for the 1475  development of a collaborative security design and operation. 1476  Organizations come in various sizes, structures, geographical spread, and complexities. These 1477  factors along with strategies related to resources and budget constraints may drive organizations 1478  to hire OT cybersecurity resources as employees or contractors or outsource the OT security 1479  operation function as a managed security service. Irrespective of the security operation and 1480  resource model used, the responsibility for OT cybersecurity management should be integrated 1481  with IT cybersecurity and corporate risk management function.  1482  The responsibility and accountability for implementing and managing cybersecurity functions 1483  typically falls under the IT and OT infrastructure organization, whereas the cybersecurity 1484  operational metrics and risks are reported to the risk management office. These two lines of 1485  reporting structure need to collaborate in terms of funding and expectations of what can be 1486  achieved given a funding and resource level. The risk executive function works with executive 1487  management to decide on the risk tolerance and residual risk. 1488  As part of building a cybersecurity team, the following tasks should be included: 1489   Establish and maintain cybersecurity roles and responsibilities for building, operating, and 1490  improving an OT cybersecurity program. 1491   Establish cybersecurity roles and responsibilities for third-party providers. Third-party 1492  providers include, for example, service providers, contractors, and other organizations 1493  providing OT system development and services, and security operation and management. 1494  Further guidance for establishing a cross-functional team can be found in Section 4 and 1495  Appendix D. Additional details with specific examples for establishing a cross-functional team 1496  are also provided in NISTIR 8183A, Cybersecurity Framework Manufacturing Profile - Low 1497  Impact Level Example Implementations Guide [IR8183A]. 1498  3.3.3 Define OT Cybersecurity Strategy 1499  An organization-wide risk management strategy is foundational to developing an OT 1500  cybersecurity strategy.4 The OT cybersecurity strategy leverages the organization-wide risk 1501  management strategy, including organization-defined risk tolerance, threats, assumptions, 1502  constraints, priorities, and tradeoffs, to further tailor the strategy to apply to the OT cybersecurity 1503  program.  1504  4  For additional information on developing an organization-wide risk management strategy, refer to NIST SP 800-37 [SP800-  37r2], Prepare Step, Task P-2, Risk Management Strategy. Section 3 provides additional information on organization-level  system-level task to prepare for implementing the NIST Risk Management Framework.  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  37  The OT cybersecurity strategy: 1505   Refines and supplements, as necessary, guidance from the organization-wide risk 1506  management strategy to address OT-specific constraints and requirements 1507   Identifies the OT cybersecurity team and personnel 1508   Addresses the OT cybersecurity operation model: insource, outsource, and/or use managed 1509  security services 1510   Outlines the appropriate cybersecurity architecture for the various OT sites within the OT 1511  program 1512   Defines OT-specific cybersecurity training and awareness 1513  The OT cybersecurity strategy should help refine the organizational risk tolerance for the OT 1514  operation. The acceptable risk tolerance for OT drives the priorities for the OT cybersecurity 1515  operation. The program should address both IT and OT concerns and requirements; for example, 1516  IT may concern data loss or system availability as a higher priority, but OT may value system 1517  safety, production efficiency, and environmental damage as higher priorities.  1518  Further guidance for developing an OT cybersecurity strategy can be found in Section 5, Section 1519  6, Appendix C and Appendix D. Additional details and specific examples for establishing an OT 1520  cybersecurity strategy are also provided in NISTIR 8183A, Cybersecurity Framework 1521  Manufacturing Profile - Low Impact Level Example Implementations Guide [IR8183A]. 1522  3.3.4 Define OT-Specific Policies and Procedures 1523  Policies and procedures are essential to the success of a cybersecurity program. OT-specific 1524  security policies and procedures should be derived from existing IT cybersecurity and plant 1525  operational policies and procedures where possible for consistency throughout the organization.  1526  As discussed earlier, organizational management is responsible for developing and 1527  communicating the risk tolerance level of the organization—the level of risk the organization is 1528  willing to accept—which allows the OT cybersecurity manager to determine the risk 1529  management strategy. The development of the cybersecurity policies should be based on a risk 1530  assessment that will set the security priorities and goals for the organization so that the risks 1531  posed by cyber threats are managed sufficiently. Procedures that support the policies need to be 1532  developed so that the policies are implemented fully and properly for the OT. Cybersecurity 1533  procedures should be documented, tested, and updated periodically in response to policy, 1534  technology, and threat changes. 1535  Further guidance for developing OT-specific policies and procedures can be found in Section 6. 1536  Additional details with examples of establishing OT-specific policies and procedures are also 1537  provided in NISTIR 8183A, Cybersecurity Framework Manufacturing Profile - Low Impact 1538  Level Example Implementations Guide [IR8183A]. 1539  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  38  3.3.5 Establish Cybersecurity Awareness Training Program for OT Organization 1540  Organizations should ensure that all personnel, including employees, contractors, consultants, 1541  and vendors, who interact with OT systems receive cybersecurity training that is relevant for the 1542  OT environment. This training is in addition to IT cybersecurity awareness training. This training 1543  is necessary to inform the OT personnel who interact with OT systems that their actions have the 1544  potential to impact the security and safety of the OT system and personnel. This training is used 1545  to inform personnel of basic cybersecurity principles and the steps they need to follow when 1546  interacting with OT systems. Cybersecurity awareness training should be required for new 1547  employees at the time of hire and on regular intervals as dictated by the regulatory requirements 1548  and organizational policies. 1549  Further guidance for OT cybersecurity awareness training can be found in Section 6 and 1550  Appendix D. Additional details with specific examples for OT cybersecurity awareness training 1551  are also provided in NISTIR 8183A, Cybersecurity Framework Manufacturing Profile - Low 1552  Impact Level Example Implementations Guide [IR8183A]. 1553  3.3.6 Implement a Risk Management Framework for OT 1554  OT system risk is another risk confronting an organization (e.g., financial, safety, environmental, 1555  IT). In each case, managers with responsibility for the mission or business function establish and 1556  conduct a risk management program in coordination with senior management. NIST SP 800-39, 1557  Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and Information System View 1558  [SP800-39] provides a framework for an enterprise-level risk management program, which is 1559  detailed in Section 4 of this document. OT personnel should be involved in developing the OT 1560  cybersecurity risk management program and communicating with senior management. 1561  NIST SP 800-37, Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations: A 1562  System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy [SP800-37r2] provides a structured process 1563  for managing security and privacy risk. This includes preparing for organization-wide risk 1564  management; system categorization; control selection, implementation, and assessment; system 1565  and common control authorizations; and continuous monitoring.  1566  Applying the Risk Management Framework (RMF) to OT systems is detailed in Section 4. 1567  3.3.7 Develop Maintenance Tracking Capability 1568  Establish processes and implement tools to ensure that routine and preventative maintenance and 1569  repairs (both local and remote) of OT assets are performed consistent with OT organizations 1570  policies and procedures. The tools used for maintenance logging and tracking should be 1571  controlled and managed. Ensure that the processes and tools allow scheduling, authorizing, 1572  tracking, monitoring, and auditing maintenance and repair activities for OT assets. If the ability 1573  for remote maintenance is required, ensure that the remote access tool supports authentication of 1574  maintenance personnel, connection establishment at the beginning of maintenance activities and 1575  immediate teardown once the maintenance activities are performed. Also ensure that the tool can 1576  log the remote maintenance activities performed. 1577  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  39  Further guidance for OT maintenance tracking can be found in Section 6. Additional details with 1578  specific examples for OT maintenance tracking are also provided in NISTIR 8183A, 1579  Cybersecurity Framework Manufacturing Profile - Low Impact Level Example Implementations 1580  Guide [IR8183A]. 1581  3.3.8 Develop Incident Response Capability 1582  Organizations should establish an OT cybersecurity incident response (IR) function that should 1583  include planning, detection, analysis, containment, and reporting activities in the case of a 1584  cybersecurity incident. The IR function requires the establishment of several cybersecurity 1585  capabilities, including incident management, forensic analysis, vulnerability management, and 1586  response communication. As part of building the IR function, the OT cybersecurity department 1587  should create an incident response plan. The purpose of the incident response capability is to 1588  determine the scope and risk of cybersecurity incidents, respond appropriately to the incident, 1589  communicate the incident with all stakeholders, and reduce the future impact. This plan applies 1590  to all OT personnel, networks, systems, and data. The IR plan guides the activities of the 1591  cybersecurity team to respond, communicate, and coordinate in the event of a cybersecurity 1592  incident. Without such a plan, the organization will find it extremely difficult to respond when a 1593  cybersecurity incident occurs. The plan includes the roles and responsibilities of personnel, the 1594  incident response workflow, incident type and severity classification, contacts of critical 1595  personnel who should be involved, contacts of external entities that may be useful in assisting 1596  with IR, information sharing policy, and internal and external communication. 1597  Further guidance for OT incident response can be found in Section 6.2.4.5 and Appendix C. 1598  Additional details with specific examples for OT incident response are also provided in NISTIR 1599  8183A, Cybersecurity Framework Manufacturing Profile – Low Impact Level Example 1600  Implementations Guide [IR8183A]. 1601  3.3.9 Develop Recovery and Restoration Capability 1602  The organization should establish the capability to recover from cybersecurity incidents and to 1603  restore the assets and services that were impaired by the cybersecurity incident to pre-cyber-1604  incident state. This capability typically includes the following tasks: 1605   Define recovery objectives when recovering from disruptions. For example, the recovery 1606  capability shall prioritize human safety and environmental safety prior to restarting the OT 1607  operation that was impaired by the cybersecurity event. 1608   Develop a site disaster recovery plan (DRP) and business continuity plan (BCP) or both to 1609  prepare the OT organization to respond appropriately to significant disruptions in their 1610  operation due to the cybersecurity incident. 1611   Establish backup systems and processes to back up the relevant OT systems’ state, data, 1612  configuration files, and programs at regular intervals to support recovery to a stable state. 1613   Establish processes for restoring relevant OT systems’ state, data, configuration files, and 1614  programs from backups in a timely manner. 1615  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  40   Establish recovery processes and procedures that will be executed to restore OT assets and 1616  services affected by cybersecurity incidents. 1617   Establish communication plans to coordinate restoration activities with internal and external 1618  stakeholders and executive management team. 1619   Establish communication plans to manage public relations. 1620   Establish a lessons learned task as part of the recovery process for continuous improvement 1621  of the cybersecurity capabilities – vulnerability management, cybersecurity operation, 1622  incident response handling, and recovery handling. 1623   Test these plans at reasonable intervals that are appropriate for the organization. 1624  Further guidance for OT recovery and restoration can be found in Section 6. Additional details 1625  with specific examples for OT recovery and restoration are also provided in NISTIR 8183A, 1626  Cybersecurity Framework Manufacturing Profile - Low Impact Level Example Implementations 1627  Guide [IR8183A]. 1628  3.3.10 Summary of OT Cybersecurity Program Content 1629  The elements of a cybersecurity program and the various considerations for establishing such a 1630  program have been presented in this section. Further guidance for establishing the elements of a 1631  cybersecurity program can be found in the document sections listed in Table 2.  1632  Table 2: Sections with additional guidance on establishing a cybersecurity program 1633  Cybersecurity Program Element Section Number for Additional  Guidance  Establish OT Cybersecurity Governance Section 6  Build and Train a Cross-Functional Team to Implement OT  Cybersecurity Program Section 4, Appendix D  Define OT Cybersecurity Strategy Section 5, 6, Appendix C, D  Define OT-Specific Policies and Procedures Section 6  Establish Cybersecurity Awareness Training Program for OT  Organization Section 6, Appendix D  Implement a Risk Management Framework for OT Section 4, 6, Appendix C, D  Develop Maintenance Tracking Capability Section 6  Develop Incident Response Capability Section 6, Appendix C  Develop Recovery and Restoration Capability Section 6  1634  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  41  4 Risk Management for OT Systems  1635  Organizations manage risk every day when meeting their business objectives. These risks may 1636  include financial, equipment failure, and personnel safety, to name just a few. Organizations 1637  develop processes to evaluate the risks associated with their business and to decide how to 1638  manage those risks based on organizational priorities, risk tolerance, and internal and external 1639  constraints. This management of risk is conducted as an interactive ongoing process as part of 1640  normal operations. Organizations that use OT systems have historically managed risk through 1641  good practices in safety and engineering. Safety assessments are well established in most sectors 1642  and are often incorporated into regulatory requirements. Information security risk management is 1643  an added dimension that can be complementary. The risk management process and framework 1644  outlined in this section can be applied to managing safety, information security, and cyber supply 1645  chain risk. Privacy is also a risk consideration for some OT systems. For additional guidance on 1646  privacy risk management, refer to the NIST Risk Management Framework and the Privacy 1647  Framework. 1648  A risk management process is employed throughout an organization using a three-level approach 1649  to address risk at the (i) organization level; (ii) mission/business process level; and (iii) system 1650  level (IT and OT). The risk management process is carried out seamlessly across the three levels 1651  with the overall objective of continuous improvement in the organization’s risk-related activities 1652  and effective inter-tier and intra-tier communication among all stakeholders having a shared 1653  interest in the mission/business success of the organization.  1654  This section focuses primarily on OT system considerations at the system level; however, the 1655  risk management activities, information, and artifacts at each level impact and inform the other 1656  levels. Section 6 applies the Cybersecurity Framework to OT systems, while Appendix F 1657  provides OT-specific recommendations to augment NIST SP 800-53, Revision 5 [SP800-53r5] 1658  control families. Throughout the following discussion of risk management, OT system 1659  considerations and the impact that these considerations have on the risk management process are 1660  discussed.  1661  For more information on multi-tiered risk management and the risk management process, refer to 1662  NIST SP 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission and Information 1663  System View [SP800-39]. NIST SP 800-37 Revision 2, Risk Management Framework for 1664  Information Systems and Organizations: A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy 1665  [SP800-37r2] provides guidelines for applying the Risk Management Framework to federal 1666  information systems to include conducting the activities of security categorization,5 security 1667  control selection and implementation, security control assessment, information system 1668  authorization,6 and security control monitoring. NIST SP 800-30, Guide for Conducting Risk 1669  Assessments [SP800-30r1] provides a step-by-step process for organizations on: (i) how to 1670  prepare for risk assessments; (ii) how to conduct risk assessments; (iii) how to communicate risk 1671  5  Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 199 [FIPS199] provides security categorization guidance for non-national  security systems. Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) Instruction 1253 provides similar guidance for national  security systems.  6  Security authorization is the official management decision given by a senior organizational official to authorize operation of  an information system and to explicitly accept the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other  organizations, and the Nation based on the implementation of an agreed-upon set of security controls.  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  42  assessment results to key organizational personnel; and (iv) how to maintain the risk assessments 1672  over time. 1673  4.1 Managing OT Security Risk  1674  While the risk management process presented in NIST SP 800-39 applies to all types of systems, 1675  there are some unique aspects to consider when it comes to managing OT system security risk. 1676  As shown in Figure 13, the risk management process has four components: framing risk (i.e., 1677  establishing the context for risk-based decisions), assessing risk, responding to risk, and 1678  monitoring risk. These activities are interdependent and often occur simultaneously within an 1679  organization. For example, the results of the monitoring component will feed into the framing 1680  component. As the environment in which organizations operate is always changing, risk 1681  management must be a continuous process where all components have ongoing activities. It is 1682  important to remember that these components apply to the management of any type of risk, 1683  including cybersecurity, physical security, safety, and financial. Sections 4.1.1 through 4.1.4 1684  discuss the four components of the risk management process in further detail and provide OT-1685  specific implementation guidance.  1686  1687  Figure 13: Risk Management Process: Frame, Assess, Respond, Monitor 1688  Organization-wide risk management is applied at three levels, as Figure 14 depicts. Level 1 1689  addresses risk management from the organizational perspective and implements risk framing by 1690  providing context for all risk management activities within the organization. Level 2 addresses 1691  risk from a mission/business process perspective and is informed by the Level 1 risk context, 1692  decisions, and activities. Level 3 addresses risk at the system level and is informed by the Level 1693  1 and 2 activities and outputs.  1694  FRAME  ASSESS  RESPONDMONITOR  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  43  1695  Figure 14: Risk Management Levels: Organization, Mission/Business Process, and System 1696  Together, each of the risk management components (i.e., frame, assess, respond, and monitor) 1697  are applied across the risk management levels, resulting in organization-wide risk awareness and 1698  traceability and transparency of risk-based decisions.  1699  4.1.1 Framing OT Risk  1700  The framing component consists of the processes for establishing the required assumptions, 1701  constraints, risk tolerances, and risk management strategies for organizations to make consistent 1702  risk management decisions. Specifically, risk framing supports the overall risk management 1703  strategy by incorporating elements from the organizational governance structure, legal/regulatory 1704  environment, and other factors to establish how the organization intends to assess, respond to, 1705  and monitor risk to all IT and OT systems.  1706  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  For OT system operators, safety is the major consideration that directly affects decisions on  how systems are engineered and operated. Safety can be defined as “freedom from conditions  that can cause death, injury, occupational illness, damage to or loss of equipment or property,  or damage to the environment.”7 Based on this, human safety impacts are typically evaluated  based on the degree of injury, disease, or death possible from the resulting OT system  malfunction from the cyber incident, taking into consideration any previously performed  safety impact assessments performed by the organization regarding the employees and the  7  https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/safety  Strategic  Focus  Tac�cal  Focus  Level 1 Organiza�on  Level 2 Mission / Business Process  Level 3 System (Environment of Opera�on)  More detailed and granular risk perspective  Broad-based risk perspective  https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/safety  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  44  public. The importance of safety and developing/ensuring a safety culture plays a critical role  in the determination of risk tolerance.  Organizations should consider incorporating an analysis of cybersecurity effects on OT  systems that impact environmental and personnel safety and mitigating controls. More  specifically, organizations may want to consider having a comprehensive process to  systematically predict or identify the operational behavior of each safety-critical failure  condition, fault condition, or human error that could lead to a hazard and potential human  harm.  Organizations may also want to consider the impact of legacy systems and components on  their environment. Specifically, legacy systems may be unable to adequately support  cybersecurity to prevent risks from exceeding organization tolerance levels.  Another major concern for OT system operators is typically the availability of services  provided by the OT system. The OT system may be part of critical infrastructure (for example,  water or power systems), where there is a significant need for continuous and reliable  operations. As a result, OT systems may have strict requirements for availability or recovery.  Organizations should understand and plan for the level(s) of redundancy required to achieve  the desired resilience levels for their operating environments and incorporate these  requirements into the risk framing. This may help organizations make risk decisions that avoid  unintended consequences on those who depend on the services provided. More specifically,  organizations consider identifying interdependent OT systems that pose cybersecurity risks  that threaten system availability.  Additionally, organizations may want to consider how an incident could propagate to a  connected system and system components. An OT may be interconnected with other systems,  such that failures in one system or process can easily cascade to other systems either within or  outside the organization. Impact propagation could occur due to both physical and logical  dependencies. Proper communication of the results of risk assessments to the operators of  connected or interdependent systems and processes is one way to manage such impacts.  Logical damage to an interconnected OT could occur if the cyber incident propagated to the  connected OT systems. An example could be if a virus or worm propagated to a connected OT  and then impacted that system. Physical damage could also propagate to other interconnected  OT. If an incident impacts the physical environment of an OT, it may also impact other related  physical domains. For example, the impact could result in a physical hazard which degrades  nearby physical environments. Additionally, the impact could also degrade common shared  dependencies (e.g., power supply) or result in a shortage of material needed for a later stage in  an industrial process.  CISA serves to promote a cohesive effort between government and industry that will improve 1707  CISA’s ability to anticipate, prioritize, and manage national-level OT risk. CISA assists OT 1708  systems’ vendors and asset owners, operators, and vendors across all critical infrastructure 1709  sectors to identify security vulnerabilities and develop sound, proactive mitigation strategies that 1710  strengthen their OT systems’ cybersecurity posture. 1711  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  45  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Organizations may want to consider incorporating resources such as the NIST National  Vulnerability Database (NVD) and the MITRE ATT&CK for Industrial Control Systems  (ICS) framework [ATTACK-ICS] into their processes for assessing risks to the mission and  OT systems. Additionally, the nature of OT systems requires organizations to consider  additional factors that might not exist when conducting risk assessment for a traditional IT  system. For example, OT will have different threat sources, vulnerabilities, and compensating  controls than IT. Organizations may also need to consider that the impact of a cyber incident  in an OT environment may include both physical and digital effects and, therefore, the risk  assessments need to incorporate these additional effects, including:   Impacts on safety and use of safety assessments   Physical impact of a cyber incident on an OT, including the larger physical environment,  and the effect on the process controlled   The consequences for risk assessments of non-digital control components within an OT  1712  During risk framing, organizations should also select appropriate risk assessment 1713  methodology(ies) that include OT. When evaluating the potential physical damage from a cyber 1714  incident, organizations with OT systems may consider: i) how a cyber incident could manipulate 1715  the operation to impact the physical environment; ii) what design features exist in the OT system 1716  to prevent or mitigate an impact; and iii) how a physical incident could emerge based on these 1717  conditions.  1718  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  When framing risks within an OT environment, organizations may discover that cybersecurity  threats are not always as well understood or predictable as OT hazards. Organizations may  consider incorporating cyber-attack and IT failure scenarios into their Process Hazard Analysis  (PHA) or Failure Mode & Effects Analysis (FMEA) processes. By including risks due to  cyber-attacks and cyber risk management measures in these processes, organizations may gain  a better understanding of the cyber risks to the OT operation environment.  As part of risk framing, organizations may also need to consider:   Assumptions about how risk is assessed, responded to, and monitored across the  organization; and   The risk tolerance for the organization, the level of risk that can be accepted as part of  achieving strategic goals and objectives, and the priorities and trade-offs considered as part  of managing risk.  In the context of OT, the potential for damage to equipment, human safety, the natural  environment, and other critical infrastructures is part of these considerations. Organizations  may need to consider evaluating the potential physical impacts for all parts of an OT system.  https://nvd.nist.gov/ https://nvd.nist.gov/ https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  46  Additionally, to support risk framing, organizations may also need to determine how OT  systems interact or depend on IT. These processes may require organizations to identify a  common framework for evaluating impacts that incorporate OT considerations. One approach  is based on NIST FIPS 199, which specifies that systems are categorized as low-impact,  moderate-impact, or high-impact for the security objectives of confidentiality, integrity, and  availability [FIPS199]. Another approach, based on ISA 62443-3-2 [ISA62443], provides  example definitions for assisting organizations with determining a system categorization  utilizing OT impacts.  1719  Table 3 provides possible example categories and impact levels organizations may customize to 1720  meet their specific industry or business requirements. For example, some organizations may see 1721  an outage lasting up to one day as a High Impact instead of Moderate as shown in the table. 1722  Table 3: Possible Definitions for OT Impact Levels Based on Product Produced, Industry, and Security 1723  Concerns 1724  Category High Moderate Low  Outage at Multiple  Sites  Significant disruption to  operations at multiple sites  with restoration expected to  require one or more days  Operational disruptions at  multiple sites, with  restoration expecting to  require more than one hour  Partially disrupted  operations at multiple sites,  with restoration to full  capability requiring less  than one hour  National  Infrastructure and  Services  Impacts multiple sectors or  disrupts community  services in a major way  Potential to impact sector at  a level beyond the  company  Little to no impact to  sectors beyond the  individual company; little to  no impact on community  Cost (% of Revenue) > 25% > 5% < 5%  Legal  Felony criminal offense or  compliance violation  affecting license to operate  Misdemeanor criminal  offense or compliance  violation resulting in fines  None  Public Confidence Loss of brand image Loss of customer  confidence None  People Onsite Fatality Loss of workday or major  injury First aid or recordable injury  People Offsite Fatality or major community  incident  Complaints or local  community impact No complaints  Environment  Citation by regional agency  or long-term significant  damage over large area  Citation by local agency Small, contained release  below reportable limits  1725  To support the risk assessment process, organizations should also define how the likelihood of 1726  occurrence for cybersecurity events will be determined to maintain consistency when assessing 1727  risks. NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 [SP800-30r1] provides guidance for organizations to develop 1728  likelihood weighted risk factors. Organizations should consider weighting risk factors based on 1729  an analysis of the probability that a given threat is capable of exploiting a given vulnerability (or 1730  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  47  set of vulnerabilities); the threat event will be initiated; and the threat event will result in adverse 1731  impacts.  1732  For adversarial threats, an assessment of likelihood of occurrence is typically based on adversary 1733  intent, capability, and targeting. For other than adversarial threat events, the likelihood of 1734  occurrence is estimated using historical evidence, empirical data, or other factors. In some 1735  situations, organizations may find that there is minimal organizational historical data. In these 1736  cases, organizations may want to consider extending their analysis to consider industry-specific 1737  data that may describe cybersecurity events reported for similar organizations.  1738  The likelihood of threat occurrence can also be based on the state of the organization (including 1739  for example, its core mission/business processes, enterprise architecture, information security 1740  architecture, information systems, and environments in which those systems operate)—taking 1741  into consideration predisposing conditions and the presence and effectiveness of deployed 1742  security controls to protect against unauthorized/undesirable behavior, detect and limit damage, 1743  and/or other resiliency factors for the OT capabilities. 1744  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Organizations establishing definitions for event likelihood may want to review Appendix G of  SP 800-30 Rev. 1 for more detailed guidance and suggestions. Based on this guidance,  organizations should consider defining five levels of likelihood (from Very Low to Very High)  based on both adversarial (intentional threat actors) and non-adversarial (errors, accidents, acts  of nature, etc.) events. Additionally, organizations will want to establish definitions for the  likelihood an event will result in an adverse impact. Using these two factors, organizations can  establish a heat map like the one depicted in Table 4 to determine the likelihood factor for  supporting the risk analysis.  1745  Table 4: Event Likelihood Evaluation 1746  Likelihood of  Threat Event  Initiation or  Occurrence  Likelihood Threat Events Result in Adverse Impacts  Very Low Low Moderate High Very High  Very High Low Moderate High Very High Very High  High Low Moderate Moderate High Very High  Moderate Low Low Moderate Moderate High  Low Very Low Low Low Moderate Moderate  Very Low Very Low Very Low Low Low Low  1747  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  48  4.1.2 Assessing Risk in the OT Environment  1748  Leveraging the outputs of framing risk, such as acceptable risk assessment methodologies, risk 1749  management strategy, and risk tolerance, risk assessments are conducted to facilitate efforts to 1750  identify, estimate, and prioritize risks to operations, assets, individuals, and other organizations. 1751  Risk assessments occur at all risk management levels (i.e., organization, mission/business 1752  function, and system) and can be used to inform risk assessments at other levels. Regardless of 1753  which risk management level the risk assessment is conducted at, assessing risk requires 1754  identifying threats and vulnerabilities, the harm that such threats and vulnerabilities may cause, 1755  and the likelihood that adverse events arising from those threats and vulnerabilities may occur.  1756  When the organization conducts a risk assessment that includes OT systems, there may be 1757  additional considerations that do not exist when doing a risk assessment of traditional IT 1758  systems. Because the impact of a cyber incident in an OT may include both physical and digital 1759  effects, risk assessments need to incorporate those potential effects.  1760  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Organizations need to consider that risk assessments are typically point-in-time reports. As a  result, organizations should ensure that they are updated to remain current and that the security  level remains adequate.  Organizations may want to review the information provided by CISA’s Alerts and Advisories,  NIST NVD, and MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework to identify common vulnerability areas  for OT environments, such as:   Poor coding practices, network designs, or device configurations   Vulnerable network services and protocols   Weak authentication   Excessive privileges   Information disclosure  1761  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  The physical operating environment is another aspect that organizations should consider when  working with an OT system. OT systems often have specific environmental requirements (e.g.,  a manufacturing process may require a precise temperature), or they may be tied to their  physical environment for operations. Organizations may want to consider incorporating these  requirements and constraints in the framing component so that the risks arising from these  constraints are identified and considered. Additionally, organizations may want to consider:   Identifying the physical assets and security controls that directly relate to safety, human  life, and maintaining continuity of operations of the OT system  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  49   Identifying the cybersecurity risks associated with physical assets that could threaten OT  system functionality   Ensure that physical security personnel understand the relative risks and physical security  countermeasures associated with the OT system environments they protect   Ensure that physical security personnel are aware of which areas of an OT system  production environment house data acquisition and operate in sensitive spaces   Mitigate business continuity risk by specifying immediate response plans if physical safety  is jeopardized  Risk assessments also require reviewing digital and non-digital mechanisms implemented to 1762  minimize adverse event impacts. OT systems often incorporate non-digital mechanisms to 1763  provide fault tolerance and prevent the OT from acting outside of acceptable parameters. 1764  Therefore, these non-digital mechanisms may help reduce any negative impact that a digital 1765  incident on the OT might have and are incorporated into the risk assessment process. For 1766  example, OT often have non-digital control mechanisms that can prevent the OT from operating 1767  outside of a safe boundary, and thereby limit the impact of an attack (e.g., a mechanical relief 1768  pressure valve). In addition, analog mechanisms (e.g., meters, alarms) can be used to observe the 1769  physical system state to provide operators with reliable data if digital readings are unavailable or 1770  corrupted. Table 5 categorizes non-digital control mechanisms that could reduce the impact of an 1771  OT incident.  1772  Table 5: Categories of Non-Digital OT Control Components 1773  Control Type Description  Analog Displays  or Alarms  Non-digital mechanisms that measure and display the state of the physical system (e.g.,  temperature, pressure, voltage, current) and can provide the operator with accurate  information in situations when digital displays are unavailable or corrupted. The information  may be provided to the operator on some non-digital display (e.g., thermometers, pressure  gauges) and through audible alarms.  Manual Control  Mechanisms  Manual control mechanisms (e.g., manual valve controls, physical breaker switches) provide  operators with the ability to manually control an actuator without relying on the digital OT  system. This ensures that an actuator can be controlled even if the OT system is unavailable  or compromised.  Analog Control  Systems  Analog control systems use non-digital sensors and actuators to monitor and control a  physical process. These may be able to prevent the physical process from entering an  undesired state in situations when the digital OT system is unavailable or corrupted. Analog  controls include devices such as regulators, governors, and electromechanical relays.  An example is a device that is designed to open during emergency or abnormal conditions to  prevent rise of internal fluid pressure in excess of a specified value, thus bringing the process  to a safer state. The device also may be designed to prevent excessive internal vacuum. The  device may be a pressure relief valve, a non-reclosing pressure relief device (e.g., rupture  disc), or a vacuum relief valve.  1774  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  50  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Organizations should consider the potential impact that a cyber incident may have on OT by  analyzing all digital and non-digital control mechanisms and the extent to which they can  mitigate potential negative impacts to the OT. There are multiple considerations when  considering the possible mitigation effects of digital and non-digital control mechanisms, such  as how non-digital control mechanisms may require additional time and human involvement to  perform necessary monitoring or control functions. For example, such mechanisms may  require operators to travel to a remote site to perform certain control functions. Such  mechanisms may also depend on human response times, which may be slower than automated  controls.  1775  Additionally, organizations may need to consider privacy with their risk assessment. Privacy risk 1776  assessments sometime require a different approach, so organizations may want to consider 1777  utilizing the NIST Privacy Risk Assessment Methodology (PRAM)—a tool that applies the risk 1778  model from NISTIR 8062 [IR8062] and helps organizations analyze, assess, and prioritize 1779  privacy risks to determine how to respond and select appropriate solutions. 1780  4.1.3 Responding to Risk in an OT Environment 1781  The risk response component provides an organization-wide response to risk in accordance with 1782  the risk framing component (e.g., identify possible courses of actions to address risk, evaluate 1783  those possibilities considering the organization’s risk tolerance and other considerations 1784  determined during framing, and choose the best alternative for the organization). The response 1785  component includes the implementation of the chosen course of action to address the identified 1786  risk: acceptance, avoidance, mitigation, sharing, transfer, or any combination of those options.8  1787  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  For an OT system, available risk responses may be constrained by system requirements,  potential adverse impact on operations, or even regulatory compliance regimes. An example of  risk sharing is when utilities enter into agreements to “loan” line workers in an emergency,  which reduces the duration of the effect of an incident to acceptable levels.  1788  4.1.4 Monitoring Risk in an OT Environment 1789  Monitoring risk is the fourth component of the risk management activities. Organizations 1790  monitor risk on an ongoing basis, including the implementation of chosen risk management 1791  strategies; changes in the environment that may affect the risk calculation; and the effectiveness 1792  and efficiency of risk reduction activities. The activities in the monitoring component impact all 1793  the other components. 1794  8  For additional information on these options, refer to NIST SP 800-39 [SP800-39].  https://www.nist.gov/privacy-framework/nist-pram  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  51  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Many OT system monitoring capabilities leverage passive monitoring techniques to detect  system changes; however, this may not always capture all modifications to the system.  Modern monitoring platforms that leverage native protocol communications to access more  system information may improve awareness, but the limitations of these OT systems must be  understood. Often OT systems are implemented with an undefined frequency for monitoring  cyber activities. Users should set a frequency in accordance with the respective risk profile.  Threat information as it relates to the OT environment is evolving, and the availability and  accuracy of this threat information is early in its development. By their nature, threats may be  difficult to accurately predict even with historical data. Organizations should categorize threats  based on the likelihood of occurrence and their potential consequences. For example, the  threat of an internet-connected system being scanned would have a high likelihood and a low- severity consequence. Another example might be the threat of a nation-state actor disrupting a  supply chain. This threat may have low likelihood and high-severity consequences to the  organization.  Since security countermeasures are typically developed for IT environments, organizations  should consider how deploying security technologies into OT environments might negatively  impact operations or safety.  4.2 Special Areas for Consideration  1795  4.2.1 Supply Chain Risk Management 1796  Cybersecurity risks can arise from products or services acquired to support OT needs. These 1797  risks can be introduced anywhere in the supply chain and at any stage across the life cycle. These 1798  risks—whether malicious, natural, or unintentional—have the potential to compromise the 1799  availability and integrity of critical OT systems and components, and the availability, integrity, 1800  and confidentiality of the data utilized by the OT, causing harms ranging from minor disruption 1801  to life-safety impacts.  1802  With few exceptions, organizations with responsibility for OT rely upon suppliers and other 1803  third-party providers and their extended supply chains for a range of needs. These supply-side 1804  organizations perform critical roles and functions, to include manufacturing and provisioning 1805  technology products, providing software upgrades and patches, performing integration services, 1806  or otherwise supporting day-to-day operations and maintenance of OT systems, components, and 1807  operational environments. For this reason, it is necessary and important that OT organizations 1808  should seek to understand and mitigate the supply chain-related risk that can be inherited from 1809  these supply-side organizations and the products and services they provide.  1810  Identifying, assessing, and effectively responding to cybersecurity risks in supply chains is best 1811  accomplished by incorporating cybersecurity supply chain risk management (C-SCRM) 1812  considerations into organizational policies, plans, and practices. This includes extending 1813  cybersecurity expectations and requirements to vendors and gaining better understanding, 1814  visibility, and control over the supply chains that are associated with acquired products and 1815  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  52  services. Vetting suppliers and service providers should be done to ascertain their capabilities, 1816  trustworthiness, the adequacy of their internal security practices, and the effectiveness of 1817  safeguards, and to understand their supply chain relationships and any risks that may be 1818  associated with those relationships and dependencies. Requirements for and evaluation of 1819  products and discrete components should go beyond an assessment of whether functional and 1820  technical requirements are satisfied and address applicable C-SCRM factors such as, but not 1821  limited to, a product’s provenance, pedigree, and composition, and whether the product is taint-1822  free and authentic. Additionally, special consideration should be given to how difficult it may be 1823  to attain original replacement parts or updates over the life of the product and how diverse the 1824  sources of supply are and may be in the future. 1825  OT organizations should familiarize themselves with NIST SP 800-161, Supply Chain Risk 1826  Management Practices for Federal Information Systems and Organizations [SP800-161] and 1827  begin, or continue, implementing the key practices, C-SCRM security controls, and C-SCRM 1828  risk management process activities described in the publication. For organizations at the early 1829  stage of establishing a C-SCRM program, there is extensive guidance about how to go about 1830  doing this in a phased approach that begins with putting the foundational elements in place, then 1831  matures and expands upon this foundation over time to ensure sustained effectiveness and the 1832  ability to enhance program capabilities. There is also guidance about conducting supply chain 1833  risk assessments, incorporating C-SCRM into procurement requirements, the importance of an 1834  integrated and inter-disciplinary risk management approach, and supplemental C-SCRM security 1835  control guidance, as well as templates that organizations can leverage. 1836  4.2.2 Safety Systems  1837  The culture of safety and safety assessments is well established within much of the OT user 1838  community. Information security risk assessments should be complementary to such 1839  assessments, though they may use different approaches and cover different areas. Safety 1840  assessments are concerned primarily with the physical world. Information security risk 1841  assessments primarily look at the digital world. However, in an OT environment, the physical 1842  and the digital are intertwined, and significant overlap may occur. 1843  It is important that organizations consider all aspects of risk management for safety (e.g., risk 1844  framing, risk tolerances), as well as the safety assessment results, when carrying out risk 1845  assessments for information security. The personnel responsible for the information security risk 1846  assessment must be able to identify and communicate identified risks that could have safety 1847  implications. Conversely, the personnel charged with safety assessments must be familiar with 1848  the potential physical impacts and their likelihood developed by the information security risk 1849  assessment process. 1850  Safety systems may also reduce the impact of a cyber incident to the OT. Safety systems are 1851  often deployed to perform specific monitoring and control functions to ensure the safety of 1852  people, the environment, process, and assets. While these systems are traditionally implemented 1853  to be fully redundant and independent from the primary OT, some architectures combine control 1854  and safety functions, components, or networks. Combining control and safety could allow a 1855  sophisticated attacker access to both control and safety systems if the OT were compromised. 1856  Ensure adequate separation of components consistent with the risk of compromise. Evaluate the 1857  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  53  impact of the implemented security controls on the safety system to determine if they negatively 1858  impact the system. 1859  4.3 Applying the Risk Management Framework for OT Systems  1860  The NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) applies the risk management process and 1861  concepts (framing risk, assessing risk, responding to risk, and monitoring risk) to systems and 1862  organizations. The following subsections describe the process of applying the RMF to OT and 1863  include a brief description of each step and task, the intended outcome of each task, task 1864  mappings to other standards and guidelines applicable to OT (e.g., the Cybersecurity Framework 1865  and IEC 62443), and OT-specific implementation guidance. Some tasks are optional, and not all 1866  tasks include OT-specific considerations or guidance.  1867  The RMF steps in Figure 15, while shown sequentially, can be implemented in a different order 1868  to be consistent with established management and system development life cycle processes. 1869  1870  Figure 15: Risk Management Framework Steps 1871  4.3.1 Prepare  1872  The purpose of the Prepare step is to carry out essential activities at the organization, mission 1873  and business process, and system levels of the organization to help prepare the organization to 1874  manage its security and privacy risks using the RMF.

TASK P-18  SYSTEM REGISTRATION  The system is registered for purposes of  management, accountability, coordination, and  oversight.  [Cybersecurity Framework: ID.GV]  1880  4.3.2 Categorize 1881  In the Categorize step, the potential adverse impact of the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and 1882  availability of the information and system is determined. For each information type and system 1883  under consideration, the three security objectives—confidentiality, integrity, and availability—1884  are associated with one of three levels of potential impact should there be a breach of security. It 1885  is important to remember that for an OT, availability is generally the greatest concern. The 1886  standards and guidance for this categorization process can be found in FIPS 199 [FIPS199] and 1887  NIST SP 800-60 [SP800-60v1r1][SP800-60v2r1], respectively.  1888  The following OT example is taken from FIPS 199: 1889  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  A power plant contains a SCADA system controlling the distribution of electric power for a large military  installation. The SCADA system contains both real-time sensor data and routine administrative information. The  management at the power plant determines that: (i) for the sensor data being acquired by the SCADA system,  there is no potential impact from a loss of confidentiality, a high potential impact from a loss of integrity, and a  high potential impact from a loss of availability; and (ii) for the administrative information being processed by  the system, there is a low potential impact from a loss of confidentiality, a low potential impact from a loss of  integrity, and a low potential impact from a loss of availability. The resulting security categories, SC, of these  information types are expressed as:  SC sensor data = {(confidentiality, NA), (integrity, HIGH), (availability, HIGH)}, and  SC administrative information = {(confidentiality, LOW), (integrity, LOW), (availability, LOW)}.  The resulting security category of the system is initially expressed as:  SC SCADA system = {(confidentiality, LOW), (integrity, HIGH), (availability, HIGH)}  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  57  representing the high-water mark or maximum potential impact values for each security objective from the  information types resident on the SCADA system. The management at the power plant chooses to increase the  potential impact from a loss of confidentiality from low to moderate, reflecting a more realistic view of the  potential impact on the system should there be a security breach due to the unauthorized disclosure of system- level information or processing functions. The final security category of the system is expressed as:  SC SCADA system = {(confidentiality, MODERATE), (integrity, HIGH), (availability, HIGH)}  1890  Table 7 provides details on applying the RMF Categorize step to OT. 1891  Table 7: Applying the RMF Categorize step to OT 1892  Tasks Outcomes OT-Specific Guidance  TASK C-1  SYSTEM DESCRIPTION  The characteristics of the system are described and  documented.  [Cybersecurity Framework: Profile]  TASK C-2  SECURITY CATEGORIZATION  A security categorization of the system, including  the information processed by the system  represented by the organization-identified  information types, is completed.  [Cybersecurity Framework: ID.AM-1; ID.AM-2;  ID.AM-3; ID.AM-4; ID.AM-5]  Security categorization results are documented in  the security, privacy, and SCRM plans.  [Cybersecurity Framework: Profile]  Security categorization results are consistent with  the enterprise architecture and commitment to  protecting organizational missions, business  functions, and mission/business processes.  [Cybersecurity Framework: Profile]  Security categorization results reflect the  organization’s risk management strategy.  OT and IT systems may have  different categorization criteria.  TASK C-3  SECURITY CATEGORIZATION  REVIEW AND APPROVAL  The security categorization results are reviewed,  and the categorization decision is approved by  senior leaders in the organization.  1893  4.3.3 Select  1894  The purpose of the Select step is to determine the initial selection of controls to protect the 1895  system commensurate with risk. The control baselines are the starting point for the control 1896  selection process and are chosen based on the security category and associated impact level of 1897  systems determined in the Categorize step. NIST SP 800-53B [SP800-53B] identifies the 1898  recommended control baselines for federal systems and information. To address the need for 1899  developing community-wide and specialized sets of controls for systems and organizations, the 1900  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  58  concept of overlays is introduced. An overlay is a fully specified set of controls, control 1901  enhancements, and supplemental guidance derived from the application of tailoring guidance to 1902  security control baselines described in NIST SP 800-53B, Appendix C. 1903  In general, overlays are intended to reduce the need for ad hoc tailoring of baselines by 1904  organizations through the selection of a set of controls and control enhancements that more 1905  closely correspond to common circumstances, situations, and/or conditions. Appendix F of this 1906  publication includes an OT-specific overlay of applicable NIST SP 800-53 controls that provides 1907  tailored baselines for low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact OT. These tailored 1908  baselines can be utilized as starting specifications and recommendations that can be applied to 1909  specific OT by responsible personnel.  1910  OT owners can tailor the overlay from Appendix F when it is not possible or feasible to 1911  implement specific controls. The use of overlays does not in any way preclude organizations 1912  from performing further tailoring (i.e., overlays can also be subject to tailoring) to reflect 1913  organization-specific needs, assumptions, or constraints. However, all tailoring activity should, 1914  as its primary goal, focus on meeting the intent of the original controls whenever possible or 1915  feasible. For example, in situations where the OT cannot support, or the organization determines 1916  it is not advisable to implement particular controls or control enhancements in an OT (e.g., 1917  performance, safety, or reliability are adversely impacted), the organization should provide a 1918  complete and convincing rationale for how the selected compensating controls provide an 1919  equivalent security capability or level of protection for the OT and why the related baseline 1920  controls could not be employed. If the OT cannot support the use of automated mechanisms, the 1921  organization employs non-automated mechanisms or procedures as compensating controls in 1922  accordance with the general tailoring guidance in Section 3.3 of NIST SP 800-53. Compensating 1923  controls are not exceptions or waivers to the baseline controls; rather, they are alternative 1924  safeguards and countermeasures employed within the OT that accomplish the intent of the 1925  original controls that could not be effectively employed. Organizational decisions on the use of 1926  compensating controls are documented in the security plan for the OT. 1927  Table 8 provides additional details on applying the RMF Select step to OT. 1928  Table 8: Applying the RMF Select step to OT 1929  Tasks Outcomes OT-Specific Guidance  TASK S-1  CONTROL SELECTION  Control baselines necessary to protect the system  commensurate with risk are selected.

TASK S-6  PLAN REVIEW AND APPROVAL  Security and privacy plans reflecting the  selection of controls necessary to protect the  system and the environment of operation  commensurate with risk are reviewed and  approved by the authorizing official.  Review any potential impact to the OT  system’s operational effectiveness and  safety.  1930  4.3.4 Implement 1931  The Implement step involves the implementation of controls in new or legacy systems. The 1932  control selection process described in this section can be applied to OT from two perspectives: 1933  new development and legacy.  1934  For new development systems, the control selection process is applied from a requirements 1935  definition perspective since the systems do not yet exist and organizations are conducting initial 1936  security categorizations. The controls included in the security plans for the systems serve as a 1937  security specification and are expected to be incorporated into the systems during the 1938  development and implementation phases of the system development life cycle.  1939  In contrast, for legacy systems, the security control selection process is applied from a gap 1940  analysis perspective when organizations are anticipating significant changes to the systems (e.g., 1941  during major upgrades, modifications, or outsourcing). Since the systems already exist, 1942  organizations likely have completed the security categorization and security control selection 1943  processes, resulting in the establishment of previously agreed-upon controls in the respective 1944  security plans and the implementation of those controls within the systems. 1945  Table 9 provides additional details on applying the RMF Implement step to OT. 1946  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  60  Table 9: Applying the RMF Implement step to OT 1947  Tasks Outcomes OT-Specific Guidance  TASK I-1  CONTROL  IMPLEMENTATION  Controls specified in the security and privacy  plans are implemented.

The nature of network traffic on these 1974  two networks is different: Internet access, email, and remote access will typically be permitted 1975  on the corporate network and not allowed on the OT networks. There may also be differences in 1976  the degree of rigor associated with corporate and OT environment change control procedures. 1977  Additionally, using the corporate network for OT communication protocols could expose the OT 1978  components to cyber-attacks (e.g., DoS, man-in-the-middle or other network-based attacks). 1979  Utilizing separate networks allows greater flexibility to address security and performance 1980  requirements between the two environments 1981  Practical considerations, such as digital transformation, cost of OT installation, or maintaining a 1982  homogenous network infrastructure, often mean that a connection is required between OT and 1983  corporate or other IT networks. This connection represents additional risk, and organizations 1984  may want to minimize these connections and consider additional security controls for these 1985  connections. This section outlines security strategies for organizations to consider when 1986  architecting their OT environments to support cybersecurity objectives.  1987  5.1 Cybersecurity Strategy 1988  The adoption of a cybersecurity strategy can help organizations with cybersecurity decisions by 1989  providing context for decisions that would otherwise be more ad hoc. This can result in a more 1990  systematic implementation of risk decisions into the development and operations of systems 1991  supporting a comprehensive and sustainable cybersecurity program. A comprehensive and 1992  accepted cybersecurity strategy can assist an organization with consistently maintaining 1993  acceptable risk management throughout the life cycle of an OT system.  1994  System security is optimized by engineering design that is based on proactive loss prevention 1995  strategy. Such a strategy includes planned measures that are engineered to address what can 1996  happen rather than what is likely to happen—to proactively identify and rid the system of 1997  weaknesses and defects that lead to security vulnerabilities; to proactively understand the 1998  certainty and uncertainty of adversarial and non-adversarial threats; and to put in place the means 1999  and methods to protect against adverse consequences. Proactive systems security engineering 2000  also includes planning for failure regardless of whether the failure results from adversarial or 2001  non-adversarial events, and to ensure that the system is resilient to such events. 2002  OT-specific Guidance and Recommendations  When planning their security strategy, organizations may need to consider critical  infrastructure standards and regulatory requirements. Based on guidance from CISA,  organizations may find that both IT and OT environments fall within the critical infrastructure  sectors. Also, these standards and requirements are typically designed to protect critical cyber  assets to support reliability, and may carry additional legal obligations for the organization.  https://www.cisa.gov/critical-infrastructure-sectors  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  64  5.1.1 Impacts of Choosing a Cybersecurity Strategy 2003  By consciously choosing to develop and implement a cybersecurity strategy, an organization 2004  establishes a disciplined approach to cybersecurity in its systems. This approach allows an 2005  organization to consider all aspects of the system life cycle, from procurement to 2006  decommissioning, with cybersecurity in mind. As a result, the organization can track that 2007  cybersecurity goals are realized in its systems.  2008  Decisions on cybersecurity strategy should flow from a high-level understanding of the 2009  operations, objectives, and cybersecurity goals of the organization. The organization may, for 2010  example, want its systems to display certain characteristics such as resiliency or trustworthiness. 2011  A strategy provides a framework that can help incorporate those characteristics into the final 2012  systems. The strategy can also include considerations such the flexibility to adopt new 2013  technologies (e.g., crypto agility, artificial intelligence [AI]/machine learning [ML] technologies, 2014  digital twins). Finally, a strategy can state the need for sound cybersecurity practices such as 2015  patching or monitoring. 2016  The cybersecurity strategy should directly impact the architectural decisions made for systems. 2017  The existence of an architecture informed by a cybersecurity strategy increases the likelihood 2018  that high-level cybersecurity goals will be reflected in the cybersecurity of individual systems. 2019  The strategy provides a document and reminder of those goals when decisions are being made at 2020  the system level. 2021  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendations  OT assets are often very long-lived and reflect massive investments in operational, reliability,  and safety testing. It is sometimes neither economically nor technically feasible to replace  existing equipment and applications wholesale with newer alternatives in the short- or  medium-term. Such equipment is at greater risk of attacks than equipment with the latest  versions of security features and the latest security updates applied, deeply affecting security.  Adoption of a security strategy can assist an organization in understanding the life cycle of its  OT systems and adjusting approaches to maintain cybersecurity.  2022  5.1.2 Defense-in-Depth Strategy 2023  Defense-in-depth is a multifaceted strategy integrating people, technology, and operations 2024  capabilities to establish variable barriers across multiple layers and dimensions of the 2025  organization. It’s considered a best practice. Many cybersecurity architectures incorporate the 2026  principles of defense-in-depth, and the strategy has been integrated into numerous standards and 2027  regulatory frameworks.  2028  The basic concepts are to prevent single points of failure in the cybersecurity defenses and to 2029  assume no single origin of threats. From this position, cybersecurity controls are organized to 2030  provide layers of protection around the critical system and system components.  2031  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  65  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendations  A defense-in-depth strategy is particularly useful in OT environments because it can focus  attention and defensive mechanisms on critical functions. Additionally, the principles of  defense-in-depth are flexible, and organizations may find that they can be applied to a wide  range of OT environments including ICS, SCADA, IoT, IIoT, and Hybrid environments.  Organizations should also consider that defense-in-depth requires an integration of people,  processes, and technology to be effective. Additionally, cybersecurity defenses are not static  and require changes and updates as risks change for the environment. To help establish and  support an effective defense-in-depth architecture, organizations should consider:   Training people to support the security environment and reduce risky behaviors   Implementing appropriate and sustainable cybersecurity technology   Implementing procedures required to monitor, respond, and adapt cybersecurity defenses  to changing conditions  2032  5.1.3 Other Cybersecurity Strategy Considerations 2033  Traditional OT systems were designed to operate industrial processes safely and reliably without 2034  connections to external networks. However, due to the need for business agility and cost 2035  reduction for OT infrastructures, OT systems and networks are becoming more integrated with 2036  business networks and cloud infrastructures. Additionally, the introduction of IIoT systems into 2037  OT environments may have unintended cybersecurity consequences.  2038  Similarly, cloud computing capabilities such as infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, 2039  software as a service, and security as a service are increasingly being utilized by organizations. 2040  While the use of these capabilities to support IT services is relatively well understood, the ability 2041  to utilize these services to support OT environments may have additional availability challenges 2042  resulting from increased sensitivity to system performance levels or connection issues.  2043  As a result, adoption of a security architecture strategy may be impacted by the current state of 2044  existing OT environments. For example, based on the architectural strategy, procurement 2045  decisions might be adjusted to include migrating specific components to support the new 2046  strategy. Also, organizations may find existing systems already support some or most of the 2047  security architecture strategy, so building on these existing capabilities could accelerate the 2048  strategy implementation. Additionally, new OT environments provide an opportunity to evaluate 2049  cyber risk early on and build cybersecurity into the design. 2050  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendations  Organizations should ensure that their security architecture strategy provides the required  flexibility to evolve their environment while also carefully considering the impacts to  operations and cybersecurity.  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  66  2051  5.2 Defense-in-Depth Architecture Capabilities 2052  Many organizations are embracing digital transformation initiatives that require altering their OT 2053  environments and developing strategies that provide a multi-tiered information architecture, 2054  supporting organization objectives such as:  2055   Maintenance of field devices, telemetry collection, or industrial-level process systems 2056   Enhanced data collection and dissemination 2057   Remote access 2058  Overall, integration between IT and OT is increasing as organizations adapt to changing local 2059  and global needs and requirements. Utilizing the principles of a defense-in-depth architecture to 2060  systematically layer security controls, including people, processes, and technology, can assist 2061  organizations with strengthening their overall cybersecurity defenses. As a result, adversaries 2062  may find it increasingly difficult to penetrate the environment without detection. In the following 2063  sections, specific defense-in-depth layers are discussed, including topics and ideas for 2064  organizations to consider when developing and implementing their defense-in-depth 2065  cybersecurity architecture. The layers are: 2066   Layer 1 – Security Management 2067   Layer 2 – Physical Security 2068   Layer 3 – Network Security 2069   Layer 4 – Hardware Security 2070   Layer 5 – Software Security 2071  5.2.1 Layer 1 - Security Management 2072  Security management or governance is the overarching cybersecurity program supporting the OT 2073  environment. Sections 3 and 4 discuss the program and risk management considerations for 2074  organizations to establish their cybersecurity program. These programmatic and organizational 2075  decisions will guide and impact the decisions made for the other defense-in-depth layers. As a 2076  result, organizations should complete this layer before attempting to implement the other layers. 2077  5.2.2 Layer 2 - Physical Security 2078  Physical security measures are designed to reduce the risk of accidental or deliberate loss or 2079  damage to assets and the surrounding environment. The assets being safeguarded may include 2080  control systems, tools, equipment, the environment, the surrounding community, and intellectual 2081  property including proprietary data such as process settings and customer information. 2082  Organizations may also need to consider additional environmental, safety, regulatory, legal, and 2083  other requirements when implementing physical security to protect their environments.  2084  A defense-in-depth solution to physical security should consider the following attributes: 2085  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  67   Protection of Physical Locations. Classic physical security considerations typically include 2086  an architecture of layered security measures creating several physical barriers around 2087  buildings, facilities, rooms, equipment, or other informational assets. Physical security 2088  controls should be implemented to protect physical locations and may include fences, anti-2089  vehicle ditches, earthen mounds, walls, reinforced barricades, gates, door and cabinet locks, 2090  guards, or other measures. 2091   Physical Access Control. Equipment cabinets should be locked when not required for 2092  operation or safety, and wiring should be neat and within cabinets or under floors. 2093  Additionally, consider keeping all computing and networking equipment in secured areas. 2094  Keys of OT assets like PLCs and safety systems should be in the “Run” position at all times 2095  unless they are being actively programmed. 2096   Access Monitoring Systems. Access monitoring systems include electronic surveillance 2097  capabilities such as still and video cameras, sensors, and identification systems (e.g., badge 2098  readers, biometric scanners, electronic keypads). Such devices typically do not prevent 2099  access to a particular location; rather, they store and record either the physical presence or the 2100  lack of physical presence of individuals, vehicles, animals, or other physical entities. 2101  Adequate lighting should be provided based on the type of access monitoring device 2102  deployed. These systems can also sometimes alert or initiate action upon detection of 2103  unauthorized access. 2104   People and Asset Tracking. Locating people and vehicles in a facility can be important for 2105  safety reasons, and it is increasingly important for security reasons as well. Asset location 2106  technologies can be used to track the movements of people and vehicles to ensure that they 2107  stay in authorized areas, to identify personnel needing assistance, and to support emergency 2108  response. 2109  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendations  Organizations should consider if physical security of remote assets is implemented at differing  levels and whether these differences could create cyber risks. For example, one remote  location may utilize only a padlock with minimal electronic surveillance to secure access to  network equipment which, if bypassed, could allow a malicious actor to gain access to an OT  network segment from the remote location.  Organizations should also consider whether secondary services such as the communications  and power supporting physical security devices (cameras, sensors, etc.) require additional  redundancy, isolation, protection, and monitoring.  2110  5.2.3 Layer 3 - Network Security 2111  Building from physical security, organizations should investigate network communications and 2112  how to protect the data and devices used to support their OT environment. While network 2113  security can encompass numerous aspects, this section focuses on several foundational elements 2114  to assist organizations with planning and implementing their network security capabilities. These 2115  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  68  include applying network architecture principles of segmentation and isolation; centralizing 2116  logging; network monitoring; and malicious code protection. Additionally, this section will 2117  discuss zero-trust architecture (ZTA) and considerations for applying these architecture 2118  enhancements to an OT environment. 2119  5.2.3.1 Network Architecture 2120  A good practice for network architectures is to segment and isolate IT and OT devices. 2121  Organizations should begin this process by considering how to characterize devices. For 2122  example, devices might be segmented based on management authority, level of trust, functional 2123  criticality, data flow, location, or other logical combinations. Organizations might also consider 2124  using an industry-recognized model such as the Purdue Model [Williams], ISA-95 Levels 2125  [IEC62264], Three-Tier IIoT System Architecture [IIRA19], or a combination of these models to 2126  organize their OT network segmentation. An additional network segmentation option for 2127  organizations to consider is incorporating the concept of a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) as an 2128  enforcement boundary between network segments as depicted in Figure 16. Implementing 2129  network segmentation utilizing levels, tiers, or zones allows organizations to control access to 2130  sensitive information and components while also considering operational performance and 2131  safety. 2132  2133  Figure 16: High-level example of Purdue Model and IIoT Model for network segmentation with DMZ segments 2134  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendations  Whether using a risk-based approach, functional model, or other organizing principle,  grouping components into levels, tiers, or zones is a precursor activity before organizations  can consider applying isolation devices to protect and monitor communication between levels,  tiers, or zones. When organizing assets, organizations should consider how the zone and  isolation configuration impact day-to-day operations, safety, and response capabilities.  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  69  2135  When properly configured, network architectures are used to support segmentation and isolation 2136  through enforcing security policies and controlling network communications. Organizations 2137  typically utilize their mapped data flows to identify required communications. These 2138  requirements are then incorporated into the network architecture and configured in the policy 2139  engines of the network devices to support monitoring communication between segments and 2140  permitting only authorized communications. Network devices such as switches, routers, 2141  firewalls, and unidirectional gateways/data-diodes that support traffic enforcement capabilities 2142  can be used to implement network segmentation and isolation. 2143  Firewalls are commonly used to support network isolation and are typically employed as 2144  boundary protection devices to control connections and information flows between network 2145  segments. Firewalls may be deployed as network devices or directly run on some hosts. Firewalls 2146  are very flexible isolation devices and typically constitute the primary mechanism for protecting 2147  OT devices.  2148  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendation  Appropriate firewall configuration is essential to properly securing the network segments.  Firewall rulesets should be established to only permit connections between adjacent levels,  tiers, or zones. For example, organizations utilizing a Purdue model architecture should  implement firewall rules and connection paths that prevent Level 4 devices from directly  communicating with Level 2, 1, or 0 devices. A similar concept would be applied to ISA/IEC  62443 or the Industrial IoT Consortium (IIC) architectures as well.  One area of considerable variation in practice associated with firewall rules is the control of  outbound traffic from the control network. Allowing outbound connections from lower levels,  tiers, or zones could represent a significant risk if unmanaged. Organizations will want to  consider making outbound rules as stringent as inbound rules to reduce these risks.  An alternative to firewalls is a unidirectional gateway or data diode that permits authorized  communication in only one direction. The use of unidirectional gateways may provide  additional protections associated with system compromises at higher levels or tiers within the  environment. For example, a unidirectional gateway deployed between Layers 2 and 3 might  protect the Layer 0, 1, and 2 devices from a cybersecurity event that occurs at Layers 3, 4, or  5.  5.2.3.2 Centralized Logging 2149  Network devices such as routers, gateways, switches, firewalls, servers, and workstations should 2150  be configured to log events to support monitoring, alerting, and incident response analysis. 2151  Logging capabilities are typically available for recording events in applications, OSs, and 2152  network communications. A centralized log management platform can assist organizations with 2153  supporting log retention, monitoring, and analysis efforts. 2154  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  70  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendation  Organizations should review the available logging capabilities and configure logging  capabilities to record operational and cybersecurity events appropriate for their environment.  Organizations should establish how long event logs should be retained and ensure adequate  storage is available to support log retention requirements.  5.2.3.3 Network Monitoring 2155  Network monitoring involves organizations reviewing alerts and logs and analyzing them for 2156  signs of possible cybersecurity incidents. Tools and capabilities that support Behavior Anomaly 2157  Detection (BAD), Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), or Intrusion 2158  Detection/Prevention systems (IDS/IPS) can assist organizations with monitoring traffic 2159  throughout the network and generate alerts when they identify anomalous or suspicious traffic. 2160  Some other capabilities to consider for network monitoring include: 2161   Asset management, including discovering and inventorying devices connected to the network 2162   Baselining typical network traffic, data flows, and device-to-device communications 2163   Diagnosing network performance issues 2164   Identifying misconfigurations or malfunctions of networked devices 2165  Additionally, organizations may want to consider incorporating additional services and 2166  capabilities such as threat intelligence monitoring to assist with establishing and maintaining an 2167  effective network monitoring capability. 2168  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendation  OT system traffic is typically more deterministic – repeatable, predictable, and designed –  than IT network traffic. Organizations may leverage the deterministic nature of OT  environments to support network monitoring for anomaly and error detection.  Organizations may want to understand the normal state of the OT network as a prerequisite  for implementing network security monitoring to help distinguish attacks from transient  conditions or normal operations within the environment. Implementing network monitoring  in a passive (listen/learning) mode and analyzing the information to differentiate between  known and unknown communication may be a necessary first step in implementing network  security monitoring.  Organizations should consider the effects of encrypted network communications on their  network monitoring capabilities and deployment strategies. For example, a BAD system or  IDS may not be able to determine if encrypted network communication is malicious and  could either generate false positive or false negative alerts for the traffic. Changing the data  collection point to capture network traffic either before or after encryption (e.g., using host-  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  71  based network monitoring tools) could assist with improving monitoring capabilities when  encrypted communication is expected.  IDS and IPS products are effective in detecting and preventing well-known Internet attacks,  and some IDS and IPS vendors have incorporated attack signatures for various OT protocols  such as Modbus, DNP3, and ICCP. An effective IDS/IPS deployment typically involves both  host-based and network-based capabilities. Organizations should consider the impact  automated responses associated with IPS might have on the OT environment before  deploying. In some cases, organizations may consider placing IPS units at higher levels in the  environment (e.g., the DMZ interfaces) to minimize potential issues with automated  responses impacting OT.  In OT environments, network-based monitoring capabilities are typically deployed on  boundary protection devices using switched port analyzer (SPAN) ports instead of in-line  network taps that could create a communication point of failure. Organizations should also  consider deploying host-based monitoring capabilities on compatible OT devices such as  HMIs, SCADA servers, and engineering workstations to improve monitoring capabilities,  provided the addition of the tools does not adversely impact operational performance or  safety.  5.2.3.4 Zero-Trust Architecture (ZTA) 2169  ZTA is a cybersecurity paradigm focusing on protecting resources (e.g., information services, 2170  data) based on the premise that authorization decisions are made closer to the resource being 2171  requested and are continuously evaluated rather than implicitly granted [SP800-207]. 2172  Conventional network security focuses on segmentation and perimeter defenses. Once inside the 2173  network perimeter, users are typically considered “trusted” and often given broad access to 2174  accessible resources. As a result, boundary protection devices between zones do not mitigate 2175  lateral movement risks within a zone. Additionally, with the growing prevalence of distributed 2176  computing, wireless and cellular communications, along with cloud and hybrid-cloud 2177  environments, traditional network perimeters and boundaries are becoming less defined. For 2178  these situations, organizations might consider incorporating the principles of zero trust into their 2179  security architecture. 2180  Some challenges to implementing a ZTA include: 2181   Organizations may not find a suitable single solution for ZTA and, instead, may need to 2182  integrate several technologies with varying maturity levels to support their environment. 2183   Migrating an existing environment may require more investments in time, resources, and 2184  technical ability to implement zero-trust principles. 2185  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendations  Some OT components (e.g., PLCs, Controllers, HMI) may not support the technologies or  protocols required to fully integrate with a ZTA implementation. As a result, a ZTA  implementation might not be practical for some OT devices. Instead, organizations should  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  72  consider applying ZTA on compatible devices such as those typically found at the functionally  higher levels of the OT architecture (e.g., Purdue Model Levels 3, 4, 5, and the OT DMZ).  Organizations may also want to consider the impact on operations and safety function. For  example, would any adverse impacts occur if the ZTA solution increases the latency to respond  to resource requests or if one or more ZTA components become unavailable? Based on this  analysis, organizations should consider adjusting the ZTA implementations to minimize latency  and ensure adequate redundancy to minimize risks to OT and safety operations.  Another important aspect of ZTA implementations is identity of person and non-person entities  accessing resources. Within OT environments, shared credentials may be utilized which could  impact the ability to fully implement a ZTA solution.  2186  5.2.4 Layer 4 - Hardware Security 2187  Hardware security protection mechanisms provide the foundation for supporting security and 2188  trust for the devices within an environment. Once device trust is established, the state must be 2189  maintained and tracked in accordance with the system model and policy. To support these 2190  capabilities, some vendors provide embedded technology such as the Trusted Platform Module 2191  (TPM) or provide hardware implementation for Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and 2192  Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA). Overall, hardware security capabilities provide the capability to 2193  enhance endpoints to provide specific function and security requirements, including:  2194   Monitoring and analysis 2195   Secure configuration and management  2196   Endpoint hardening 2197   Integrity protection 2198   Access control 2199   Device identity 2200   Root of trust 2201   Physical security 2202  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendations  Organizations should review available hardware security and automated capabilities to  determine how they can support OT environments without impacting operational performance,  safety, or capabilities.  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  73  5.2.5 Layer 5 - Software Security 2203  Software security protection mechanisms provide organizations with capabilities to ensure 2204  applications and services supporting OT are used and maintained properly. Overall, software 2205  security capabilities can enhance endpoint security when organizations incorporate:  2206   Application allowlisting 2207   Patching 2208   Secure code development 2209   Configuration management, including application hardening 2210  5.2.5.1 Application Allowlisting 2211  Application allowlisting technologies provide an additional protection mechanism on hosts by 2212  restricting which applications are allowed to execute. When properly configured, non-authorized 2213  applications will not execute on the host environment. 2214  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendations  The relatively static nature of OT environments presents an opportunity for organizations to  include application allowlisting as part of their defense-in-depth strategy, and is a  recommended best practice by DHS. When considering application allowlisting within an OT  environment, organizations should coordinate with their vendors and review available  implementation guidance such as NIST SP 800-167, Guide to Application Whitelisting  [SP800-167]; Guidelines for Application Whitelisting in Industrial Control Systems; or  relevant guidance for their industry. The configurations and policies should be thoroughly  tested before being deployed to ensure the rules and settings properly support the  organizational security objectives.  5.2.5.2 Patching 2215  Patches have two main purposes: to fix vulnerabilities and to enhance functionality. While 2216  enhancing software functionality is important, in the context of defense-in-depth software 2217  security, the focus of patching is associated with reducing vulnerabilities. As a result, patch 2218  management is a defense-in-depth capability to support vulnerability management as part of an 2219  organizational risk management strategy. 2220  Deploying patches to OT environments requires additional considerations for organizations, 2221  including testing and validation to ensure the patches do not impact operational capabilities or 2222  safety. OT operational requirements can also impact the frequency patches are applied. For 2223  example, some OT environments must run nearly continuously for extended periods of time or 2224  have small maintenance windows when approved updates could be applied. Additionally, 2225  patching older OT components that run on unsupported OSs may not be an option. In these 2226  cases, organizations may want to consider updating their OSs or investigating additional controls 2227  that can protect the environment from attempts to exploit known vulnerabilities. Some tools, 2228  such as web application firewalls (WAF) and IPS, could be configured to provide additional 2229  https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/documents/Seven%20Steps%20to%20Effectively%20Defend%20Industrial%20Control%20Systems_S508C.pdf https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/documents/Guidelines%20for%20Application%20Whitelisting%20in%20Industrial%20Control%20Systems_S508C.pdf  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  74  protection to detect or prevent attacks against unpatched vulnerabilities while the organization 2230  waits for an opportunity to apply the updates. 2231  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendations  Whenever possible, patches should be tested on a sandbox system (test environment) to ensure  they do not cause problems before being deployed to a production system. Organizations  should plan patches and updates during scheduled maintenance windows for the environment  and have a recovery plan for the OT component or system being patched.  Organizations should also consider that different levels, tiers, or zones may have different  availability requirements and, as such, may have different abilities to support patching.  Whenever possible, organizations should prioritize patching components within DMZ  environments and when vulnerabilities exist that impact availability and integrity or would  allow unauthorized remote access to the OT environment.  2232  5.2.5.3 Secure Code Development 2233  For organizations developing in-house systems and components, policies and procedures to 2234  support and validate secure code development practices should be incorporated into the 2235  cybersecurity program. The software development life cycle (SDLC) should include security 2236  during each phase of software development. This should include security reviews and coding 2237  techniques for each of the following processes: 2238   Using or developing tools to audit and automate secure code techniques 2239   Testing and reviewing code to comply with secure coding practices 2240   Testing the software for security errors in programming 2241  For organizations that procure components or services from third parties, reviewing these same 2242  practices should be considered prior to executing contracts with vendors. Organizations can help 2243  industry move toward more secure products by requesting these practices in their service level 2244  agreements and procurement actions. 2245  5.2.5.4 Configuration Management 2246  Applying configuration management practices for cybersecurity settings supporting both secure 2247  configurations and application hardening is important to meet organization and regulatory 2248  security requirements. These settings may include setting access controls for restricting access or 2249  enabling encryption to protect data at rest or in transit. Application hardening procedures may 2250  include disabling or blocking specific network communication ports, application features, or 2251  unnecessary services running on the system. 2252  Encrypting data that flows over networks (in transit) or data stored in memory and hard drives (at 2253  rest) can also be used in defending OT. Encryption prevents an attacker from viewing or 2254  modifying cleartext data streams. Because encryption and the subsequent decryption process use 2255  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  75  algorithms to create ciphers, encryption adds latency and may not be suitable for all OT devices. 2256  Knowing the advantages and disadvantages of encryption can help organizations make an 2257  informed choice on where to include encryption in the defense-in-depth strategy. 2258  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendations  Organizations should consider using encryption to support secure connections or conduits for  OT environments when the connections must pass over non-OT network segments such as the  corporate network or the internet. Virtual private network (VPN) connections should also use  encryption protocols, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Internet Protocol Security  (IPsec), for securing the data.  Encryption can also be used on hard drives to protect information at rest. Full disk encryption  is recommended for portable laptops and devices. Organizations may also want to consider  encrypting folders containing sensitive files.  Organizations must also consider that encryption can negatively impact other defense tools  such as network monitoring. For example, an IDS might not be able to determine if an  encrypted packet is malicious, resulting in either false-positive or false-negative alerts.  2259  5.3 Additional Cybersecurity Architecture Considerations 2260  When establishing a security architecture for supporting OT and IIoT environments, 2261  organizations should include considerations for supporting cyber-related safety, availability, 2262  geographically distributed systems, environmental considerations, and regulatory requirements 2263  into the security architecture designs and implementations. The following subsections discuss 2264  these considerations in more detail. 2265  5.3.1 Cyber-Related Safety Considerations 2266  OT systems are generally designed with specific safety goals, depending on both the business 2267  environment and regulatory requirements. Organizations should consider whether the additional 2268  communication and cybersecurity requirements of safety systems, e.g., segmentation and 2269  isolation of safety systems from other OT systems, is required. Additionally, safety requirements 2270  can influence selection of security mechanisms. For example, safety considerations may require 2271  that an organization use physical separation as opposed to logical separation.  2272  OT systems typically employ fail-to-a-known-state design (e.g., fail-safe design) in the event of 2273  an unexpected situation or a component failure. Fail-safe design considers placing the equipment 2274  or process in a safe state that prevents injury to individuals or destruction to property and avoids 2275  cascading event or secondary hazards. Cyber-related events such as the loss of network 2276  communications could trigger these fail-safe events. To minimize false positives, define the 2277  thresholds that OT components can operate at with reduced or disrupted capabilities such as lost 2278  network communications.  2279  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  76  5.3.2 Availability Considerations 2280  Operational continuity management requires managing availability at multiple levels – data, 2281  applications, IT infrastructure, power, and other supporting utilities such as HVAC, water, steam, 2282  compressed air, etc. Failure of these systems can have a cascading effect on OT systems and can 2283  adversely impact the OT operation. Different availability considerations are presented below. 2284  Data, Applications, and Infrastructure 2285  Architecture requirements and design should support the redundancy needs of the OT systems. 2286  Availability can be enhanced using redundancy at the communication, system, or component 2287  level such that a single failure is less likely to result in a capability or information outage. 2288  Cybersecurity architecture should take into consideration any redundant communication and 2289  protect it to the same security level as the primary.  2290  Additionally, a data backup and restoration process will facilitate speedy recovery of systems in 2291  case of data lost due to cyber-attacks or other reasons. Examples of important data and files are 2292  operational data, program files, configuration files, system images, firewall rules and access 2293  control list (ACLs). A “backup-in-depth” approach, with multiple layers of backups (e.g., local, 2294  facility, disaster) that are time-sequenced such that rapid recent local backups are available for 2295  immediate use and secure backups are available to recover from a massive security incident (e.g., 2296  ransomware attack) can help improve OT system availability. Periodic testing of data backup and 2297  restore capabilities will ensure that they will be available when the need arises. 2298  Primary and Alternate Power Sources 2299  Architectural considerations should include the impact of power outage for OT systems. For 2300  example, if the OT systems need a graceful degradation or orderly shutdown, then an alternate 2301  backup power may be considered. In addition, if the organization’s business continuity plan 2302  requires that the OT systems need to continue operating in the event of an extended loss of the 2303  primary power source, a long-term alternate power supply for the OT systems that is self-2304  contained and not reliant on external power generation can be implemented. The monitoring and 2305  controls systems for the power system are vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Appropriate cybersecurity 2306  practices should be implemented to protect these systems from cyber-attacks. 2307  Other Utilities 2308  Industrial facilities typically have monitoring and controls systems that manage uninterruptable 2309  power supplies (UPSs), HVAC, fire alarm systems, boilers, cooling water plant, steam, 2310  compressed air, etc. These monitoring and controls systems are also vulnerable to cyber-attacks 2311  and can affect the OT systems. Appropriate cybersecurity practices should be implemented to 2312  protect these systems from cyber-attacks. 2313  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendations  Disaster recovery planning is another important activity for OT systems, especially where  there are safety concerns. Organizations should establish and maintain a disaster recovery plan  (DRP) detailing the actions to take before, during, and after a natural, environmental, or  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  77  human-caused (intentionally or unintentionally) disaster. The DRP should also include  instructions for restoring and restarting failed components and integrating them back into  operation. Organizations should also consider testing the DRP to ensure that the necessary  architecture capabilities can be operationalized in an actual disaster recovery scenario.  Tabletop exercises can also be used to simulate a disaster recovery event to support testing.  5.3.3 Geographically Distributed Systems 2314  Many of the critical infrastructure industries have sites that are geographically distributed. 2315  Organizations should consider if differences in physical security at remote locations create risks 2316  to the OT operational capabilities or safety. The necessary cybersecurity and communication 2317  infrastructure should be provided at the remote sites to protect them from cyber threats and to 2318  communicate cybersecurity monitoring information.  2319  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendations  The communication between sites should be encrypted and authenticated end-to-end whether  the connection is via point-to-point link, satellite, or Internet. Organizations should also ensure  adequate bandwidth is provisioned for collecting cyber monitoring data in addition to the  operational data from remote locations.  If the organization has several geographically dispersed sites, the organization should consider  whether security operation will be managed from a central security operations center (SOC) or  from regionally distributed SOCs. Availability of qualified personnel can impact these  decisions.  5.3.4 Regulatory Requirements 2320  Regulated industries must consider cyber-related regulatory requirements when designing their 2321  cybersecurity architecture. For example, NERC Standard CIP-005 (see Appendix D.1.9.1) 2322  provides cybersecurity architecture requirements for bulk electric systems. Similar requirements 2323  and guidance exist for other regulated industries.  2324  5.3.5 Environmental Considerations 2325  Organizations should consider whether any of their processes and equipment pose environmental 2326  hazards. The hazard analysis will typically provide this information. If an environmental hazard 2327  has been identified, organizations should consider architectural measures to prevent 2328  environmental hazard due to cybersecurity failure. 2329  5.3.6 Field I/O (Purdue Level 0) Security Considerations 2330  Many of the devices and the communication protocols at the Field I/O level (Purdue Level 0) 2331  (e.g., sensors, actuators) do not have the ability to be authenticated. Without authentication, there 2332  is the potential to replay, modify, or spoof data. Organizations should make a risk-based decision 2333  considering where within the OT system (e.g., the most critical process) the use of mitigating 2334  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  78  security controls (e.g., digital twins, separate Field I/O monitoring network) should be 2335  implemented to detect incorrect data. 2336  5.3.7 Additional Security Considerations for IIoT 2337  The introduction of IIoT to OT environments can increase connectivity and information 2338  exchanges with enterprise systems and cloud-based systems which may require additional 2339  considerations for the security architecture. For example, introduction of IIoT devices in OT 2340  environments may require altering boundaries or exposing more interfaces and services. 2341  Additionally, the security capabilities of IIoT devices may need to be considered when 2342  developing the security architecture. 2343  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendations  In addition to security architecture considerations, organizations may also need to consider the  impact to policy management, enforcement, and governance to support IIoT. Additionally,  integration of IIoT in OT environments may require a tighter collaboration between IT and OT  security teams for managing the security operations. For example, real-time situational  awareness should be shared between IT and OT security teams.  2344  Application and Infrastructure 2345  Organizations should consider the IIoT data flow use cases, including those that share data 2346  externally, to determine whether additional access control mechanisms are necessary. 2347  Organizations should also consider that the attack vectors for IIoT may be different from those 2348  managed for OT environments – for example, due to the increased communications requirements 2349  or the use of additional services such as cloud systems to support operational requirements. 2350  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendations  Organizations should consider the endpoint security capabilities of the IIoT devices being  deployed. For example, the IIC suggests that organizations consider the following security  capabilities:   Endpoint tamper resistance capabilities   Endpoint root of trust   Endpoint identity   Endpoint access control   Endpoint integrity protection   Endpoint data protection   Endpoint monitoring & analysis   Endpoint configuration and management  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  79   Cryptographic techniques   Capability to harden endpoints  2351  Cybersecurity Capability Considerations 2352  Compute resources including processing, memory, and storage vary among IIoT devices. Some 2353  IIoT devices may have constrained resources and others may have unused capabilities. Both 2354  cases have implications for cybersecurity. Organizations should consider how the resources and 2355  capabilities available in the IIoT devices will integrate into the security architecture to achieve 2356  their cybersecurity objectives. Additionally, organizations should consider if the operational and 2357  safety impacts for IIoT differ from the operational and safety impacts for other OT devices. For 2358  example, IIoT devices may support a separate data monitoring (read-only capability) for the 2359  environment and have minimal impact on operational controls or safety which may allow 2360  organizations to implement security operations differently than those established for OT devices. 2361  5.4 Cybersecurity Architecture Models 2362  Building on the concepts and guidance from Sections 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3, the following subsections 2363  will expand on the general OT and IIoT environments described in Section 2 to provide 2364  examples for how the general environments might be adapted to support defense-in-depth 2365  security architectures. 2366  5.4.1 Distributed Control System (DCS)-Based OT Systems 2367  As described in Section 2, a Distributed Control System (DCS) is used to control production 2368  systems within the same geographic location for industries. Figure 17 shows an example DCS 2369  system implementation. Figure 18 shows an example defense-in-depth architecture applied to the 2370  DCS system. 2371  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  80  2372  2373  Figure 17: DCS implementation example 2374  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  81  2375  Figure 18: Defense-in-depth security architecture example for DCS system 2376  For the Figure 18 example, the assumption is that the organization has already addressed Layer 1 2377  – Security Management and Layer 2 – Physical Security. For Layer 3 – Network Security, the 2378  organization should consider incorporating the following capabilities in the security architecture: 2379  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  82   Separate networks into different levels or zones. In this example, the devices are split into 2380  different levels based on function. The Field Level includes devices typically found in the 2381  Purdue model levels 0, 1, and 2. The Operations Management level includes devices for 2382  monitoring and managing the field level devices and includes the Purdue level 3 components. 2383  The DMZ includes devices that support bridging the operations management and enterprise 2384  tiers. Organizations should also consider if additional network segments are required for 2385  safety or security systems (e.g., physical monitoring and access controls, doors, gates, 2386  cameras, Voice over IP [VoIP], access card readers). Network segmentation is an important 2387  step in applying a defense-in-depth strategy.  2388   Boundary devices (e.g., firewalls) are added to control and monitor communications between 2389  different levels. Industrial-class firewalls are sometimes used between the field and 2390  operations management levels to provide additional support for OT-specific protocols or to 2391  allow devices to operate in harsh environments. Rules for both inbound and outbound 2392  communication should be defined so that only authorized communication passes between 2393  adjacent levels. 2394   Implement a DMZ to separate the OT environment from the enterprise network. Any 2395  communications between the Enterprise Level and the Operations Management level are 2396  required to go through services within the DMZ. Since the DMZ connects to outside 2397  environments, the services within the DMZ must be monitored and protected to avoid 2398  compromises within the DMZ that allow pivoting to the OT environment without detection. 2399   The security architecture diagram shows an IT authentication server in the Enterprise 2400  network to authenticate users in the Enterprise network, and a separate OT authentication 2401  server in the operations management network for OT users. Organizations may want to 2402  consider this approach if it supports their risk-based security objectives. 2403  For Layer 4 – Hardware Security, and Layer 5 – Software Security, organizations should 2404  consider applying the principle of least functionality on all field, operations management, and 2405  DMZ devices to support application and device hardening. Organizations should identify and 2406  disable any non-essential capability, software, or ports from the devices. For example, a web 2407  server or SSH server may be available in some newer-model PLCs or HMIs. If these services are 2408  not used, they should be disabled and the associated TCP/UDP ports should be disabled. Only 2409  enable the functionality when required. 2410  5.4.2 DCS/PLC-Based OT with IIoT 2411  Building on the guidance for DCS/PLC-based OT environments in Section 5.4.1, Figure 19 2412  shows a simplified example security architecture implementation for the DCS system with 2413  additional IIoT devices configured to utilize a local IIoT platform for providing computing 2414  capabilities. Due to different communication and architectural components supporting IIoT, the 2415  example shows separate network segments for supporting the additional IIoT components. 2416  Communication from the IIoT platform tier is routed through the DMZ border firewall, allowing 2417  organizations to consider data transmission to servers in the DMZ or to the Enterprise/Internet as 2418  required to support IIoT operational requirements. Additionally, this also permits the 2419  cybersecurity services located in the DMZ to monitor the IIoT platform tier. 2420  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  83  2421  Figure 19: Security architecture example for DCS system with IIoT devices 2422  Alternatively, some organizations may use cloud services for their IIoT platform. In this case, 2423  organizations should consider how to secure communications from the edge to the cloud IIoT 2424  platform. Organization should also consider routing the communication through the DMZ 2425  boundary firewall to manage and monitor them. 2426  5.4.3 SCADA-Based OT Environments 2427  An example implementation showing the components and general configuration of a SCADA 2428  system is depicted in Figure 20. Typically, primary and backup control centers support one or 2429  more remote stations based on geographic locations, and regional control centers are 2430  geographically located to support one or more primary or backup control centers. Due to the 2431  distributed nature of the remote stations and control centers, communication between locations 2432  typically passes over external or WAN connections using wireless or wired mediums. 2433  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  84  2434  Figure 20: An example SCADA system in an OT environment 2435  Figure 21 shows an example defense-in-depth implementation for the example SCADA system. 2436  For this example, the assumption is that the organization has already addressed Layer 1 – 2437  Security Management and Layer 2 – Physical Security. For Layer 3 – Network Security, the 2438  organization should consider incorporating the following capabilities in the security architecture: 2439   Separate networks into different zones or regions; it is an important step in applying a 2440  defense-in-depth strategy in the SCADA environment. Additional separation should be 2441  considered for security systems (e.g., physical monitoring and access controls, doors, gates, 2442  cameras, VoIP, access card readers). 2443   Boundary devices (e.g., firewalls) are added between the different regions to control and 2444  monitor communications between the network segments. Industrial-class stateful firewalls 2445  may offer more support for OT-specific protocols, enhancing protection for OT devices like 2446  the PLC and controllers. Rules for inbound and outbound communication should be defined 2447  so that only authorized communication passes between regions. 2448   Use secure connections (e.g., VPN tunnel. encrypted channel, point-to-point connection) 2449  between network segments, such as between a regional center and primary control centers, 2450  and between remote stations and control centers. For geographically distanced locations, 2451  secure connections can be connected over the Internet/WAN connection. Devices in the 2452  network segments should only connect to other segments through the secure connection and 2453  should be restricted in accessing the Internet.  2454  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  85   Implement a DMZ to separate the control centers from the enterprise network. Any 2455  communications between the enterprise network and the control centers must go through 2456  services within the DMZ. Since the DMZ connects to outside environments, the services 2457  within the DMZ must be monitored and protected to avoid compromises within the DMZ that 2458  might allow pivoting to the OT environment without detection. 2459  2460  Figure 21: Security architecture example for SCADA system 2461  For Layer 4 – Hardware Security, and Layer 5 – Software Security, organizations should 2462  consider applying the principle of least functionality to all remote station components, control 2463  center components, and DMZ devices to support application and device hardening. 2464  Organizations should identify and disable any non-essential capability, software, or ports from 2465  the devices. For example, a webserver or SSH server may be available in some newer-model 2466  PLCs or HMIs. If these services are not used, they should be disabled and the associated 2467  TCP/UDP ports should be disabled. Only enable the functionality when required. 2468  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  86  6 Applying the Cybersecurity Framework to OT 2469  Many public and private sector organizations have adopted the NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2470  (CSF) [CSF] as a means for guiding cybersecurity activities and considering cybersecurity risks. 2471  The Framework consists of five concurrent and continuous Functions—Identify, Protect, Detect, 2472  Respond, and Recover—for presenting industry standards, guidelines, and practices in a manner 2473  that allows for communication of cybersecurity activities and outcomes across the organization. 2474  When considered together, these functions provide a high-level, strategic view for cybersecurity 2475  risk management. The Framework further identifies underlying key Categories and 2476  Subcategories for each Function and matches them with example Informative References such as 2477  existing standards, guidelines, and practices for each Subcategory.  2478  The five Functions include 23 Categories of cybersecurity outcomes and Subcategories that 2479  further divide the Categories into more specific technical or management activities. For this 2480  section, each subsection references a CSF Function and Category and includes the CSF two-2481  letter abbreviations for reference.  2482  The CSF functions guide the following actions:  Identify (ID) – Develop an organizational  understanding to manage cybersecurity risk to  systems, people, assets, data, and capabilities.  Protect (PR) – Develop and implement appropriate  safeguards to ensure delivery of critical services.  Detect (DE) – Develop and implement appropriate  activities to identify the occurrence of the  cybersecurity event.  Respond (RS) – Develop and implement  appropriate activities to take action regarding a  detected cybersecurity incident.  Recover (RC) – Develop and implement  appropriate activities to maintain plans for  resilience and to restore any capabilities or services  that were impaired due to a cybersecurity incident.  2483  All CSF Functions and selected CSF Categories and Subcategories are covered in this section. 2484  Additionally, some Categories include additional OT-specific considerations that are not 2485  included in the CSF.  2486  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  87  6.1 Identify (ID) 2487  The Identify Function provides foundational activities to effectively use the CSF. The intended 2488  outcome of the Identify Function is to develop an organizational understanding to manage 2489  cybersecurity risk to systems, people, assets, data, and capabilities. 2490  6.1.1 Asset Management (ID.AM) 2491  The ability for organizations to properly and consistently identify and consistently manage data, 2492  personnel, devices, systems, and facilities based on their relative importance provides a 2493  foundational capability to support an organizational cybersecurity program. Additionally, 2494  updating inventory information when components are added, removed, or changed (e.g., patched, 2495  new firmware installed, component swapped during maintenance) helps organizations accurately 2496  manage their overall environment risks. Organizations should consider including the following to 2497  support their asset management capability:  2498   Unique identifiers to differentiate and track assets 2499   Hardware inventory management to track computing and network devices within the 2500  environment including device details and location. Device details might include vendor, 2501  model, serial number, purchase information, and manufacturing/build information (e.g., 2502  provenance information). 2503   Software and firmware inventory management to track software and firmware installed with 2504  the OT components, including version numbers and location information, Software Bill of 2505  Materials (SBOM), etc. 2506   Vendor information to establish a repository of vendor information, points of contact, 2507  warranty information, locations of recall and update information, etc. 2508   Documented roles and responsibilities to identify specific individuals, teams, or organization 2509  groups who represent the asset owner and those with operation & maintenance and 2510  cybersecurity roles and responsibilities 2511  Supplemental guidance for ID.AM can be found in the following documents: 2512   NIST SP 1800-5, IT Asset Management 2513   NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and 2514  Organizations  2515  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Organizations should consider the criticality of a complete and accurate asset inventory for  managing risk within the OT environment. Accurate inventory information supports multiple  risk management objectives including risk assessment, vulnerability management, and  obsolescence tracking.  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-5 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53r5 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53r5  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  88  While automated tools for supporting asset management are generally preferable,  organizations should consider how the tool collects information and if the collection method  (e.g., active scanning) may have a negative impact on their OT systems. Performing a test  using the automated asset management tools on offline systems or components is  recommended prior to deployment within the OT production environment. When automated  tools are not feasible due to network architectures or other OT environment issues, the  organization should consider manual processes for maintaining a current inventory.  2516  6.1.1.1 Mapping Data Flows (ID.AM-3) 2517  Data flow diagrams enable a manufacturer to understand the flow of data between networked 2518  components. Documenting data flows enables organizations to understand expected behavior of 2519  their networks. This understanding of how devices communicate assists with troubleshooting as 2520  well as response and recovery activities. This information can be leveraged during forensic 2521  activities or used for analysis to identify anomalies. 2522  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Organizations should consider the impact on OT systems from the use of automated data flow  mapping tools that use active scanning or require network monitoring tools (e.g., in-line  network probes). Impacts could be due to the nature of the information, the volume of network  traffic, or momentary disconnection of manufacturing system components from the network.  Consider using data flow mapping tools that utilize these methods during planned downtime.  2523  6.1.1.2 Network Architecture Documentation (supports the outcome of ID.AM)  2524  Network architecture documentation tools enable a manufacturer to identify, document, and 2525  diagram the interconnections between networked devices, corporate networks, and other external 2526  connections. A comprehensive understanding of the interconnections within the environment is 2527  critical for successful deployment of cybersecurity controls. This information is equally 2528  important for effective network monitoring. 2529  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Network architecture documentation tools that use automated topology discovery technologies  are only able to capture details from IP-based networked devices. Many OT environments  contain isolated systems, components, or systems connected on non-IP networks. The OT  environment may not be technically capable of using automated network architecture  documentation tools. Manual processes may be required to document these components.  Asset owners may also want to consider how automated scanning activity may potentially  impact the OT system by testing automation tools in a non-production environment. Based on  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  89  testing results, asset owners should consider utilizing automated OT network architecture  documentation tools during planned downtime.  Organizations may also want to consider utilizing physical inspections of OT network  connections or analysis of network logs to document the OT network architecture, especially if  the network is not large or complicated. Incorporating OT network activity monitoring may  help organizations identify the addition or removal of devices within the environment between  planned scanning activities.  2530  6.1.2 Governance (ID.GV) 2531  Effective governance involves organization leadership incorporating risk management objectives 2532  along with resiliency, privacy, and cybersecurity objectives into the strategic planning process 2533  and providing the required resources to effectively implement and sustain the cybersecurity 2534  program. From this process, organization leadership develops and disseminates policies 2535  establishing security requirements for their environments. These policies include, for example, 2536  the identification and assignment of roles, responsibilities, management commitment, and 2537  compliance. The policies may also reflect coordination among organizational entities responsible 2538  for the different aspects of security (i.e., technical, physical, personnel, cyber-physical, access 2539  control, media protection, vulnerability management, maintenance, monitoring). 2540  Sections 3 and 4 provide additional details for governance. Supplemental guidance for ID.GV 2541  can be found in the following documents: 2542   NIST SP 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and 2543  Information System View 2544   NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2, Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and 2545  Organizations: A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy  2546   NIST SP 800-100, Information Security Handbook: A Guide for Managers 2547   NISTIR 8286, Integrating Cybersecurity and Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 2548  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Organizations should consider:   Ensuring the cybersecurity program is provided sufficient resources to support the  organization’s IT and OT risk management strategy   Ensuring that policies take into consideration the full life cycle of the OT systems   Ensuring that legal and regulatory cybersecurity requirements affecting the OT operations  are understood and managed  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-39 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-39 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-37r2 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-37r2 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-100 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8286  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  90   Establishing one or more senior official positions with responsibility and accountability for  the organization’s governance and risk management for IT and OT cybersecurity programs   Establishing communication and coordination between IT and OT organizations   Cross-training IT and OT personnel to support the cybersecurity program  2549  6.1.3 Risk Assessment (ID.RA) 2550  A cybersecurity risk assessment is performed to identify risks and estimate the magnitude of 2551  harm to operations, assets, or individuals resulting from cyber-incidents such as unauthorized 2552  access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of an information system or data. 2553  Organizations should consider the frequency for updating risk assessments and testing system 2554  cybersecurity controls. 2555  Supplemental guidance for ID.RA can be found in the following documents: 2556   NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments 2557   NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2, Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and 2558  Organizations: A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy 2559   NIST SP 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and 2560  Information System View 2561  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  In OT environments, risks and impacts may be related to safety, health, and the environment,  in addition to business/financial impacts. As a result, organizations may find that determining  a cost-to-benefit analysis for some types of risks is not possible. In these cases, organizations  should consider reviewing past cyber and non-cyber incidents that have resulted in loss of  power, loss of control, loss of upstream feed, loss of downstream capacity, and major  equipment failures. A PHA, FMEA, or analysis of past events can be used to understand the  potential impact of a cyber incident. ISA 62443-3-2 provides guidance on how to assess  cyber risk in an environment with these potential consequences.  Risk assessments also require the identification of both vulnerabilities and threats to the OT  environment. Maintaining an accurate inventory of the IT and OT assets within the  environment of operation to include product vendor, model numbers, firmware, OSs, and  software versions installed on the assets facilitates the identification, tracking, and  remediation of vulnerabilities. OT-specific vulnerability information is available through  multiple methods, including:   Monitoring security groups, associations, and vendors for security alerts and advisories   NVD for detailed information on known vulnerabilities for hardware and software assets  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-30r1 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-37r2 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-37r2 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-39 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-39  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  91  Threat information relevant to the environment can be obtained from both internal resources  as well as external threat intelligence information sharing forums. Organizations should  consider participating in cyber threat information sharing [SP800-150].  2562  6.1.4 Risk Management Strategy (ID.RM) 2563  The risk management strategy guides how risk is framed, assessed, responded to, and monitored, 2564  and provides a consistent approach to making risk-based decisions across the organization. Risk 2565  tolerance, assumptions, constraints, priorities, and trade-offs are identified for investment and 2566  operational decision making. Additionally, the risk management strategy identifies acceptable 2567  risk assessment methodologies, potential risk responses, and a process to continuously monitor 2568  the security posture (or implementation of security countermeasures/outcomes) of the 2569  organization.  2570  Section 3 describes the overall risk management process for supporting an effective 2571  cybersecurity program. The following NIST documents provide additional implementation 2572  guidance for developing a risk management strategy: 2573   NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2, Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and 2574  Organizations: A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy 2575   NIST SP 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and 2576  Information System View 2577   NISTIR 8179, Criticality Analysis Process Model: Prioritizing Systems and Components 2578  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  When establishing an OT risk management strategy, organizations should consider:   Ensuring that the risk tolerance of an OT environment is informed by the organization’s  role in critical infrastructure and sector-specific risk analysis   Documenting failure scenarios involving IT components within the OT environment and  their effect on operations and safety   Establishing processes to periodically update information to determine the current risk  posture for the environment and coordinate required adjustments to risk management and  management controls  Overall risk can also be reduced by addressing likelihood and consequence. For OT systems,  the risk management strategy should consider non-security and safety controls (e.g., pressure  relief valves, manual valves) that can also help reduce the consequence of a failure.  2579  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-37r2 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-37r2 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-39 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-39 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8179  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  92  6.1.5 Supply Chain Risk Management (ID.SC) 2580  Supply chains are multifaceted and are built on a variety of business, economic, and 2581  technological factors. Organizations choose their suppliers, and consumers choose their sources 2582  based on a range of factors that vary from corporate preferences and existing/ongoing business 2583  relationships to more discrete considerations such as the existence of limited sources of supply or 2584  other unique characteristics.  2585  The subcategories (outcomes) that fall within the CSF Supply Chain Risk Management category 2586  provide the basis for developing processes and procedures for managing supply chain risk. These 2587  risks include insertion of counterfeits, unauthorized production, malicious insiders, tampering, 2588  theft, and insertion of malicious software and hardware, as well as poor manufacturing and 2589  development practices in the cyber supply chain. These risks must be identified, assessed, and 2590  managed. The CSF category also addresses supplier and third-party partner contracts, 2591  assessments, evaluations, and response and recovery planning.  2592  Additionally, organizations should investigate SBOMs and distributed ledger (e.g., blockchain) 2593  technologies to support supply chain risk management. For example, SBOM information can 2594  identify software components and the relationships or dependencies on other components. 2595  Having this information available can help an organization determine if a device is affected by 2596  reported software vulnerabilities. 2597  Supplemental guidance for Supply Chain Risk Management can be found in the following 2598  documents: 2599   NIST SP 800-161, Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Federal Information 2600  Systems and Organizations 2601   NISTIR 8276, Key Practices in Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management: Observations from 2602  Industry 2603  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Organizations should consider documenting and tracking serial numbers, checksums, digital  certificates/signatures, or other identifying features that can allow determining the  authenticity of vendor-provided OT hardware, software, and firmware. Organizations should  also consider if OT is purchased directly from the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or  an authorized third-party distributor or reseller. Suppliers should be assessed or reviewed to  ensure that they continue to follow best practices.  Many OT components and devices utilize open-source libraries to support their functional  capabilities. Organizations should identify the open-source dependencies for their OT  components and establish monitoring for open-source information such as vendor websites or  cyber news sources to ensure no known vulnerabilities or counterfeits have been disclosed.  Additionally, organizations might consider utilizing an industry-recognized certification  process for OT products to support supply chain risk management.  2604  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-161 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-161 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8276 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8276  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  93  6.2 Protect (PR) 2605  6.2.1 Identity Management and Access Control (PR.AC) 2606  Identity Management and Access Control (PR.AC) identifies outcomes around establishing and 2607  managing the identification mechanisms and credentials for users, devices, and services. Identity 2608  management supports the cybersecurity principle to identify and authorize a person, process, or 2609  device before granting physical or logical access to resources such as the system, information, or 2610  location being protected positively and uniquely. Access controls represent the policies, 2611  processes, and technology for specifying the use of system resources by only authorized users, 2612  programs, processes, or other systems. PR.AC controls allow organizations to manage the logical 2613  and physical access to support system risk management requirements. 2614  Supplemental guidance for implementing identity management and access control outcomes can 2615  be found in the following documents: 2616   NIST SP 800-63-3, Digital Identity Guidelines 2617   NIST SP 800-73-4, Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification 2618   NIST SP 800-76-2, Biometric Specifications for Personal Identity Verification 2619   NIST SP 800-100, Information Security Handbook: A Guide for Managers 2620  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Organizations should consider the life cycle for managing OT credentials including issuance,  revocation, and updates across the OT environment.  Organizations should consider the centralization of identification and authentication for users,  devices, and processes within the OT environments to improve/reduce burden account  management and enhance monitoring capabilities. Common network technologies such as  Active Directory and, more generally, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) or  similar technologies can be utilized to support centralization of identity management across  environments. If authenticated accounts from the IT environment have access within the OT  environment, organizations should weigh the increased risk from permitting that versus the  benefits of using centralized accounts.  In situations where OT cannot support authentication, or the organization determines it is not  advisable due to adverse impacts on performance, safety, or reliability, the organization should  select compensating countermeasures, such as use of physical security (e.g., control center  keycard access for authorized users) to provide an equivalent security capability or level of  protection for the OT. This guidance also applies to the use of session lock and session  termination in an OT.  A unique challenge in OT is the need for immediate access to an HMI in emergency situations.  The time needed to enter a user’s credentials may impede response or intervention by the  operator, resulting in negative consequences to safety, health, or the environment.  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63-3 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-73-4 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-76-2 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-100  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  94  6.2.1.1 Logical Access Controls (PR.AC)  2621  Logical access controls restrict logical access to systems, data, and networks of the organization. 2622  ACLs are sometimes used to support logical access controls. An ACL is one or more rules for 2623  determining whether an access request should be granted or denied; they are used to support the 2624  principle of least functionality and control access to restricted areas. They are commonly used 2625  with isolation technologies such as firewalls where an ACL might specify the source, 2626  destination, and protocol allowed through the isolation device to or from the protected network 2627  segment. An ACL may also be used for physical or logical access to areas or information such as 2628  network file shares, databases, or other data repositories and applications. 2629  Another technology for supporting logical access controls is called Role-Based Access Control 2630  (RBAC). RBAC is a technology that has the potential to reduce the complexity and cost of 2631  security administration in networks with large numbers of intelligent devices. RBAC is built on 2632  the principle that employees change roles and responsibilities more frequently than the duties 2633  within roles and responsibilities. Under RBAC, security administration is simplified using roles, 2634  hierarchies, and constraints to organize user access levels. 2635  Additionally, Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) is an access control approach in which 2636  access is determined based on attributes associated with subjects (requesters) and the objects 2637  being accessed. Each object and subject have a set of associated attributes, such as location, time 2638  of creation, access rights, etc. Access to an object is authorized or denied depending upon 2639  whether the required (e.g., policy-defined) correlation can be made between the attributes of that 2640  object and of the requesting subject. 2641  For federal employees and contractors, Personal Identity Verification (PIV), used in accordance 2642  with FIPS 201, may be required to achieve access control. Organizations may also consider one 2643  or more of these techniques when determining how to support local access controls within their 2644  environments. Supplemental guidance for access controls can be found in the following 2645  documents: 2646   NIST SP 800-63-3, Digital Identity Guidelines 2647   NIST SP 800-73-4, Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification 2648   NIST SP 800-76-2, Biometric Specifications for Personal Identity Verification 2649   NIST SP 800-78-4, Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes for Personal Identity 2650  Verification 2651   NIST SP 800-96, PIV Card to Reader Interoperability Guidelines 2652   NIST SP 800-97, Establishing Wireless Robust Security Networks: A Guide to IEEE 802.11i 2653   NIST SP 800-162, Guide to Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) Definition and 2654  Considerations 2655  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63-3 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-73-4 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-76-2 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-78-4 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-78-4 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-96 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-97 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-162 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-162  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  95  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Organizations should consider the following:   Some logical access controls such as RBAC support the principle of least privilege and  separation of duties by providing a uniform means to manage access to OT devices while  reducing the cost of maintaining individual device access levels and minimizing errors.  These logical access controls can also restrict OT user privileges to only those required to  perform each person’s job (i.e., configuring each role based on the principle of least  privilege). The level of access can take several forms, including viewing, using, and  altering specific OT data or device functions.   Implement solutions that provide credential management, authentication and authorization,  and system use monitoring technical capabilities. These technologies may help manage  risks associated with OT devices and protocols by providing a secure platform to allow  authorized personnel to access the OT devices.   Access control systems that verify the identity of the individual, process, or device before  granting access should be designed to minimize latency or delays in processing OT system  access or commands.   Implementing highly reliable systems that do not interfere with the routine or emergency  duties of OT personnel. Solutions should be designed to reduce the impact of determining  identity and authorization on OT operations and safety.  2656  To support access controls, an organization is not limited to a single access control approach. In 2657  some cases, applying different access control techniques to different zones based on criticality, 2658  safety, and operational requirements is more efficient and effective. For example, ACLs on 2659  network zone firewalls combined with RBAC on engineering workstations and servers, plus 2660  ABAC integrated into physical security to sensitive areas may achieve the risk-based access 2661  control requirements for an organization. 2662  6.2.1.2 Physical Access Controls (PR.AC-2) 2663  Physical security controls are any physical measures that limit physical access to assets. These 2664  measures are employed to prevent many types of undesirable effects including unauthorized 2665  physical access to sensitive locations; unauthorized introduction of new systems, infrastructure, 2666  communications interfaces, or removable media; and unauthorized disruption of the physical 2667  process. Physical access controls include controls for managing and monitoring physical access, 2668  maintaining logs, and handling visitors.  2669  Deployment of physical security controls is often subject to environmental, safety, regulatory, 2670  legal, and other requirements that must be identified and addressed specific to a given 2671  environment. Physical security controls may be broadly applied or could be specific to certain 2672  assets. 2673  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  96  Initial layers of physical access control are often determined based on the risk of access to the 2674  overall facility, not just OT components. Some regulations, such as NERC CIP-006-5 (Physical 2675  Security of BES Cyber Systems) or from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), may also 2676  determine the strength and quantity of barriers used for the physical protection of a facility.  2677  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance   The physical protection of the cyber components and data associated with OT must be  addressed as part of the overall security for OT environments. Security at many OT  facilities is closely tied to operational safety. A primary goal is to keep personnel out of  hazardous situations without preventing them from doing their jobs or carrying out  emergency procedures.   Physical access controls are often applied to the OT environment as compensating controls  when legacy systems do not support modern IT logical access controls (e.g., an asset could  be locked in a cabinet when the USB port or power button cannot be logically disabled).  When implementing these mitigations, organizations should consider if the OT component  being protected can be compromised using a wireless or network connection that might  bypass the physical security controls.  A defense-in-depth solution to physical security should consider the following attributes:   Protection of Physical Locations. Classic physical security considerations typically  include an architecture of layered security measures creating several physical barriers  around buildings, facilities, rooms, equipment, or other informational assets. Physical  security controls should be implemented to protect physical locations and may include  fences, anti-vehicle ditches, earthen mounds, walls, reinforced barricades, gates, door and  cabinet locks, guards, or other measures.   Physical Access Control. Equipment cabinets should be locked when not required for  operation or safety, and wiring should be neat and within cabinets or under floors.  Additionally, consider keeping all computing and networking equipment in secured areas.  Keys of OT assets like PLCs and safety systems should be in the “Run” position at all  times unless they are being actively programmed.   Access Monitoring Systems. Access monitoring systems include electronic surveillance  capabilities such as still and video cameras, sensors, and identification systems (e.g., badge  readers, biometric scanners, electronic keypads). Such devices typically do not prevent  access to a particular location; rather, they store and record either the physical presence or  the lack of physical presence of individuals, vehicles, animals, or other physical entities.  Adequate lighting should be provided based on the type of access monitoring device  deployed. These systems can also sometimes alert or initiate action upon detection of  unauthorized access.   People and Asset Tracking. Locating people and vehicles in a facility can be important  for safety reasons, and it is increasingly important for security reasons as well. Asset  location technologies can be used to track the movements of people and vehicles to ensure  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  97  that they stay in authorized areas, to identify personnel needing assistance, and to support  emergency response.  The following are additional physical security considerations:   Portable Devices. Organizations should apply a verification process that includes, at a  minimum, scanning devices (e.g., laptops, USB storage, etc.) for malicious code prior to  allowing the device to be connected to OT devices or networks.   Cabling. Unshielded twisted pair communications cable, while acceptable for the office  environment, may not be suitable for some OT environment due to its susceptibility to  interference from magnetic fields, radio waves, temperature extremes, moisture, dust, and  vibration. Organizations should consider using alternative cabling or shielding that  provides suitable protection against environmental threats. Additionally, organizations  should consider color-coded cables, connectors, and conduits in addition to labeling to  clearly delineate OT and IT network segments and reduce the risk of potential cross- connections.   Control Centers / Control Rooms. Providing physical security for control centers/control  rooms is recommended to reduce the potential of many threats including unauthorized  access. The access to these areas should be limited to authorized personnel due to the  increased probability of finding sensitive servers, network components, control systems,  and consoles for supporting continuous monitoring and rapid response. Gaining physical  access to a control room or OT system components often implies gaining logical access to  the system or system components. In extreme cases, organizations may need to consider  designing control centers/control rooms to be blast-proof, or to provide an offsite  emergency control center/control room so that control can be maintained if the primary  control center/control room becomes uninhabitable.  2678  6.2.1.3 Network Segmentation and Isolation (PR.AC-5) 2679  As discussed in Section 5, a common architecture for supporting a defense-in-depth 2680  cybersecurity approach involves the use of network segmentation or zoning to organize devices 2681  by location or function. Network segmentation is typically implemented physically using 2682  different network switches or logically using Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) 2683  configurations. When properly configured, network segmentation supports enforcing security 2684  policies and segmented traffic at the Ethernet layer and facilitates network isolation. 2685  For network isolation, organizations typically utilize their mapped data flows to identify required 2686  communications between segments. Network isolation devices such as gateways (including 2687  unidirectional gateways or data-diodes) and firewalls are then configured to enforce these 2688  communication restrictions by monitoring all communication traffic and only permitting 2689  communication between segments that has been explicitly authorized. 2690  2691  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  98  Supplemental guidance for access controls can be found in the following documents: 2692   NIST SP 800-41 Rev. 1, Guidelines on Firewalls and Firewall Policy 2693   NIST SP 800-207, Zero Trust Architecture 2694   NIST SP 1800-15, Securing Small-Business and Home Internet of Things (IoT) Devices: 2695  Mitigating Network-Based Attacks Using Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) 2696  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  The use of network segmentation and isolation should support an organization’s OT  cybersecurity defense in depth architecture, as described in Section 5.  While VLANs can be a cost-effective solution for OT network segmentation, organizations  should consider utilizing physically separate switches for segmenting high-criticality devices  such as those supporting safety systems.  When configuring network isolation devices, organizations may find it difficult to determine  which network traffic is necessary for proper OT operations. In these situations, organizations  might consider temporarily allowing and recording all communication between the network  segments. This can provide reviewable logs to identify and document authorized  communication for implementing network isolation rules. Additionally, this activity might  also reveal previously unknown or undocumented communication that needs to be reviewed  by the organization.  Organizations should also consider whether regulatory requirements stipulate the type of  network isolation devices required for OT environments or specific network segments. If  organizations choose to utilize firewalls for supporting network isolation, modern firewalls  such as stateful and deep packet inspection devices and devices specifically designed to  support OT environments should be considered. Organizations should enforce a deny-all,  permit-by-exception policy where possible and also review the Centre for the Protection of  National Infrastructure’s (CPNI) Firewall Deployment for SCADA and Process Control  Networks: Good Practice Guide to assist with their firewall implementations.  Organizations should keep in mind that network isolation devices might not protect against  all network-based risks. For example, network isolation does not mitigate risks associated  with lateral movement within a network segment such as the propagation of a worm or other  malicious code. Additionally, some IT protocols and many industrial communications  protocols have known security vulnerabilities which might be exploitable through network  isolation devices. Organizations should consider limiting the flow of insecure protocols,  restricting information flow to be unidirectional, and utilizing secure and authenticated  protocols for supporting information exchange between the OT environment and other  network segments.  2697  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-41r1 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-207 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-15 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-15 https://www.energy.gov/oe/downloads/good-practice-guide-firewall-deployment-scada-and-process-control-networks https://www.energy.gov/oe/downloads/good-practice-guide-firewall-deployment-scada-and-process-control-networks  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  99  6.2.1.4 User, Device, and Asset Authentication (PR.AC-7) 2698  6.2.1.4.1 Physical Token Authentication 2699  The primary vulnerability that physical token authentication addresses is easily duplicating a 2700  secret code or sharing it with others. It eliminates the all-too-common scenario of a password to 2701  a “secure” system being on the wall next to a PC or operator station. The security token cannot 2702  be duplicated without special access to equipment and supplies.  2703  A second benefit is that the secret within a physical token can be very large, physically secure, 2704  and randomly generated. Because it is embedded in metal or silicon, it does not have the same 2705  risks that manually entered passwords do. If a security token is lost or stolen, the token owner is 2706  aware of the missing token and can notify security personnel to disable access. Traditional 2707  passwords can become lost or stolen without notice, leaving credentials more vulnerable to 2708  exploitation. 2709  Common forms of physical/token authentication include: 2710   Traditional physical lock and keys 2711   Security cards (e.g., magnetic, smart chip, optical coding) 2712   Radio frequency devices in the form of cards, key fobs, or mounted tags 2713   Dongles with secure encryption keys that attach to the USB, serial, or parallel ports of 2714  computers 2715   One-time authentication code generators (e.g., key fobs) 2716  For single-factor authentication with a physical token, the largest weakness is that physically 2717  holding the token means access is granted (e.g., anyone finding a set of lost keys now has access 2718  to whatever they open). Physical token authentication is more secure when combined with a 2719  second form of authentication, such as a memorized PIN used along with the token. 2720  When token-based access control employs cryptographic verification, the access control system 2721  should conform to the requirements of NIST SP 800-78 [SP800-78]. 2722  6.2.1.4.2 Biometric Authentication 2723  Biometric authentication enhances software-only solutions, such as password authentication, by 2724  offering an additional authentication factor and removing the need for people to memorize 2725  complex secrets. In addition, because biometric characteristics are unique to a given individual, 2726  biometric authentication addresses the issues of lost or stolen physical tokens and smart cards. 2727  Biometric devices make a useful secondary check versus other forms of authentication that can 2728  become lost or borrowed. Using biometric authentication in combination with token-based 2729  access control or badge-operated employee time clocks increases the security level.  2730  2731  2732  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  100  Noted issues with biometric authentication include: 2733   Distinguishing a real object from a fake (e.g., how to distinguish a real human finger from a 2734  silicon-rubber cast of one or a real human voice from a recorded one). 2735   Generating type-I and type-II errors (the probability of rejecting a valid biometric image, and 2736  the probability of accepting an invalid biometric image, respectively). Biometric 2737  authentication devices should be configured to the lowest crossover between these two 2738  probabilities, also known as the crossover error rate. 2739   Handling environmental factors such as temperature and humidity to which some biometric 2740  devices are sensitive.  2741   Addressing industrial applications where employees may have on safety glasses and/or 2742  gloves and industrial chemicals may impact biometric scanners. 2743   Retraining biometric scanners that occasionally “drift” over time. Human biometric traits 2744  may also shift over time, necessitating periodic scanner retraining. 2745   Requiring face-to-face technical support and verification for device training, unlike a 2746  password that can be given over a phone or an access card that can be handed out by a 2747  receptionist. 2748   Denying needed access to the OT system because of a temporary inability of the sensing 2749  device to acknowledge a legitimate user. 2750   Being socially acceptable. Users consider some biometric authentication devices more 2751  acceptable than others. For example, retinal scans may be considered very low on the scale of 2752  acceptability, while thumbprint scanners may be considered high on the scale of 2753  acceptability. Users of biometric authentication devices will need to take social acceptability 2754  for their target group into consideration when selecting among biometric authentication 2755  technologies. 2756  When token-based access control employs biometric verification, the access control system 2757  should conform to the requirements of NIST SP 800-76 [SP800-76]. 2758  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  While biometrics can provide a valuable authentication mechanism, organizations may need  to carefully assess this technology for use with industrial applications. Physical and  environmental issues within OT environments may decrease the reliability of biometric  authorized authentication. Organizations may need to coordinate with system vendors or  manufacturers regarding their specific physical and environmental properties and biometric  authentication requirements.  2759  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  101  6.2.1.4.3 Smart Card Authentication 2760  Smart cards come in a variety of form factors, from USB devices to embedded chips on cards 2761  about the size of credit cards that can be printed and embossed. Smart cards can be customized, 2762  individualized, and issued in-house or outsourced to service providers who could issue hundreds 2763  of thousands per day. Smart cards enhance software-only solutions, such as password 2764  authentication, by offering an additional authentication factor and removing the human element 2765  in memorizing complex secrets by: 2766   Isolating security-critical computations involving authentication, digital signatures, and key 2767  exchange from other parts of the system that do not have a need to know 2768   Enabling portability of credentials and other private information between computer systems 2769   Providing tamper-resistant storage for protecting private keys and other forms of personal 2770  information 2771  Most issues regarding the use of smart cards are logistical and focus on issuing cards, 2772  particularly to replace lost or stolen cards. 2773  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Although smart cards offer useful functionality, in an OT context their implementation must  consider the overall security context of the OT environment. The necessary identification of  individuals, issuance of cards, revocation if compromise is suspected, and the assignment of  authorizations to authenticated identities represents a significant initial and ongoing  challenge. In some cases, corporate IT or other resources may be available to assist in the  deployment of smart cards and the required public key infrastructures. Organizations should  also consider the impact on OT operational capability if dependency on IT systems and  services are required to support the smart card technology.  Additionally, if smart cards are implemented in an OT setting, organizations should consider  provisions for management of lost or damaged cards, the costs to incorporate and sustain a  respective access control system, and a management process for card distribution and  retrieval. These procedures should take into consideration the ability to grant temporary  access to OT personnel to prevent operational or safety disruptions.  A common approach in the Federal Government is based on the standardization on Federal  PIV smart cards allowing organizations to use the same credential mechanism in multiple  applications with one to three factors for authentication (Card-Only, Card+PIN,  Card+PIN+Biometric) depending on the risk-level of the resource being protected. If the  Federal PIV is used as an identification token, the access control system should conform to  the requirements of FIPS 201 [FIPS201] and NIST SP 800-73 [SP800-73] and employ either  cryptographic verification or biometric verification.  2774  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  102  6.2.1.4.4 Multi-Factor Authentication  2775  Organizations should consider that there are several possible factors for determining the 2776  authenticity of a person, device, or system, including something you know, something you have 2777  or something you are. When two or more factors are used, the process is known generically as 2778  multi-factor authentication (MFA). In general, the more factors that are used in the 2779  authentication process, the more robust the process. For example, authentication could be based 2780  on something known (e.g., PIN number or password), something possessed (e.g., key, dongle, 2781  smart card), or something you are such as a biological characteristic (e.g., fingerprint, retinal 2782  signature). 2783  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Organizations need to consider whether MFA is required for protecting OT environments in  whole or in part. MFA is an accepted best practice for remote access to OT applications. When  determining the placement and usage of MFA within an OT environment, organizations may  need to consider different authentication scenarios since some OT components support only a  single factor or no authentication. Organizations may consider adjusting credential  requirements based on the type of access or other mitigating factors for the environment. For  example, remote access to the OT environment may require MFA, while local access may only  require user ID and password due to other mitigating factors, such as physical access controls  before gaining physical access to the area where the user ID and password may be used.  2784  6.2.1.4.5 Password Authentication  2785  While password authentication schemes are arguably the most common and simplest form of 2786  authentication, numerous vulnerabilities are associated with the use and reliance on password-2787  only authentication. For example, systems are often delivered with default passwords that can be 2788  easily guessed, discovered, or researched. Another weakness is the ease of third-party 2789  eavesdropping. Passwords typed at a keyboard can be visually observed by others or recorded 2790  using keystroke loggers.  2791  Some network services and protocols transmit passwords as plaintext (unencrypted), allowing 2792  any network capture tool to expose the passwords. Additionally, passwords may be shared and 2793  not changed frequently. The use of shared credentials, including shared passwords, limits the 2794  ability to positively identify the individual person, process, or device that accessed a protected 2795  resource. Defense-in-depth is often utilized to prevent password authentication from being the 2796  only control in place to prevent unauthorized modification. 2797  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Many OT systems do not offer password recovery mechanisms, so the secure and reliable  handling of passwords is critical to maintaining continuous operation. Organizations are  encouraged to change the default password on OT equipment to make it more difficult for an  adversary to guess the password. Once changed, the password needs to be made available to  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  103  those that need to know. Organizations may want to consider using a password management  tool that is secure and accessible by those that need to know.  Some OT OSs make setting secure passwords difficult, as the password size is smaller than  current password standards and the system allows only group passwords at each level of  access, not individual passwords. Some industrial (and Internet) protocols transmit passwords  in plaintext, making them susceptible to interception. In cases where this practice cannot be  avoided, it is important that users have different (and unrelated) passwords for use with  encrypted and non-encrypted protocols.  Additionally, special considerations may be required when applying policies based on login  password authentication within the OT environment. Without an exclusion list based on  machine identification (ID), non-operator logon can result in policies such as auto-logoff  timeout and administrator password replacement being pushed down, and that can be  detrimental to the operation of the OT system.  The following are general recommendations and considerations with regards to the use of  passwords.   Change all default passwords in OT components.   Passwords should have appropriate length, strength, and complexity balanced between  security and operational ease of access within the capabilities of the software and  underlying OS.   Passwords should not be able to be found in a dictionary or contain predictable sequences  of numbers or letters.   Passwords should be used with care on specialized OT devices such as control consoles on  critical processes. Using passwords on these consoles could introduce potential safety  issues if operators are locked out or delayed access during critical events. Organizations  should consider physical or network isolation for devices where password protection is not  recommended.   Copies of shared or master passwords must be stored in a secure location with limited  access that can also be accessed in an emergency. Organizations may also need to consider  procedures to periodically change passwords when a password is compromised or an  individual with access leaves the organization.   Privileged (administrative) account passwords require additional protection such as  stronger password requirements, more frequent changing, and additional physical  safeguards.   Passwords should not be sent across any network unless protected by some form of FIPS- approved encryption or salted cryptographic hash specifically designed to prevent replay  attacks.  2798  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  104  6.2.2 Awareness and Training (PR.AT) 2799  The Awareness and Training category provides policy and procedures for ensuring that all users 2800  are provided basic cybersecurity awareness and training. 2801  Supplemental guidance can be found in the following documents: 2802   NIST SP 800-50, Building an Information Technology Security Awareness and Training 2803  Program 2804   NIST SP 800-100, Information Security Handbook: A Guide for Managers 2805   NIST SP 800-181 Rev. 1, Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity (NICE Framework) 2806  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance 2807  Personnel should receive OT-specific security awareness and training for the environment and 2808  specific applications. In addition, organizations identify, document, and train all personnel 2809  having significant OT roles and responsibilities. Awareness and training should cover the 2810  physical process being controlled as well as the OT system. 2811  Security awareness is a critical part of OT incident prevention, particularly when it comes to 2812  social engineering threats. Social engineering is a technique used to manipulate individuals into 2813  giving away private information, such as passwords. This information can then be used to 2814  compromise otherwise secure systems. 2815  OT security-specific awareness and training programs could include: a basic understanding of 2816  social engineering techniques and identifying anomalous behavior in the OT environment, 2817  guidance on when and how to connect and disconnect the OT environment from external security 2818  domains, password complexity and management requirements, and reporting practices. All 2819  personnel with OT responsibility should be provided training, but the training may be tailored 2820  based on roles and responsibilities. Roles to consider in the training program could include 2821  senior executives, privileged account users, third-party providers, physical security personnel, 2822  control engineers, operators, and maintainers. 2823  6.2.3 Data Security (PR.DS) 2824  Providing data security includes protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data-2825  at-rest and data-in-transit, protecting assets after removal, and preventing data leaks. 2826  Use of cryptography can support data security requirements. Encryption, digital signatures, 2827  hashing, and other cryptographic functions are available to prevent unauthorized access or 2828  modification of data at rest and in transit [RFC4949]. When cryptography is selected, 2829  organizations should use a certified cryptographic system. Federal organizations are required to 2830  comply with FIPS 140-3 [FIPS140] and the Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP). 2831  Additionally, cryptographic hardware should be protected from physical tampering and 2832  uncontrolled electronic connections. 2833  Supplemental guidance for data security can be found in the following documents: 2834  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-50 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-50 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-100 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-181r1 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  105   NIST SP 800-47 Rev. 1, Managing the Security of Information Exchanges 2835   NIST SP 800-111, Guide to Storage Encryption Technologies for End User Devices 2836   NIST SP 800-209, Security Guidelines for Storage Infrastructure 2837  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Identify critical file types and data to protect (both physical and electronic) while at rest. This  may include personally identifiable information and sensitive, proprietary, or trade secret  information (e.g., PLC program code, robot programs, computer aided drafting/computer  aided manufacturing files, operating manuals and documentation, electrical diagrams,  network diagrams, historical production data [NISTIR 8183]). Organizations should consider  centralizing critical data within secure storage locations.  When OT data is stored in the cloud or vendor servers, organizations should consider  performing a risk analysis to determine how the data is protected by the service provider and  if additional countermeasures should be implemented to manage risk to an acceptable level.  Information flows from the OT security domain to other security domains, and connections  between security domains are monitored. Technologies such as data diodes, firewalls, and  ACLs can be used to restrict the information flow. Examples of critical interfaces and  interconnections may include interfaces between IT and OT, OT and external industry  partners, or OT and third-party support vendors.  To protect data on system components at end-of-life, an asset disposal program should be  implemented, including consideration for wiping, sanitizing, or otherwise destroying critical  data and media prior to disposal. The asset disposal program should include any removeable  media and mobile devices as well as traditional OT hardware.  Cryptography  Critical OT data should be protected while in transit, especially over third-party network  segments and other untrusted or vulnerable network paths (e.g., cellular, wireless, Internet,  WAN). First identify which data is critical, then implement cryptographic mechanisms (e.g.,  encryption) to prevent unauthorized access or modification of system data and audit records.  Encryption provides a mechanism for ensuring confidentiality and integrity for data in transit.  OT applications often focus on availability of data. Before deploying encryption in OT,  ensure that confidentiality or integrity is the goal of applying the security control. The use of  encryption within an OT environment could introduce communications latency due to the  additional time and computing resources required to encrypt, decrypt, and authenticate each  message. Degradation of performance of the end device or system caused by encryption, or  any other security technique, should be considered. Before deploying encryption within an  OT environment, solutions should be tested to determine if latency is acceptable for the  application. Encryption at OSI Layer 2 rather than Layer 3 may be implemented to help  reduce encryption latency.  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-47r1 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-111 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-209  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  106  Additionally, while encryption provides confidentiality between encryption/decryption  devices, anomaly detection tools supporting OT environments may not be able to read  encrypted data. Encryption should therefore be carefully planned and implemented to manage  operational risks.  Organizations should also consider that cryptography may introduce key management issues.  Sound security policies require key management processes, which can become more difficult  as the geographic size of the OT increases. Because site visits to change or manage keys can  be costly and slow, organizations should consider if cryptographic protection with remote key  management may be beneficial, such as when the units being protected are so numerous or  geographically dispersed that managing keys is difficult or expensive.  For OT, encryption can be deployed as part of a comprehensive, enforced security policy. A  cryptographic key should be long enough so that guessing it or determining it through  analysis takes more effort, time, and cost than the value of the protected asset.  2838  6.2.4 Information Protection Processes and Procedures (PR.IP) 2839  Policies, processes, and procedures should be maintained and used to manage protection of 2840  information systems and assets. Countermeasures and outcomes should be in place to manage 2841  configuration changes throughout the life cycle of the component and system. Backups should be 2842  maintained, and response and recovery plans should be prepared and tested. A plan should be 2843  developed and implemented for vulnerability management throughout the life cycle of the 2844  components.  2845  6.2.4.1 Least Functionality (PR.IP-1) 2846  The principle of least functionality entails configuring systems to only provide essential 2847  functions and services. Some of the functions and services routinely provided by default may not 2848  be necessary to support essential organizational missions, functions, or operations. These 2849  functions include network ports and protocols, software, and services. 2850  Supplemental guidance can be found in the following document: 2851   NIST SP 800-167, Guide to Application Whitelisting 2852  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Systems and devices in the OT environment include many functions and services that may  not be necessary for their proper operation, some of which may be enabled by default and  without knowledge of the organization. Any functions or services that are not required for  proper operation should be disabled to reduce exposure.  Care should be taken when disabling these functions and services, as unintended impacts may  result if a critical function or service is unknowingly disabled (e.g., disabling all external  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-167  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  107  communications to a PLC may also disable the ability to communicate with associated  HMIs). Devices should be subjected to extensive testing before being deployed to the OT  network.  2853  6.2.4.2 Configuration Change Control (Configuration Management) (PR.IP-3) 2854  Configuration management helps ensure that systems are deployed and maintained in a secure 2855  and consistent state, allowing organizations to reduce risks from outages due to configuration 2856  issues and security breaches through improved visibility and tracking of changes to the system. 2857  In addition, configuration management can detect improper configurations before they 2858  negatively impact performance, safety, or security. Configuration management tools enable an 2859  asset owner to establish and maintain the integrity of system hardware and software components 2860  by controlling processes for initializing, changing, monitoring, and auditing the configurations of 2861  the components throughout the system life cycle. 2862  Supplemental guidance for configuration management can be found in the following documents: 2863   NIST SP 800-128, Guide for Security-Focused Configuration Management of Information 2864  Systems 2865   NIST SP 1800-5, IT Asset Management 2866  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Organizations should document the approved baseline configuration for their OT devices.  Additionally, organizations should establish the system development life cycle (SDLC)  approach to document, test, and approve changes before deploying to the OT environment.  Some organizations may maintain logbooks or other similar methods to document changes to  OT components. Organizations should consider centralizing the tracking and documentation of  changes to the OT environment to improve visibility and ensure proper testing and approvals  for system changes. Such a process may allow organizations to prevent accidental  reconfiguration or identify intentional reconfiguration of components to unapproved or  untested versions.  In some cases, the use of automated configuration management tools might be appropriate.  Processes should be in place to validate configurations prior to deployment. Many changes to  OT can be made only during scheduled maintenance downtimes to minimize impacts. When  considering automated configuration management tools, organizations should consider  potential impact to the OT system. In some cases, these tools transfer numerous types of data  over the manufacturing system network, and potentially large amounts of data. Additionally,  some tools may also have the potential to impact OT system operations by attempting to  change device configurations or manipulating active files.  2867  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-128 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-128 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-5  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  108  6.2.4.3 Backups (PR.IP-4) 2868  Conducting, maintaining, and testing backups is a critical outcome for the recovery process if a 2869  cyber or reliability incident occurs.  2870  Supplemental guidance for determining priority and strategy for backups can be found in the 2871  following documents: 2872   NIST SP 800-34 Rev. 1, Contingency Planning Guide for Federal Information Systems 2873   NIST SP 800-209, Security Guidelines for Storage Infrastructure 2874  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  A list should be developed of all backups maintained, including installation media, license  keys, and configuration information. Additional measures should be taken to ensure that  backups are readily available when needed:   Verify the backups for reliability and integrity (if technically possible).   Establish an onsite location for backups that is accessible to all personnel who may need  access during a recovery event.   Establish an alternative secondary storage location for additional copies of backups to  ensure that the same incident that disrupts primary data cannot modify or destroy the  backup (e.g., store PLC logic and configuration files at an offsite, geographically diverse  location that cannot be destroyed by the same [hurricane, wildfire, tornado] that may  destroy the PLC).   Include testing of restoration process from backup data as part of contingency plan  testing.   Ensure backup procedures are included in configuration or change management  processes.   Secure backups according to access control requirements.   Monitor environmental conditions where backup media is stored.  2875  6.2.4.4 Physical Operating Environment (PR.IP-5) 2876  Managing the physical operating environment includes emergency protection controls such as 2877  emergency shutdown of the system, backup for power and lighting, controls for temperature and 2878  humidity, and protection against fire and water damage. Organizations should develop policies 2879  and procedures to ensure that environmental operating requirements for assets are achieved.  2880  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-34r1 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-209  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  109  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Organizations should consider the following factors when identifying potential  countermeasures to implement to protect the physical operating environment:   Environmental Factors. Environmental factors can be important. For example, if a site  is dusty, systems should be placed in a filtered environment. This is particularly important  if the dust is likely to be conductive or magnetic, as in the case of sites that process coal  or iron. If vibration is likely to be a problem, systems should be mounted on rubber  bushings to prevent disk crashes and wiring connection problems. In addition, the  environments containing systems and media (e.g., backup tapes, floppy disks) should  have stable temperature and humidity. An alarm to the OT system should be generated  when environmental specifications such as temperature or humidity are exceeded.   Environmental Control Systems. HVAC systems for control rooms must support OT  personnel during normal operation and emergency situations, which could include the  release of toxic substances. Risk assessments should consider the risk of operating an  HVAC system (e.g., air intakes) in an occupied shelter during a toxic release, as well as  continued operation during a power outage (e.g., using an uninterruptible power supply in  critical environments).  Fire systems must be carefully designed to avoid causing more harm than good (e.g., to  avoid mixing water with incompatible products). HVAC and fire systems have  significantly increased roles in security that arise from the interdependence of process  control and security. For example, fire prevention and HVAC systems that support  industrial control computers need to be protected against cyber incidents.   Power. Reliable power for OT is essential, so a UPS should be provided for critical  systems. If the site has an emergency generator, the UPS battery life may only need to be  a few seconds; however, if the site relies on external power, the UPS battery life may  need to be hours. It should be sized, at a minimum, so that the system can be shut down  safely.  2881  6.2.4.5 Response and Recovery Plans (PR.IP-9) and Response and Recovery Plan 2882  Testing (PR.IP-10) 2883  Organizations should develop and maintain response plans, including incident response and 2884  business continuity. Response plans should be measured against the service being provided, not 2885  just the system that was compromised. Organizations should consider a systematic approach to 2886  response planning, such as the process described in CISA’s Cybersecurity Incident and 2887  Vulnerability Response Playbooks [CISA-CIVR]. Common planning steps include preparation, 2888  detection and analysis, containment, recovery, post-incident activity, communication, and 2889  coordination. Organizations should also establish a regular review and update for their response 2890  plans. 2891  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  110  The response plans should be documented in paper form or on an offline system (i.e., air gapped) 2892  that cannot be compromised during a cyber-attack. Individuals should be trained on where to 2893  find the response plan, along with the actions to take as part of an incident response. 2894  Additionally, during the preparation of the incident response plan, input should be obtained from 2895  the various stakeholders including operations, engineering, IT, system support vendors, 2896  management, organized labor, legal, and safety. These stakeholders should also review and 2897  approve the plan.  2898  Business continuity planning addresses the overall issue of maintaining or reestablishing 2899  production in the case of an interruption. An outage may involve typical time spans of days, 2900  weeks, or months to recover from a natural disaster, or minutes or hours to recover from a 2901  malware infection or a mechanical/electrical failure. Business continuity plans (BCP) are often 2902  written to cover many types of incidents involving several different disciplines. The BCP for 2903  cybersecurity incidents should broadly cover long-term outages, including disaster recovery, and 2904  short-term outages requiring operational recovery. It is important to work with physical security 2905  on developing the BCP related to cybersecurity incidents. This collaboration with physical 2906  security should include the identification of critical equipment and the associated 2907  countermeasures in place to prevent an incident. 2908  Before creating a BCP to deal with potential outages, it is important to specify the recovery 2909  objectives for the various systems and subsystems involved based on typical business needs. 2910  There are two distinct types of objectives: system recovery and data recovery. System recovery 2911  involves the recovery of communication links and processing capabilities, and it is usually 2912  specified in terms of a Recovery Time Objective (RTO). Management should define the 2913  acceptable RTO, and technical personnel should work to achieve that target. Data recovery 2914  involves the recovery of data describing production or product conditions in the past and is 2915  usually specified in terms of a Recovery Point Objective (RPO). This is defined as the time for 2916  which an absence of data can be tolerated. The RTO and RPO may justify investment in spare 2917  inventory if recovery objectives cannot be met by other means. 2918  Once the recovery objectives are defined, a list of potential interruptions should be created and 2919  the recovery procedure developed and described. A contingency plan is then created for the 2920  variety of potential interruptions. The contingency plan should be reviewed with managers to 2921  ensure that the cost to meet the contingency plan is approved. For many smaller-scale 2922  interruptions, a critical spares inventory will prove adequate to meet the recovery objectives. For 2923  larger-scale recovery, vendor relationships will likely be leveraged. For all types of recovery, 2924  backups are critical.  2925  A disaster recovery plan (DRP) is a documented process or set of procedures comprising a 2926  comprehensive statement of recovery actions to be taken before, during, and after a disaster. The 2927  DRP is ordinarily documented in both electronic and paper form to ensure it is readily available 2928  during any type of disaster. The disaster could be natural, environmental, or caused by humans, 2929  either intentionally or unintentionally. Organizations should develop, maintain, and validate 2930  disaster recovery plans for their environments to help minimize an event impact by reducing the 2931  time required to restore capabilities. 2932  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  111  Organizations may already have some emergency response plans and should consider leveraging 2933  existing plans when developing a response plan for cybersecurity events. 2934  Supplemental guidance for the response planning can be found in the following documents: 2935   NIST SP 800-34 Rev. 1, Contingency Planning Guide for Federal Information Systems 2936   NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide 2937   NIST SP 800-83 Rev. 1, Guide to Malware Incident Prevention and Handling for Desktops 2938  and Laptops 2939   NIST SP 800-100, Information Security Handbook: A Guide for Managers 2940   CISA Security Tip (ST13-003), Handling Destructive Malware 2941   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) National Incident Management System 2942  (NIMS) 2943   FEMA National Preparedness Goal 2944  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Incident response planning may include the following items:   Identification and Classification of Incidents. The various types of OT incidents should  be identified and classified based on potential impact so that a proper response can be  formulated for each potential incident.   Response Actions. There are several responses that can be taken in the event of an  incident. These range from doing nothing to performing a full system shutdown, which  could result in a shutdown of the physical process. The response taken will depend on the  type of incident and its effect on the OT system and the physical process being controlled.  A written plan documenting the response to each type of incident should be prepared.  This will provide guidance during times when there might be confusion or stress due to  the incident. This plan should include step-by-step actions to be taken by the various  organizations. If there are reporting requirements, these should be documented along with  contact information and reporting format to reduce confusion.  Response actions should include steps for Detection and Analysis; Containment,  Eradication, and Recovery; and Post-Incident Activity. Some considerations for OT may  include:  o Determining a priority: either returning to normal operations as quickly as possible,  or performing an investigation and preserving forensic data  o Communicating to the incident response team  o Disconnecting infected systems from the network  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-34r1 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-61r2 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-83r1 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-83r1 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-100 https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST13-003 https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/nims https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/nims https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/national-preparedness/goal  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  112  o Physically isolating operationally independent networks (e.g., enterprise from control  or control from safety)  o Transitioning to manual operations  o Resourcing for additional operations support to manually validate data  o Notifying management, public relations, and/or outside companies and agencies as  required  If an incident is discovered, organizations should conduct a focused risk assessment on the  OT environment to evaluate the effect of both the attack and the options to respond. For  example, one possible response option is to physically isolate the system under attack.  However, this may have a negative impact on the OT and may not be possible without  impacting operational performance or safety. A focused risk assessment should be used to  determine the response action.  The plan should also indicate requirements for the timely replacement of components in the  case of an emergency. If possible, replacements for hard-to-obtain critical components should  be kept in inventory.  The organization should have a means for prioritizing recovery activities. This prioritization  may leverage existing documentation such as risk assessments or startup procedures. As an  example, the focus may be to recover the systems supporting critical utilities prior to the  systems supporting manufacturing based on the order of start-up activities.  Testing recovery plan procedures for OT components could be difficult due to operational  and safety requirements. Organizations may need to determine if “bench tests” or other  offline testing is possible to confirm the recovery procedures for OT components.  Organizations at a minimum should verify the integrity of the backups if a full recovery test  cannot be performed.  2945  6.2.5 Maintenance (PR.MA) 2946  The outcomes that fall within the CSF Maintenance Category provide guidance for performing 2947  routine and preventative maintenance on the components of an information system. This includes 2948  the usage of maintenance tools (both local and remote) and management of maintenance 2949  personnel.  2950  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Maintenance tracking solutions enable an organization to schedule, track, authorize, monitor,  and audit maintenance and repair activities to OT, ensuring maintenance logs or changes  performed are properly documented. Documenting these events provides an audit trail that  can aid in cybersecurity-related troubleshooting, response, and recovery activities.  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  113  Maintenance tracking can also provide visibility into scheduled maintenance for OT devices  and help inform end-of-life decisions.  Software used for OT maintenance activities should be approved and controlled by the  organization. Approved software should be obtained directly from vendors and its  authenticity verified (e.g., by validating certificates or comparing hashes of installers).  Any maintenance performed on an OT device can inadvertently modify its configuration,  resulting in an increased attack surface. The hardened state of the OT device should be  maintained regardless of the maintenance performed. Device configuration should be verified  after maintenance and software patching, as some features may have inadvertently been  reenabled or new features installed. Best practices and other supporting documents should be  obtained from the device vendor to guide and inform maintenance activities.  Limiting the use of certain devices only for maintenance activities can help reduce the  chances of device compromise by exposure to external networks, unauthorized users, or theft.  Maintenance devices that remain secure within the OT environment reduce their exposure.  Using maintenance devices outside the OT environment or connecting the devices to non-OT  networks should be restricted or minimized.  Any device connected to the OT system should be disconnected after the maintenance  activities are completed, and any temporary connections should be removed.  The operation, capabilities, and features of devices used for maintenance activities should be  well understood. Devices may contain wireless radios and other communications devices that  may be vulnerable to side-channel attacks or may allow simultaneous connections between  networks (i.e., dual-homed). Vendor documentation should be thoroughly reviewed to  understand these capabilities.  2951  6.2.6 Protective Technology (PR.PT) 2952  Technical mechanisms assist organizations with protecting the devices and information within 2953  their environments. These technologies alone may not be sufficient to sustain the security 2954  capabilities as threats evolve and change; as such, organizations should manage the technical 2955  solutions securing the organizational assets in a manner consistent with policies, procedures, and 2956  agreements. 2957  6.2.6.1 Logging (PR.PT-1) 2958  Logging enables an organization to capture events occurring within its systems and networks. 2959  Events can be generated by many different systems including OSs, workstations, servers, 2960  networking devices, cybersecurity software, and applications.  2961  Supplemental guidance can be found in the following document: 2962   NIST SP 800-92, Guide to Computer Security Log Management 2963  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-92  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  114  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Capturing log events is critical to maintaining situational awareness of the OT system. The  typical types of events include maintenance functions (e.g., access control, configuration  changes, backup and restore), OS functions, and application (i.e., process) events. The  specific types of events available for logging will vary between OT devices and should be  chosen based on the capabilities of the device and the desired events to be captured.  To support log correlation, each log entry should include identification of the device that  generated the event, the timestamp of the event, and identification of the user or system  account that generated the event. In general, each log entry should include where the event  occurred, the type of event, when the event occurred, the source of the event, the identity of  any users or system accounts related to the event, and the outcome of the event.  Correlating events across multiple OT devices can be difficult if the event timestamps  generated by the devices were not informed by a shared time source. The internal clocks of  each device should be synchronized with a primary clock to support event correlation  between devices. Log entries should also produce a consistent timestamp format (e.g., time  zone format, string format, daylight saving).  The collection and event forwarding functions may impact the performance of the OT device.  Log size may grow quickly depending on the frequency of events being logged, resulting in  increasing space utilization. Disk space and memory is limited on most OT devices, so  adequate storage should be provided either locally or remotely to reduce the likelihood of  exceeding the device capacity, which could ultimately result in the loss of logging capability.  Transferring logs from the OT devices to alternate storage should be considered.  2964  6.2.7 Media Protection (PR.PT-2) 2965  Removable media is protected, and use is restricted in accordance with policy. This includes 2966  labeling media for distribution and handling requirements, as well as storage, transport, 2967  sanitization, destruction, and disposal of the media. 2968  Supplemental guidance can be found in the following documents: 2969   NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1, Guidelines for Media Sanitation 2970   NIST SP 800-100, Information Security Handbook: A Guide for Managers 2971   NIST SP 800-209, Security Guidelines for Storage Infrastructure 2972  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Processes and procedures for the handling of media assets should be developed and followed.  Media assets include removable media and devices such as floppy disks, CDs, DVDs, SD  cards, and USB memory sticks, as well as printed reports and documents. Physical security  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-88r1 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-100 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-209  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  115  controls should address specific requirements for the safe and secure maintenance of these  assets and provide specific guidance for transporting, handling, and erasing or destroying  these assets. Security requirements could include safe storage from loss, fire, theft,  unintentional distribution, or environmental damage.  OT devices should be protected against the misuse of media. The use of any unauthorized  removable media or device on any node that is part of or connected to the OT should not be  permitted. Solutions could be either procedural or technical to prevent the introduction of  malware or the inadvertent loss or theft of data.  Physically protecting media or encrypting the data on media is critical to protecting the OT  environment. For example, if an adversary gains access to media containing OT data, it could  provide valuable information for launching an attack.  2973  6.2.8 Personnel Security 2974  Cybersecurity should be included in human resources practices to reduce the risk of human error, 2975  theft, fraud, or other intentional or unintentional misuse of information systems.  2976  Supplemental guidance for the Personnel Security controls can be found in the following 2977  documents: 2978   NIST SP 800-35, Guide to Information Technology Security Services 2979   NIST SP 800-73-4, Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification 2980   NIST SP 800-76-2, Biometric Specifications for Personal Identity Verification 2981   NIST SP 800-100, Information Security Handbook: A Guide for Managers 2982  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  A general organization personnel security program should be developed to include policy,  position risk designations, personnel screening, terminations and transfers, access  agreements, and third-party roles and responsibilities. OT personnel should be in  communication with Human Resources, IT, and Physical Security as necessary to ensure  personnel security requirements are being met.  An organization should consider establishing an access agreement and request form for  managing access (physical and/or logical) to OT equipment. Organizations should also screen  personnel assigned to critical positions controlling and maintaining the OT.  Additionally, training programs should be developed to ensure that each employee has  received training relevant and necessary to their job functions. Employees should  demonstrate competence in their job functions to retain physical and logical access to OT.  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-35 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-73-4 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-76-2 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-100  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  116  Organizations should consider adopting a framework, such as the National Initiative for  Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Framework, for training their OT personnel.  2983  6.2.9 Wireless Communications 2984  Wireless communications utilize radio frequency (RF) to support data transmission. This can 2985  include Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) local area network communication based on IEEE 802.11 2986  protocols and may also include cellular or other radio-based communications. RF-based 2987  communications provide enhanced flexibility over traditional physical (wired) communication 2988  capabilities. However, RF communications are also more susceptible to interference and may 2989  also allow eavesdropping by unauthorized personnel.  2990  Supplemental guidance for wireless communications can be found in the following documents: 2991   NIST SP 800-97, Establishing Wireless Robust Security Networks: A Guide to IEEE 802.11i 2992   NIST SP 800-121 Rev. 2, Guide to Bluetooth Security 2993   NIST SP 800-153, Guidelines for Securing Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) 2994   NIST SP 800-187, Guide to LTE Security 2995  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  The use of temporary or permanent wireless communication within an OT is a risk-based  decision determined by the organization. Generally, devices utilizing wireless communication  should be placed in a separate network segment and only be deployed where the residual  risks to health, safety, environmental, and financial implications are low.  Prior to installation, a wireless survey should be performed to determine antenna locations  and signal strength to ensure adequate coverage and to minimize exposure of the wireless  network to interference from OT environmental factors and eavesdropping. Organizations  should consider that attackers typically use directional antennas to extend the effective range  of a wireless network beyond the standard range.  Organizations may choose to implement a wireless mesh network to improve resiliency or to  eliminate areas with poor signal strength. Mesh networks can provide fault tolerance through  alternate route selection and preemptive fail-over of the network. Organizations should also  consider the performance and security impacts associated with the use of mesh networks. For  example, when roaming between access points, devices may experience temporary  communication loss. Roaming may also require different security controls to reduce the  transition time. Organizations will need to find the appropriate balance between functional  capabilities and cybersecurity to achieve the risk tolerance.  https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-97 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-121r2-upd1 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-153 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-187  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  117  Wireless LANs   Wireless device communications should be encrypted. The encryption must not degrade  the operational performance of the end devices. Encryption at OSI Layer 2 should be  considered, rather than at Layer 3, to reduce encryption latency. The use of hardware  accelerators to perform cryptographic functions should also be considered.   Wireless access points should establish independent network segments (not extend an  existing segment) and be used in combination with a boundary protection device to  restrict and control communication.   Wireless access points should be configured to have a unique service set identifier (SSID)  and enable Media Access Control (MAC) address filtering at a minimum.   Wireless devices may require different security controls and should be zoned accordingly.   An adaptive routing protocol should be considered if the devices are to be used for  wireless mobility. The convergence time of the network should be as fast as possible  supporting rapid network recovery in the event of a failure or power loss.  Wireless Field Networks  When implementing a wireless field network, the following security features should be  considered:   Selecting a standard, non-proprietary protocol (e.g., IEEE 802.15.x)   Ensuring encryption is used between field instruments and wireless access points   Allowlisting devices into the wireless device manager so rogue devices cannot connect   Implementing appropriately complex passwords and join keys  Most wireless field networks are inherently less reliable than their wired counterparts due to  their susceptibility to signal jamming, distance limitations, and line-of-sight requirements.  Work with the system vendor to design a wireless network appropriate for the application.  2996  6.2.10 Remote Access 2997  When accessing systems or data remotely, security controls should be implemented to prevent 2998  unauthorized access to the organization’s networks, systems, and data. A virtual private network 2999  (VPN) is a set of technologies and protocols designed to support secure remote access to network 3000  environments. A VPN can provide both strong authentication and encryption to secure 3001  communication data by establishing a private network that operates as an overlay on a public 3002  infrastructure. The most common types of VPN technologies implemented today are: 3003   Internet Protocol Security (IPsec). IPsec supports two encryption modes: transport and 3004  tunnel. Transport mode encrypts only the data portion (payload) of each packet while leaving 3005  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  118  the packet header untouched. The more secure tunnel mode adds a new header to each packet 3006  and encrypts both the original header and the payload. On the receiving side, an IPsec-3007  compliant device decrypts each packet. 3008   Transport Layer Security (TLS). Sometimes referred to by the legacy terminology of 3009  Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), TLS provides a secure channel between two machines that 3010  encrypts the contents of each packet. TLS is most often recognized for securing HTTP 3011  traffic; this protocol implementation is known as HTTP Secure (HTTPS). However, TLS is 3012  not limited to HTTP traffic; it can be used to secure many application-layer programs. 3013   Secure Shell (SSH). SSH is a command interface and protocol for securely gaining access to 3014  a remote computer. It is widely used by network administrators to remotely control Linux-3015  based servers. SSH is a secure alternative to a telnet application. SSH is included in most 3016  UNIX distributions and is typically added to other platforms through a third-party package. 3017  Supplemental guidance for access controls can be found in the following documents: 3018   NIST SP 800-52 Rev. 2, Guidelines for the Selection, Configuration, and Use of Transport 3019  Layer Security (TLS) Implementations 3020   NIST SP 800-63B, Digital Identity Guidelines: Authentication and Lifecycle Management 3021   NIST SP 800-77 Rev. 1, Guide to IPsec VPNs 3022   NIST SP 800-113, Guide to SSL VPNs 3023  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendations  Many OT security architectures are designed with multiple levels, such as in the Purdue  Architecture. This can significantly limit access which can minimize accidental or  unauthorized disruptions to operations. A process should be developed and communicated to  the organization for requesting and enabling remote access. Remote access should be provided  only if justified and limited to only what is required to meet the business need. Remote access  should not circumvent or negate safety or security controls.  In critical situations or when vendor support is needed, temporary remote access may be  requested to perform maintenance. In such cases, procedures should still be followed to ensure  secure connections are being utilized.  There are several different techniques for implementing temporary remote access, including  the following:   Users/protocols (e.g., RDP, SSH) temporarily permitted through the OT/enterprise firewall   Screen-sharing technologies   Modems   VPNs  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-52r2 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-52r2 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63b https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-77r1 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-113  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  119  Regardless of the technology, organizations should consider the following:   Implementing unique usernames and complex passwords   Removing, disabling, or modifying any default credentials   Updating any software/firmware to the latest versions   Removing access when no longer required. Consider implementing automatic timers for  removing access, or the management of change processes to manually confirm removal of  access.   Monitoring remote activities   Ensuring operations personnel are aware of planned remote activity in the OT environment   Initiating the connection from the OT environment   Labeling remote connection devices so that operations may disconnect quickly in the case  of unauthorized use  Dial-Up Modems  If dial-up modems are used in OT environments, consider using callback systems. This  ensures that a dialer is an authorized user by having the modem establish the working  connection based on the dialer’s information and a callback number stored in the OT approved  authorized user list.  If feasible, disconnect modems when not in use, or consider automating this disconnection  process by having modems disconnect after being on for a given amount of time. It should be  noted that sometimes modem connections are part of the legal support service agreement with  the vendor (e.g., 24x7 support with 15-minute response time). Personnel should be aware that  disconnecting/removing the modems may require that contracts be renegotiated.  VPNs  VPN devices used to protect OT systems should be thoroughly tested to verify that the VPN  technology is compatible with the application and that implementation of the VPN devices  does not negatively impact network traffic characteristics.  VPN technology can also be applied between network segments. For example, a remote site  might have a boundary protection device onsite that uses a VPN to establish a secure tunnel  over an untrusted network (e.g., the internet) to a VPN-enabled device in the main control  center at a different location.  6.2.11 Flaw Remediation and Patch Management 3024  Patches are additional pieces of code that have been developed to address specific problems or 3025  flaws in existing software. Vulnerabilities are flaws that can be exploited, enabling unauthorized 3026  access to systems or enabling users to have access to greater privileges than authorized. 3027  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  120  A systematic approach to managing and using software patches can help organizations to 3028  improve the overall security of their systems in a cost-effective way. Organizations that actively 3029  manage and use software patches can reduce the chances that the vulnerabilities in their systems 3030  can be exploited; in addition, they can save time and money that might be spent in responding to 3031  vulnerability-related incidents.  3032  NIST SP 800-40 Revision 4 [SP800-40] provides guidance for CIOs, CISOs, and others who are 3033  responsible for managing organizational risk related to the use of software. This publication 3034  frames patching as a critical component of preventive maintenance for computing technologies – 3035  a cost of doing business, and a necessary part of what organizations need to do in order to 3036  achieve their missions. This publication also discusses common factors that affect enterprise 3037  patch management and recommends creating an enterprise strategy to simplify and 3038  operationalize patching while also improving reduction of risk. The guidance may also be useful 3039  to business and mission owners, security engineers and architects, system administrators, and 3040  security operations personnel. 3041  Supplemental guidance for flaw remediation and patch management can be found in the 3042  following document: 3043   NIST SP 800-40 Rev. 4, Guide to Enterprise Patch Management Planning: Preventive 3044  Maintenance for Technology 3045  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Significant care should be exercised when applying patches to OS components. Patches  should be adequately tested (e.g., offline system testing) to determine the acceptability of any  performance impacts. Regression testing is advised. It is not uncommon for patches to have  an adverse impact on other software. A patch may remove a vulnerability, but it can also  introduce a greater risk from a production or safety perspective. Patching the vulnerability  may also change the way the OS or application works with control applications, causing the  control application to lose some of its functionality. Many OT systems utilize older versions  of OSs that are no longer supported by the vendor; consequently, patches may not be  available.  Organizations should implement a systematic, accountable, and documented OT patch  management process for managing exposure to vulnerabilities. The patch management  process should include guidance on how to monitor for patches, when to apply patches, how  to test the patches (e.g., with vendors or on offline systems), and how to select compensating  controls to limit exposure of the vulnerable system when patching is delayed.  Many OT vulnerabilities are published to CISA as advisories; however, not all vendors report  known vulnerabilities to CISA. Organizations can often stay informed of vulnerabilities by  subscribing to vendor-specific notifications in addition to CISA alerts and advisories. Private  cybersecurity companies also offer services to assist organizations with staying informed of  known vulnerabilities within their OT environment. An organization is responsible for  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-40r4 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-40r4  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  121  staying informed of its OT vulnerabilities and determining when patches should be applied as  part of their documented patch management process.  When and how to deploy patches should be determined by knowledgeable OT personnel.  Consider separating the automated process for OT patch management from the automated  process for non-OT applications. Patching should be deployed during planned OT outages.  Organizations may be required to follow industry-specific guidance on patch management.  Otherwise, they may develop patch management procedures based on existing standards such  as NIST SP 800-40 Rev. 4 [SP800-40r4]; NERC CIP-007, Cyber Security - System Security  Management System Security Management; or ISA 62443-2-3, Patch Management in the  IACS Environment.  3046  6.2.12 Time Synchronization 3047  Time synchronization solutions enable an organization to synchronize time across many devices. 3048  This is important for many functions including event and log correlation, authentication 3049  mechanisms, access control, and quality of service. 3050  Supplemental guidance can be found in the following documents: 3051   NIST SP 800-92, Guide to Computer Security Log Management 3052   NISTIR 8323, Foundational PNT Profile: Applying the Cybersecurity Framework for the 3053  Responsible Use of Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) Services 3054  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Synchronizing the internal clocks of OT systems and devices is critical for cyber event  correlation and other OT functions (e.g., motion control). If a device or system clock is  inaccurate, timestamps generated by the clock for event and log entries will also be  inaccurate, as well as any other functions that utilize the clock.  A common time should be used across all OT devices. Utilizing multiple time sources can  benefit OT devices by reducing clock error and providing backup time sources if the primary  time source is lost or time quality of a primary time source has degraded.  Authenticated Network Time Protocol (NTP) and secure Precision Time Protocol (PTP) (i.e.,  PTP with an authentication TLV [type, length, value]) can be used where there is a risk of  malicious modification to the network time (e.g., RF jamming, packet spoofing, denial of  service). Non-authenticated NTP is susceptible to spoofing and should be located behind the  firewall.  Time sources located in the OT environment should be included in the system and network  monitoring programs. If available, logs from each time source (e.g., syslog) should be  forwarded to a log collection system.  https://www.nerc.com/pa/Stand/Pages/CIPStandards.aspx https://www.nerc.com/pa/Stand/Pages/CIPStandards.aspx https://www.isa.org/standards-and-publications/isa-standards/isa-standards-committees/isa99 https://www.isa.org/standards-and-publications/isa-standards/isa-standards-committees/isa99 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-92 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8323 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8323  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  122  3055  6.3 Detect (DE) 3056  The Detect function enables the timely discovery of cybersecurity events by ensuring appropriate 3057  activities are developed and implemented.  3058  6.3.1 Anomalies and Events (DE.AE) 3059  Organizations should understand the different events and anomalies and their potential impact to 3060  the systems, organization, and environment to establish an effective detection capability. Within 3061  any environment, numerous non-malicious and potentially malicious events and anomalies occur 3062  almost continuously. Some examples of common events include: 3063  Information Events 3064   Multiple failed logon attempts 3065   Locked-out accounts 3066   Unauthorized creation of new accounts 3067   Unexpected remote logons (e.g., logons of individuals that are on vacation, remote logon 3068  when the individual is expected to be local, remote logon for maintenance support when no 3069  support was requested) 3070   Cleared event logs 3071   Unexpectedly full event logs 3072   Antivirus or IDS alerts 3073   Disabled antivirus or other disabled security controls 3074   Requests for information about the system or architecture (social engineering or phishing 3075  attempts) 3076  Operational Events 3077   Unauthorized configuration changes 3078   Unauthorized patching of systems 3079   Unplanned shutdowns 3080  Physical Access Events 3081   Physical intrusions 3082  Networking Events 3083   Unexpected communication, including new ports or protocols being used without appropriate 3084  change management 3085  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  123   Unusually heavy network traffic 3086   Unauthorized devices connecting to the network 3087   Unauthorized communication to external IPs 3088  Organizations should consider that not all events and anomalies are malicious or require follow-3089  up investigation. Organizations should define incident alerting thresholds and response 3090  requirements for the events and anomalies affecting their systems and environment to establish 3091  an efficient incident detection capability.  3092  Organizations should consider collecting and correlating event data from multiple sources and 3093  sensors using automated mechanisms where possible to improve detecting and alerting 3094  capabilities. For example, a centralized intrusion detection system could accept data feeds and 3095  logs from multiple devices and network segments to identify and alarm on organization- or 3096  environment-specific events. Detection tools should also be integrated with asset management 3097  tools. This integration can provide additional context to an event (e.g., where the system is 3098  located, which firmware version it runs, what the criticality of the system is) to help an 3099  organization determine the event impact. 3100  Supplemental guidance can be found in the following documents: 3101   NIST SP 800-92, Guide to Computer Security Log Management 3102   NIST SP 800-94, Guide to Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems 3103   NIST SP 1800-7, Situational Awareness for Electric Utilities 3104  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Organizations should consider OT-specific events and anomalies for their processes and  environments. Also, organizations should note that some tools and alerts for behaviors or  events that could indicate an intrusion may be normal behaviors and events within the OT  environment. To reduce false positive and nuisance alarms, organizations should establish  their OT alerting thresholds based on baselines of normal network traffic and data flows in  addition to normal human and OT process behavior. Additionally, OT components are often  physically remote and not continually staffed. Alerting thresholds may also need to take into  consideration the response time associated with the alert. For example, a temperature alert  threshold may have to be set to alert earlier based on the expected response time to correct  the situation in order to avoid an incident.  Shared credentials are often used on OT systems. Anomalous behavior on shared accounts  may be more difficult to determine, so organizations should consider if additional controls,  such as identifying the use of shared credentials using physical access monitoring, are  required.  3105  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-92 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-94 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-7  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  124  6.3.2 Security Continuous Monitoring (DE.CM) 3106  Organizations should implement continuous monitoring as part of the organizational risk 3107  management strategy to monitor the effectiveness of protective measures. This includes 3108  establishing the frequency for evaluating the implementation of the desired outcomes.  3109  Continuous monitoring can be performed by internal or external resources to identify security 3110  gaps within the environment. Peer reviews (i.e., cold eyes reviews) between sites of the same 3111  organization are highly encouraged. When leveraging third-party services for security continuous 3112  monitoring, it is important to understand and evaluate how the organization’s continuous 3113  monitoring data is protected by the third party. A third party that aggregates continuous 3114  monitoring information from multiple organizations may be a desirable target for adversaries.  3115  Supplemental guidance can be found in the following documents: 3116   NIST SP 800-53A Rev. 5, Assessing Security and Privacy Controls in Information Systems 3117  and Organizations 3118   NIST SP 800-55 Rev. 1, Performance Measurement Guide for Information Security 3119   NIST SP 800-115, Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment 3120   NIST SP 800-137, Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) for Federal 3121  Information Systems and Organizations 3122   NIST SP 800-137A, Assessing Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) 3123  Programs: Developing an ISCM Program Assessment 3124  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Organizations may find that automation within OT environments may not be possible due to  the sensitivity of the systems or the resources required to support the automation. For  example, some automated systems may utilize active scanning for supporting vulnerability or  patch management or for validating device configurations. Solutions that perform active  scanning or use local resources to support automation should be subjected to testing before  deployment to the OT system.  Continuous monitoring can be achieved using automated tools, through passive scanning, or  with manual monitoring performed at a frequency deemed commensurate with the risk. As an  example, a risk assessment may determine that the logs from isolated (i.e., non-networked),  non-critical devices should be reviewed monthly by OT personnel to determine if anomalous  behavior is occurring. Alternatively, a passive network monitor might be able to detect  vulnerable network services without having to scan the devices.  When organizations implement a sampling methodology, the criticality of the components  should be considered. For example, the sampling methodology should not inadvertently  exclude higher risk devices such as layer 3/layer 4 firewalls.  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53Ar5 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53Ar5 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-55r1 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-115 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-137 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-137 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-137A https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-137A  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  125  When using third parties for continuous monitoring of security controls, ensure that the  personnel involved have the appropriate skillset to analyze OT environments.  3125  6.3.2.1 Network Monitoring (DE.CM-1) 3126  Network monitoring involves organizations reviewing alerts and logs and analyzing them for 3127  signs of possible cybersecurity incidents. Organizations should consider automation, including 3128  in-house developed, commercially available solutions, or some combination of tools, to assist 3129  with monitoring efforts. Tools and capabilities that support Behavior Anomaly Detection (BAD), 3130  Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), or Intrusion Detection/Prevention systems 3131  (IDS/IPS) can assist organizations with monitoring traffic throughout the network and generate 3132  alarms when they identify anomalous or suspicious traffic. Some other capabilities to consider 3133  for network monitoring include: 3134   Asset management, including discovering and inventorying devices connected to the network 3135   Baselining typical network traffic, data flows, and device-to-device communications 3136   Diagnosing network performance issues 3137   Identifying misconfigurations or malfunctions of networked devices 3138  Supplemental guidance can be found in the following documents: 3139   NIST SP 800-94, Guide to Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS)  3140   NISTIR 8219, Securing Manufacturing Industrial Control Systems: Behavioral Anomaly 3141  Detection 3142  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Network monitoring can greatly enhance the ability to detect attacks entering or leaving the  OT networks, thereby improving security. It can also improve network efficiency by  detecting non-essential traffic. OT cybersecurity personnel must be part of the diagnostic  process of interpreting the alerts provided by network monitoring tools. Careful monitoring  and an understanding of the normal state of the OT network can help distinguish transient  conditions from legitimate attacks and provide insight into events that are outside the normal  state.  Gaining access to network traffic is typically performed with switched port analyzer (SPAN)  ports and network taps. SPAN ports are a feature in network devices that can logically  duplicate and forward select network traffic to a network monitoring solution. Taps are  bump-in-the-wire network devices that duplicate traffic from a single physical link. For both  types of sensors, care should be taken as performance impacts to the OT system may result  from their use.  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-94 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8219 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8219  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  126  Network sensors should be placed to effectively monitor the OT network. Typical  installations locate the network sensors between the control network and corporate network,  but other locations can include network perimeters, key network segments (e.g., DMZ), and  critical OT devices.  Regardless of the type of network sensor, all sensors should be subjected to extensive testing  and be implemented in a test environment before being deployed to the OT network.  Configuring the sensor into a test or learning mode after it is installed on the network  provides an opportunity to tune the device with real OT network traffic. Tuning can help  reduce false positive alerts, reduce the alert “noise” from typical network traffic, and help  identify implementation and configuration problems.  Failure modes of network sensors in the event of a sensor failure should be considered (e.g.,  does the sensor fail-safe or fail-open if the device fails).  3143  6.3.2.2 System Use Monitoring (DE.CM-1 and DE-CM-3) 3144  System use monitoring solutions enable an organization to monitor, store, and audit system 3145  events (e.g., system logs, running processes, file access and modification, system and application 3146  configuration changes) occurring within a system. Monitoring users and systems helps to ensure 3147  they are behaving as expected and can aid in troubleshooting when events occur by providing 3148  information about which users were working within the system during the event. System and 3149  device misconfigurations can also be identified.  3150  Compared to network monitoring, system use monitoring solutions can analyze activity that does 3151  not traverse the network. In host-based solutions, this can be achieved with real-time monitoring 3152  of inter-process communications and other internal OS data, while active-scanning solutions 3153  gather information by querying the OS or application programming interfaces (APIs).  3154  Supplemental guidance can be found in the following documents: 3155   NIST SP 800-94, Guide to Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) 3156   NIST SP 800-137, Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) for Federal 3157  Information Systems and Organizations 3158  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-94 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-137 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-137  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  127  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Situational awareness of the OT system is imperative to understanding the current state of the  system, validating that it is operating as intended and that no policy violations or cyber  incidents have hindered its operation. Strong device monitoring, logging, and auditing is  necessary to collect, correlate, and analyze security-related information, resulting in  actionable communication of security status across the complete OT system. In the event of a  cybersecurity incident, the information gathered by system-use monitoring solutions can be  used to perform forensic analysis of the OT system.  System-use monitoring solutions can generate significant amounts of events. It is generally  suggested these solutions be used in combination with a control log management system,  such as a SIEM, to help filter the types of events and reduce alert fatigue. The amount of  tuning and customization of events and alerts is dependent on the type of OT system and the  number of devices in the system.  System-use monitoring solutions should be subjected to extensive testing and be  implemented in a test environment before being deployed to devices in the OT system.  Concerns include performance impacts of host-based agents on devices, impact of active  scanning on devices, and capability of the network infrastructure bandwidth. Separate  appliances can offload the processing. Host-based agents can impact the performance of the  OT device because of the resources they consume from the host.  3159  6.3.2.3 Malicious Code Detection (DE.CM-4) 3160  When stored, processed, and transmitted, files and data streams should be scanned using 3161  specialized tools with a combination of heuristic algorithms and known malware signatures to 3162  detect and block potentially malicious code. Malicious code protection tools only function 3163  effectively when installed, configured, run full-time, and maintained properly against the state of 3164  known attack methods and payloads.  3165  Supplemental guidance for anti-malware practices can be found in the following documents: 3166   NIST SP 800-83 Rev. 1, Guide to Malware Incident Prevention and Handling for Desktops 3167  and Laptops 3168   NIST SP 1058, Using Host-Based Anti-Virus Software on Industrial Control Systems: 3169  Integration Guidance and a Test Methodology for Assessing Performance Impacts 3170  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  While antivirus tools are common security practice in IT computer systems, the use of  antivirus with OT may require adopting special practices including compatibility checks,  change management, and performance impact metrics. These practices should be utilized for  testing new signatures and new versions of antivirus software.  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-83r1 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-83r1 https://doi.org/10.6028/nist.sp.1058 https://doi.org/10.6028/nist.sp.1058  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  128  Some OT vendors recommend and even support the use of vendor-specific antivirus tools. In  some cases, OT system vendors may have performed regression testing across their product  line for supported versions of a particular antivirus tool and provide associated installation  and configuration documentation.  Generally:   General-purpose Windows, Unix, Linux systems, etc., used as engineering workstations,  data historians, maintenance laptops, and backup servers can be secured like commercial  IT equipment: install push- or auto-updated antivirus software with updates distributed  via an antivirus server located inside the process control network. Follow organization- developed procedures for transferring the latest updates from known-good vendor sites to  the OT antivirus servers to other OT computers and servers.   Follow vendor recommendations on all other servers and computers (e.g., DCS, PLC,  instruments) that have time-dependent code, modified or extended OSs, or any other  change that makes it different from a standard PC. Perform testing of the antivirus  software and updates on an offline system if possible (e.g., install on a backup HMI and  validate that performance is not degraded before applying to the primary HMI).  According to NIST SP 1058 [SP1058], antivirus software may negatively impact the time- critical control processes of an ICS. The SP also identified significant CPU usage when  running manual scans and signature updates, which could have negative impacts on OT  computers and servers. As a result:   Configuration of the antivirus software should be tested on an offline system, if possible.   Manual scanning and signature updates should be performed while the system is not  critical for operations.   Redundancy should be considered for critical systems requiring ongoing antivirus  updates, such that signature updates can be performed without impact to operations (e.g.,  consoles and HMIs).   When configuring file exclusion lists, determine which control application files should  not be scanned during production time because of possible OT system malfunction or  performance degradation.  CISA provides a recommended practice for updating antivirus in OT environments.  3171  6.3.2.4 Vulnerability Scanning (DE.CM-8) 3172  Vulnerabilities can be identified through a combination of automated and manual techniques. 3173  These vulnerability scans should be performed on an ongoing basis to capture new 3174  vulnerabilities as they are discovered. 3175  https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/Recommended-Practices  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  129  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Some common ways to achieve vulnerability identification in the OT environment are:   Continuous monitoring using passive or active scanning capabilities. Organizations  should consider how vulnerability scanning tools may impact OT components and  communications by testing in an offline environment prior to implementing in production.  o Passive scanning tools typically utilize network traffic analyzers to detect assets and  determine possible vulnerabilities affecting the assets.  o Active scanning tools typically utilize an agent to connect to networked assets and  perform detailed queries and analysis of the components to determine possible  vulnerabilities affecting the assets.   Performance testing, load testing, and penetration testing if the test will not adversely  impact the production environment.   Regular audits, assessments, and peer reviews to identify gaps in security.  3176  6.3.3 Detection Process (DE.DP) 3177  Detection process includes maintaining and testing processes, procedures, and tools to ensure 3178  anomalous events are identified in a prompt manner and responsible parties (individuals) are 3179  alerted and help accountable for adequate response. To ensure ongoing awareness of anomalous 3180  events: define roles and responsibilities to ensure accountability; periodically review that 3181  detection activities comply with the requirements; test the detection processes regularly; 3182  communicate detected events to appropriate personnel to act; and continuously improve 3183  detection capabilities. 3184  6.4 Respond (RS) 3185  The Response function supports the ability to take the appropriate course of action and activities 3186  to contain a cybersecurity incident when it occurs.  3187  6.4.1 Response Planning (RS.RP) 3188  When responding to events, organizations should attempt to capture details associated with 3189  executing the documented response plans. This may help organizations during the post-incident 3190  review process to identify gaps or potential opportunities for improvement in the response plan. 3191  Due to time sensitivity of response efforts, if capturing execution details impacts safety or 3192  increases the time to complete the response plan, organizations may want to consider other 3193  techniques such as reviewing logs, reviewing video footage captured during the response 3194  activities, or interviewing response personnel. 3195  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  130  6.4.2 Response Communications (RS.CO) 3196  Response to a cybersecurity incident includes coordination with internal and external 3197  stakeholders. An incident response team should be assembled. Depending on the complexity and 3198  impact of the incident, the incident response team could consist of one or many individuals that 3199  have been trained on incident response. The FEMA National Incident Management System 3200  (NIMS) can be used to standardize on common terminology and roles for incident response. 3201  Prior to an incident, organizations should consider how to communicate with response personnel 3202  and external entities, including: 3203   developing an email distribution list for incident response 3204   leveraging an emergency notification system 3205   establishing backup communication plans for radio / phone / email if primary communication 3206  systems fail 3207   designating a spokesperson for external communications 3208   designating a scribe for internal incident communications 3209  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Organizations should consider FEMA’s guidance on crisis communications when  establishing their communication plans and strategies.  Personnel responsible for responding to an incident should be informed of and trained on  their responsibilities.  The response plan should include a detailed list of organizations and personnel that should be  contacted for incident response and reporting under various circumstances. Each individual  should be assigned a role or roles required for incident response, which could include  incident commander; operations, planning, logistics, or finance/administration section chief  or member; and public information, safety, or liaison officer.  To support a response in an OT environment, an organization should consider including the  following personnel in the response plan:  Internal Resources   Designated Incident Commander   Operations leadership   Safety personnel   On-call OT systems personnel  https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/nims https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/nims https://www.ready.gov/crisis-communications-plan  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  131   On-call IT personnel   Physical security personnel   Administrative personnel   Procurement   Public relations and legal personnel  External Industry Partners   OT technical support (vendors, integrators)   Operational supply chain (e.g., suppliers, customers, distributors, business partners)   Incident response team   Surge support   Impacted community (e.g., facility neighbors)  Organizations are required to report incidents to federal agencies in accordance with PPD-21  [PPD-21] and PPD-41 [PPD-41]. CISA maintains the list of sector-specific contacts.  Legal departments can often assist with developing nondisclosure agreements or other  contracts if an organization plans to utilize external resources for incident response. It may be  beneficial to develop these contracts prior to an incident occurring so that incident response  can be immediate. Private companies are available to be held on retainer in case of an OT  incident.  3210  6.4.3 Response Analysis (RS.AN) 3211  Analyses of cybersecurity incidents are conducted to ensure effective response and recovery 3212  activities, consistent with the detection process and the response plan. Analysis includes 3213  reviewing notifications and determining if further investigation is required, understanding the 3214  potential impact, performing forensics, categorizing the incident consistent with the response 3215  plan, and analyzing disclosed vulnerabilities. 3216  Supplemental guidance for the response analysis controls can be found in the following 3217  document: 3218   NIST SP 800-86, Guide to Integrating Forensic Techniques into Incident Response 3219  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  When determining the overall impact of a cybersecurity incident, consider the dependencies  of OT and its resulting impact on operations. For example, an OT system may be dependent  https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/ncirp/National_Cyber_Incident_Response_Plan.pdf https://www.cisa.gov/sector-risk-management-agencies https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-86  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  132  on IT for business applications, such that an incident on the IT network results in an OT  disconnect or shutdown.  If an organization does not have adequate resources or capabilities to conduct OT forensics,  consider engaging external organizations to perform forensic analysis.  Organizations should identify and classify cyber and non-cyber incidents affecting the OT  environment according to the incident response plan. When developing the OT incident  response plan, potential classes of incidents could include accidental actions taken by  authorized personnel, targeted malicious attacks, and untargeted malicious attacks.  3220  6.4.4 Response Mitigation (RS.MI) 3221  Activities are performed to prevent expansion of the incident, mitigate its effects, and resolve the 3222  incident. Mitigation activity should be consistent with the response plan. 3223  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  OT components are often physically remote and not continually staffed. For these cases,  consider how the organization would respond during an incident and the additional time  required to coordinate the response. The system may need to be designed with the capability  to minimize impacts until personnel can arrive onsite (e.g., remote shutdown or disconnects).  Cyber incident mitigation may involve process shutdowns or communication disconnects that  have impact to operations. These impacts should be understood and communicated during  incident mitigation.  3224  6.4.5 Response Improvements (RS.IM) 3225  Organizational response activities are improved by incorporating lessons learned from current 3226  and previous detection and response activities. It is recommended to designate an individual(s) 3227  responsible for documenting and communicating response actions to the incident response team 3228  which can later be reviewed for lessons learned. 3229  6.5 Recover (RC) 3230  Timely recovery to normal operations after a cybersecurity incident is critical. The recover 3231  function addresses developing and implementing activities to maintain resilience of systems and 3232  ensure timely restoration of capabilities and services affected by a cybersecurity incident.  3233  6.5.1 Recovery Planning (RC.RP) 3234  When recovering from events, organizations should attempt to capture details associated with the 3235  execution of the documented recovery plans. Capturing execution details may help organizations 3236  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  133  during the post-incident review process to determine if any gaps or potential opportunities for 3237  improvement in the recovery plan should be considered. Due to time sensitivity of recovery 3238  efforts, if capturing execution details impacts safety or increases the time to complete the 3239  recovery plan, organizations may want to consider other techniques such as reviewing logs, 3240  reviewing video footage captured during the recovery activities, or interviewing recovery 3241  personnel. 3242  Supplemental guidance for recovery planning can be found in the following documents: 3243   NIST SP 800-184, Guide for Cybersecurity Event Recovery 3244   NIST SP 800-209, Security Guidelines for Storage Infrastructure 3245  6.5.2 Recovery Improvements (RC.IM) 3246  As a recovery effort is ongoing, the recovery steps taken should be documented to develop 3247  lessons learned. These lessons can be used to improve recovery plans and processes. 3248  Supplemental guidance for recovery improvements can be found in the following document: 3249   NIST SP 800-184, Guide for Cybersecurity Event Recovery 3250  6.5.3 Recovery Communications (RC.CO) 3251  Restoration activities are coordinated with internal and external parties. In addition to operational 3252  recovery, an organization may need to manage public relations and repair its reputation. 3253  Supplemental guidance for recovery communications can be found in the following document: 3254   NIST SP 800-184, Guide for Cybersecurity Event Recovery 3255  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  A list of internal and external resources for recovery activities should be developed as part of  the Recovery Planning effort.

Actuator A device for moving or controlling a mechanism or system. It is operated  by a source of energy, typically electric current, hydraulic fluid pressure,  or pneumatic pressure, and converts that energy into motion. An actuator  is the mechanism by which a control system acts upon an environment.  The control system can be simple (a fixed mechanical or electronic  system), software-based (e.g., a printer driver, robot control system), or a  human or other agent.  Alarm  [ANSI-ISA-5-1]  A device or function that signals the existence of an abnormal condition  by making an audible or visible discrete change, or both, so as to attract  attention to that condition.  Antivirus tools Software products and technology used to detect malicious code, prevent  it from infecting a system, and remove malicious code that has infected  the system.  Attack An attempt to gain unauthorized access to system services, resources, or  information, or an attempt to compromise system integrity, availability,  or confidentiality.  Authentication  [FIPS200]  Verifying the identity of a user, process, or device, often as a prerequisite  to allowing access to resources in an information system.  Authorization  [RFC4949]  (adapted)  The right or a permission that is granted to a system entity to access a  system resource.  Backdoor An undocumented way of gaining access to a computer system. A  backdoor is a potential security risk.  Buffer overflow  [SP800-28]  A condition at an interface under which more input can be placed into a  buffer or data holding area than the capacity allocated, overwriting other  information. Adversaries exploit such a condition to crash a system or to  insert specially crafted code that allows them to gain control of the  system.  Cleartext Information that is not encrypted.  Communications  router  A communications device that transfers messages between two  networks. Common uses for routers include connecting a LAN to a  WAN, and connecting MTUs and RTUs to a long-distance network  medium for SCADA communication.  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  153  Confidentiality  [USC44-3552]  (adapted)  Preserving authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure,  including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary  information.

Control The part of the OT system used to perform the monitoring and control of  the physical process. This includes all control servers, field devices,  actuators, sensors, and their supporting communication systems.  Control algorithm  [ISADICT]  A mathematical representation of the control action to be performed.  Control center  [ANSI-ISA-51-1]  An equipment structure or group of structures from which a process is  measured, controlled, and/or monitored.  Control loop A control loop consists of sensors for measurement, controller hardware  such as PLCs, actuators such as control valves, breakers, switches and  motors, and the communication of variables. Controlled variables are  transmitted to the controller from the sensors. The controller interprets  the signals and generates corresponding manipulated variables, based on  set points, which it transmits to the actuators. Process changes from  disturbances result in new sensor signals, identifying the state of the  process, to again be transmitted to the controller.  Control network Those networks of an enterprise typically connected to equipment that  controls physical processes and that is time or safety critical. The control  network can be subdivided into zones, and there can be multiple separate  control networks within one enterprise and site.  SOURCE: ISA99  Control server A controller that also acts as a server that hosts the control software that  communicates with lower-level control devices, such as remote terminal  units (RTUs) and programmable logic controllers (PLCs), over an OT  network. In a SCADA system, this is often called a SCADA server,  MTU, or supervisory controller.  Control system A system in which deliberate guidance or manipulation is used to  achieve a prescribed value for a variable. Control systems include  SCADA, DCS, PLCs, BAS and other types of OT measurement and  control systems.  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  154  Controlled  variable  [ISADICT]  The variable that the control system attempts to keep at the set point  value. The set point may be constant or variable.  Controller  [ANSI-ISA-51-1]  A device or program that operates automatically to regulate a controlled  variable.  Cycle time  [ISADICT]  The time, usually expressed in seconds, for a controller to complete one  control loop where sensor signals are read into memory, control  algorithms are executed, and corresponding control signals are  transmitted to actuators that create changes the process resulting in new  sensor signals.  Data diode A network appliance or device allowing data to travel only in one  direction. Also referred to as a unidirectional gateway, deterministic one- way boundary device or unidirectional network.  Data historian A centralized database supporting data analysis using statistical process  control techniques.  Database  [IR6859] (adapted)  A repository of information that usually holds plant-wide information  including process data, recipes, personnel data, and financial data.  Demilitarized  zone  [SP800-41r1]  An interface on a routing firewall that is similar to the interfaces found  on the firewall’s protected side. Traffic moving between the DMZ and  other interfaces on the protected side of the firewall still goes through the  firewall and can have firewall protection policies applied.  Denial of service  [RFC4949]  The prevention of authorized access to a system resource or the delaying  of system operations and functions.  Diagnostics  [ISADICT]  Information concerning known failure modes and their characteristics.  Such information can be used in troubleshooting and failure analysis to  help pinpoint the cause of a failure and help define suitable corrective  measures.  Disaster recovery  plan  [SP800-34r1]  (adapted)  A written plan for processing critical applications in the event of a major  hardware or software failure or destruction of facilities.  Discrete process  [ISADICT]  A type of process where a specified quantity of material moves as a unit  (part or group of parts) between work stations and each unit maintains its  unique identity.  Distributed  control system  [ISADICT]  In a control system, refers to control achieved by intelligence that is  distributed about the process to be controlled, rather than by a centrally  located single unit.  Disturbance  [ANSI-ISA-51-1]  An undesired change in a variable being applied to a system that tends to  adversely affect the value of a controlled variable.  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  155  Domain  [RFC4949]  (adapted)  An environment or context that includes a set of system resources and a  set of system entities that have the right to access the resources as  defined by a common security policy, security model, or security  architecture.  Encryption  [RFC4949]  (adapted)  Cryptographic transformation of data (called “plaintext”) into a form  (called “ciphertext”) that conceals the data’s original meaning to prevent  it from being known or used. If the transformation is reversible, the  corresponding reversal process is called “decryption,” which is a  transformation that restores encrypted data to its original state.  Enterprise An organization that coordinates the operation of one or more processing  sites.  SOURCE: ANSI/ISA-88.01-1995  Fault tolerant Of a system, having the built-in capability to provide continued, correct  execution of its assigned function in the presence of a hardware and/or  software fault.  Field device Equipment that is connected to the field side on an ICS. Types of field  devices include RTUs, PLCs, actuators, sensors, HMIs, and associated  communications.  Field site A subsystem that is identified by physical, geographical, or logical  segmentation within the ICS. A field site may contain RTUs, PLCs,  actuators, sensors, HMIs, and associated communications.  Fieldbus A digital, serial, multi-drop, two-way data bus or communication path or  link between low-level industrial field equipment such as sensors,  transducers, actuators, local controllers, and even control room devices.  Use of fieldbus technologies eliminates the need of point-to-point wiring  between the controller and each device. A protocol is used to define  messages over the fieldbus network with each message identifying a  particular sensor on the network.  File Transfer  Protocol  An Internet standard for transferring files over the Internet. FTP  programs and utilities are used to upload and download Web pages,  graphics, and other files between local media and a remote server which  allows FTP access.  Firewall  [RFC4949]  An inter-network gateway that restricts data communication traffic to  and from one of the connected networks (the one said to be “inside” the  firewall) and thus protects that network’s system resources against  threats from the other network (the one that is said to be “outside” the  firewall).  Human-machine  interface  [IR6859]  The hardware or software through which an operator interacts with a  controller. An HMI can range from a physical control panel with buttons  and indicator lights to an industrial PC with a color graphics display  running dedicated HMI software.

Worm  [RFC4949]  (adapted)  A computer program that can run independently, can propagate a  complete working version of itself onto other hosts on a network, and  may consume computer resources destructively.  3549  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  163  Appendix C—Threat Sources, Vulnerabilities, and Incidents 3550  Several terms are used to describe the inter-related concepts of threat, threat source, threat event, 3551  and incident. A threat is any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact 3552  organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational 3553  assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation through an information system via 3554  unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information, and/or denial of 3555  service. Threats have some intent or method that may exploit a vulnerability through either 3556  intentional or unintentional means. This intent or method is referred to as the threat source. A 3557  vulnerability is a weakness in an information system (including an OT), system security 3558  procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat 3559  source. A threat event is an event or situation that has the potential for causing undesirable 3560  consequences or impact. When a threat event occurs it becomes an incident that actually or 3561  potentially jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information system or 3562  the information the system processes, stores, or transmits or that constitutes a violation or 3563  imminent threat of violation of security policies, security procedures, or acceptable use policies. 3564  This appendix explores OT-specific threat sources, vulnerabilities, and incidents. It also cites 3565  examples of OT-specific incidents to illustrate their potential impact. Each organization 3566  calculates risk based on the specific threats, vulnerabilities, and impact and likelihood of 3567  incidents within their environment. 3568  C.1 Threat Sources 3569  Threats to OT can come from numerous sources, which can be classified as adversarial, 3570  accidental, structural, or environmental. Table 13 lists and defines known threat sources to OT. 3571  These threat sources should be considered part of the risk management strategy. The threat 3572  source must be well understood in order to define and implement adequate protection. For 3573  example, environmental events (e.g., floods, earthquakes) are well understood, but may vary in 3574  their magnitude, frequency, and their ability to compound other interconnected events. However, 3575  adversarial threats depend on the resources available to the adversary and the emergence of 3576  previously unknown vulnerabilities or attacks.  3577  Table 13: Threats to OT 3578  Type of Threat Source Description Characteristics  ADVERSARIAL  - Bot-network operators  - Criminal groups  - Hackers/hacktivists  - Insiders  - Nations  - Terrorists  Individuals, groups, organizations, or nation-states that seek  to exploit the organization’s dependence on cyber resources  (e.g., information in electronic form, information and  communications technologies, and the communications and  information-handling capabilities provided by those  technologies)  Capability, Intent,  Targeting  ACCIDENTAL  - User  - Privileged User/Administrator  Erroneous actions taken by individuals in the course of  executing their everyday responsibilities (e.g., operator  accidentally typing 100 instead of 10 as a set point; engineer  making a change in the production environment while  thinking that they are in the development environment)  Range of effects  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  164  Type of Threat Source Description Characteristics  STRUCTURAL  - Hardware failure  • Processors, input/output cards,  communications cards  • Networking equipment  • Power supply  • Sensor, final element  • HMI, displays  - Software failure  • OS  • General-purpose applications  • Mission-specific applications  - Environmental controls failure  • Temperature control  • Humidity control  - Communications degradation  • Wireless  • Wired  Failures of equipment, environmental controls, or software  due to aging, resource depletion, or other circumstances  which exceed expected operating parameters. Includes  failures of critical infrastructures within the control of the  organization.  Range of effects  ENVIRONMENTAL  - Natural or human-caused disaster  • Fire  • Flood/tsunami  • Windstorm/tornado  • Hurricane  • Earthquake  • Bombing  • Animal interference  • Solar flares, meteorites  - Critical Infrastructure failure  • Telecommunications  • Electrical power  • Transportation  • Water/wastewater  Natural disasters and failures of critical infrastructures on  which the organization depends, but which are outside the  control of the organization.  Note: Natural and human-caused disasters can also be  characterized in terms of their severity and/or duration.  However, because the threat source and the threat event are  strongly identified, severity and duration can be included in  the description of the threat event (e.g., Category 5 hurricane  causes extensive damage to the facilities housing mission- critical systems, making those systems unavailable for three  weeks).  Range of effects  3579  C.2 Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions 3580  Vulnerabilities are weaknesses in information systems, system procedures, controls, or 3581  implementations that can be exploited by a threat source. Predisposing conditions are properties 3582  of the organization, mission/business process, architecture, or information systems that 3583  contribute to the likelihood of a threat event. The order of these vulnerabilities and predisposing 3584  conditions does not reflect priority in terms of likelihood of occurrence or severity of impact. 3585  Additionally, the vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions identified in this section should not 3586  be considered a complete list; it should also not be assumed that these issues are found within 3587  every OT environment.  3588  The vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions are grouped according to where they exist, such 3589  as in the organization’s policy and procedures or the inadequacy of security mechanisms 3590  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  165  implemented in hardware, firmware, and software. The former is referred to as being in the 3591  organization and the latter as being in the system. Understanding the source of vulnerabilities 3592  and predisposing conditions can assist in determining optimal mitigation strategies. Deeper 3593  analysis may uncover that causes and observations may not be one-to-one—that is, some 3594  underlying causes may exhibit multiple symptoms and some symptoms may come from more 3595  than one cause.  3596  Any given OT will usually exhibit a subset of the identified vulnerabilities in this appendix but 3597  may also contain additional vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions unique to the particular 3598  technology or implementation that do not appear in this appendix. Specific current information 3599  on OT vulnerabilities can be researched at the CISA website. Many vendors publish notifications 3600  and patches to improve both reliability and security which are not always found on the CISA 3601  website. It is beneficial to maintain relationships with the vendors in order to stay up-to-date with 3602  known vulnerabilities. 3603  Some vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions can be mitigated; others can only be accepted 3604  and controlled by appropriate countermeasures but will result in some residual risk to the OT 3605  environment. For example, some existing policies and procedures may be changed with a level 3606  of effort that the organization considers acceptable; others are more expeditiously dealt with by 3607  instituting additional policies and procedures.  3608  Vulnerabilities in products and services acquired from outside the organization are rarely under 3609  the direct control of the organization. Changes may be influenced by market forces, but this is a 3610  slow and indirect approach. Instead, the organization may change predisposing conditions to 3611  reduce the likelihood that a systemic vulnerability will be exploited.  3612  C.2.1 Policy and Procedure Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions 3613  Vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions are often introduced into the OT environment 3614  because of incomplete, inappropriate, or nonexistent security policy, including its 3615  documentation, implementation guides (e.g., procedures), and enforcement. Management support 3616  of security policy and procedures is the cornerstone of any security program. Organization 3617  security policy can reduce vulnerabilities by mandating and enforcing proper conduct. Written 3618  policy and procedures are mechanisms for informing staff and stakeholders of decisions about 3619  behavior that is beneficial to the organization. From this perspective, policy is an educational and 3620  instructive way to reduce vulnerabilities. Enforcement is partner to policy, encouraging people to 3621  do the proper thing. Various forms of corrective action are the usual consequences to personnel 3622  not following policy and procedures. Policies should be explicit about the consequences to 3623  individuals or organizations that do not conform. 3624  There is usually a complex policy and procedure environment that includes laws and regulations, 3625  overlapping jurisdictions and spheres of influence, economics, custom, and history. The larger 3626  enterprise is often subdivided into organizational units that should work together to reduce 3627  vulnerabilities. The scope and hierarchical relationship among policies and procedures needs to 3628  be managed for maximum effectiveness.  3629  https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  166  Table 14 presents examples of observed policy and procedure vulnerabilities and predisposing 3630  conditions for OT. 3631  Table 14: Policy and Procedure Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions 3632  Vulnerability Description  Inadequate organizational  ownership of risk assessments  Risk assessments should be performed with acknowledgement from  appropriate levels within the organization. Lack of understanding of risk  could lead to under-mitigated scenarios or inadequate funding and  selection of controls.  Inadequate security policy for OT Vulnerabilities are often introduced into the OT environment due to  inadequate policies or the lack of policies specifically for OT system  security. Controls and countermeasures should be derived from a risk  assessment or policy. This ensures uniformity and accountability.  Inadequate OT security training  and awareness program  A documented formal OT security training and awareness program is  designed to keep staff up to date on organizational security policies and  procedures as well as threats, industry cybersecurity standards, and  recommended practices. Without adequate ongoing training on specific OT  policies and procedures, staff cannot be expected to maintain a secure OT  environment.  Lack of inventory management  policy  Inventory policy and procedures should include installation, removal, and  changes made to hardware, firmware, and software. An incomplete  inventory could lead to unmanaged and unprotected devices within the OT  environment.  Lack of configuration management  policy  Lack of policy and procedures for OT configuration management can lead  to an unmanageable and highly vulnerable inventory of hardware,  firmware, and software.  Inadequate OT equipment  implementation guidelines  Equipment implementation guidelines should be kept up to date and readily  available. These guidelines are an integral part of security procedures in  the event of an OT malfunction.  Lack of administrative mechanisms  for security policy enforcement  Without accountability for enforcing policy, there’s limited ability to ensure  security policies are followed adequately. Administrative mechanisms  should be in place to ensure accountability.  Inadequate review of the  effectiveness of the OT security  controls  Procedures and schedules should exist to determine the extent to which  the security program and its constituent controls are implemented correctly,  operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to  meeting the security requirements for the OT. The examination is  sometimes called an “audit,” “evaluation,” or “assessment.” Policy should  address the stage of the life cycle, purpose, technical expertise,  methodology, and level of independence.  No OT-specific contingency plan  A contingency plan (e.g., business continuity plan, disaster recovery plan)  should be prepared, tested, and available in the event of a major hardware  or software failure or destruction of facilities. Lack of a specific plan for the  OT could lead to extended downtimes and production loss.  Lack of adequate access control  policy  Access control enforcement depends on policy that correctly models roles,  responsibilities, and authorizations. The policy model must enable the way  the organization functions.  Lack of adequate authentication  policy  Authentication policies are needed to define when authentication  mechanisms (e.g., passwords, smart cards) must be used, how strong they  must be, and how they must be maintained. Without policy, systems might  not have appropriate authentication controls, making unauthorized access  to systems more likely. Authentication policies should be developed as part  of an overall OT security program, taking into account the capabilities of  the OT and its personnel to handle more complex passwords and other  mechanisms.  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  167  Vulnerability Description  Inadequate incident detection &  response plan and procedures  Incident detection and response plans, procedures, and methods are  necessary for rapidly detecting incidents, minimizing loss and destruction,  preserving evidence for later forensic examination, mitigating the  weaknesses that were exploited, and restoring services. Establishing a  successful incident response capability includes continually monitoring for  anomalies, prioritizing the handling of incidents, and implementing effective  methods of collecting, analyzing, and reporting data.  Lack of redundancy for critical  components  Lack of redundancy in critical components could provide single point of  failure possibilities.  3633  C.2.2 System Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions 3634  Security controls must clearly identify the systems to which they apply. Systems range widely in 3635  size, scope, and capability. At the small end of the spectrum, a system may be an individual 3636  hardware or software product or service. At the other end of the spectrum, we find large complex 3637  systems, systems-of-systems, and networks, all of which incorporate hardware architecture and 3638  software framework (including application frameworks), where the combination supports 3639  operations. An organization may choose to identify security zones such that security controls 3640  may be applied to all systems within the security zone. 3641  System vulnerabilities can occur in the hardware, firmware, and software used to build the OT. 3642  Sources of vulnerabilities include design flaws, development flaws, misconfigurations, poor 3643  maintenance, poor administration, and connections with other systems and networks. Many of 3644  the controls in the SP 800-53 and the OT overlay in Appendix F specify what the system must do 3645  to mitigate these vulnerabilities. 3646  Vulnerabilities can also exist in the auxiliary components that support the OT systems. A subset 3647  of those vulnerabilities with the potential to impact the physical process are described in this 3648  section. 3649  The potential vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions commonly found within OT systems 3650  are categorized into the following tables: 3651   Table 15: Architecture and Design Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions 3652   Table 16: Configuration and Maintenance Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions 3653   Table 17: Physical Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions 3654   Table 18: Software Development Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions 3655   Table 19: Communication and Network Configuration Vulnerabilities and Predisposing 3656  Conditions 3657   Table 20: Sensor, Final Element, and Asset Management Vulnerabilities and Predisposing 3658  Conditions 3659  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  168  Table 15: Architecture and Design Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions 3660  Vulnerability Description  Inadequate incorporation of  security into architecture and  design  Incorporating security into the OT architecture and design must start with  budget and schedule designated for OT. The architectures must address  the identification and authorization of users, access control mechanism,  network topologies, and system configuration and integrity mechanisms.  Inadequate management of  change allowing insecure  architecture to evolve  The network infrastructure within the OT environment has often been  developed and modified based on business and operational requirements,  with little consideration for the potential security impacts of the changes.  Over time, security gaps may have been inadvertently introduced within the  infrastructure. Without remediation, these gaps may represent backdoors  into the OT.  Sensors and controllers that were historically simple devices are now often  manufactured as intelligent devices. In some cases, sensors and  controllers may be replaced with IIoT devices which allow direct internet  connections. Security should be incorporated into change management for  all OT devices, not just traditional IT components.  No security perimeter defined If the OT does not have a security perimeter clearly defined, it is not  possible to ensure that the necessary security controls are deployed and  configured properly. This can lead to unauthorized access to systems and  data, as well as other problems.  Control networks used for non- control traffic  Control and non-control traffic have different requirements, such as  determinism and reliability. Having both types of traffic on a single network  creates challenges for meeting the requirements of control traffic. For  example, non-control traffic could inadvertently consume resources that  control traffic needs, causing disruptions in OT functions.  Control network services  dependent on a non-control  network  When IT services such as Domain Name System (DNS) and Dynamic Host  Configuration Protocol (DHCP) are used by control networks, they are  often implemented in the IT network. This causes the OT network to  become dependent on the IT network, which may not have the reliability  and availability requirements needed by OT.  Inadequate collection of event data  history  Forensic analysis depends on collection and retention of sufficient data.  Without proper and accurate data collection, it might be impossible to  determine what caused a security incident to occur. Incidents might go  unnoticed, leading to additional damage and/or disruption. Regular security  monitoring is also needed to identify problems with security controls, such  as misconfigurations and failures.  Event data for an OT environment could include physical process data,  system use data, and network data.  3661  Table 16: Configuration and Maintenance Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions 3662  Vulnerability Description  Hardware, firmware, and software  not under asset management  The organization doesn’t know what it has (e.g., make, model), where they  are, or what version it has, resulting in an inconsistent and ineffective  defense posture. To properly secure an OT, there should be an accurate  inventory of the assets in the environment. Procedures should be in place  to manage additions, deletions, and modifications of assets which include  asset inventory management. These procedures are critical to executing  business continuity and disaster recovery plans.  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  169  Vulnerability Description  Hardware, firmware, and software  not under configuration  management  The organization doesn’t know the patch management status, security  settings, or configuration versions that it has, resulting in inconsistent and  ineffective defense posture. A lack of configuration change management  procedures can lead to security oversights, exposures, and risks. A  process for controlling modifications to hardware, firmware, software, and  documentation should be implemented to ensure an OT is protected  against inadequate or improper modifications before, during, and after  system implementation. To properly secure an OT, there should be an  accurate listing or repository of the current configurations.  OS and vendor software patches  may not be developed until  significantly after security  vulnerabilities are found  Because of the tight coupling between OT software and the underlying OT,  changes must undergo expensive and time-consuming comprehensive  regression testing. The elapsed time for such testing and subsequent  distribution of updated software provides a long window of vulnerability.  Vulnerability management procedures should include flexibility for interim  alternative mitigations.  Vendor declines to develop  patches for vulnerability  Out-of-date OSs and applications may contain newly discovered  vulnerabilities that could be exploited. Security patch support may not be  available for legacy OT, so vulnerability management procedures should  include contingency plans for mitigating vulnerabilities where patches may  never be available or replacement plans.  Lack of a vulnerability  management program  Vulnerabilities not considered by the organization could result in  exploitation. Vulnerability management procedures should be in place to  determine a plan of action or inaction upon discovery of a vulnerability.  Some OT considerations are: availability concerns may push patching until  the next planned operational downtime; security patch support may not be  available for OT systems that use outdated OSs; isolated systems may not  require immediate patching; and OT exposed to the internet may need  prioritized for patching.  Inadequate testing of security  changes  Modifications to hardware, firmware, and software deployed without testing  could compromise normal operation of the OT. Documented procedures  should be developed for testing all changes for security impact. The live  operational systems should never be used for testing. The testing of  system modifications may need to be coordinated with system vendors and  integrators.  Poor remote access controls There are many reasons why an OT may need to be remotely accessed,  including vendors and system integrators performing system maintenance  functions, and also OT engineers accessing geographically remote system  components. The concept of least privilege should be applied to remote  access controls. Remote access capabilities must be adequately controlled  to prevent unauthorized individuals from gaining access, or authorized  individuals from gaining excessive access, to the OT.  Poor configurations are used Improperly configured systems may leave unnecessary ports and protocols  open. These unnecessary functions may contain vulnerabilities that  increase the overall risk to the system. Using default configurations often  exposes vulnerabilities and exploitable services. All settings should be  examined.  Critical configurations are not  stored or backed up  Procedures should be available for restoring OT configuration settings in  the event of accidental or adversary-initiated configuration changes to  maintain system availability and prevent loss of data. Documented  procedures should be developed for maintaining configuration settings.  Data unprotected on portable  device  If sensitive data (e.g., passwords, dial-up numbers) is stored in cleartext on  portable devices such as laptops and mobile devices and these devices  are lost or stolen, system security could be compromised. Policy,  procedures, and mechanisms are required for protection.  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  170  Vulnerability Description  Vendor default passwords are  used  Most vendor default passwords are easy to discover within vendor product  manuals, which are also available to adversaries. Using the default  password can drastically increase OT vulnerability.  Passwords generation, use, and  protection not in accord with policy  Password policy and procedures must be followed to be effective.  Violations of password policy and procedures can increase OT  vulnerability.  Inadequate access controls applied Access controls must be matched to the way the organization allocates  responsibilities and privilege to its personnel. Poorly specified access  controls can result in giving an OT user too many or too few privileges. The  following exemplify each case:  • System configured with default access control settings gives an  operator administrative privileges  • System configured improperly results in an operator being  unable to take corrective actions in an emergency situation  Improper data linking OT data storage systems may be linked with non-OT data sources. An  example of this is database links, which allow data from one database  (e.g., data historian) to be automatically replicated to others. Data linkage  may create a vulnerability if it is not properly configured and may allow  unauthorized data access or manipulation.  Malware protection not installed or  up to date  Installation of malicious software, or malware, is a common attack.  Malware protection software, such as antivirus software, should be kept  current in a dynamic environment. Outdated malware protection software  and definitions leave the system open to malware threats.  Malware protection implemented  without sufficient testing  Malware protection software deployed without sufficient testing could  impact normal operation of the OT and block the system from performing  necessary control actions.  Denial of service (DoS)  OT software could be vulnerable to DoS attacks, resulting in the prevention  of authorized access to a system resource or delaying system operations  and functions.  Intrusion detection/prevention  software not installed  Incidents can result in loss of system availability and integrity; the capture,  modification, and deletion of data; and incorrect execution of control  commands. IDS/IPS software may stop or prevent various types of attacks,  including DoS attacks, and also identify attacked internal hosts, such as  those infected with worms. IDS/IPS software must be tested prior to  deployment to determine that it does not compromise normal operation of  the OT.  Logs not maintained Without proper and accurate logs, it might be impossible to determine what  caused a security event to occur and perform adequate forensics.  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  171  3663  Table 17: Physical Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions 3664  Vulnerability Description  Unauthorized personnel have  physical access to equipment  Physical access to OT equipment should be restricted to only the  necessary personnel, taking into account safety requirements such as  emergency shutdown or restarts. Improper access to OT equipment can  lead to any of the following:  • Physical theft of data and hardware  • Physical damage or destruction of data and hardware  • Modification of the operational process  • Unauthorized changes to the functional environment (e.g., data  connections, unauthorized use of removable media,  adding/removing resources)  • Disconnection of physical data links  • Undetectable interception of data (keystroke and other input  logging)  Radio frequency, electromagnetic  pulse (EMP), static discharge,  brownouts, and voltage spikes  Some hardware used for OT systems is vulnerable to radio frequency and  electromagnetic pulses (EMP), static discharge, brownouts, and voltage  spikes. The impact can range from temporary disruption of command and  control to permanent damage to circuit boards. Proper shielding,  grounding, power conditioning, and/or surge suppression is recommended.  Lack of backup power Without backup power to critical assets, a general loss of power will shut  down the OT and could create an unsafe situation. Loss of power could  also lead to insecure default settings. If the program file or data is stored in  volatile memory, the process may not be able to restart after a power  outage without appropriate backup power.  Loss of environmental control Loss of environmental control (e.g., temperatures, humidity) could lead to  equipment damage, such as processors overheating. Some processors will  shut down to protect themselves; some may continue to operate but in a  minimal capacity and may produce intermittent errors, continually reboot,  or become permanently inoperable.  Unsecured physical ports  Unsecured universal serial bus (USB) and PS/2 ports could allow  unauthorized connection of thumb drives, keystroke loggers, etc.  3665  Table 18: Software Development Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions 3666  Vulnerability Description  Improper data validation OT software may not properly validate user inputs or received data to  ensure validity. Invalid data may result in numerous vulnerabilities including  buffer overflows, command injections, cross-site scripting, and path  traversals.  Installed security capabilities not  enabled by default  Security capabilities that were installed with the product are useless if they  are not enabled or at least identified as being disabled.  Inadequate authentication,  privileges, and access control in  software  Unauthorized access to configuration and programming software could  provide the ability to corrupt a device.  3667  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  172  Table 19: Communication and Network Configuration Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions 3668  Vulnerability Description  Data flow controls not employed Data flow controls, based on data characteristics, are needed to restrict  which information is permitted between systems. These controls can  prevent exfiltration of information and illegal operations.  Firewalls nonexistent or improperly  configured  A lack of properly configured firewalls could permit unnecessary data to  pass between networks, such as control and corporate networks, allowing  attacks and malware to spread between networks, making sensitive data  susceptible to monitoring/eavesdropping, and providing individuals with  unauthorized access to systems.  Inadequate firewall and router logs Without proper and accurate logs, it might be impossible to determine what  caused a security incident to occur.  Standard, well-documented  communication protocols are used  in plaintext  Adversaries that can monitor the OT network activity can use a protocol  analyzer or other utilities to decode the data transferred by protocols such  as telnet, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Hypertext Transfer Protocol  (HTTP), and Network File System (NFS). The use of such protocols also  makes it easier for adversaries to perform attacks against OT and  manipulate OT network activity.  Authentication of users, data or  devices is substandard or  nonexistent  Many OT protocols have no authentication at any level. Without  authentication, there is the potential to replay, modify, or spoof data or to  spoof devices such as sensors and user identities.  Use of unsecure OT protocols OT protocols often have few or no security capabilities, such as  authentication and encryption, to protect data from unauthorized access or  tampering. Also, incorrect implementation of the protocols can lead to  additional vulnerabilities.  Lack of integrity checking for  communications  Integrity checks are not built into most OT protocols; adversaries could  manipulate communications undetected. To ensure integrity, the OT can  use lower-layer protocols (e.g., IPsec) that offer data integrity protection  when traversing untrusted physical media.  Inadequate authentication between  wireless clients and access points  Strong mutual authentication between wireless clients and access points is  needed to ensure that legitimate OT clients do not connect to a rogue  access point deployed by an adversary, and also to ensure that adversary  clients do not connect to any of the OT wireless networks.  Inadequate data protection  between wireless clients and  access points  Sensitive data between wireless clients and access points should be  protected using strong encryption to ensure that adversaries cannot gain  unauthorized access to the unencrypted data.  3669  Table 20: Sensor, Final Element, and Asset Management Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions 3670  Vulnerability Description  Unauthorized physical access to  sensors or final elements  Physical access to sensors and final elements allows for direct  manipulation of the physical process. Many devices are configured on a  fieldbus such that physical access to the sensor network allows for  manipulation of controlling parameters. Physical access to the whole of the  loop should be managed to prevent incidents.  Unauthorized wireless access to  sensors or final elements  Wireless access to sensors and final elements allows for direct  manipulation of the physical process. Many smart devices allow for  wireless configuration (e.g., Bluetooth, WiFi, WirelessHART). Wireless  access should be securely configured or disabled using hardware write- protect where possible to protect unauthorized modification of the sensors  and final elements which are connected both to the physical process and to  the OT environment.  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  173  Vulnerability Description  Inappropriate segmentation of  asset management system  Most architectures are designed for PLCs, RTUs, DCS, and SCADA  controllers to manipulate the process, and for asset management systems  to monitor the assets connected to the controllers. Many asset  management systems also have the technical ability to modify the  configuration of sensors and final elements, although modification may not  be their primary function. The asset management system should be  controlled appropriately based on its ability (or lack of ability) to manipulate  the process.  3671  C.3 Threat Events and Incidents 3672  A threat event is an event or situation that could potentially cause an undesirable consequence or 3673  impact to operations resulting from some threat source. In NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 [SP800-30r1], 3674  Appendix E identifies a broad set of threat events that could potentially impact information 3675  systems. The properties of OT may also present unique threat events, specifically addressing 3676  how the threat events can manipulate OT processes to cause physical damage. Table 21 provides 3677  an overview of potential OT threat events, leveraging MITRE’s ATT&CK® for Industrial 3678  Control Systems [ATTACK-ICS]. 3679  Table 21: Examples of Potential Threat Events 3680  Threat Event Description  Denial of Control Temporarily prevents operators and engineers from interfacing with  process controls. An affected process may still be operating during the  period of control loss, but not necessarily in a desired state.  Manipulation of Control Unauthorized changes made to programmed instructions in PLCs, RTUs,  DCS, or SCADA controllers, alarm thresholds changed, or unauthorized  commands issued to control equipment, which could potentially result in  damage to equipment (if tolerances are exceeded), premature shutdown of  processes (such as prematurely shutting down transmission lines), causing  an environmental incident, or even disabling control equipment.  Spoofed Reporting Message False information sent to an OT system operator either for evasion or to  impair process control. The adversary could make the defenders and  operators think that other errors are occurring in order to distract them from  the actual source of the problem (i.e., alarm floods).  Theft of Operational Information Adversaries may steal operational information for personal gain or to  inform future operations.  Loss of Safety Adversaries may target and disable safety system functions as a  prerequisite to subsequent attack execution or to allow for future unsafe  conditionals to go unchecked.  Loss of Availability Adversaries may leverage malware to delete or encrypt critical data on  HMIs, workstations, or databases.  3681  Numerous OT incidents have been reported and documented. Descriptions of these events help 3682  demonstrate the severity of the threat sources, vulnerabilities, and impacts within the OT domain. 3683  As mentioned in Section C.2, the four broad categories of threat sources are adversarial, 3684  accidental, structural, and environmental. Often the incident can be the result of multiple threat 3685  sources (e.g., an environmental event causes a system failure, which is responded to incorrectly 3686  by an operator resulting in an accidental event). Provided below is a limited selection of reported 3687  incidents covering each of the four categories. 3688  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  174  The incidents have been additionally categorized into malicious or non-malicious, and direct or 3689  indirect to further distinguish the possible causes of OT incidents. 3690  M = Malicious. The event was initiated by someone for a harmful purpose. The initiator 3691  may or may not have been targeting the OT or known the potential consequences. 3692  N = Non-malicious. There does not appear to be evidence that the initiating event was 3693  intended to cause an incident. 3694  D = Direct. The event was designed to discover, inhibit, impair, or otherwise impact the 3695  OT system.  3696  I = Indirect. The event was not believed to be designed to discover, inhibit, impair, or 3697  otherwise impact the OT system. The OT system shut down or caused disruption as a 3698  result of impact to the supporting infrastructure. 3699  C.3.1 Adversarial Events 3700   [M][D] Marconi Wireless Hack.9 In 1903, Italian radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi was 3701  preparing for his first public demonstration of long-distance secure wireless communications 3702  from Cornwall to Professor Fleming at the Royal Institution of London. Inventor and 3703  magician, Nevil Maskelyne, hacked the system, sending a comical message in morse code 3704  referencing “rats.” Maskelyne then published an explanation of his hack to the trade journal 3705  The Electrician. 3706   [M][I] Worcester Air Traffic Communications.10 In March 1997, a teenager in Worcester, 3707  Massachusetts disabled part of the public switched telephone network using a dial-up modem 3708  connected to the system. This knocked out phone service at the control tower, airport 3709  security, the airport fire department, the weather service, and carriers that use the airport. 3710  Also, the tower’s main radio transmitter and another transmitter that activates runway lights 3711  were shut down, as well as a printer that controllers use to monitor flight progress. The attack 3712  also knocked out phone service to 600 homes and businesses in the nearby town of Rutland.  3713   [M][D] Maroochy Shire Sewage Spill.11 In the spring of 2000, a former employee of an 3714  Australian organization that develops manufacturing software applied for a job with the local 3715  government but was rejected. Over a two-month period, the disgruntled rejected employee 3716  reportedly used a radio transmitter on as many as 46 occasions to remotely break into the 3717  controls of a sewage treatment system. He altered electronic data for particular sewerage 3718  pumping stations and caused malfunctions in their operations, ultimately releasing about 3719  264,000 gallons of raw sewage into nearby rivers and parks. 3720  9  Additional information on the Marconi Wireless Hack incident can be found at: https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1505628.  10  Additional information on the Worcester Air Traffic Communications incident can be found at:  http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9803/18/juvenile.hacker/index.html  11  Additional information on the Maroochy Shire Sewage Spill incident can be found at  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/10/31/hacker_jailed_for_revenge_sewage/.  https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1505628 http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9803/18/juvenile.hacker/index.html http://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/10/31/hacker_jailed_for_revenge_sewage/  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  175   [M][I] Night Dragon.12 McAfee reported a series of attacks designed to steal sensitive data 3721  from the global oil, energy, and petrochemical industries. Adversaries exfiltrated proprietary 3722  operations data and project financing information with regard to oil and gas field bids and 3723  operations. 3724   [M][D] Iranian Centrifuge, Stuxnet.13 Stuxnet was a Microsoft Windows computer worm 3725  discovered in July 2010 that specifically targeted industrial software and equipment. The 3726  worm initially spread indiscriminately, but included a highly specialized malware payload 3727  that was designed to only target particular SCADA systems that were configured to control 3728  and monitor specific industrial processes. 3729   [M][D] German Steel Mill Attack.14 In 2014, hackers manipulated and disrupted control 3730  systems to such a degree that a blast furnace could not be properly shut down, resulting in 3731  “massive”—though unspecified—damage. 3732   [M][I] Shamoon.15 In 2012 Saudi Aramco experienced a malware attack that targeted their 3733  refineries and overwrote the attacked systems’ Master Boot Records (MBRs), partition 3734  tables, and other data files. This caused the systems to become unusable. 3735   [M][D] New York Dam.16 In 2013, an Iranian computer security company obtained remote 3736  access to a computer which controlled the SCADA system for the Bowman Dam located in 3737  Rye, New York. The adversary was able to view water levels, temperature, and status of the 3738  sluice gate. The sluice gate control was disconnected for maintenance at the time of 3739  adversarial remote access, so the dam could not be remotely controlled. 3740   [M][D] Dragonfly Campaign, Havex.17 The energy sector was targeted during a multi-year 3741  cyber-espionage campaign using primarily Havex malware. Havex is a remote access trojan 3742  that uses the Open Platform Communications (OPC) standard to gather information about 3743  connected ICS devices on a network. The campaigns were exploratory. 3744   [M][D] Ukrainian Power Grid, BlackEnergy3.18 On December 23, 2015, Ukrainian power 3745  companies experienced a cyberattack causing power outages which impacted over 225,000 3746  customers in Ukraine. Over 50 regional substations experienced malicious remote operation 3747  of their breakers. KillDisk malware was used to erase files on target systems, including at 3748  least one Windows-based HMI. The actors also corrupted the firmware of Serial-to-Ethernet 3749  devices at the substations. This was the first-known cyber attack on a power grid. 3750  12  Additional information on Night Dragon was published as a McAfee white paper at: https://www.heartland.org/_template-  assets/documents/publications/29423.pdf.  13  Additional information on the Stuxnet worm can be found at: https://www.wired.com/2014/11/countdown-to-zero-day-  stuxnet/.  14  Additional information on the German steel mill incident can be found at: http://www.wired.com/2015/01/german-steel-  mill-hack-destruction/.  15  Additional information on Shamoon can be found at https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/monitors/ICS-MM201209.  16  The US Department of Justice indictment for the New York Dam attacks can be found at:  https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/834996/download.  17  Additional information on the Dragonfly / Energetic Bear Campaign can be found at:  https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1505628.  18  Additional information about the first Ukrainian Power Grid attack can be found at:  https://info.publicintelligence.net/NCCIC-UkrainianPowerAttack.pdf.  https://www.heartland.org/_template-assets/documents/publications/29423.pdf https://www.heartland.org/_template-assets/documents/publications/29423.pdf https://www.wired.com/2014/11/countdown-to-zero-day-stuxnet/ https://www.wired.com/2014/11/countdown-to-zero-day-stuxnet/ http://www.wired.com/2015/01/german-steel-mill-hack-destruction/ http://www.wired.com/2015/01/german-steel-mill-hack-destruction/ https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/monitors/ICS-MM201209 https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/834996/download https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1505628 https://info.publicintelligence.net/NCCIC-UkrainianPowerAttack.pdf  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  176   [M][D] Ukrainian Power Grid, Industroyer.19 On December 17, 2016, a cyber attack 3751  occurred at a substation outside of Kiev. The impact was an outage for customers of one 3752  substation for approximately one hour. This attack is the first-known malware specifically 3753  designed to attack the power grid. 3754   [M][I] Maersk, NotPetya. In 2017, the NotPetya malware encrypted computers globally 3755  with no method for decryption. Although the malware initially targeted Ukrainian 3756  companies, it spread throughout the world with significant impact to Maersk, FedEx, Merck, 3757  and Saint-Gobain. Malware destroyed data and disrupted shipping operations for Maersk, 3758  costing the company over $300 million on repair and recovery. 3759   [M][D] Saudi Petrochem, TRITON.20 A petrochemical facility in Saudi Arabia was 3760  attacked using malicious software targeted at the industrial SIS. The SIS initiated a safe 3761  shutdown of the petrochemical process in 2017 when the triple-redundant processors 3762  identified mismatched code amongst the processors. 3763   [M][I] Norsk Hydro, LockerGoga.21 In March 2019, Norsk Hydro experienced a 3764  cyberattack which used LockerGoga ransomware to encrypt its computer files. The 3765  aluminum and renewable energy company transitioned to manual operations and was 3766  transparent with the public on its progress to recovery. Norsk Hydro’s transparency 3767  throughout the discovery and recovery process is well regarded by the security industry. 3768   [M][D] Honda, EKANS. EKANS is ransomware that impacted operations at Honda 3769  automotive US production facilities in June 2020. EKANS has a hard-coded kill-list of 3770  processes, including some associated with common ICS software platforms (e.g., GE Proficy 3771  historian, Honeywell HMIWeb).  3772   [M][D] Oldsmar Water Treatment Facility.22 In February 2021, hackers gained access to 3773  the City of Oldsmar’s water treatment control system using TeamViewer, which was 3774  accessible via the internet. Dosing set points were modified, which temporarily increased the 3775  amount of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) being added to the water. The water treatment operator 3776  observed the hacker moving the mouse on the operating screen and was able to restore 3777  normal operations. 3778   [M][I] Colonial Pipeline.23 In May 2021, over 5500 miles of pipeline transporting more than 3779  100 million gallons per day of refined products to the east coast of the U.S. shutdown 3780  operations because of a ransomware attack.

Colonial Pipeline also 3785  decided to pay the ransom to cybercriminal group Darkside in order to have all possible 3786  tools, including the decryption tools, available to bring the pipeline system back online. The 3787  U.S. government was able to recover some of the ransom payment.24 3788   [M][I] Ransomware Targeting Healthcare.25 A string of malware delivered via phishing 3789  attacks targeted the healthcare and public health sectors. The malware was used by 3790  adversaries to conduct ransomware attacks, disrupt services, and steal data. In fall 2020, 3791  CISA Alert (AA20-302A) was issued to warn healthcare and public health sector companies 3792  of the prevalence of these attacks. 3793  C.3.2 Structural Events 3794   [N][D] Bellingham, Washington Gasoline Pipeline Failure.26 In June 1999, 900,000 liters 3795  (237,000 gallons) of gasoline leaked from a 40.64 cm (16 inch) pipeline and ignited 1.5 hours 3796  later, causing three deaths, eight injuries, and extensive property damage. The pipeline failure 3797  was exacerbated by control systems not able to perform control and monitoring functions. 3798  “Immediately prior to and during the incident, the SCADA system exhibited poor 3799  performance that inhibited the pipeline controllers from seeing and reacting to the 3800  development of an abnormal pipeline operation.” A key recommendation from the NTSB 3801  report issued October 2002 was to utilize an off-line development and testing system for 3802  implementing and testing changes to the SCADA database. 3803   [M][I] CSX Train Signaling System.27 In August 2003, the Sobig computer virus was 3804  blamed for shutting down train signaling systems throughout the east coast of the U.S. The 3805  virus infected the computer system at CSX Corp.’s Jacksonville, Florida headquarters, 3806  shutting down signaling, dispatching, and other systems. According to Amtrak spokesman 3807  Dan Stessel, ten Amtrak trains were affected in the morning. Trains between Pittsburgh and 3808  Florence, South Carolina were halted because of dark signals, and one regional Amtrak train 3809  from Richmond, Virginia to Washington and New York was delayed for more than two 3810  hours. Long-distance trains were also delayed between four and six hours. 3811   [N][D] Browns Ferry-3 PLC Failure.28 In August 2006, TVA was forced to manually shut 3812  down one of their plant’s two reactors after unresponsive PLCs problems caused two water 3813  pumps to fail and threatened the stability of the plant itself. Although there were dual 3814  redundant PLCs, they were connected to the same Ethernet network. Later testing on the 3815  24  Department of Justice Seizes $2.3 Million in Cryptocurrency Paid to Ransomware Extortionists Darkside. 7 June 2021.  https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-seizes-23-million-cryptocurrency-paid-ransomware-extortionists- darkside  25  Additional information on the series of malware targeting Healthcare can be found at Ransomware Activity Targeting the  Healthcare and Public Health Sector | CISA.  26  Additional information on the Bellingham, Washington Gasoline Pipeline Failure incident can be found at  http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/PAR0202.pdf.  27  Additional information on the CSX Train Signaling System incident can be found at:  http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=13100807.  28  Additional information on the Browns Ferry -3 PLC Failure incident can be found at:  http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/gen-comm/info-notices/2007/in200715.pdf.  https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-seizes-23-million-cryptocurrency-paid-ransomware-extortionists-darkside https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-seizes-23-million-cryptocurrency-paid-ransomware-extortionists-darkside https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-302a https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-302a http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/PAR0202.pdf http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=13100807 http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/gen-comm/info-notices/2007/in200715.pdf  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  178  failed devices discovered that they would crash when they encountered excessive network 3816  traffic. 3817  C.3.3 Environmental Events  3818   [N][I] Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster.29 The Great East Japan Earthquake on March 3819  11, 2011 struck off the coast of Japan, sending a massive tsunami inland towards the nuclear 3820  plant. The tsunami compromised the plant’s seawall, flooding much of the plant, including 3821  the location housing the emergency generators. This emergency power was critical for 3822  operating the control rooms and providing coolant water for the reactors. The loss of coolant 3823  caused the reactor cores to overheat to the point where the fuel’s zirconium cladding reacted 3824  with water, releasing hydrogen gas and fueling large explosions in three of the four reactor 3825  buildings. This resulted in large-scale radiation leakage that has impacted plant employees, 3826  nearby citizens, and the local environment. Post-event analysis found that the plant’s 3827  emergency response center had insufficient secure communication lines to provide other 3828  areas of the plant with information on key safety-related instrumentation.  3829  C.3.4 Accidental Events 3830   [N][D] Vulnerability Scanner Incidents.30 While a ping sweep was being performed on an 3831  active SCADA network that controlled 3-meter (9-foot) robotic arms, one arm became active 3832  and swung around 180 degrees. The controller for the arm was in standby mode before the 3833  ping sweep was initiated. In a separate incident, a ping sweep was being performed on an 3834  ICS network to identify all hosts that were attached to the network, for inventory purposes, 3835  and it caused a system controlling the creation of integrated circuits in the fabrication plant to 3836  hang. This test resulted in the destruction of $50,000 worth of wafers. 3837   [N][D] Penetration Testing Incident.31 A natural gas utility hired an IT security consulting 3838  organization to conduct penetration testing on its corporate IT network. The consulting 3839  organization carelessly ventured into a part of the network that was directly connected to the 3840  SCADA system. The penetration test locked up the SCADA system and the utility was not 3841  able to send gas through its pipelines for four hours. The outcome was the loss of service to 3842  its customer base for those four hours.  3843   [N][I] NERC Enforcement Action.32 In 2019, a U.S. energy company was fined $10 3844  million by NERC for cybersecurity violations that took place between 2015 and 2018. The 3845  inability to comply with U.S. standards for cybersecurity was seen as a risk to the security 3846  and reliability of the overall power system. 3847  29  Additional information can be found at: http://www-  pub.iaea.org/MTCD/meetings/PDFplus/2011/cn200/documentation/cn200_Final-Fukushima-Mission_Report.pdf and  http://pbadupws.nrc.gov/docs/ML1414/ML14140A185.pdf.  30  Additional information on the vulnerability scanner incidents can be found at: https://energy.sandia.gov/wp- content/gallery/uploads/sand_2005_2846p.pdf.  31  Additional information on penetration testing incidents can be found at: https://energy.sandia.gov/wp- content/gallery/uploads/sand_2005_2846p.pdf.  32  For additional information about fines imposed on energy companies, see Enforcement Actions 2019 (nerc.com).  http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/meetings/PDFplus/2011/cn200/documentation/cn200_Final-Fukushima-Mission_Report.pdf http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/meetings/PDFplus/2011/cn200/documentation/cn200_Final-Fukushima-Mission_Report.pdf http://pbadupws.nrc.gov/docs/ML1414/ML14140A185.pdf https://energy.sandia.gov/wp-content/gallery/uploads/sand_2005_2846p.pdf https://energy.sandia.gov/wp-content/gallery/uploads/sand_2005_2846p.pdf https://energy.sandia.gov/wp-content/gallery/uploads/sand_2005_2846p.pdf https://energy.sandia.gov/wp-content/gallery/uploads/sand_2005_2846p.pdf https://www.nerc.com/pa/comp/CE/Pages/Actions_2019/Enforcement-Actions-2019.aspx  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  179   [N][D] NASA Fire.33 A security patch was applied to an OT component that controlled a 3848  large engineering oven. The patch and associated reboot caused the oven to stop running, 3849  which led to a fire that destroyed the spacecraft hardware. The reboot also impeded alarm 3850  activation, which allowed the fire to go undetected for 3.5 hours before discovery.  3851  3852  33  For additional information on accidental OT losses from applying IT security controls in NASA, see Final Report - IG-17-  011 (nasa.gov).  https://oig.nasa.gov/docs/IG-17-011.pdf https://oig.nasa.gov/docs/IG-17-011.pdf  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  180  Appendix D—OT Security Organizations, Research, and Activities 3853  This appendix contains abstracts of some of the many activities that are addressing OT 3854  cybersecurity.

It directed NIST to work 4382  with stakeholders to develop a voluntary framework—based on existing standards, guidelines, 4383  and practices—for reducing cyber risks to critical infrastructure.  4384  NIST released the first version of the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure 4385  Cybersecurity on February 12, 2014. The Framework, created through collaboration between 4386  industry and government, consists of standards, guidelines, and practices to promote the 4387  protection of critical infrastructure. The prioritized, flexible, repeatable, and cost-effective 4388  approach of the Framework helps owners and operators of critical infrastructure to manage 4389  cybersecurity-related risk. 4390  In April of 2018, NIST published Version 1.1 of the Framework for Improving Critical 4391  Infrastructure Cybersecurity. Edits were driven by dialog with over 1,200 participants at the 4392  2016 and 2017 annual framework workshops in addition to over 200 written comments regarding 4393  draft publications. Both versions can be found at the link below. 4394  https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/framework 4395  D.3.7 SANS ICS Security Courses 4396  SANS offers several courses that provide hands-on training focused on the cybersecurity of OT 4397  environments.

The conference initially was founded for 4490  a need to showcase advanced and highly technical content to the ICS audience. S4 has since 4491  grown to also accommodate other ICS security content but remains a premier venue to present 4492  technical findings within OT security.  4493  https://s4xevents.com/ 4494  D.5.2 Industrial Control Systems Joint Working Group (ICSJWG) 4495  CISA hosts a bi-annual working group which provides a vehicle for communicating and 4496  partnering across all Critical Infrastructure (CI) Sectors between federal agencies and 4497  departments, as well as private asset owners/operators of industrial control systems. The goal of 4498  the ICSJWG is to continue and enhance the collaborative efforts of the industrial control systems 4499  stakeholder community in securing CI by accelerating the design, development, and deployment 4500  of secure industrial control systems. 4501  https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/Industrial-Control-Systems-Joint-Working-Group-ICSJWG  4502  D.5.3 IFIP Working Group 11.10 on Critical Infrastructure Protection 4503  An active international community of scientists, engineers and practitioners dedicated to 4504  advancing the state-of-the-art of research and practice in the emerging field of critical 4505  infrastructure protection. 4506  http://ifip1110.org/Conferences/ 4507  https://www.tsa.gov/for-industry https://www.aar.org/ https://www.epa.gov/ https://www.awwa.org/ https://www.amwa.net/ https://www.nawc.org/ https://s4xevents.com/ https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/Industrial-Control-Systems-Joint-Working-Group-ICSJWG http://ifip1110.org/Conferences/  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  200  D.5.4 SecurityWeek’s ICS Cyber Security Conference 4508  Since 2002, SecurityWeek has held an annual conference focused on cybersecurity for the 4509  industrial control systems sector. An event where ICS users, ICS vendors, system security 4510  providers and government representatives meet to discuss the latest cyber-incidents, analyze their 4511  causes, and cooperate on solutions. 4512  https://www.icscybersecurityconference.com/ 4513  D.5.5 Stockholm International Summit on Cyber Security in SCADA and ICS 4514  (CS3STHLM) 4515  Organized beginning in 2014, CS3STHLM has quickly become the premier ICS Security 4516  Summit in Northern Europe. CS3STHLM is a summit that offers generous time for lectures, 4517  networking, and knowledge sharing in regard to today’s ICS security challenges. 4518  https://cs3sthlm.se/ 4519  https://www.icscybersecurityconference.com/ https://cs3sthlm.se/  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  201  Appendix E—OT Security Capabilities and Tools 4520  This appendix provides an overview of key security technologies that are available to or being 4521  developed to support the OT community. There are several security products that are marketed 4522  specifically for OT, while others are general IT security products that are also applicable to OT. 4523  Many cybersecurity products are marketed today as a single platform that combines many of the 4524  capabilities and tools listed here. Each organization should make a risk-based determination on 4525  whether to employ the security technologies and tools mentioned in this appendix. 4526  E.1 Network Segmentation and Isolation 4527  Network segmentation and separation technologies allow OT network owners to implement 4528  cybersecurity strategies that isolate devices and network traffic by both physical and logical 4529  means. Popular tooling for this capability area is described below. 4530  E.1.1 Firewalls 4531  Firewalls can be used to logically enforce user-defined rule sets on network traffic. Commonly 4532  placed at network boundaries, firewalls can limit both incoming and outgoing traffic based on a 4533  variety of data characteristics.  4534  There are several types of general IT firewalls. Basic packet filtering firewalls directly inspect 4535  current network traffic at OSI layers 3 and 4 to inform decisions on whether to drop or forward 4536  packets to their destination. Conversely, stateful inspection firewalls draw upon memory of both 4537  past and present network connections when making filtering decisions, thereby offering more 4538  capability at an increased computational cost. Next generation firewalls (NGFWs) expand upon 4539  stateful inspection firewalls by adding features such as application filtering, deep packet 4540  inspection, VPN traffic awareness, adaptive rules, and threat detection.  4541  Several vendors also offer OT-specific firewalls. The OT-specific implementations are often 4542  preferred over their generic IT counterparts due to their unique feature sets specific to OT 4543  networks. For example, they often provide built-in parsers for common OT protocols such as 4544  DNP3, CIP, and Modbus, allowing for deep packet inspection of OT traffic. 4545  E.1.2 Unidirectional Gateways 4546  Unidirectional gateways, also referred to as data diodes, are designed to only allow data 4547  transmission in a single direction. Unlike a firewall, data diodes cannot be programmed to allow 4548  data to flow in both directions; the hardware is incapable. A common use case is placing a data 4549  diode at the boundary between the operational network and the enterprise network. The data 4550  diode would allow network traffic to leave the operational network, but not enter, preventing a 4551  potential avenue of cyber attack. 4552  E.1.3 Virtual Local Area Networks (VLAN)  4553  A VLAN can be used to logically separate areas within a network when physical separation may 4554  not be feasible due to cost or other prohibitive measures. VLANs are implemented on modern 4555  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  202  network switching equipment that logically separates network traffic based on switch port. For 4556  example, an 8-port switch can be configured to separate traffic into two VLANs. One VLAN 4557  would be provided for ports 1-4, while another would be provided for ports 5-8. While all 8 ports 4558  are physically connected to a single device, each port is only logically connected to the other 4559  ports within its VLAN. 4560  E.1.4 Software-Defined Networking (SDN) 4561  Traditional networking switches are responsible for both forwarding packets (data plane) and 4562  running the distributed algorithms that determine routing (control plane). SDN is a technology 4563  that evolves this concept by keeping the data plane at the switch and moving the control plane to 4564  a centralized controller. The centralized controller acts as an abstraction layer for network 4565  programmability, eliminating the need to individually manage each switch within the network. 4566  SDN allows for easy dynamic reconfiguration of the data plane, which can allow for quick 4567  isolation of devices or redirection and duplication of traffic for monitoring and data capture. 4568  Utilizing SDN technology within an OT environment allows asset owners greater flexibility 4569  when initially designing their network architectures and when updating them in the future.  4570  E.2 Network Monitoring/Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) 4571  Network monitoring technologies allow OT network owners to maintain situational awareness of 4572  their controlled processes and support cybersecurity objectives such as event or anomaly 4573  detection. OT vendors often market their network monitoring technology as capable of 4574  integration with SIEM technologies. These systems collect data through log aggregation and 4575  network scanning tools, detect threats through analytics, and can provide automated incident 4576  response. Capabilities continue to be added, including use of machine learning and artificial 4577  intelligence to improve detection and reduce unnecessary alerts. OT owners must exercise 4578  caution when implementing these technologies as they can directly impact the availability of the 4579  controlled process. 4580  E.2.1 Centralized Logging 4581  System and network logs from all sources in an environment are the foundation of SIEM. Logs 4582  act as the primary historical artifact for incident response. When aggregated at a central location, 4583  logs can be analyzed together to provide a holistic view of the network state. A SIEM will utilize 4584  a variety of sensors strategically placed within a target network to collect logs from endpoints, as 4585  well as network traffic information, which is then stored in a database for real-time analysis. 4586  Specific to OT networks, data historians can serve as a supplemental source of event data 4587  providing greater context surrounding a cyber incident. 4588  E.2.2 Passive Scanning 4589  Passive network scans are a form of network discovery that inspects existing network traffic by 4590  watching traffic passing through network switches or other dedicated network capture devices. 4591  Systems that implement passive network scans do not introduce any additional traffic to the 4592  network, which is ideal for sensitive devices found on OT networks that may exhibit unexpected 4593  behavior when directly probed. Passive scanning can identify all devices actively communicating 4594  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  203  on network segments being monitored. Through inspection of network data, passive scanning 4595  can identify significant amounts of information about devices, potentially including, but not 4596  limited to, manufacturer, part number, and firmware version. Passive scanning cannot identify 4597  devices that are not actively communicating, nor can it inspect encrypted traffic (without special 4598  provisioning). Additionally, a passive scan will often take days to complete due to its 4599  dependence on existing network traffic. 4600  E.2.3 Active Scanning 4601  Active network scans are a form of network discovery that directly probe the network for 4602  attached devices. Systems employing active scanning introduce traffic to the network and will 4603  directly interact with the devices within the scan’s scope. OT network owners should exercise 4604  extreme caution when permitting active scanning on an operational network due to device 4605  sensitivity on the target network.  4606  Some OT-specific scanning devices combine passive and active scanning to enable a safer 4607  version of active scanning. Safe active scanning first learns about connected equipment through 4608  passive means and then uses device-specific communication to actively gain additional 4609  information about connected equipment without risks to OT operations.  4610  E.2.4 Malware Detection 4611  Endpoint malware detection can be bolstered with antivirus software. Antivirus software 4612  monitors activity on the host device and will alert the user to possible malicious activities. Older 4613  detection techniques rely on file signatures to detect known threats. Over time, malware 4614  developers have found ways to bypass this mechanism such as with polymorphic code. Modern 4615  antivirus software uses behavioral analysis of running processes and advanced file analysis to 4616  detect potentially malicious activity.  4617  Host-based malware detection with antivirus software may not be advisable for some OT 4618  endpoints due to OS incompatibility, software incompatibility, or runtime requirements. 4619  However, network-based malware detection can still be utilized. Unlike host-based antivirus 4620  software, network-based malware detection runs on an independent system that aggregates and 4621  inspects network traffic for anomalies. Network-based malware detection offers similar 4622  capabilities to host-based detection without the computational overhead being placed on the 4623  defended component. Network-based detection is a primary component of SIEM packages. 4624  E.2.5 Behavioral Anomaly Detection 4625  Behavioral anomaly detection (BAD) systems compare the current state of an environment with 4626  a baseline to detect abnormal activity. This baseline is used to detect anomalous events to be 4627  investigated further. This could be unusual network traffic such as large amounts of data 4628  transferred, new ports/protocols, or new connections between devices. Unusual activity on an 4629  endpoint may include excessive processor usage, logins outside of work hours, or new processes. 4630  The detectable events are dependent on the sensor capabilities of the specific implementation. 4631  Some BAD systems utilize artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to 4632  automatically update the baseline model. By automating the process of updating the baseline, the 4633  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  204  BAD system is able to maintain knowledge of normal activity even as the environment evolves 4634  over time. This ultimately reduces false positive detections, improving incident response 4635  capability. 4636  E.2.6 Data Loss Prevention (DLP) 4637  DLP is a collection of tools built to improve the confidentiality of sensitive data on a network. 4638  DLP is often marketed as a feature set within SIEM that actively monitors both data at rest to 4639  prevent unauthorized access and data in transit to prevent unauthorized extraction. In cases 4640  where DLP is unable to prevent the data loss, it can still alert the organization to a breach. 4641  E.2.7 Deception Technology 4642  A deception technology uses decoy data and/or devices placed across the network to lure 4643  attackers away from legitimate assets. Decoys can range from access credentials and files to 4644  complete endpoints. When a threat actor interacts with a decoy, it triggers an alarm to alert cyber 4645  defenders to its presence. Defenders can then choose to further monitor the adversary for 4646  intelligence or immediately mitigate the threat. Because decoys do not actively interact with 4647  other network components, deception technologies can support malicious activity monitoring 4648  and detection without jeopardizing the controlled process.  4649  E.2.8 Digital Twins 4650  A digital twin is a digital replica of a physical system or component. They can be deployed 4651  within OT environments as a tool for anomaly detection. The digital twin utilizes real-time 4652  sensor inputs and compares them using heuristics and algorithms (including machine learning) 4653  against a baseline model. Operational anomalies detected by digital twins most often indicate a 4654  maintenance or failure situation. However, a detected operational anomaly could indicate an 4655  advanced cyber attack which has bypassed other security mechanisms and otherwise would have 4656  gone undetected. 4657  E.3 Data Security 4658  Various data security technologies assist information owners in protecting the confidentiality, 4659  integrity, and availability of their data. OT network owners are encouraged to identify the critical 4660  files and data residing in their networks and implement data security technologies to mitigate 4661  risk.  4662  E.3.1 Backup Storage 4663  Backup storage is an alternative file storage location where copies of critical files are stored and 4664  protected to assist with recovery should the originals be lost, compromised, or unusable. Using 4665  backup tools and procedures is fundamental to ensuring the availability of critical data within an 4666  OT network environment. Based on risk, backup plans should specify which files require 4667  backup, how often they should be backed up, the number of copies to be made, the location of 4668  the backup (e.g., offline, offsite) and how long backup copies should be kept. Various solutions 4669  exist that automate backup storage of critical data on a regular basis. 4670  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  205  E.3.2 Immutable Storage 4671  Immutable storage is a special type of backup storage that provides additional data integrity 4672  through data storage in a read-only format. Immutable storage can be used to store backups of 4673  programs or device configurations. It can also be used as a read-only drive in a maintenance 4674  workstation for added protection against installation of new software. 4675  E.3.3 File Hashing 4676  Integrity of critical files such as program logic can be validated by using hashes. A hashing 4677  algorithm calculates a fixed-size string from a file’s contents. If a hash is calculated and stored 4678  for a critical file when it is first created, the integrity of the file can be checked later by 4679  calculating the hash again. For example, if an end user needs to restore functionality to a device 4680  by returning it to a baseline, the integrity of the baseline files can first be validated by 4681  recomputing the file hash. If a different hash is calculated for a target file, the data owner can 4682  assume the backup files have been compromised. Many data backup software systems include 4683  hashing within their feature set. NIST-approved hash algorithms are specified in FIPS 180-4, 4684  Secure Hash Standard [FIPS180] and FIPS 202, SHA-3 Standard [FIPS202]. 4685  E.3.4 Digital Signatures 4686  Digital signatures are an additional data integrity measure. They are the electronic analogue of a 4687  written signature providing assurance that the claimed signatory signed the information, and that 4688  the information was not modified following signature. FIPS 186-4, Digital Signature Standard 4689  (DSS) [FIPS186] specifies three NIST-approved digital signature algorithms: DSA, RSA, and 4690  ECDSA. 4691  E.3.5 Block Ciphers 4692  Asset owners can protect the confidentiality of data at rest using block ciphers. Block ciphers are 4693  algorithms that encrypt data in block-sized chunks rather than one bit at a time. This is beneficial 4694  when encrypting large amounts of data at once. NIST-approved block ciphers are Advanced 4695  Encryption Standard (AES) and Triple Data Encryption Standard (DES). AES is specified in 4696  FIPS 197, Advanced Encryption Standard [FIPS197]. Triple DES is specified in NIST SP 800-4697  67 Rev. 2, Recommendation for the Triple Data Encryption Algorithm Block Cipher [SP800-67]. 4698  E.3.6 Remote Access 4699  When accessing systems or data remotely, security controls should be implemented to prevent 4700  unauthorized access to the organization’s networks, systems, and data. A virtual private network 4701  (VPN) is a set of technologies and protocols designed to support secure remote access to network 4702  environments. A VPN can provide both strong authentication and encryption to secure 4703  communication data by establishing a private network that operates as an overlay on a public 4704  infrastructure. The most common types of VPN technologies implemented today are: 4705   Internet Protocol Security (IPsec). IPsec supports two encryption modes: transport and 4706  tunnel. Transport mode encrypts only the data portion (payload) of each packet while 4707  leaving the packet header untouched. The more secure tunnel mode adds a new header to 4708  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  206  each packet and encrypts both the original header and the payload. On the receiving side, 4709  an IPsec-compliant device decrypts each packet. See NIST SP 800-77 Rev. 1, Guide to 4710  IPsec VPNs for more information. 4711   Transport Layer Security (TLS). Sometimes referred to by the legacy terminology of 4712  Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), TLS provides a secure channel between two machines that 4713  encrypts the contents of each packet. TLS is most often recognized for securing HTTP 4714  traffic; this protocol implementation is known as HTTP Secure (HTTPS). However, TLS 4715  is not limited to HTTP traffic; it can be used to secure many application-layer programs. 4716  For more information, see NIST SP 800-52 Rev. 2, Guidelines for the Selection, 4717  Configuration, and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) Implementations. 4718   Secure Shell (SSH). SSH is a command interface and protocol for securely gaining 4719  access to a remote computer. It is widely used by network administrators to remotely 4720  control Linux-based servers. SSH is a secure alternative to a telnet application. SSH is 4721  included in most UNIX distributions and is typically added to other platforms through a 4722  third-party package. 4723  When implemented with diligence, remote access technologies can improve an organization’s 4724  capability. There are several options for remote access and desktop control including Remote 4725  Desktop Protocol (RDP), screens, and other standalone packages. If remote technologies are not 4726  managed properly using vulnerability and patch management, these connections serve as another 4727  channel for an adversary to exploit. 4728  4729  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-77r1 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-77r1 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-52r2 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-52r2  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  207  Appendix F—OT Overlay 4730  Note to Readers 4731  The OT overlay is a partial tailoring of the controls and control baselines in SP 800-53 Rev. 5 4732  and adds supplementary guidance specific to OT. The concept of overlays is discussed in 4733  Appendix C of SP 800-53B. The OT overlay is intended to be applicable to all OT systems in all 4734  industrial sectors. Further tailoring can be performed to add specificity to a particular sector (e.g., 4735  pipeline, energy). Ultimately, an overlay may be produced for a specific system (e.g., the XYZ 4736  company).  4737  This OT overlay constitutes supplemental guidance and tailoring for SP 800-53 Revision 5. 4738  Please be sure you are looking at the correct version of SP 800-53. Duplicating Appendix F of 4739  SP 800-53 would increase the size of this publication significantly. Therefore, the drafting 4740  committee has decided to not duplicate Appendix F here. The reader should have SP 800-53 4741  Revision 5 available.  4742  The authoring team also considered that this OT overlay may serve as a model for other 4743  overlays. Feedback on this Appendix’s structure would be appreciated, especially on the level of 4744  abstraction and whether the examples provided in the supplemental guidance are 4745  sufficient/beneficial for implementation. 4746  Overlays provide a structured approach to help organizations tailor control baselines and develop 4747  specialized security plans that can be applied to specific mission/business functions, 4748  environments of operation, and/or technologies. This specialization approach is important as the 4749  number of threat-driven controls and control enhancements in the catalog increases and 4750  organizations develop risk management strategies to address their specific protection needs 4751  within defined risk tolerances. 4752  A repository of overlays may be found at https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/risk-management/sp800-4753  53-controls/overlay-repository. This overlay may be referenced as the NIST SP 800-82 Revision 4754  3 Operational Technology Overlay (“NIST SP 800-82 Rev 3 OT Overlay”). It is based on NIST 4755  SP 800-53 Revision 5 [SP800-53r5]. 4756  NIST developed this overlay in furtherance of its statutory responsibilities under the Federal 4757  Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014 (Public Law 113-283) [FISMA], 4758  Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD-21) [PPD-21], and Executive Order 13636 [EO13636]. 4759  NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, 4760  for providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets, but such 4761  standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems without the express 4762  approval of appropriate federal officials exercising policy authority over such systems. 4763  F.1 Overlay Characteristics 4764  OT encompasses a broad range of programmable systems and devices that interact with the 4765  physical environment (or manage devices that interact with the physical environment). These 4766  systems/devices detect or cause a direct change through the monitoring and/or control of devices, 4767  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/risk-management/sp800-53-controls/overlay-repository https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/risk-management/sp800-53-controls/overlay-repository  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  208  processes, and events. Examples include industrial control systems, building automation systems, 4768  transportation systems, physical access control systems, physical environment monitoring 4769  systems, and physical environment measurement systems. 4770  ICS consists of combinations of control components (e.g., electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, 4771  pneumatic) that act together to achieve an objective (e.g., manufacturing, transportation of matter 4772  or energy). The part of the system primarily concerned with producing an output is referred to as 4773  the process. The control part of the system includes the specification of the desired output or 4774  performance. Control can be fully automated or may include a human in the loop. 4775  Section 2 provides an overview of various OT systems such as Supervisory Control and Data 4776  Acquisition (SCADA), Distributed Control Systems (DCS), Programmable Logic Controllers 4777  (PLCs), Building Automation Systems (BAS), Physical Access Control Systems (PACS), and 4778  the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). 4779  F.2 Applicability 4780  The purpose of this overlay is to provide guidance for securing OT systems. This overlay has 4781  been prepared for use by federal agencies. It may be used by nongovernmental organizations on 4782  a voluntary basis. 4783  Privacy is a risk consideration for OT systems. For additional guidance, refer to the NIST 4784  Privacy Framework [PF]. The application of privacy in OT will depend on sector and 4785  organizational risks; therefore, controls exclusively related to privacy have not been included in 4786  this OT overlay. Each organization will need to independently determine applicability. All 4787  controls and control enhancements that only appear in the privacy baseline have been removed 4788  from this OT overlay according to this rationale. 4789  F.3 Overlay Summary 4790  Table 22 provides a summary of the controls and control enhancements from NIST SP 800-53 4791  Rev. 5, Appendix F [SP800-53r5] that have been allocated to the initial control baselines (i.e., 4792  Low, Moderate, and High) along with indications of OT Discussion and OT tailoring. The table 4793  uses the following conventions: 4794   Bold indicates controls and control enhancements with OT Discussions. 4795   Underline indicates that this overlay has added a control to the baseline, supplemental to 4796  the baselines provided in NIST SP 800-53B. 4797   Strikethrough indicates that a control or control enhancement has been removed from this 4798  baseline, compared to the baselines provided in NIST SP 800-53B. 4799  In the following example, OT Discussion was added to Control Enhancement 1 of AU-4 4800  (bolded). In addition, Control Enhancement 1 of AU-4 was added to the Low, Moderate (Mod), 4801  and High baselines (underlined), compared with the NIST 800-53B baseline which did not 4802  include AU-4 Control Enhancement 1. 4803  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  209  AU-4 Audit Storage Capacity AU-4 (1) AU-4 (1) AU-4 (1)  4804  Some controls and control enhancements are useful to many OT environments but are not 4805  applicable across all OT sectors or architectures. Such controls may have additional OT 4806  discussion. These will appear in the individual control tables. Controls and control enhancements 4807  without baselines are not included in Table 22. 4808  Table 22: Control Baselines 4809  CNTL  NO.

Additionally, OT systems vary widely in 4814  their architecture and technology selection. The SP 800-53B control baselines were tailored for 4815  these general considerations, including addition of controls relevant for OT environments. 4816  Organizations can use this overlay as a starting point and further tailor controls to meet specific 4817  operational needs to address variability of OT systems.  4818  As organizations further tailor controls to meet their internal security requirements, limitations 4819  (e.g., technology, operational constraints, environmental considerations) may necessitate 4820  selecting compensating controls. Compensating controls in the OT environment may be required 4821  in situations where the OT cannot support certain controls or control enhancements, or the 4822  organization determines it is not advisable to implement controls or control enhancements due to 4823  potential adverse impacts to performance, safety, or reliability. Compensating controls are 4824  alternatives to a specific baseline control or enhancement that provide equivalent or comparable 4825  protection. For example, if controls or control enhancements require automated mechanisms 4826  which are not readily available, cost effective, or technically feasible in OT environments, 4827  compensating controls implemented through nonautomated mechanisms or procedures may be 4828  acceptable to meet the intent of the control. 4829  Compensating controls implemented in accordance with PL-11 from SP 800-53 Rev. 5 are not 4830  considered exceptions or waivers to the baseline controls; rather, they are alternative safeguards 4831  and countermeasures employed within the OT environment that accomplish the intent of the 4832  original controls that could not be effectively employed. See “Control Tailoring” in Section 3.3 4833  of SP 800-37 Rev. 2 [SP800-37r2].  4834  Using compensating controls may also include control enhancements that supplement the 4835  baseline. Using compensating controls typically involves a trade-off between additional risk and 4836  reduced functionality. Every use of compensating controls should involve a risk-based 4837  determination of how much residual risk to accept and how much functionality to reduce. 4838  Additionally, when compensating controls are employed, organizations should document the 4839  rationale describing: 4840   why the baseline control could not be implemented;  4841   how the compensating control(s) provide equivalent security capabilities for OT systems; and 4842   the risk acceptance for any residual risk resulting from using the compensating control(s) 4843  instead of the baseline control. 4844  Organizational decisions on the use of compensating controls are documented in the security 4845  plan for the OT.  4846  Controls that contain assignments (e.g., Assignment: organization-defined conditions or trigger 4847  events) may be tailored out of the baseline. This is equivalent to assigning a value of “none.” The 4848  assignment may take on different values for different impact baselines. 4849  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  219  F.5 OT Communication Protocols 4850  The unique network properties within OT may warrant specific attention when applying certain 4851  controls. Many of the controls in NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 that pertain to communication, devices, 4852  and interfaces implicitly assume the applicability of network routing or communication between 4853  network segments or zones. Some devices, or subsystems, used in OT may be configured or 4854  architected in a way that may create an exception to this assumption. As a result, controls for 4855  devices that communicate using standards and protocols that do not include network addressing 4856  generally require tailoring. An RS-232 (serial) interface is an example of a non-network 4857  addressable or routable communication method that is commonly employed in OT equipment.  4858  F.6 Definitions 4859  Terms used in this overlay are defined in the CSRC glossary. 4860  F.7 Detailed Overlay Control Specifications 4861  This overlay is based on NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5, Security and Privacy Controls for Information 4862  Systems and Organizations [SP800-53r5], which provides a catalog of security and privacy 4863  controls, and NIST SP 800-53B, Control Baselines for Information Systems and Organizations 4864  [SP800-53B]. The controls are customizable and implemented as part of an organization-wide 4865  process that manages security and privacy risk. The controls address a diverse set of security and 4866  privacy requirements across the federal government and critical infrastructure, and are derived 4867  from legislation, Executive Orders, policies, directives, regulations, standards, and 4868  mission/business needs. The documents also describe how to develop specialized sets of 4869  controls, or overlays, tailored for specific types of missions/business functions, technologies, or 4870  environments of operation. Finally, the catalog controls address security from both a 4871  functionality perspective (the strength of security and privacy functions and mechanisms 4872  provided) and an assurance perspective (the measures of confidence in the implemented 4873  capability). Addressing both functionality and assurance helps to ensure that component products 4874  and the systems built from those products using sound system and security engineering 4875  principles are sufficiently trustworthy.  4876  In preparation for selecting and specifying the appropriate controls for organizational systems 4877  and their respective environments of operation, organizations first determine the criticality and 4878  sensitivity of the information to be processed, stored, or transmitted by those systems. This 4879  process is known as security categorization. FIPS 199 [FIPS199] enables federal agencies to 4880  establish security categories for both information and information systems. Other documents, 4881  such as those produced by ISA and CNSS, also provide guidance for defining low, moderate, and 4882  high levels of security based on impact. The security categories are based on the potential impact 4883  on an organization or on people (employees and/or the public) should certain events occur which 4884  jeopardize the information and systems needed by the organization to accomplish its assigned 4885  mission, such as protecting its assets, fulfilling its legal responsibilities, maintaining its day-to-4886  day functions, and protecting individuals’ safety, health, and life. Security categories are to be 4887  used in conjunction with vulnerability and threat information in assessing the risk to an 4888  organization.  4889  https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  220  This overlay provides OT Discussion for the controls and control enhancements prescribed for a 4890  system or an organization designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its 4891  data and to meet a set of defined security requirements. Discussions for all controls and control 4892  enhancements in SP 800-53 Rev. 5, Chapter 3 should be used in conjunction with the OT 4893  Discussions in this overlay. This overlay contains a tailoring of the control baselines; its 4894  specification may be more stringent or less stringent than the original control baseline 4895  specification. It can be applied to multiple systems. This overlay is high-level, applicable to all 4896  OT environments; it may be used as the basis for more specific overlays. Use cases for specific 4897  systems in specific environments may be separately published (e.g., as a NISTIR). 4898  Figure 22 uses the AU-4 control as an example of the format and content of the detailed overlay 4899  control specifications. 4900   Control number and title 4901   Column for control and control enhancement number 4902   Column for control and control enhancement name 4903   Columns for baselines.

Example compensating controls  include encapsulation. Policy for logical access control to non-addressable and non- routable system resources and the associated information is made explicit. Access control  mechanisms include hardware, firmware, and software that control the device or have  device access, such as device drivers and communications controllers. Physical access  control may serve as a compensating control for logical access control; however, it may  not provide sufficient granularity in situations where users require access to different  functions.  ➒ Control Enhancement: (11) OT Discussion: The organization identifies and restricts  access to information that could impact the OT environment, accounting for information  types that are sensitive, proprietary, contain trade secrets, or support safety functions.  ➓ Rationale for adding AC-3 (11) to HIGH baseline: The loss of availability, integrity,  and confidentiality of certain types of information residing on a high-impact OT system  may result in severe or catastrophic adverse effects on operations, assets, or individuals  that include severe degradation or loss of mission capability, major damage to  organizational assets, or result in harm to individuals involving loss of life or life- threatening injuries.  Figure 22: Detailed Overlay Control Specifications Illustrated 4915  F.7.1 ACCESS CONTROL – AC 4916  Tailoring Considerations for the Access Control Family 4917  Before implementing controls in the AC family, consider the tradeoffs among security, privacy, 4918  latency, performance, throughput, and reliability. For example, the organization considers 4919  whether latency induced from the use of confidentiality and integrity mechanisms employing 4920  cryptographic mechanisms would adversely impact the operational performance of the OT. 4921  In situations where the OT cannot support the specific Access Control requirements of a control, 4922  the organization employs compensating controls in accordance with the general tailoring 4923  guidance. Examples of compensating controls are given with each control, as appropriate. 4924  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  222  AC-1 ACCESS CONTROL POLICY AND PROCEDURES 4925  CNTL  NO.

Inspection of message content may enforce information 4966  flow policy. For example, industrial OT protocols may be restricted using inbound and outbound 4967  traffic rules on a network control device between OT and IT networks. For non-routable 4968  communication such as serial connections, devices may be configured to limit commands to and 4969  from specific tags within the OT device. Information flow policy may be supported by labeling 4970  or coloring physical connectors to aid in connecting networks.

Compensating controls 5029  could include limiting remote access to a specified period of time or placing a call from the OT 5030  site to the authenticated remote entity. 5031  Control Enhancement: (2) OT Discussion: Encryption-based technologies should be used to 5032  support the confidentiality and integrity of remote access sessions. While OT devices often lack 5033  the ability to support modern encryption, additional devices (e.g., VPNs) can be added to support 5034  these features. This control should not be confused with SC-8 – Transmission Confidentiality 5035  and Integrity, which discusses confidentiality and integrity requirements for general 5036  communications, including between OT devices. 5037  Control Enhancement: (3) OT Discussion: Example compensating controls include connection-5038  specific manual authentication of the remote entity. 5039  Control Enhancement: (4) (10) No OT Discussion for this control. 5040  Control Enhancement: (9) OT Discussion: Implementation of the remote access disconnect 5041  should not impact OT operations. OT personnel should be trained on how to use the remote 5042  access disconnect. 5043  Rationale for adding AC-17 (9) to LOW, MOD and HIGH baselines: As more OT systems 5044  become accessible remotely, the capability to disconnect or disable remote access is critical to 5045  manage risk. Disconnect of remote access may be required to provide stable and safe operations. 5046  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  228  Rationale for adding AC-17 (10) to MOD and HIGH baselines: The ability to authenticate remote 5047  commands is important to prevent unauthorized commands that may have immediate or serious 5048  consequences such as injury, death, property damage, loss of high-value assets, failure of 5049  mission or business functions, or compromise of sensitive information. 5050  AC-18 WIRELESS ACCESS 5051  CNTL  NO.

There are some scenarios where devices and users cannot all be 5056  authenticated and encrypted due to operational or technology constraints. In such scenarios, 5057  compensating controls include providing increased auditing for wireless access, limiting wireless 5058  access privileges to key personnel, or using AC-18 (5) to reduce the boundary of wireless access. 5059  Control Enhancement: (3) (4) No OT Discussion for this control. 5060  Control Enhancement: (5) Availability and interference for wireless signals may be a concern 5061  within OT environments.

An organization may 5069  consider a system to be external if that system performs different functions, implements different 5070  policies, falls under different management authorities, or does not provide sufficient visibility 5071  into the implementation of controls to allow the establishment of a satisfactory trust relationship. 5072  For example, an OT system and a business data processing system may be considered external to 5073  each other depending on the organization’s system boundaries.  5074  Access to an OT for support by a business partner, such as a vendor or support contractor, is 5075  another common example. The definition and trustworthiness of external systems is reexamined 5076  with respect to OT functions, purposes, technology, and limitations to establish a clearly 5077  documented technical or business case for use and an acceptance of the risk inherent in the use of 5078  an external system.  5079  Control Enhancement: (1) (2) No OT Discussion for this control.  5080  AC-21 INFORMATION SHARING 5081  CNTL  NO.

The individual/group designing and conducting 5207  the continuous monitoring for the OT systems implements monitoring consistent with the 5208  organizational information security policies and procedures, the OT security policies and 5209  procedures, and the specific health, safety, and environmental risks associated with a particular 5210  facility and/or process. Continuous monitoring can be automated or manual at a frequency 5211  sufficient to support risk-based decisions. For example, the organization may determine for 5212  lower-risk, isolated systems to monitor event logs manually on a specified frequency less often 5213  than for higher-risk, networked systems. 5214  Control Enhancement: (1) (4) No OT Discussion for this control. 5215  CA-8 PENETRATION TESTING  5216  CNTL  NO.  CONTROL NAME  Control Enhancement Name  CONTROL BASELINES  LOW MOD HIGH  CA-8 Penetration Testing  Select  CA-8 (1) PENETRATION TESTING | INDEPENDENT PENETRATION TESTING AGENT OR  TEAM  Remove  OT Discussion: Penetration testing is used with care on OT networks to ensure that OT functions 5217  are not adversely impacted by the testing process. In general, OT systems are highly sensitive to 5218  timing constraints and have limited resources. Example compensating controls include 5219  employing a replicated, virtualized, or simulated system to conduct penetration testing. 5220  Production OT may need to be taken off-line before testing can be conducted. If OT systems are 5221  taken off-line for testing, tests are scheduled to occur during planned OT outages whenever 5222  possible. If penetration testing is performed on non-OT networks, extra care is taken to ensure 5223  that tests do not propagate into the OT network. 5224  Rationale for removing CA-8 (1) from HIGH baseline: Specific expertise is necessary to conduct 5225  effective penetration testing on OT systems; it may not be feasible to identify independent 5226  personnel with the appropriate skillset/knowledge to perform penetration testing on an OT 5227  environment. While an independent penetration test agent/team is recommended, it may not be 5228  feasible for all high-impact OT systems. 5229  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  238  CA-9 INTERNAL SYSTEM CONNECTIONS 5230  CNTL  NO.

The 5232  AO fully understands the potential risks associated with approving individual connections or 5233  approving a class of components to be connected. As an example, the AO may broadly approve 5234  the connection of any sensors limited to 4 to 20 milliamp (mA) communication, while other 5235  connection types (e.g., serial or ethernet) require individual approval. Decisions to accept risk are 5236  documented. 5237  F.7.5 CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT – CM 5238  Tailoring Considerations for the Configuration Management Family  5239  In situations where the OT cannot be configured to restrict the use of unnecessary functions or 5240  cannot support the use of automated mechanisms to implement configuration management 5241  functions, the organization employs nonautomated mechanisms or procedures as compensating 5242  controls in accordance with the general tailoring guidance.

The ability to test backups is often dependent on resources, such as 5349  the availability of spare devices and testing equipment, needed to appropriately represent the 5350  environment. Testing backup and restoration on OT is often limited to systems with redundancy 5351  or spare equipment; in certain cases, sampling will be limited to those redundant systems. 5352  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  246  Compensating controls may include alternative methods for testing backups such as hash or 5353  checksum validations. 5354  Control Enhancement: (3) (5) (8) No OT Discussion for this control. 5355  CP-10 SYSTEM RECOVERY AND RECONSTITUTION 5356  CNTL  NO.

Restoring system state variables may be 5359  disruptive to ongoing physical processes (e.g., valves initially closed may adversely affect 5360  system cooling). 5361  Control Enhancement: (2) (4) No OT Discussion for this control.  5362  Control Enhancement: (6) OT Discussion: Organizations should consider recovery and 5363  reconstitution timeframes when storing spare equipment, including environmental hazards that 5364  could damage the equipment. Storage locations and environments should be chosen 5365  appropriately for the type of backup equipment.  5366  Rationale for adding CP-10 (6) to MOD and HIGH baselines: OT system components stored 5367  without protection against environmental threats and unauthorized physical or logical access can 5368  be susceptible to compromise or damage. Certain system components may include embedded 5369  electronics that must be protected from environmental hazards. 5370  CP-12 SAFE MODE 5371  CNTL  NO.

For example, the organization considers whether latency 5380  induced from the use of authentication mechanisms employing cryptographic mechanisms would 5381  adversely impact the operational performance of the OT. 5382  In situations where the OT cannot support the specific Identification and Authentication 5383  requirements of a control, the organization employs compensating controls in accordance with 5384  the general tailoring guidance. Examples of compensating controls are given with each control as 5385  appropriate. 5386  IA-1 POLICY AND PROCEDURES 5387  CNTL  NO.

For certain OT, 5392  the capability for immediate operator interaction is critical. Local emergency actions for OT are 5393  not hampered by identification or authentication requirements. Access to these systems may be 5394  restricted by appropriate physical controls. 5395  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  248  Control Enhancement: (1) (2) OT Discussion: As a compensating control, physical access 5396  restrictions may sufficiently represent one authentication factor, provided the system is not 5397  remotely accessible. 5398  Control Enhancement: (5) OT Discussion: For local access, physical access controls and logging 5399  may be used as an alternative to individual authentication on an OT system. For remote access, 5400  the remote access authentication mechanism will be used to identify, permit, and log individual 5401  access before permitting use of shared accounts. 5402  Control Enhancement: (8) No OT Discussion for this control. 5403  Control Enhancement: (12) OT Discussion: The acceptance of PIV credentials is only required 5404  for federal organizations, as defined by OMB Memorandum M-19-17 [OMB-M1917]. Non-5405  federal organizations should refer to IA-2 (1) (2) for guidance on multi-factor authentication 5406  credentials. Furthermore, many OT systems do not have the ability to accept PIV credentials and 5407  will require compensating controls.  5408  IA-3 DEVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION 5409  CNTL  NO.

If devices 5410  are local to one another, physical security measures that prevent unauthorized communication 5411  between devices can be used as compensating controls. For remote communication, additional 5412  hardware may be required to meet authentication requirements. 5413  Control Enhancement: (1) (4) OT Discussion: For OT systems that include IIoT devices, these 5414  enhancements may be needed to protect device-to-device communication.  5415  Rationale for adding IA-3 to LOW baseline: Given the variety of OT devices and physical 5416  locations of OT devices, organizations may consider if types of OT devices that may be 5417  vulnerable to tampering or spoofing require unique identification and authentication, and for 5418  what types of connections. 5419  IA-4 IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT 5420  CNTL  NO.

It is encouraged to leverage existing organizational systems (i.e., HR or IT 5449  processes) to perform this control. 5450  Control Enhancement: (1) OT Discussion: Maintenance, Engineering, or third-party 5451  organizations may require OT access in order to support operations. The organization should 5452  determine the AO for proving identity prior to allowing access to the OT environment. Consider 5453  obtaining supervisor or sponsor authorization, where the sponsor may be someone within 5454  operations. 5455  Control Enhancement: (2) (3) (4) (5) OT Discussion: If the organization already performs these 5456  controls, it is recommended to leverage existing organizational processes. For example, Human 5457  Resources may provide a system for tracking identity evidence. OT does not need to develop an 5458  independent system for achieving this control. Rather, it is advised to leverage the existing 5459  processes developed by other departments within the organization. 5460  Rationale for adding IA-12 (1) to HIGH baseline: A supervisor or sponsor should be made aware 5461  of any access an employee has to the OT environment, since unauthorized or accidental access 5462  could create consequences to the physical process. 5463  F.7.8 INCIDENT RESPONSE - IR 5464  Tailoring Considerations for the Incident Response Family 5465  The automated mechanisms used to support the tracking of security incidents are typically not 5466  part of, or connected to, the OT. 5467  IR-1 POLICY AND PROCEDURES 5468  CNTL  NO.

Organizations identify alternative methods to continue 5873  supported operation of such system components and consider additional compensating controls 5874  to mitigate against known threats and vulnerabilities to unsupported system components.  5875  F.7.17 SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION - SC 5876  Tailoring Considerations for the System and Communications Protection Family  5877  The use of cryptography is determined after careful consideration of the security needs and the 5878  potential ramifications on system performance. For example, the organization considers whether 5879  latency induced from the use of cryptography would adversely impact the operational 5880  performance of the OT. While the legacy devices commonly found within OT often lack direct 5881  support of cryptographic functions, compensating controls (e.g., encapsulations) may be used to 5882  meet the intent of the control. 5883  In situations where the OT cannot support the specific System and Communications Protection 5884  requirements of a control, the organization employs compensating controls in accordance with 5885  the general tailoring guidance.

Subnets should be considered along with other 5918  boundary protection technologies. 5919  Rationale for adding SC-7 (18) to MOD baseline: The ability to choose the failure mode for the 5920  physical part of the OT differentiates the OT from other IT systems. This choice may be a 5921  significant influence in mitigating the impact of a failure. 5922  Rationale for adding SC-7 (28) to LOW, MOD and HIGH baselines: Access to OT should be 5923  restricted to individuals required for operation. A connection made from the OT directly to a 5924  public network has limited applicability in OT environments, but significant potential risk. 5925  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  283  Rationale for adding SC-7 (29) to LOW, MOD and HIGH baselines: In OT environments, 5926  subnets and zoning is a common practice for isolating functions.  5927  SC-8 TRANSMISSION CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY 5928  CNTL  NO.

Preserving OT state 5965  information includes consistency among OT state variables and the physical state which the OT 5966  represents (e.g., whether valves are open or closed, communication permitted or blocked, 5967  continue operations). 5968  Rationale for adding SC-24 to MOD baseline: As part of the architecture and design of the OT, 5969  the organization selects an appropriate failure state of an OT in accordance with the function 5970  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  286  performed by the OT and the operational environment. The ability to choose the failure mode for 5971  the physical part of OT differentiates OT systems from other IT systems. This choice may be a 5972  significant influence in mitigating the impact of a failure, since it may be disruptive to ongoing 5973  physical processes (e.g., valves failing in closed position may adversely affect system cooling). 5974  SC-28 PROTECTION OF INFORMATION AT REST 5975  CNTL  NO.

CONTROL NAME  Control Enhancement Name  CONTROL BASELINES  LOW MOD HIGH  SI-2 Flaw Remediation Select Select Select  SI-2 (2) FLAW REMEDIATION | AUTOMATED FLAW REMEDIATION STATUS  Select Select  OT Discussion: Flaw remediation, or patching, is complicated since many OT employ OSs and 6027  other software no longer maintained by the vendors. OT operators may also not have the 6028  resources or capability to test patches and are dependent on vendors to validate the operability of 6029  a patch. Sometimes the organization has no choice but to accept additional risk if no vendor 6030  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  289  patch is available, patching requires additional time to complete validation/testing, or 6031  deployment requires an unacceptable operations shutdown. In these situations, compensating 6032  controls should be implemented (e.g., limiting the exposure of the vulnerable system, restricting 6033  vulnerable services, implementing virtual patching). Other compensating controls that do not 6034  decrease the residual risk but increase the ability to respond may be desirable (e.g., provide a 6035  timely response in case of an incident; devise a plan to ensure the OT can identify the 6036  exploitation of the flaw). Testing flaw remediation in an OT may exceed the organization’s 6037  available resources. 6038  Control Enhancement: (2) No OT discussion for this control. 6039  SI-3 MALICIOUS CODE PROTECTION 6040  CNTL  NO.

OT may run much longer than conventional systems, allowing latent flaws to become 6104  effective that are not manifest in other environments. For example, integer overflow might never 6105  occur in systems that are re-initialized more frequently than the occurrence of the overflow. 6106  Experience and forensic studies of anomalies and incidents in OT can lead to identification of 6107  emergent properties that were previously unknown, unexpected, or unanticipated. Preventative 6108  and restorative actions (e.g., restarting the system or application) are prudent but may not be 6109  acceptable for operational reasons in OT. 6110  SI-16 MEMORY PROTECTION 6111  CNTL  NO.

The same failure event may trigger different responses, depending on the impact level. 6115  Mechanical and analog systems can be used to provide mechanisms to ensure fail-safe 6116  procedures. Fail-safe states should incorporate potential impacts to human safety, physical 6117  systems, and the environment. Related controls: CP-6. 6118  Rationale for adding SI-17 to LOW, MOD and HIGH baselines: This control provides a structure 6119  for the organization to identify its policy and procedures for dealing with failures and other 6120  incidents. Creating a written record of the decision process for selecting incidents and 6121  appropriate response is part of risk management in light of changing environment of operations. 6122  SI-22 INFORMATION DIVERSITY 6123  CNTL  NO.

ITL develops tests, test 97  methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance 98  the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the 99  development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for 100  the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in 101  federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research, 102  guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities 103  with industry, government, and academic organizations. 104  Abstract 105  This document provides guidance on how to secure operational technology (OT), while 106  addressing their unique performance, reliability, and safety requirements. OT encompasses a 107  broad range of programmable systems and devices that interact with the physical environment 108  (or manage devices that interact with the physical environment). These systems and devices 109  detect or cause a direct change through monitoring and/or control of devices, processes, and 110  events. Examples include industrial control systems, building automation systems, transportation 111  systems, physical access control systems, physical environment monitoring systems, and 112  physical environment measurement systems. The document provides an overview of OT and 113  typical system topologies, identifies typical threats and vulnerabilities to these systems, and 114  provides recommended security countermeasures to mitigate the associated risks. 115  Keywords  116  Computer security; distributed control systems (DCS); industrial control systems (ICS); 117  information security; network security; operational technology (OT); programmable logic 118  controllers (PLC); risk management; security controls; supervisory control and data acquisition 119  (SCADA) systems 120  121  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  iii  Acknowledgments for DRAFT Revision 3 122  The authors gratefully acknowledge and appreciate the significant contributions from Sallie 123  Edwards, Blaine Jefferies, Adam Hahn, John Hoyt, Stephanie Saravia, Aslam Sherule, and 124  Michael Thompson from The MITRE Corporation, and Megan Corso and Brett Ramsay from the 125  Department of Defense.

PUBLIC DRAFT  xv  Executive Summary  482  This document provides guidance for establishing secure operational technology (OT)1 while 483  addressing OT’s unique performance, reliability, and safety requirements. OT encompasses a 484  broad range of programmable systems and devices that interact with the physical environment 485  (or manage devices that interact with the physical environment). These systems and devices 486  detect or cause a direct change through monitoring and/or control of devices, processes, and 487  events. Examples include industrial control systems (ICS), building automation systems, 488  transportation systems, physical access control systems, physical environment monitoring 489  systems, and physical environment measurement systems. The document provides an overview 490  of OT and typical system topologies, identifies typical threats and vulnerabilities for these 491  systems, and recommends security countermeasures to mitigate the associated risks. 492  OT is critical to the operation of U.S. critical infrastructures, which are often highly 493  interconnected, mutually dependent systems. It is important to note that while federal agencies 494  operate many of the nation’s critical infrastructures, many others are privately owned and 495  operated. Additionally, critical infrastructures are often referred to as a “system of systems” 496  because of the interdependencies that exist between various industrial sectors as well as 497  interconnections between business partners. 498  Initially, OT had little resemblance to traditional information technology (IT) systems in that OT 499  systems were isolated, ran proprietary control protocols, and used specialized hardware and 500  software. As OT are adopting IT solutions to promote corporate business systems connectivity 501  and remote access capabilities, and being designed and implemented using industry-standard 502  computers, operating systems (OSs), and network protocols, they are starting to resemble IT 503  systems. This integration supports new IT capabilities, but it provides significantly less isolation 504  for OT from the outside world than predecessor systems, creating a greater need to secure OT 505  systems. The increasing use of wireless networking places OT implementations at greater risk 506  from adversaries who are in relatively close physical proximity but do not have direct physical 507  access to the equipment. While security solutions have been designed to deal with these issues in 508  typical IT systems, special precautions must be taken when introducing these same solutions to 509  OT environments. In some cases, new security solutions are needed that are tailored to the OT 510  environment. 511  Although some characteristics are similar, OT also have characteristics that differ from 512  traditional information processing systems. Many of these differences stem from the fact that 513  logic executing in OT has a direct effect on the physical world. Some of these characteristics 514  include significant risk to the health and safety of human lives and serious damage to the 515  environment, as well as serious financial issues such as production losses, negative impact to a 516  nation’s economy, and compromise of proprietary information. OT have unique performance and 517  reliability requirements and often use OSs and applications that may be considered 518  unconventional to typical IT personnel. Furthermore, the goals of safety and efficiency 519  sometimes conflict with security in the design and operation of OT systems. 520  1  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/operational-technology-security  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/operational-technology-security  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  xvi  OT cybersecurity programs should always be part of broader OT safety and reliability programs 521  at both industrial sites and enterprise cybersecurity programs, because cybersecurity is essential 522  to the safe and reliable operation of modern industrial processes. Threats to OT systems can 523  come from numerous sources, including hostile governments, terrorist groups, disgruntled 524  employees, malicious intruders, complexities, accidents, and natural disasters as well as 525  malicious actions by insiders. OT security objectives typically follow the priority of integrity and 526  availability, followed by confidentiality. 527  Possible incidents an OT system may face include the following: 528   Blocked or delayed flow of information through OT networks, which could disrupt OT 529  operation. 530   Unauthorized changes to instructions, commands, or alarm thresholds, which could damage, 531  disable, or shut down equipment, create environmental impacts, and/or endanger human life. 532   Inaccurate information sent to system operators, either to disguise unauthorized changes or to 533  cause operators to initiate inappropriate actions, which could have various negative effects. 534   Modified OT software or configuration settings, or OT software infected with malware, 535  which could have various negative effects. 536   Interference with the operation of equipment protection systems, which could endanger 537  costly and difficult-to-replace equipment. 538   Interference with the operation of safety systems, which could endanger human life. 539  Major security objectives for an OT implementation should include the following: 540   Restrict logical access to the OT network, network activity, and systems. This may 541  include using unidirectional gateways, utilizing a demilitarized zone (DMZ) network 542  architecture with firewalls to prevent network traffic from passing directly between the 543  corporate and OT networks, and having separate authentication mechanisms and credentials 544  for users of the corporate and OT networks. The OT system should also use a network 545  topology that has multiple layers, with the most critical communications occurring in the 546  most secure and reliable layer.  547   Restrict physical access to the OT network and devices. Unauthorized physical access to 548  components could cause serious disruption of the OT’s functionality. A combination of 549  physical access controls should be used, such as locks, card readers, and/or guards.  550   Protect individual OT components from exploitation. This includes deploying security 551  patches in as expeditious a manner as possible after testing them under field conditions; 552  disabling all unused ports and services and assuring that they remain disabled; restricting OT 553  user privileges to only those that are required for each user’s role; tracking and monitoring 554  audit trails; and using security controls such as antivirus software and file integrity checking 555  software where technically feasible to prevent, deter, detect, and mitigate malware. Keys of 556  OT assets like programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and safety systems should be in the 557  “Run” position at all times unless they are being actively programmed. 558  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  xvii   Restrict unauthorized modification of data. This includes data that is in transit (at least 559  across network boundaries) and at rest. 560   Detect security events and incidents. Detecting security events, which have not yet 561  escalated into incidents, can help defenders break the attack chain before attackers attain their 562  objectives. This includes the capability to detect failed OT components, unavailable services, 563  and exhausted resources that are important to provide proper and safe functioning of the OT 564  system. 565   Maintain functionality during adverse conditions. This involves designing the OT system 566  so that each critical component has a redundant counterpart. Additionally, if a component 567  fails, it should fail in a manner that does not generate unnecessary traffic on the OT or other 568  networks, nor causes another problem elsewhere, such as a cascading event. The OT system 569  should also allow for graceful degradation such as moving from “normal operation” with full 570  automation to “emergency operation” with operators more involved and less automation to 571  “manual operation” with no automation. 572   Restore the system after an incident. Incidents are inevitable and an incident response plan 573  is essential. A major characteristic of a good security program is how quickly the system can 574  be recovered after an incident has occurred. 575  To properly address security in an OT system, it is essential for a cross-functional cybersecurity 576  team to share their varied domain knowledge and experience to evaluate and mitigate risk to the 577  OT system. The cybersecurity team should consist of a member of the organization’s IT staff, 578  control engineer, control system operator, network and system security expert, a member of the 579  management staff, and a member of the physical security department at a minimum. For 580  continuity and completeness, the cybersecurity team should consult with the control system 581  vendor and/or system integrator as well. The cybersecurity team should coordinate closely with 582  site management (e.g., facility superintendent) and the company’s Chief Information Officer 583  (CIO) or Chief Security Officer (CSO), who in turn, along with the Chief Executive Officer 584  (CEO) or Chief Operating Officer (COO), accepts complete responsibility and accountability for 585  the cybersecurity of the OT system and for any safety incidents, reliability incidents, or 586  equipment damage caused directly or indirectly by cyber incidents. An effective cybersecurity 587  program for an OT system should apply a strategy known as “defense-in-depth,” layering 588  security mechanisms such that the impact of a failure in any one mechanism is minimized. 589  Organizations should not rely on “security by obscurity.” 590  In a typical OT system this means a defense-in-depth strategy that includes:   Developing security policies, procedures, training and educational material that apply  specifically to the OT system.   Considering OT security policies and procedures based on the National Terrorism Advisory  System, deploying increasingly heightened security postures as the Threat Level increases.   Addressing security throughout the life cycle of the OT system, including architecture  design, procurement, installation, maintenance, and decommissioning.  https://www.dhs.gov/national-terrorism-advisory-system https://www.dhs.gov/national-terrorism-advisory-system  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  xviii   Implementing a network topology for the OT system that has multiple layers, with the most  critical communications occurring in the most secure and reliable layer.   Providing logical separation between the corporate and OT networks (e.g., stateful  inspection firewall(s) between the networks, unidirectional gateways).   Employing a DMZ network architecture (e.g., prevent direct traffic between the corporate  and OT networks).   Ensuring that critical components are redundant and are on redundant networks.   Designing critical systems for graceful degradation (fault tolerant) to prevent catastrophic  cascading events.   Disabling unused ports and services on OT devices after assuring through testing that it will  not impact OT operation.   Restricting physical access to the OT network and devices.   Restricting OT user privileges to only those that are required to perform each user’s function  (e.g., establishing role-based access control, configuring each role based on the principle of  least privilege).   Using separate authentication mechanisms and credentials for users of the OT network and  the corporate network (i.e., OT network accounts do not use corporate network user  accounts).   Using modern technology, such as smart cards for user authentication   Implementing security controls such as intrusion detection software, antivirus software and  file integrity checking software, where technically feasible, to prevent, deter, detect, and  mitigate the introduction, exposure, and propagation of malicious software to, within, and  from the OT system.   Applying security techniques such as encryption and/or cryptographic hashes to OT data  storage and communications where determined appropriate.   Expeditiously deploying security patches after testing all patches under field conditions on a  test system if possible, before installation on the OT system.   Tracking and monitoring audit trails on critical areas of the OT system.   Employing reliable and secure network protocols and services where feasible.  NIST, in cooperation with the public and private sector OT community, has developed specific 591  guidance on the application of the security controls in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 592  Revision 5, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations [SP800-593  53r5], to OT. This guidance is included in Appendix F of this document. 594  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  xix  While many of the controls in Appendix F of SP 800-53 Rev. 5 are applicable to OT as written, 595  some controls require OT-specific interpretation and/or augmentation by adding one or more of 596  the following to the control: 597   OT Discussion provides organizations with additional information on the application of the 598  security controls and control enhancements in Appendix F to OT and the environments in 599  which these specialized systems operate. The guidance also provides information as to why a 600  particular security control or control enhancement may not be applicable in some OT 601  environments or may be a candidate for tailoring (i.e., the application of scoping guidance 602  and/or compensating controls). OT Discussion does not replace the original Supplemental 603  Guidance in Appendix F. 604   Control Enhancements (one or more) provide augmentations to the original control that 605  may be required for some OT systems. 606  The most successful method for securing OT systems is to gather industry recommended  practices and engage in a proactive, collaborative effort between management, the OT  engineers and operators, the IT organization, and a trusted OT advisor. This team should  draw upon the wealth of information available from ongoing federal government, industry  groups, and vendor and standards activities listed in Appendix D.  607  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  1  1 Introduction 608  1.1 Purpose and Scope 609  The purpose of this document is to provide guidance for establishing secure operational 610  technology (OT)2 while addressing OT’s unique performance, reliability, and safety 611  requirements. The document gives an overview of OT systems and typical system topologies, 612  identifies typical threats and vulnerabilities for these systems, and recommends security 613  countermeasures to mitigate the associated risks. Additionally, it presents an OT-tailored security 614  control overlay based on NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 Rev. 5 [SP800-53r5] that 615  customizes controls for the unique characteristics of the OT domain. The body of the document 616  provides context for the overlay, but the overlay is intended to stand alone. 617  Because there are many types of OT with varying levels of potential risk and impact, this 618  document provides a list of many methods and techniques for securing OT systems. The 619  document should not be used purely as a checklist to secure a specific system. Readers are 620  encouraged to perform a risk-based assessment on their systems and to tailor the recommended 621  guidelines and solutions to meet their specific security, business and operational requirements. 622  The range of applicability of the basic concepts for securing OT systems presented in this 623  document continues to expand. 624  1.2 Audience 625  This document covers details specific to OT systems. Readers of this document should be 626  acquainted with general computer security concepts and with communication protocols such as 627  those used in networking. The document is technical in nature; however, it provides the 628  necessary background to understand the topics that are discussed.  629  The intended audience is varied and includes the following: 630   Control engineers, integrators, and architects who design or implement OT systems 631   System administrators, engineers, and other information technology (IT) professionals who 632  administer, patch, or secure OT systems 633   Security consultants who perform security assessments and penetration testing of OT systems 634   Managers who are responsible for OT systems 635   Senior management who need to better understand risk for OT systems as they justify and 636  apply an OT cybersecurity program 637   Researchers and analysts who are trying to understand the unique security needs of OT 638  systems 639  2  The acronym “OT” can stand for either “operational technology” or “operational technologies.” The context around the  acronym, especially the use of singular or plural words, will indicate which meaning is intended.  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  2   Vendors that are developing products that will be deployed as part of an OT system 640  1.3 Document Structure 641  The remainder of this document is divided into the following major sections: 642   Section 2 gives an overview of OT, including a comparison between OT and IT systems. 643   Section 3 discusses the development and deployment of an OT cybersecurity program to 644  mitigate risk for the vulnerabilities identified in Appendix C. 645   Section 4 examines OT security risk management and applying the Risk Management 646  Framework to OT systems. 647   Section 5 provides recommendations for integrating security into network architectures 648  typically found in OT systems, with an emphasis on network segmentation and separation 649  practices. 650   Section 6 offers guidance on applying the Cybersecurity Framework to OT systems. 651   The References section provides a list of references used in the development of this 652  document. 653  The guide also contains several appendices with supporting material, as follows: 654   Appendix A lists acronyms and abbreviations used in this document. 655   Appendix B contains a glossary of terms used in this document. 656   Appendix C discusses OT threat sources, vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions, threat 657  events, and incidents. 658   Appendix D presents lists and descriptions of OT security organizations, research, and 659  activities. 660   Appendix E discusses various OT security capabilities and tools. 661   Appendix F defines an SP 800-53, Revision 5 OT overlay, listing security controls, 662  enhancements, and supplemental guidance that apply specifically to OT systems.  663  664  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  3  2 OT Overview 665  Operational technology (OT)3 encompasses a broad range of programmable systems and devices 666  that interact with the physical environment (or manage devices that interact with the physical 667  environment). These systems and devices detect or cause a direct change through monitoring 668  and/or control of devices, processes, and events. Examples include industrial control systems, 669  building automation systems, transportation systems, physical access control systems, physical 670  environment monitoring systems, and physical environment measurement systems.  671  OT systems consist of combinations of control components (e.g., electrical, mechanical, 672  hydraulic, pneumatic) that act together to achieve an objective (e.g., manufacturing, 673  transportation of matter or energy). The part of the system primarily concerned with producing 674  an output is referred to as the process. The part of the system primarily concerned with 675  maintaining conformance with specifications is referred to as the controller (or control). The 676  control components of the system include the specification of the desired output or performance. 677  The system can be configured in one of three ways: 678   open-loop: the output is controlled by established settings 679   closed-loop: the output has an effect on the input in such a way as to maintain the desired 680  control objective 681   manual mode: the system is controlled completely by humans 682  This section provides an overview of several types of common OT systems, including 683  supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), distributed control systems (DCS), 684  programmable logic controllers (PLCs), building automation systems (BAS), physical access 685  control systems (PACS), and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Diagrams depict the typical 686  network topology, connections, components, and protocols typically used for each system type. 687  These examples only attempt to identify notional topology concepts. Actual implementations of 688  these types of control systems may be hybrids that blur the lines between them. Note that the 689  diagrams in this section do not focus on securing OT. Security architecture and security controls 690  are discussed in Section 5 and Appendix F of this document, respectively. 691  2.1 Evolution of OT 692  Much of today’s OT evolved from the insertion of IT capabilities into existing physical systems, 693  often replacing or supplementing physical control mechanisms. For example, embedded digital 694  controls replaced analog mechanical controls in rotating machines and engines. Improvements in 695  cost and performance have encouraged this evolution, resulting in many of today’s “smart” 696  technologies such as the smart electric grid, smart transportation, smart buildings, smart 697  manufacturing, and the Internet of Things. While this increases the connectivity and criticality of 698  these systems, it also creates a greater need for their adaptability, resilience, safety, and security. 699  Engineering of OT continues to evolve to provide new capabilities while maintaining the typical 700  long life cycles of these systems. The introduction of IT capabilities into physical systems 701  3  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/operational-technology-security  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/operational-technology-security  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  4  presents emergent behavior that has security implications. Engineering models and analysis are 702  evolving to address these emergent properties, including safety, security, privacy, and 703  environmental impact interdependencies.  704  2.2 OT-Based Systems and Their Interdependencies 705  OT is used in many industries and critical infrastructures, including those identified by the 706  Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) as critical infrastructure sectors listed 707  below. Critical infrastructures that typically contain OT are bolded. 708   Chemical Sector 709   Commercial Facilities Sector 710   Communications Sector 711   Critical Manufacturing Sector 712   Dams Sector 713   Defense Industrial Base Sector 714   Emergency Services Sector 715   Energy Sector 716   Financial Services Sector 717   Food and Agriculture Sector 718   Government Facilities Sector 719   Healthcare and Public Health Sector 720   Information Technology Sector 721   Nuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste Sector 722   Transportation Systems Sector 723   Water and Wastewater Systems Sector 724  OT is critical to the operation of the U.S. critical infrastructures that are often highly 725  interconnected and mutually dependent systems. It is important to note that while federal 726  agencies operate many of the critical infrastructures mentioned above, many others are privately 727  owned and operated. Additionally, critical infrastructures are often referred to as a “system of 728  systems” because of the interdependencies that exist between various industrial sectors and the 729  interconnections between business partners [Peerenboom][Rinaldi]. Overall, critical 730  infrastructures are highly interconnected and mutually dependent in complex ways, both 731  physically and through a host of information and communications technologies. An incident in 732  one infrastructure can directly and indirectly affect other infrastructures through cascading and 733  escalating failures. 734  For example, both the electrical power transmission and distribution grid industries use 735  geographically distributed SCADA control technology to operate highly interconnected and 736  https://www.cisa.gov/critical-infrastructure-sectors  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  5  dynamic systems consisting of thousands of public and private utilities and rural cooperatives for 737  supplying electricity to end users. Some SCADA systems monitor and control electricity 738  distribution by collecting data from and issuing commands to geographically remote field control 739  stations from a centralized location. SCADA systems are also used to monitor and control water, 740  oil, and natural gas distribution, including pipelines, ships, trucks, and rail systems, as well as 741  wastewater collection systems. 742  SCADA systems and DCS are often networked together. This is the case for electric power 743  control centers and electric power generation facilities. Although electric power generation 744  facility operation is controlled by a DCS, the DCS must communicate with the SCADA system 745  to coordinate production output with transmission and distribution demands. 746  Electric power is often thought to be one of the most prevalent sources of disruptions of 747  interdependent critical infrastructures. As an example, a cascading failure can be initiated by a 748  disruption of the microwave communications network used for an electric power transmission 749  SCADA system. The lack of monitoring and control capabilities could cause a large generating 750  unit to be taken offline, an event that would lead to loss of power at a transmission substation. 751  This loss could cause a major imbalance, triggering a cascading failure across the power grid. 752  This could result in large area blackouts that could potentially affect oil and natural gas 753  production, refinery operations, water treatment systems, wastewater collection systems, and 754  pipeline transport systems that rely on the grid for electric power. 755  2.3 OT System Operation, Architectures, and Components 756  As Figure 1 depicts, a typical OT system contains numerous control loops, human-machine 757  interfaces, and remote diagnostics and maintenance tools. The system is built using an array of 758  network protocols on layered network architectures. Some critical processes may also include 759  safety systems.  760  A control loop utilizes sensors, actuators, and controllers to manipulate some controlled process. 761  A sensor is a device that produces a measurement of some physical property and then sends this 762  information as controlled variables to the controller. The controller interprets the signals and 763  generates corresponding manipulated variables, based on a control algorithm and target set 764  points, which it transmits to the actuators. Actuators such as control valves, breakers, switches, 765  and motors are used to directly manipulate the controlled process based on commands from the 766  controller.  767  In a typical monitoring system, there are no direct connections between the sensors and any 768  actuators. Sensor values are transmitted to a monitoring station to be analyzed by a human. 769  However, these types of systems can still be considered OT systems (albeit with a human-in-the-770  loop) because the objective of the monitoring system is likely to identify and ultimately mitigate 771  an event or condition (e.g., a door alerting that it has been forced opened, resulting in security 772  personnel being sent to investigate; an environmental sensor alerting to high temperatures in a 773  server room, resulting in control center personnel activating an auxiliary air conditioning unit).  774  Operators and engineers use human-machine interfaces (HMIs) to monitor and configure set 775  points, control algorithms, and adjust and establish parameters in the controller. The HMI also 776  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  6  displays process status information and historical information. Diagnostics and maintenance 777  utilities are used to prevent, identify, and recover from abnormal operation or failures.  778  Sometimes control loops are nested and/or cascading, whereby the set point for one loop is based 779  on the process variable determined by another loop. Supervisory-level loops and lower-level 780  loops operate continuously over the duration of a process, with cycle times ranging on the order 781  of milliseconds to minutes. 782  783  Figure 1: Basic operation of a typical OT system 784  2.3.1 OT System Design Considerations 785  The design of an OT system, including whether a SCADA, DCS, or PLC-based topology is used 786  depends on many factors. This section identifies key factors that drive design decisions regarding 787  the control, communication, reliability, and redundancy properties of the OT system. Because 788  these factors heavily influence the design of the OT system, they also help determine the 789  system’s security needs.  790   Control Timing Requirements. System processes have a wide range of time-related 791  requirements, including very high speed, consistency, regularity, and synchronization. 792  Humans may not be able to reliably and consistently meet these requirements; automated 793  controllers may be necessary. Some systems may require computation to be performed as 794  close to sensors and actuators as possible to reduce communication latency and perform 795  necessary control actions on time.  796  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  7   Geographic Distribution. Systems have varying degrees of distribution, ranging from a 797  small system (e.g., local PLC-controlled process) to large, distributed systems (e.g., oil 798  pipelines, electric power grids). Greater distribution typically implies a need for wide area 799  networking (e.g., leased lines, circuit switching, packet switching) and mobile 800  communication.  801   Hierarchy. Supervisory control is used to provide a central location that can aggregate data 802  from multiple locations to support control decisions based on the current state of the system. 803  Often a hierarchical/centralized control is used to provide human operators with a 804  comprehensive view of the entire system.  805   Control Complexity. Often control functions can be performed by simple controllers and 806  preset algorithms. However, more complex systems (e.g., air traffic control) require human 807  operators to ensure that all control actions are appropriate for meeting the larger objectives of 808  the system. 809   Availability. Availability (i.e., reliability) requirements of the system are also an important 810  factor in design. Systems with strong availability/up-time requirements may require more 811  redundancy or alternate implementations across all communications and control. 812   Impact of Failures. The failure of a control function could cause substantially different 813  impacts across domains. Systems with greater impacts often require the ability to continue 814  operations through redundant controls or to operate in a degraded state. The design needs to 815  address these requirements. 816   Safety. The system’s safety requirements are an important factor in design. Systems must be 817  able to detect unsafe conditions and trigger actions to reduce unsafe conditions to safe ones. 818  In most safety-critical operations, human oversight and control of a potentially dangerous 819  process is an essential part of the safety system. 820  2.3.2 SCADA Systems 821  Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems are used to control dispersed assets 822  where centralized data acquisition is as important as control [Bailey][Boyer]. These systems are 823  used in distribution systems such as water distribution and wastewater collection systems, oil and 824  natural gas pipelines, electrical utility transmission and distribution systems, and rail and other 825  public transportation systems. SCADA systems integrate data acquisition systems with data 826  transmission systems and HMI software to provide a centralized monitoring and control system 827  for numerous process inputs and outputs. SCADA systems are designed to collect field 828  information, transfer it to a control center, and display the information to the operator graphically 829  or textually, thereby allowing the operator to monitor or control an entire system from a central 830  location in near real-time. Based on the sophistication and setup of the individual system, control 831  of any individual system, operation, or task can be automatic, or it can be performed by operator 832  commands.  833  Typical hardware includes a control server placed at a control center, communications equipment 834  (e.g., radio, telephone line, cable, or satellite), and one or more geographically distributed field 835  sites consisting of remote terminal units (RTUs) and/or PLCs, which control actuators and/or 836  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  8  monitor sensors. The control server stores and processes the information from RTU inputs and 837  outputs, while the RTU or PLC controls the local process. The communications hardware allows 838  the transfer of information and data back and forth between the control server and the RTUs or 839  PLCs. The software is programmed to tell the system what and when to monitor, what parameter 840  ranges are acceptable, and what response to initiate when a process variable changes outside 841  acceptable values. An intelligent electronic device (IED), such as a protective relay, may 842  communicate directly to the control server, or a local RTU may poll the IEDs to collect the data 843  and pass it to the control server. IEDs provide a direct interface to control and monitor 844  equipment and sensors. IEDs may be directly polled and controlled by the control server and in 845  most cases have local programming that allows for the IED to act without direct instructions 846  from the control center. SCADA systems are usually designed to be fault-tolerant systems with 847  significant redundancy built into the system, although redundancy may not be a sufficient 848  countermeasure in the face of malicious attack.  849  Figure 2 shows the components and general configuration of a SCADA system. The control 850  center at the top of the diagram houses a control server and the communications routers. Other 851  control center components include the HMI, engineering workstations, and the data historian, 852  which are all connected by a local area network (LAN). The control center collects and logs 853  information gathered by the field sites, displays information to the HMI, and may generate 854  actions based upon detected events. The control center is also responsible for centralized 855  alarming, trend analyses, and reporting.  856  The field sites at the bottom of Figure 2 perform local control of actuators and monitor sensors. 857  Field sites are often equipped with a remote access capability to allow operators to perform 858  remote diagnostics and repairs, usually over a separate dial-up modem or wide area network 859  (WAN) connection. Standard and proprietary communication protocols running over serial and 860  network communications are used to transport information between the control center and field 861  sites using telemetry techniques such as telephone line, cable, fiber, and radio frequencies (e.g., 862  broadcast, microwave, satellite). 863  SCADA communication topologies vary among implementations. The various topologies used, 864  including point-to-point, series, series-star, and multi-drop [AGA12], are shown in Figure 3. 865  Point-to-point is functionally the simplest type; however, it can be expensive because of the 866  individual channels needed for each connection. In a series configuration, the number of 867  channels used is reduced; however, channel sharing has an impact on the efficiency and 868  complexity of SCADA operations. Similarly, the series-star and multi-drop configurations’ use 869  of one channel per device results in decreased efficiency and increased system complexity.  870  The four basic SCADA topologies shown in Figure 3 can be further augmented by using 871  dedicated devices to manage communication exchanges and perform message switching and 872  buffering. Large SCADA systems containing hundreds of RTUs often employ a sub-control 873  server to alleviate the burden on the primary server. This type of topology is shown in Figure 4. 874  Figure 5 shows an example SCADA system implementation. This particular SCADA system 875  consists of a primary control center and three field sites. A second backup control center 876  provides redundancy in the event of a primary control center malfunction. Point-to-point 877  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  9  connections are used for all control center to field site communications, with two connections 878  using radio telemetry. The third field site is local to the control center and uses the WAN for 879  communications. A regional control center resides above the primary control center for a higher 880  level of supervisory control. The corporate enterprise network has access to all control centers 881  through the WAN, and field sites can be accessed remotely for troubleshooting and maintenance 882  operations. The primary control center polls field devices for data at defined intervals (e.g., 5 883  seconds, 60 seconds) and can send new set points to field devices as required. In addition to 884  polling and issuing high-level commands, the control server also watches for priority interrupts 885  coming from field site alarm systems. 886  887  Figure 2: A general SCADA system layout showing control center devices, communications equipment, and 888  field sites 889  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  10  890  891  Figure 3: Examples of point-to-point, series, series-star, and multi-drop SCADA communications topologies 892  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  11  893  Figure 4: Example SCADA topology to support a large number of remote stations 894  895  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  12  896  Figure 5: A comprehensive SCADA system implementation example897  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  13  Figure 6 shows an example implementation for rail monitoring and control. This example 898  includes a rail control center that houses the SCADA system and three sections of a rail system. 899  The SCADA system polls the rail sections for information such as the status of the trains, signal 900  systems, traction electrification systems, and ticket vending machines. This information is also 901  fed to operator consoles at the HMI stations within the rail control center. The SCADA system 902  monitors operator inputs at the rail control center and disperses high-level operator commands to 903  the rail section components. In addition, the SCADA system monitors conditions at the 904  individual rail sections and issues commands based on these conditions (e.g., stopping a train to 905  prevent it from entering an area that has been determined to be flooded or occupied by another 906  train based on condition monitoring). 907  908  Figure 6: An example rail monitoring and control SCADA system implementation 909  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  14  2.3.3 Distributed Control Systems 910  Distributed control systems (DCS) are used to control production systems within the same 911  geographic location for industries such as oil refineries, water and wastewater treatment, electric 912  power generation, chemical manufacturing, automotive production, and pharmaceutical 913  processing. These systems are usually process control or discrete part control systems.  914  DCS are integrated as a control architecture containing a supervisory level of control overseeing 915  multiple, integrated sub-systems that are responsible for controlling the details of a localized 916  process. A DCS uses a centralized supervisory control loop to mediate a group of localized 917  controllers that share the overall tasks of carrying out an entire production process [Erickson]. 918  Product and process control are usually achieved by deploying feedback or feedforward control 919  loops, whereby key product and/or process conditions are automatically maintained around a 920  desired set point. To accomplish the desired product and/or process tolerance around a specified 921  set point, specific process controllers or more capable PLCs are employed in the field and are 922  tuned to provide the desired tolerance as well as the rate of self-correction during process upsets. 923  By modularizing the production system, a DCS reduces the impact of a single fault on the overall 924  system. In many modern systems, the DCS is interfaced with the corporate enterprise network to 925  give business operations a view of production. 926  An example implementation showing the components and general configuration of a DCS is 927  depicted in Figure 7. This DCS encompasses an entire facility from the bottom-level production 928  processes up to the corporate enterprise layer. In this example, a supervisory controller (control 929  server) communicates to its subordinates via a control network. The supervisor sends set points 930  to and requests data from the distributed field controllers. The distributed controllers control their 931  process actuators based on control server commands and sensor feedback from process sensors.  932  Figure 7 gives examples of low-level controllers found on a DCS system. The field control 933  devices shown include a machine controller, a PLC, and a process controller. The machine 934  controller interfaces with sensors and actuators using point-to-point wiring, while the other three 935  field devices incorporate fieldbus networks to interface with process sensors and actuators. 936  Fieldbus networks eliminate the need for point-to-point wiring between a controller and 937  individual field sensors and actuators. Additionally, a fieldbus allows greater functionality 938  beyond control, including field device diagnostics, and can accomplish control algorithms within 939  the fieldbus, thereby avoiding signal routing back to the PLC for every control operation. 940  Standard industrial communication protocols designed by industry groups such as Modbus and 941  Fieldbus [Berge] are often used on control networks and fieldbus networks. 942  In addition to the supervisory-level and field-level control loops, intermediate levels of control 943  may also exist. For example, in the case of a DCS controlling a discrete part manufacturing 944  facility, there could be an intermediate level supervisor for each cell within the plant. This 945  supervisor encompasses a manufacturing cell containing a machine controller that processes a 946  part and a robot controller that handles raw stock and final products. There could be several of 947  these cells that manage field-level controllers under the main DCS supervisory control loop. 948  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  15  949  950  Figure 7: A comprehensive DCS implementation example951  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  16  2.3.4 Programmable Logic Controller-Based Topologies 952  PLCs are used in both SCADA and DCS systems as the control components of an overall 953  hierarchical system to provide local management of processes through feedback control, as 954  described in the sections above. In the case of SCADA systems, they may provide similar 955  functionality to RTUs. When used in DCS, PLCs are implemented as local controllers within a 956  supervisory control scheme.  957  In addition to PLC usage in SCADA and DCS, PLCs can be implemented as the primary 958  controller in smaller OT system configurations to provide operational control of discrete 959  processes (e.g., automobile assembly lines, process controllers). These topologies differ from 960  SCADA and DCS in that they generally lack a central control server or HMI and, therefore, 961  primarily provide closed-loop control with minimal human involvement. PLCs have a user-962  programmable memory for storing instructions for the purpose of implementing specific 963  functions such as I/O control, logic, timing, counting, three mode proportional-integral-964  derivative (PID) control, communication, arithmetic, and data and file processing.  965  Figure 8 shows control of a manufacturing process being performed by a PLC over a fieldbus 966  network. The PLC is accessible via a programming interface located on an engineering 967  workstation, and data is stored in a data historian, all connected on a LAN. 968  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  17  969  970  Figure 8: A PLC control system implementation example 971  2.3.5 Building Automation Systems  972  Building automation systems (BAS) are a type of OT used to control many systems used in a 973  building, including heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), fire, electrical, lighting, 974  physical access control, physical security, and other utility systems. Most modern buildings 975  contain some form of a BAS when they are constructed; however, older buildings and equipment 976  may have to be retrofitted to take advantage of the benefits BAS provide. 977  Some of the most common functions of BAS are maintaining the environmental conditions for 978  occupant comfort, reducing energy consumption, reducing operating and maintenance costs, 979  increasing security, recording historical data (e.g., temperature, humidity), and performing 980  general equipment monitoring (e.g., provide alerts to building personnel upon device failure or 981  an alarm condition).  982  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  18  An example of a BAS is shown in Figure 9. The architecture can be compared to a DCS, as it has 983  a similar structure and distributed elements (typically throughout a building or buildings) which 984  may communicate over wired or wireless paths to controllers or gateways. For example, 985  environmental control sensors can provide the temperature and humidity to a building controller. 986  If the sensor values are outside of the set points, the controller can signal a variable air volume 987  (VAV) box to increase or decrease airflow and bring the temperature to the desired state. 988  Similarly, a building occupant scanning their identification badge at a badge reader can result in 989  the credentials being sent to the access control controller and application control server to 990  determine if access should be granted. 991  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  19  992  Figure 9: A comprehensive Building Automation System implementation example993  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  20  2.3.6 Physical Access Control Systems  994  Physical access control systems (PACS) are a type of physical security system designed to 995  control access to an area. Unlike standard physical barriers, physical access control can control 996  who is granted access, when the access is granted, and how long the access should last.  997  An access point is the entrance/barrier where access control is required. Some common physical 998  access control examples of access points are doors and locks, security gates, turnstiles, and 999  vehicular gate arms. Depending on the type of facility there can be a single access point (e.g., for 1000  high-security areas) or many (e.g., for a large office building).  1001  An identification (ID) or personal credential is used to identify the authorized user trying to gain 1002  access to the area or facility. Most PACS require a user to have credentials to gain entrance to a 1003  facility or access sensitive data. Examples of identification credentials include simple controls 1004  (e.g., PIN codes, passwords, key fobs, key cards) and more advanced credentials (e.g., encrypted 1005  badges, mobile credentials). Identification credentials allow the system to know who is 1006  attempting to gain access and to maintain access logs.  1007  Readers and/or keypads are typically located at the access point. The reader reads the data and 1008  sends it to a door controller to validate the credential to determine if access should be authorized. 1009  If a keypad or biometric reader is also required (i.e., for multi-factor authentication), the user will 1010  enter their PIN or perform the biometric scan following their credential scan.  1011  1012  Figure 10: A Physical Access Control System implementation example 1013  An example of a PACS is shown in Figure 10. In this example, the door controller receives 1014  credential data from the reader and verifies the identification credential. If the credential is 1015  approved by the access control server, the control panel transmits the command to authorize 1016  access and the door will be unlocked. If the credential is denied, the door will remain locked, and 1017  the user will not be able to gain entry. All access attempts are logged by the door controller(s) 1018  and ultimately the access control server. The access control server is the repository for user 1019  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  21  information, access privileges, and audit logs. Depending on the system, the server might be on-1020  premises or managed in the cloud.  1021  2.3.7 Safety Systems  1022  Many of the physical processes that OT systems control have the potential to create hazardous 1023  situations to life and safety, property, and the environment. Safety systems are designed to 1024  reduce the likelihood and/or consequence of these potentially hazardous situations by bringing 1025  the system to a safe state. There are several types of safety systems related to OT environments, 1026  including emergency shut down (ESD), process safety shutdown (PSS), and fire and gas systems 1027  (FGS). 1028  One of the more well-known types of safety system is the Safety Instrumented System (SIS). An 1029  SIS is a system that is composed of one or more Safety Instrumented Functions (SIFs). An SIF is 1030  an engineered system typically comprised of sensors, logic solvers, and final control elements 1031  (e.g., actuators) whose purpose is to bring a system to a safe state when predetermined thresholds 1032  are violated. They are implemented as part of an overall risk reduction strategy which is intended 1033  to reduce the likelihood and/or potential consequences of a previously identified event so it is 1034  within the organization’s risk tolerance. Numerous other terms are associated with safety 1035  systems; however, the SIS is specifically designed in accordance with IEC 61511 [IEC61511]. 1036  SIS are typically found in chemical, refinery, and nuclear processes.  1037  SIS are typically independent from all other control systems in such a manner that a failure of the 1038  Basic Process Control System (BPCS) will not impact SIS functionality in a deleterious manner. 1039  Historically, SIS were designed to be standalone, physically and logically separated, and air 1040  gapped from the rest of the control system. In the configuration shown in Figure 11, the SIS and 1041  BPCS operated completely independent of each other with no direct communication between the 1042  systems. However, some modern SIS have been designed to allow communication with the 1043  control system. These types of SIS are called Integrated Control and Safety Systems (ICSS). An 1044  ICSS solution may be an all-in-one device from a single vendor or may incorporate multiple 1045  devices from multiple vendors. While ICSS combine the functionality of both control and safety 1046  systems, the SIS still must comply with the requirements outlined in IEC 61511. One of the 1047  advantages to this ICSS methodology is the ability to communicate information from the SIS to 1048  the BPCS. 1049  1050  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  22  1051  Figure 11: A Safety Instrumented System implementation example 1052  2.3.8 Industrial Internet of Things 1053  The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) consists of sensors, instruments, machines, and other 1054  devices that are networked together and use internet connectivity to enhance industrial and 1055  manufacturing business processes and applications [Berge]. As IT and OT systems continue to 1056  converge and the systems become even more interconnected, control of physical processes 1057  remains a relatively unique and critical concept of OT.  1058  The Industrial IoT Consortium proposes a three-tier system architecture model for representing 1059  IIoT systems [IIRA19], consisting of the Edge Tier, Platform Tier, and Enterprise Tier. Each tier 1060  plays a specific role in processing the data flows and control flows involved in usage activities. 1061  The tiers are connected by three networks: the Proximity Network, Access Network, and Service 1062  Network. An example architecture is shown in Figure 12. 1063  The Enterprise Tier implements domain-specific applications and decision support systems, 1064  provides interfaces to end-users, receives data flows from the other tiers, and issues control 1065  commands to the other tiers. 1066  The Platform Tier receives, processes, and forwards control commands from the Enterprise Tier 1067  to the Edge Tier. It consolidates processes and analyzes data flows from the other tiers, provides 1068  management functions for devices and assets, and offers non-domain specific services such as 1069  data query and analytics. Based on the specific implementation, these functions can be 1070  implemented on the IIoT Platform that is deployed in an on-site datacenter, an off-site 1071  datacenter, or in the cloud. 1072  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  23  The Edge Tier collects data from the edge nodes using the proximity network. The architectural 1073  characteristics of this tier vary depending on the specific implementation (e.g., geographical 1074  distribution, physical location, governance scope). It is a logical layer rather than a true physical 1075  division. From the business perspective, the location of the edge depends on the business 1076  objectives.  1077  1078  Figure 12: A three-tiered Industrial Internet of Things system architecture 1079  Edge computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure in which computing resources and 1080  application services can be distributed along the communication path between the data source 1081  and the cloud. It exists vertically within the full stack (i.e., from the device to the cloud) and 1082  horizontally across IIoT subsystems. The edge is not merely a way to collect data for 1083  transmission to the datacenter or cloud; it also processes, analyzes, and acts on data collected at 1084  the edge and is, therefore, essential for optimizing industrial data at every aspect of an operation. 1085  The IIoT system architecture is fully distributed and can support a wide range of interactions and 1086  communication paradigms, including:  1087  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  24   Peer-to-peer networking (e.g., security cameras communicating about identified objects)  1088   Edge-device collaboration (e.g., wind turbines in remote locations)  1089   Distributed queries across data stored in devices, in the cloud, and anywhere in between  1090   Distributed data management, defining where and what data is to be stored, and for how long 1091   Data governance including quality, discovery, usability, privacy and security 1092  The Proximity Network connects edge nodes (e.g., sensors, actuators, devices, OT systems and 1093  assets) to the stack. It typically connects these edge nodes as one or more clusters to a gateway 1094  that bridges to other networks. The Access Network enables connectivity for data and control 1095  flow between the Edge and Platform Tiers. This connection may be a corporate network, or an 1096  overlay private network over the public Internet or a 4G/5G network. The Service Network 1097  enables connectivity between the services in the Platform Tier, the Enterprise Tier, and the 1098  services within each tier. This connectivity may be an overlay private network over the public 1099  Internet or the Internet itself, allowing enterprise-grade security between end-users and services. 1100  2.4 Comparing OT and IT System Security 1101  OT has many characteristics that differ from traditional IT systems, including different risks and 1102  priorities. Some of these include significant risk to the health and safety of human lives, serious 1103  damage to the environment, and financial issues such as production losses. OT has different 1104  performance and reliability requirements and uses OSs and applications that may be considered 1105  unconventional in a typical IT network environment. Security protections must be implemented 1106  in a way that maintains system integrity during normal operations as well as during times of 1107  cyber-attack [Knapp]. 1108  Initially, OT systems had little resemblance to IT systems in that OT were isolated systems 1109  running proprietary control protocols using specialized hardware and software. Widely available, 1110  low-cost Ethernet, Internet Protocol (IP), and wireless devices are now replacing the older 1111  proprietary technologies, which increases the likelihood of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and 1112  incidents. As OT continues to adopt IT technologies to promote corporate connectivity and 1113  remote access capabilities, such as using industry standard computers, OSs, and network 1114  protocols, OT systems and devices are increasingly resembling IT systems. This integration 1115  supports new IT capabilities, but it provides significantly less isolation for OT from the outside 1116  world than predecessor systems, creating a greater need to secure them. While security solutions 1117  have been designed to deal with these issues in typical IT systems, special precautions must be 1118  taken when introducing these same solutions to OT environments. In some cases, new security 1119  solutions are needed that are tailored to the OT environment. 1120  The following lists some special considerations when considering security for OT: 1121   Timeliness and Performance Requirements. OT are generally time-critical, with the 1122  criterion for acceptable levels of delay and jitter dictated by the individual installation. Some 1123  systems require reliable, deterministic responses. High throughput is typically not essential to 1124  OT. In contrast, IT systems typically require high throughput, and they can typically 1125  withstand some level of delay and jitter. For some OT, automated response time or system 1126  response to human interaction is very critical. Many OT utilize real-time OSs (RTOS), where 1127  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  25  real-time refers to timeliness requirements. The units of real-time are highly application-1128  dependent and must be explicitly stated. 1129   Availability Requirements. Many OT processes are continuous in nature. Unexpected 1130  outages of systems that control industrial processes are not acceptable. Outages often must be 1131  planned and scheduled days or weeks in advance. Exhaustive pre-deployment testing is 1132  essential to ensure high availability (i.e., reliability) for the OT. OT systems often cannot be 1133  stopped and started without affecting production. In some cases, the products produced or 1134  equipment being used are more important than the information being relayed. Therefore, 1135  typical IT strategies (e.g., rebooting a component) are usually not acceptable for OT due to 1136  the adverse impact on the requirements for high availability, reliability, and maintainability. 1137  Some OT employ redundant components, often running in parallel, to provide continuity 1138  when primary components are unavailable.  1139   Risk Management Requirements. In a typical IT system, primary concerns include data 1140  confidentiality and integrity. For OT, primary concerns include human safety, fault tolerance 1141  to prevent loss of life or endangerment of public health or confidence, regulatory compliance, 1142  loss of equipment, loss of intellectual property, or lost or damaged products. The personnel 1143  responsible for operating, securing, and maintaining OT must understand the important link 1144  between safety and security. Any security measure that impairs safety is unacceptable. 1145   Physical Effects. Field devices (e.g., PLCs, operator stations, DCS controllers) are directly 1146  responsible for controlling physical processes. OT can have complex interactions with 1147  physical processes and consequences in the OT domain that can manifest in physical events. 1148  Understanding these potential physical effects often requires communication between experts 1149  in OT and experts of the particular physical domain.  1150   System Operation. OT OSs and control networks are often quite different from their IT 1151  counterparts, requiring different skill sets, experience, and levels of expertise. Control 1152  networks are typically managed by control engineers, not IT personnel. Assumptions that 1153  differences are insignificant can have disastrous consequences on system operations. 1154   Resource Constraints. OT and their RTOS are often resource-constrained systems that do 1155  not include typical contemporary IT security capabilities. Legacy systems are often lacking 1156  resources common on modern IT systems. Many systems may not have desired features 1157  including encryption capabilities, error logging, and password protection. Indiscriminate use 1158  of IT security practices in OT may cause availability and timing disruptions. There may not 1159  be computing resources available on OT components to retrofit these systems with current 1160  security capabilities. Adding resources or features may not be possible. 1161   Communications. Communication protocols and media used by OT environments for field 1162  device control and intra-processor communication are typically different from IT 1163  environments and may be proprietary.  1164   Change Management. Change management is paramount to maintaining the integrity of 1165  both IT and OT systems. Unpatched software represents one of the greatest vulnerabilities to 1166  a system. Software updates on IT systems, including security patches, are typically applied in 1167  a timely fashion based on appropriate security policy and procedures. In addition, these 1168  procedures are often automated using server-based tools. Software updates on OT cannot 1169  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  26  always be implemented on a timely basis. These updates need to be thoroughly tested by both 1170  the vendor and the end user of the industrial control application before being implemented. 1171  Additionally, the OT owner must plan and schedule OT outages days/weeks in advance. The 1172  OT may also require revalidation as part of the update process. Another issue is that many 1173  OT utilize older versions of OSs that are no longer supported by the vendor through patches. 1174  Change management is also applicable to hardware and firmware. The change management 1175  process, when applied to OT, requires careful assessment by OT experts (e.g., control 1176  engineers) working in conjunction with security and IT personnel.  1177   Managed Support. Typical IT systems allow for diversified support styles, perhaps 1178  supporting disparate but interconnected technology architectures. For OT, service support is 1179  in some instances available only from a single vendor. In some instances, third-party security 1180  solutions are not allowed due to OT vendor licensing and service agreements, and loss of 1181  service support can occur if third-party applications are installed without vendor 1182  acknowledgement or approval. 1183   Component Lifetime. Typical IT components have a lifetime on the order of three to five 1184  years due to the quick evolution of technology. For OT where technology has been 1185  developed in many cases for specific uses and implementations, the lifetime of the deployed 1186  technology is often in the order of 10 to 15 years, and sometimes longer. 1187   Component Location. Most IT components and some OT components are located in 1188  business and commercial facilities physically accessible by local transportation. Remote 1189  locations may be utilized for backup facilities. Distributed OT components may be isolated, 1190  remote, and require extensive transportation effort to reach. Component location also needs 1191  to consider necessary physical and environmental security measures.  1192  Table 1 summarizes some of the typical differences between IT and OT systems. 1193  Table 1: Summary of typical differences between IT and OT systems 1194  Category Information Technology  Operational Technology  Performance  Requirements  • Non-real time  • Response must be consistent.  • High throughput is demanded.  • High delay and jitter may be acceptable.  • Emergency interaction is less critical.  • Tightly restricted access control can be  implemented to the degree necessary  for security.  • Real-time  • Response is time-critical.  • Modest throughput is acceptable.  • High delay and/or jitter is not acceptable.  • Response to human and other  emergency interaction is critical.  • Access to OT should be strictly controlled  but should not hamper or interfere with  human-machine interaction.

A cross-functional 1197  team of control engineers, control system operators, and IT security professionals must work 1198  closely to understand the possible implications of the installation, operation, and maintenance of 1199  security solutions in conjunction with control system operation. IT professionals working with 1200  OT need to understand the reliability impacts of information security technologies before 1201  deployment. Some of the OSs and applications running on OT may not operate correctly with 1202  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  28  commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) IT cybersecurity solutions because of their unique 1203  requirements. 1204  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  29  3 OT Cybersecurity Program Development  1205  To mitigate cybersecurity risk to their OT systems, organizations need to develop and deploy an 1206  OT cybersecurity program. It should be consistent and integrated with existing IT cybersecurity 1207  programs and practices, but also account for the specific requirements and characteristics of OT 1208  systems and environments. Organizations should review and update their OT cybersecurity plans 1209  and programs regularly to reflect changes in technologies, operations, standards, regulations, and 1210  the security needs of specific facilities. 1211  Effective integration of cybersecurity into the operation of OT requires defining and executing a 1212  comprehensive program that addresses all aspects of cybersecurity. This includes defining the 1213  objectives and scope of the program, establishing a cross functional team that understands OT 1214  and cybersecurity, defining policies and procedures, identifying the cyber risk management 1215  capabilities that include people, process, and technology, as well as identifying day-to-day 1216  operations of event monitoring and auditing for compliance and improvement. 1217  When a new system is being designed and installed, it is imperative to take the time to address 1218  security throughout the life cycle, including architecture, procurement, installation, maintenance, 1219  and decommissioning. Deploying systems to the field based on the assumption that these systems 1220  will be secured later introduces significant risk to the systems and the organization. If there 1221  aren’t sufficient time and resources to secure the system properly before deployment, it is 1222  unlikely that security will be addressed at a later time. Since new OT systems are designed and 1223  deployed less frequently than IT systems, it is much more common to improve, expand, or 1224  update an existing OT system than to design a new one.  1225  This section introduces the basic process for developing an OT cybersecurity program and 1226  applies to new and deployed OT systems. Additional guidance for developing the specific 1227  elements of an OT cybersecurity program can be found in the Sections listed in Section 3.3.10. 1228  Organizations may also wish to consult ISA-62443-2-1, Security for Industrial Automation and 1229  Control Systems: Security Program Requirements for IACS Asset Owners, which describes 1230  another view of the elements of a cybersecurity program for use in the OT environment. It 1231  provides guidance on how to meet the cybersecurity requirements described for each element of 1232  the cybersecurity program [ISA62443]. 1233  3.1 Establish a Charter for OT Cybersecurity Program 1234  Senior management must demonstrate a clear commitment to cybersecurity and should 1235  communicate its importance throughout the organization. Cybersecurity is a business 1236  responsibility shared by all members of the organization and especially by its leaders and IT and 1237  OT teams. Commitment to cybersecurity, both IT and OT, can be demonstrated by establishing a 1238  charter for a cybersecurity program with adequate funding, visibility, governance, and support 1239  from senior leaders. A cybersecurity program that has commitment from senior management is 1240  more likely to achieve the mission and business goals of the organization. 1241  A charter for a cybersecurity program is a plain-language high-level description that establishes 1242  clear ownership and accountability for protecting the OT resources and provides a mandate for 1243  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  30  the most senior person responsible to establish and maintain the cybersecurity program (e.g., 1244  CISO). In this section, the focus is on the OT-specific program. However, the OT cybersecurity 1245  program should be integrated with the overall cybersecurity program for the organization. 1246  A cybersecurity program charter should include program objectives, scope, and responsibilities. 1247  Senior management establishes the OT cybersecurity program charter and identifies an OT 1248  cybersecurity manager with appropriate scope, responsibility, and authority to lead the OT 1249  cybersecurity program. The OT cybersecurity manager should define the roles and 1250  responsibilities of system owners, mission/business process managers, and users. The OT 1251  cybersecurity manager should document the objectives and scope of the OT security program, 1252  including the business organizations affected, the systems and networks involved, the budget and 1253  resources required, and the division of responsibilities.  1254  The organization may already have an information security program in place or have developed 1255  one for its IT systems. The OT cybersecurity manager should identify which existing practices to 1256  leverage, and which practices are specific to the OT system. In the long run, it will be more 1257  effective if the team can share resources with others in the organization that have similar 1258  objectives. 1259  3.2 Business Case for OT Cybersecurity Program 1260  The cybersecurity of OT systems is a critical component in the overall security for the 1261  organization. An OT cybersecurity program considers the characteristics of OT systems that 1262  differ from IT systems, necessitating special consideration in securing OT.  1263  Attacks on OT systems are increasing and can cause physical damage or even halt production. 1264  As OT systems are increasingly being connected to IT networks, relying on traditional measures 1265  is not enough to protect such systems from cyber-attack. e.g., traditional measures like air gap 1266  are no longer realistic as systems are more connected to the enterprise network for productivity 1267  or efficiency reasons. Also, OT systems can be used as an entry point to the organizational IT 1268  systems and other enterprise systems. Therefore, security measures tailored to the OT system are 1269  required to protect the organization. The OT cybersecurity program can provide an organization-1270  wide strategy to secure the system. 1271  The ability to perform its missions and goals is an important requirement for many organizations 1272  and OT operators. Managing the risk of the OT system to ensure the organization meets its goals 1273  and missions is a high priority for these OT operators. The potential impact of a cybersecurity 1274  event could be severe—it could impact the organization’s mission and objectives, the 1275  environment, regulatory compliance, and even human safety. An OT cybersecurity program can 1276  provide a methodology and strategy to mitigate the risks.  1277  3.2.1 Benefits of Cybersecurity investments 1278  OT cybersecurity supports the mission and business functions of the organization. Investment in 1279  OT cybersecurity can provide additional benefits, including:  1280   Improving OT system safety, reliability, and availability 1281  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  31   Improving OT system efficiency  1282   Reducing community concerns 1283   Reducing legal liabilities 1284   Meeting regulatory requirements 1285   Helping with insurance coverage and cost 1286  A strong OT cybersecurity program is fundamental to a sustainable business operation. An OT 1287  cybersecurity program with OT-specific security policies can potentially enhance system 1288  reliability and availability. This also includes minimizing unintentional OT system information 1289  security impacts from inappropriate testing, policies, and misconfigured systems. The importance 1290  of secure systems should be further emphasized as business reliance on interconnectivity 1291  increases. Denial of service (DoS) attacks and malware (e.g., worms, viruses) have become very 1292  common and have already impacted OT systems. Cyber-attacks can have significant physical 1293  and consequential impacts. The major categories of impacts are as follows: 1294   Physical Impacts. Physical impacts encompass the set of direct consequences of OT failure. 1295  The potential effects of paramount importance include personal injury and loss of life. Other 1296  effects include the loss of property (including data) and potential damage to the environment. 1297   Economic Impacts. Economic impacts are a second-order effect from physical impacts 1298  ensuing from an OT incident. Physical impacts could result in repercussions to system 1299  operations, which in turn inflict a greater economic loss on the facility, organization, or 1300  others dependent on the OT systems. Unavailability of critical infrastructure (e.g., electrical 1301  power, transportation) can have economic impact far beyond the systems sustaining direct 1302  and physical damage. These effects could negatively impact the local, regional, national, or 1303  possibly global economy. 1304   Social Impacts. Another second-order effect, the consequence from the loss of national or 1305  public confidence in an organization, is many times overlooked. It is, however, a very real 1306  consequence that could result from an OT incident. 1307  Examples of potential consequences of an OT incident are listed below. Note that items in this 1308  list are not independent. For example, release of hazardous material can lead to injury or death. 1309   Impact on national security—facilitate an act of terrorism 1310   Reduction or loss of production at one site or multiple sites simultaneously 1311   Injury or death of employees 1312   Injury or death of persons in the community 1313   Damage to equipment 1314   Release, diversion, or theft of hazardous materials 1315   Environmental damage 1316   Violation of regulatory requirements 1317   Product contamination 1318  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  32   Criminal or civil legal liabilities 1319   Loss of proprietary or confidential information 1320   Loss of brand image or customer confidence 1321  Undesirable incidents of any sort detract from the value of an organization, but safety and 1322  security incidents can have negative impacts that last longer than other types of incidents on all 1323  stakeholders—employees, shareholders, customers, and the communities in which an 1324  organization operates. The list of potential business consequences needs to be prioritized to focus 1325  on the consequences that senior management will find the most compelling. The highest priority 1326  items should be evaluated to estimate the annual business impact, preferably but not necessarily 1327  in financial terms. 1328  3.2.2 Building an OT Cybersecurity Business Case 1329  A well-defined business case for an OT cybersecurity program is essential for management buy-1330  in to ensure the long-term commitment of the organization and allocation of resources needed for 1331  development, implementation, and maintenance of the program. Without a strong commitment 1332  by senior management, it may be difficult to prioritize the allocation of resources to sustain the 1333  program. 1334  The first step in developing an OT security program is to identify the business objectives and 1335  missions of the organization, and how the cybersecurity program can lower risk and protect the 1336  organization’s ability to perform its mission. The business case should capture the business 1337  concerns of senior management and provide the business impact and financial justification for 1338  creating an integrated organizational cybersecurity program. It should include detailed 1339  information about the following: 1340   Benefits of creating an integrated security program 1341   Potential costs and failure scenarios if an OT cybersecurity program is not implemented 1342   High-level overview of the process required to implement, operate, monitor, review, 1343  maintain, and improve the information security program 1344  Costs and resources required to develop, implement, and maintain the security program should 1345  be considered. The economics benefit of the cybersecurity program may be evaluated similar to 1346  worker health and safety programs. However, an attack on the OT system could have significant 1347  consequences that far exceed the monetary costs. 1348  3.2.3 Resources for Building Business Case 1349  Significant resources can be found in external resources from other organizations in similar lines 1350  of business—either individually or in information sharing exchanges, trade and standards 1351  organizations, consulting firms, and internal resources in related risk management programs or 1352  engineering and operations. External organizations can often provide useful tips as to what 1353  factors most strongly influenced management to support their efforts and what resources within 1354  their organizations proved most helpful. For different industries these factors may be different, 1355  but there may be similarities in the roles that other risk management specialists can play. 1356  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  33  Appendix D provides a list and short descriptions of some of the current activities in OT 1357  security. 1358  Internal resources in related risk management efforts (e.g., information security, health, safety 1359  and environmental risk, physical security, business continuity) can provide tremendous 1360  assistance based on their experiences with related incidents in the organization. This information 1361  is helpful from the standpoint of prioritizing threats and estimating business impact. These 1362  resources can also provide insight into which managers are focused on dealing with which risks 1363  and, thus, which managers might be the most appropriate or receptive to serving as a champion.  1364  3.2.4 Presenting the OT Cybersecurity Business Case to Leadership 1365  It is critical for the success of the OT cybersecurity program that it receives senior management 1366  buy-in and that they actively participate in the program. Organization-level management that 1367  encompasses both IT and OT operations has the perspective to understand the risks and the 1368  authority to assume responsibility for them. 1369  Senior management will be responsible for approving and driving information security policies, 1370  assigning security roles and responsibilities, and implementing the information security program 1371  across the organization. Funding for the entire program can usually be done in phases. While 1372  some funding may be required to start the program, additional funding can be obtained later as 1373  the security vulnerabilities and needs of the program are better understood and additional 1374  strategies are developed. Additionally, costs should be considered for retrofitting the OT for 1375  security versus addressing security to begin with. 1376  Often, a good approach to obtain management buy-in is to base the business case on a successful 1377  example. The business case should inform management that the other organization had the same 1378  problem and then present the solution they have found and how they were able to solve it. This 1379  will often prompt management to ask how this solution might be applicable to their organization. 1380  When presenting the business case to leadership, it may be helpful to mention the specific 1381  challenges in securing the OT systems: 1382   OT systems operate under different environments and requirements than IT systems. For 1383  example, OT systems tend to prioritize availability and safety over other factors like 1384  confidentiality. 1385   IT programs or tools may not be suitable for OT systems. The security measures or tools that 1386  work well with IT systems may not work effectively in the OT environment.  1387   Compensatory measures may be an effective solution to secure an OT system without 1388  affecting system performance.  1389   Protecting OT systems is critical, and a cybersecurity incident on an OT system may have 1390  catastrophic consequences that affect human life and the environment. 1391  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  34  3.3 OT Cybersecurity Program Content 1392  This section provides recommendations for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and 1393  continually improving an OT cybersecurity program. These recommendations, when 1394  implemented and maintained, provide a security roadmap that helps to manage OT cybersecurity 1395  risk. These recommendations are independent, which allows the organization to select 1396  approaches and technologies most suitable to their needs. 1397  An OT cybersecurity program typically tailors to a specific OT environment. An organization 1398  may have multiple sites, each with multiple specific OT environments. In such a situation, it is 1399  recommended that an organizational-level OT security program be defined whose 1400  recommendations cascade down and adapt to the needs of individual sites and OT environments.  1401  The effectiveness of an OT cybersecurity program is often enhanced through coordination or 1402  integration with the organization’s processes and information security program. The 1403  organizational information security program typically focuses on confidentiality, integrity, and 1404  availability, in that order, of information for the entire organization. Information security 1405  programs generally do not specifically address all the security and operational needs of an OT 1406  environment. In the OT environment, the focus is usually on safety, availability, integrity, and 1407  confidentiality, in that order. This difference in focus and priorities between IT and OT security 1408  programs should be kept in mind. NIST SP 800-100, Information Security Handbook: A Guide 1409  for Managers [SP800-100], provides a broad overview of information security program elements 1410  to assist in establishing and implementing an information security program in an organization. 1411  The lifespan of an OT system can exceed twenty years. As a result, many legacy systems may 1412  contain hardware and software that are no longer supported by the vendors and cannot be 1413  patched or updated to protect against known vulnerabilities. In that case, the security program 1414  should tailor to the unique characteristics of the legacy system to determine if the controls are 1415  applicable. In situations where security controls are not supported by the legacy OT system, 1416  compensating controls should be considered. For example, anti-malware software may not be 1417  available for systems such as PLCs and DCS, which means that malware protection requirements 1418  cannot be applied to these endpoints. In this case, a compensating control should be considered, 1419  e.g., using a firewall with deep packet inspection capability that can monitor and block advanced 1420  threats like malware, disabling unused ports in switches, or physically securing switches. 1421  The primary purpose of investing in a cybersecurity program is risk management. Risk to 1422  operations exists because of the potential of threat actors exploiting the vulnerabilities in the 1423  applications and infrastructures. Therefore, the most appropriate decision regarding what to 1424  include in the scope of a cybersecurity program can be made if investments in this program are 1425  viewed through the lens of corporate risk management. To help design and drive a cybersecurity 1426  program with a risk management perspective, the risk management framework defined by NIST 1427  800-37r2 [SP800-37r2] is used to define the core tasks and the processes for implementing a 1428  cybersecurity program. This is briefly summarized in the subsection “Implement an OT Security 1429  RMF” and further elaborated in Section 4. 1430  The OT cybersecurity program also needs to address policy exceptions and deviations. In a 1431  demanding OT environment, situations may arise that require a temporary deviation from the 1432  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  35  security policy in order to maintain the mission or goal of the OT system. Such deviations or 1433  exceptions must be handled with great care and receive approval from management and the 1434  cross-functional team. The security program can establish a policy and procedure for handling 1435  policy exceptions. All of these guidance documents recognize that one size does not fit all; 1436  rather, domain knowledge combined with site-specific constraints should be applied in adapting 1437  the guidance to the specific organization. 1438  3.3.1 Establish OT Cybersecurity Governance 1439  The governance should include policies, procedures, and processes to manage the organization’s 1440  regulatory, legal, risk, environmental, and operational requirements. The governance should 1441  ensure that the policies, procedures, and processes are well understood by the staff and inform 1442  the management of OT cybersecurity risk. To establish an effective OT cybersecurity 1443  governance capability, develop a process and assign the responsibility and accountability to the 1444  appropriate role in the corporate risk management function to ensure that the various elements of 1445  an OT cybersecurity program are operational and effective, and that it is integrated with the 1446  corporate risk management function. Typically, a cybersecurity governance process should 1447  include the following: 1448   Ensure that OT cybersecurity policy is established and communicated 1449   Ensure that OT cybersecurity roles and responsibilities are coordinated and aligned with 1450  internal roles and external partners 1451   Ensure that legal and regulatory requirements regarding OT cybersecurity, including privacy, 1452  are understood and managed 1453   Ensure that cybersecurity risks are integrated with corporate risk management processes  1454  Further guidance for establishing OT cybersecurity guidance can be found in Section 6. 1455  Additional details with specific examples for establishing a cybersecurity governance capability 1456  are also provided in NIST Internal Report (NISTIR) 8183A, Cybersecurity Framework 1457  Manufacturing Profile - Low Impact Level Example Implementations Guide [IR8183A]. 1458  3.3.2 Build and Train a Cross-Functional Team to Implement OT Cybersecurity 1459  Program 1460  It is essential for a cross-functional cybersecurity team to share their varied domain knowledge 1461  and experience to evaluate and manage risk in OT. The OT cybersecurity team should consist of 1462  representatives of the following departments: IT staff, control engineer, control system operator, 1463  security subject matter expert, and enterprise risk management. For completeness, the 1464  information security team should also include any cybersecurity service provider.  1465  From a safety perspective, there are serious consequences relating to major accident hazards and 1466  loss of containment due to equipment failure or operator mistakes. Cybersecurity is another 1467  threat to the safety and reliability of industrial processes, so including the safety experts as part 1468  of the cybersecurity team will be beneficial in identifying potential impact areas due to cyber 1469  vulnerabilities. Their insight into OT design and safety considerations will also help in 1470  formulating cyber mitigations.  1471  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  36  While the control engineers will play a large role in securing OT, they will not be able to do so 1472  without collaboration and support from both the IT department and management. IT often has 1473  years of cybersecurity experience, much of which is applicable to OT. As the cultures of control 1474  engineering and IT are often significantly different, their integration will be essential for the 1475  development of a collaborative security design and operation. 1476  Organizations come in various sizes, structures, geographical spread, and complexities. These 1477  factors along with strategies related to resources and budget constraints may drive organizations 1478  to hire OT cybersecurity resources as employees or contractors or outsource the OT security 1479  operation function as a managed security service. Irrespective of the security operation and 1480  resource model used, the responsibility for OT cybersecurity management should be integrated 1481  with IT cybersecurity and corporate risk management function.  1482  The responsibility and accountability for implementing and managing cybersecurity functions 1483  typically falls under the IT and OT infrastructure organization, whereas the cybersecurity 1484  operational metrics and risks are reported to the risk management office. These two lines of 1485  reporting structure need to collaborate in terms of funding and expectations of what can be 1486  achieved given a funding and resource level. The risk executive function works with executive 1487  management to decide on the risk tolerance and residual risk. 1488  As part of building a cybersecurity team, the following tasks should be included: 1489   Establish and maintain cybersecurity roles and responsibilities for building, operating, and 1490  improving an OT cybersecurity program. 1491   Establish cybersecurity roles and responsibilities for third-party providers. Third-party 1492  providers include, for example, service providers, contractors, and other organizations 1493  providing OT system development and services, and security operation and management. 1494  Further guidance for establishing a cross-functional team can be found in Section 4 and 1495  Appendix D. Additional details with specific examples for establishing a cross-functional team 1496  are also provided in NISTIR 8183A, Cybersecurity Framework Manufacturing Profile - Low 1497  Impact Level Example Implementations Guide [IR8183A]. 1498  3.3.3 Define OT Cybersecurity Strategy 1499  An organization-wide risk management strategy is foundational to developing an OT 1500  cybersecurity strategy.4 The OT cybersecurity strategy leverages the organization-wide risk 1501  management strategy, including organization-defined risk tolerance, threats, assumptions, 1502  constraints, priorities, and tradeoffs, to further tailor the strategy to apply to the OT cybersecurity 1503  program.  1504  4  For additional information on developing an organization-wide risk management strategy, refer to NIST SP 800-37 [SP800-  37r2], Prepare Step, Task P-2, Risk Management Strategy. Section 3 provides additional information on organization-level  system-level task to prepare for implementing the NIST Risk Management Framework.  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  37  The OT cybersecurity strategy: 1505   Refines and supplements, as necessary, guidance from the organization-wide risk 1506  management strategy to address OT-specific constraints and requirements 1507   Identifies the OT cybersecurity team and personnel 1508   Addresses the OT cybersecurity operation model: insource, outsource, and/or use managed 1509  security services 1510   Outlines the appropriate cybersecurity architecture for the various OT sites within the OT 1511  program 1512   Defines OT-specific cybersecurity training and awareness 1513  The OT cybersecurity strategy should help refine the organizational risk tolerance for the OT 1514  operation. The acceptable risk tolerance for OT drives the priorities for the OT cybersecurity 1515  operation. The program should address both IT and OT concerns and requirements; for example, 1516  IT may concern data loss or system availability as a higher priority, but OT may value system 1517  safety, production efficiency, and environmental damage as higher priorities.  1518  Further guidance for developing an OT cybersecurity strategy can be found in Section 5, Section 1519  6, Appendix C and Appendix D. Additional details and specific examples for establishing an OT 1520  cybersecurity strategy are also provided in NISTIR 8183A, Cybersecurity Framework 1521  Manufacturing Profile - Low Impact Level Example Implementations Guide [IR8183A]. 1522  3.3.4 Define OT-Specific Policies and Procedures 1523  Policies and procedures are essential to the success of a cybersecurity program. OT-specific 1524  security policies and procedures should be derived from existing IT cybersecurity and plant 1525  operational policies and procedures where possible for consistency throughout the organization.  1526  As discussed earlier, organizational management is responsible for developing and 1527  communicating the risk tolerance level of the organization—the level of risk the organization is 1528  willing to accept—which allows the OT cybersecurity manager to determine the risk 1529  management strategy. The development of the cybersecurity policies should be based on a risk 1530  assessment that will set the security priorities and goals for the organization so that the risks 1531  posed by cyber threats are managed sufficiently. Procedures that support the policies need to be 1532  developed so that the policies are implemented fully and properly for the OT. Cybersecurity 1533  procedures should be documented, tested, and updated periodically in response to policy, 1534  technology, and threat changes. 1535  Further guidance for developing OT-specific policies and procedures can be found in Section 6. 1536  Additional details with examples of establishing OT-specific policies and procedures are also 1537  provided in NISTIR 8183A, Cybersecurity Framework Manufacturing Profile - Low Impact 1538  Level Example Implementations Guide [IR8183A]. 1539  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  38  3.3.5 Establish Cybersecurity Awareness Training Program for OT Organization 1540  Organizations should ensure that all personnel, including employees, contractors, consultants, 1541  and vendors, who interact with OT systems receive cybersecurity training that is relevant for the 1542  OT environment. This training is in addition to IT cybersecurity awareness training. This training 1543  is necessary to inform the OT personnel who interact with OT systems that their actions have the 1544  potential to impact the security and safety of the OT system and personnel. This training is used 1545  to inform personnel of basic cybersecurity principles and the steps they need to follow when 1546  interacting with OT systems. Cybersecurity awareness training should be required for new 1547  employees at the time of hire and on regular intervals as dictated by the regulatory requirements 1548  and organizational policies. 1549  Further guidance for OT cybersecurity awareness training can be found in Section 6 and 1550  Appendix D. Additional details with specific examples for OT cybersecurity awareness training 1551  are also provided in NISTIR 8183A, Cybersecurity Framework Manufacturing Profile - Low 1552  Impact Level Example Implementations Guide [IR8183A]. 1553  3.3.6 Implement a Risk Management Framework for OT 1554  OT system risk is another risk confronting an organization (e.g., financial, safety, environmental, 1555  IT). In each case, managers with responsibility for the mission or business function establish and 1556  conduct a risk management program in coordination with senior management. NIST SP 800-39, 1557  Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and Information System View 1558  [SP800-39] provides a framework for an enterprise-level risk management program, which is 1559  detailed in Section 4 of this document. OT personnel should be involved in developing the OT 1560  cybersecurity risk management program and communicating with senior management. 1561  NIST SP 800-37, Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations: A 1562  System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy [SP800-37r2] provides a structured process 1563  for managing security and privacy risk. This includes preparing for organization-wide risk 1564  management; system categorization; control selection, implementation, and assessment; system 1565  and common control authorizations; and continuous monitoring.  1566  Applying the Risk Management Framework (RMF) to OT systems is detailed in Section 4. 1567  3.3.7 Develop Maintenance Tracking Capability 1568  Establish processes and implement tools to ensure that routine and preventative maintenance and 1569  repairs (both local and remote) of OT assets are performed consistent with OT organizations 1570  policies and procedures. The tools used for maintenance logging and tracking should be 1571  controlled and managed. Ensure that the processes and tools allow scheduling, authorizing, 1572  tracking, monitoring, and auditing maintenance and repair activities for OT assets. If the ability 1573  for remote maintenance is required, ensure that the remote access tool supports authentication of 1574  maintenance personnel, connection establishment at the beginning of maintenance activities and 1575  immediate teardown once the maintenance activities are performed. Also ensure that the tool can 1576  log the remote maintenance activities performed. 1577  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  39  Further guidance for OT maintenance tracking can be found in Section 6. Additional details with 1578  specific examples for OT maintenance tracking are also provided in NISTIR 8183A, 1579  Cybersecurity Framework Manufacturing Profile - Low Impact Level Example Implementations 1580  Guide [IR8183A]. 1581  3.3.8 Develop Incident Response Capability 1582  Organizations should establish an OT cybersecurity incident response (IR) function that should 1583  include planning, detection, analysis, containment, and reporting activities in the case of a 1584  cybersecurity incident. The IR function requires the establishment of several cybersecurity 1585  capabilities, including incident management, forensic analysis, vulnerability management, and 1586  response communication. As part of building the IR function, the OT cybersecurity department 1587  should create an incident response plan. The purpose of the incident response capability is to 1588  determine the scope and risk of cybersecurity incidents, respond appropriately to the incident, 1589  communicate the incident with all stakeholders, and reduce the future impact. This plan applies 1590  to all OT personnel, networks, systems, and data. The IR plan guides the activities of the 1591  cybersecurity team to respond, communicate, and coordinate in the event of a cybersecurity 1592  incident. Without such a plan, the organization will find it extremely difficult to respond when a 1593  cybersecurity incident occurs. The plan includes the roles and responsibilities of personnel, the 1594  incident response workflow, incident type and severity classification, contacts of critical 1595  personnel who should be involved, contacts of external entities that may be useful in assisting 1596  with IR, information sharing policy, and internal and external communication. 1597  Further guidance for OT incident response can be found in Section 6.2.4.5 and Appendix C. 1598  Additional details with specific examples for OT incident response are also provided in NISTIR 1599  8183A, Cybersecurity Framework Manufacturing Profile – Low Impact Level Example 1600  Implementations Guide [IR8183A]. 1601  3.3.9 Develop Recovery and Restoration Capability 1602  The organization should establish the capability to recover from cybersecurity incidents and to 1603  restore the assets and services that were impaired by the cybersecurity incident to pre-cyber-1604  incident state. This capability typically includes the following tasks: 1605   Define recovery objectives when recovering from disruptions. For example, the recovery 1606  capability shall prioritize human safety and environmental safety prior to restarting the OT 1607  operation that was impaired by the cybersecurity event. 1608   Develop a site disaster recovery plan (DRP) and business continuity plan (BCP) or both to 1609  prepare the OT organization to respond appropriately to significant disruptions in their 1610  operation due to the cybersecurity incident. 1611   Establish backup systems and processes to back up the relevant OT systems’ state, data, 1612  configuration files, and programs at regular intervals to support recovery to a stable state. 1613   Establish processes for restoring relevant OT systems’ state, data, configuration files, and 1614  programs from backups in a timely manner. 1615  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  40   Establish recovery processes and procedures that will be executed to restore OT assets and 1616  services affected by cybersecurity incidents. 1617   Establish communication plans to coordinate restoration activities with internal and external 1618  stakeholders and executive management team. 1619   Establish communication plans to manage public relations. 1620   Establish a lessons learned task as part of the recovery process for continuous improvement 1621  of the cybersecurity capabilities – vulnerability management, cybersecurity operation, 1622  incident response handling, and recovery handling. 1623   Test these plans at reasonable intervals that are appropriate for the organization. 1624  Further guidance for OT recovery and restoration can be found in Section 6. Additional details 1625  with specific examples for OT recovery and restoration are also provided in NISTIR 8183A, 1626  Cybersecurity Framework Manufacturing Profile - Low Impact Level Example Implementations 1627  Guide [IR8183A]. 1628  3.3.10 Summary of OT Cybersecurity Program Content 1629  The elements of a cybersecurity program and the various considerations for establishing such a 1630  program have been presented in this section. Further guidance for establishing the elements of a 1631  cybersecurity program can be found in the document sections listed in Table 2.  1632  Table 2: Sections with additional guidance on establishing a cybersecurity program 1633  Cybersecurity Program Element Section Number for Additional  Guidance  Establish OT Cybersecurity Governance Section 6  Build and Train a Cross-Functional Team to Implement OT  Cybersecurity Program Section 4, Appendix D  Define OT Cybersecurity Strategy Section 5, 6, Appendix C, D  Define OT-Specific Policies and Procedures Section 6  Establish Cybersecurity Awareness Training Program for OT  Organization Section 6, Appendix D  Implement a Risk Management Framework for OT Section 4, 6, Appendix C, D  Develop Maintenance Tracking Capability Section 6  Develop Incident Response Capability Section 6, Appendix C  Develop Recovery and Restoration Capability Section 6  1634  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  41  4 Risk Management for OT Systems  1635  Organizations manage risk every day when meeting their business objectives. These risks may 1636  include financial, equipment failure, and personnel safety, to name just a few. Organizations 1637  develop processes to evaluate the risks associated with their business and to decide how to 1638  manage those risks based on organizational priorities, risk tolerance, and internal and external 1639  constraints. This management of risk is conducted as an interactive ongoing process as part of 1640  normal operations. Organizations that use OT systems have historically managed risk through 1641  good practices in safety and engineering. Safety assessments are well established in most sectors 1642  and are often incorporated into regulatory requirements. Information security risk management is 1643  an added dimension that can be complementary. The risk management process and framework 1644  outlined in this section can be applied to managing safety, information security, and cyber supply 1645  chain risk. Privacy is also a risk consideration for some OT systems. For additional guidance on 1646  privacy risk management, refer to the NIST Risk Management Framework and the Privacy 1647  Framework. 1648  A risk management process is employed throughout an organization using a three-level approach 1649  to address risk at the (i) organization level; (ii) mission/business process level; and (iii) system 1650  level (IT and OT). The risk management process is carried out seamlessly across the three levels 1651  with the overall objective of continuous improvement in the organization’s risk-related activities 1652  and effective inter-tier and intra-tier communication among all stakeholders having a shared 1653  interest in the mission/business success of the organization.  1654  This section focuses primarily on OT system considerations at the system level; however, the 1655  risk management activities, information, and artifacts at each level impact and inform the other 1656  levels. Section 6 applies the Cybersecurity Framework to OT systems, while Appendix F 1657  provides OT-specific recommendations to augment NIST SP 800-53, Revision 5 [SP800-53r5] 1658  control families. Throughout the following discussion of risk management, OT system 1659  considerations and the impact that these considerations have on the risk management process are 1660  discussed.  1661  For more information on multi-tiered risk management and the risk management process, refer to 1662  NIST SP 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission and Information 1663  System View [SP800-39]. NIST SP 800-37 Revision 2, Risk Management Framework for 1664  Information Systems and Organizations: A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy 1665  [SP800-37r2] provides guidelines for applying the Risk Management Framework to federal 1666  information systems to include conducting the activities of security categorization,5 security 1667  control selection and implementation, security control assessment, information system 1668  authorization,6 and security control monitoring. NIST SP 800-30, Guide for Conducting Risk 1669  Assessments [SP800-30r1] provides a step-by-step process for organizations on: (i) how to 1670  prepare for risk assessments; (ii) how to conduct risk assessments; (iii) how to communicate risk 1671  5  Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 199 [FIPS199] provides security categorization guidance for non-national  security systems. Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) Instruction 1253 provides similar guidance for national  security systems.  6  Security authorization is the official management decision given by a senior organizational official to authorize operation of  an information system and to explicitly accept the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other  organizations, and the Nation based on the implementation of an agreed-upon set of security controls.  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  42  assessment results to key organizational personnel; and (iv) how to maintain the risk assessments 1672  over time. 1673  4.1 Managing OT Security Risk  1674  While the risk management process presented in NIST SP 800-39 applies to all types of systems, 1675  there are some unique aspects to consider when it comes to managing OT system security risk. 1676  As shown in Figure 13, the risk management process has four components: framing risk (i.e., 1677  establishing the context for risk-based decisions), assessing risk, responding to risk, and 1678  monitoring risk. These activities are interdependent and often occur simultaneously within an 1679  organization. For example, the results of the monitoring component will feed into the framing 1680  component. As the environment in which organizations operate is always changing, risk 1681  management must be a continuous process where all components have ongoing activities. It is 1682  important to remember that these components apply to the management of any type of risk, 1683  including cybersecurity, physical security, safety, and financial. Sections 4.1.1 through 4.1.4 1684  discuss the four components of the risk management process in further detail and provide OT-1685  specific implementation guidance.  1686  1687  Figure 13: Risk Management Process: Frame, Assess, Respond, Monitor 1688  Organization-wide risk management is applied at three levels, as Figure 14 depicts. Level 1 1689  addresses risk management from the organizational perspective and implements risk framing by 1690  providing context for all risk management activities within the organization. Level 2 addresses 1691  risk from a mission/business process perspective and is informed by the Level 1 risk context, 1692  decisions, and activities. Level 3 addresses risk at the system level and is informed by the Level 1693  1 and 2 activities and outputs.  1694  FRAME  ASSESS  RESPONDMONITOR  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  43  1695  Figure 14: Risk Management Levels: Organization, Mission/Business Process, and System 1696  Together, each of the risk management components (i.e., frame, assess, respond, and monitor) 1697  are applied across the risk management levels, resulting in organization-wide risk awareness and 1698  traceability and transparency of risk-based decisions.  1699  4.1.1 Framing OT Risk  1700  The framing component consists of the processes for establishing the required assumptions, 1701  constraints, risk tolerances, and risk management strategies for organizations to make consistent 1702  risk management decisions. Specifically, risk framing supports the overall risk management 1703  strategy by incorporating elements from the organizational governance structure, legal/regulatory 1704  environment, and other factors to establish how the organization intends to assess, respond to, 1705  and monitor risk to all IT and OT systems.  1706  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  For OT system operators, safety is the major consideration that directly affects decisions on  how systems are engineered and operated. Safety can be defined as “freedom from conditions  that can cause death, injury, occupational illness, damage to or loss of equipment or property,  or damage to the environment.”7 Based on this, human safety impacts are typically evaluated  based on the degree of injury, disease, or death possible from the resulting OT system  malfunction from the cyber incident, taking into consideration any previously performed  safety impact assessments performed by the organization regarding the employees and the  7  https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/safety  Strategic  Focus  Tac�cal  Focus  Level 1 Organiza�on  Level 2 Mission / Business Process  Level 3 System (Environment of Opera�on)  More detailed and granular risk perspective  Broad-based risk perspective  https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/safety  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  44  public. The importance of safety and developing/ensuring a safety culture plays a critical role  in the determination of risk tolerance.  Organizations should consider incorporating an analysis of cybersecurity effects on OT  systems that impact environmental and personnel safety and mitigating controls. More  specifically, organizations may want to consider having a comprehensive process to  systematically predict or identify the operational behavior of each safety-critical failure  condition, fault condition, or human error that could lead to a hazard and potential human  harm.  Organizations may also want to consider the impact of legacy systems and components on  their environment. Specifically, legacy systems may be unable to adequately support  cybersecurity to prevent risks from exceeding organization tolerance levels.  Another major concern for OT system operators is typically the availability of services  provided by the OT system. The OT system may be part of critical infrastructure (for example,  water or power systems), where there is a significant need for continuous and reliable  operations. As a result, OT systems may have strict requirements for availability or recovery.  Organizations should understand and plan for the level(s) of redundancy required to achieve  the desired resilience levels for their operating environments and incorporate these  requirements into the risk framing. This may help organizations make risk decisions that avoid  unintended consequences on those who depend on the services provided. More specifically,  organizations consider identifying interdependent OT systems that pose cybersecurity risks  that threaten system availability.  Additionally, organizations may want to consider how an incident could propagate to a  connected system and system components. An OT may be interconnected with other systems,  such that failures in one system or process can easily cascade to other systems either within or  outside the organization. Impact propagation could occur due to both physical and logical  dependencies. Proper communication of the results of risk assessments to the operators of  connected or interdependent systems and processes is one way to manage such impacts.  Logical damage to an interconnected OT could occur if the cyber incident propagated to the  connected OT systems. An example could be if a virus or worm propagated to a connected OT  and then impacted that system. Physical damage could also propagate to other interconnected  OT. If an incident impacts the physical environment of an OT, it may also impact other related  physical domains. For example, the impact could result in a physical hazard which degrades  nearby physical environments. Additionally, the impact could also degrade common shared  dependencies (e.g., power supply) or result in a shortage of material needed for a later stage in  an industrial process.  CISA serves to promote a cohesive effort between government and industry that will improve 1707  CISA’s ability to anticipate, prioritize, and manage national-level OT risk. CISA assists OT 1708  systems’ vendors and asset owners, operators, and vendors across all critical infrastructure 1709  sectors to identify security vulnerabilities and develop sound, proactive mitigation strategies that 1710  strengthen their OT systems’ cybersecurity posture. 1711  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  45  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Organizations may want to consider incorporating resources such as the NIST National  Vulnerability Database (NVD) and the MITRE ATT&CK for Industrial Control Systems  (ICS) framework [ATTACK-ICS] into their processes for assessing risks to the mission and  OT systems. Additionally, the nature of OT systems requires organizations to consider  additional factors that might not exist when conducting risk assessment for a traditional IT  system. For example, OT will have different threat sources, vulnerabilities, and compensating  controls than IT. Organizations may also need to consider that the impact of a cyber incident  in an OT environment may include both physical and digital effects and, therefore, the risk  assessments need to incorporate these additional effects, including:   Impacts on safety and use of safety assessments   Physical impact of a cyber incident on an OT, including the larger physical environment,  and the effect on the process controlled   The consequences for risk assessments of non-digital control components within an OT  1712  During risk framing, organizations should also select appropriate risk assessment 1713  methodology(ies) that include OT. When evaluating the potential physical damage from a cyber 1714  incident, organizations with OT systems may consider: i) how a cyber incident could manipulate 1715  the operation to impact the physical environment; ii) what design features exist in the OT system 1716  to prevent or mitigate an impact; and iii) how a physical incident could emerge based on these 1717  conditions.  1718  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  When framing risks within an OT environment, organizations may discover that cybersecurity  threats are not always as well understood or predictable as OT hazards. Organizations may  consider incorporating cyber-attack and IT failure scenarios into their Process Hazard Analysis  (PHA) or Failure Mode & Effects Analysis (FMEA) processes. By including risks due to  cyber-attacks and cyber risk management measures in these processes, organizations may gain  a better understanding of the cyber risks to the OT operation environment.  As part of risk framing, organizations may also need to consider:   Assumptions about how risk is assessed, responded to, and monitored across the  organization; and   The risk tolerance for the organization, the level of risk that can be accepted as part of  achieving strategic goals and objectives, and the priorities and trade-offs considered as part  of managing risk.  In the context of OT, the potential for damage to equipment, human safety, the natural  environment, and other critical infrastructures is part of these considerations. Organizations  may need to consider evaluating the potential physical impacts for all parts of an OT system.  https://nvd.nist.gov/ https://nvd.nist.gov/ https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  46  Additionally, to support risk framing, organizations may also need to determine how OT  systems interact or depend on IT. These processes may require organizations to identify a  common framework for evaluating impacts that incorporate OT considerations. One approach  is based on NIST FIPS 199, which specifies that systems are categorized as low-impact,  moderate-impact, or high-impact for the security objectives of confidentiality, integrity, and  availability [FIPS199]. Another approach, based on ISA 62443-3-2 [ISA62443], provides  example definitions for assisting organizations with determining a system categorization  utilizing OT impacts.  1719  Table 3 provides possible example categories and impact levels organizations may customize to 1720  meet their specific industry or business requirements. For example, some organizations may see 1721  an outage lasting up to one day as a High Impact instead of Moderate as shown in the table. 1722  Table 3: Possible Definitions for OT Impact Levels Based on Product Produced, Industry, and Security 1723  Concerns 1724  Category High Moderate Low  Outage at Multiple  Sites  Significant disruption to  operations at multiple sites  with restoration expected to  require one or more days  Operational disruptions at  multiple sites, with  restoration expecting to  require more than one hour  Partially disrupted  operations at multiple sites,  with restoration to full  capability requiring less  than one hour  National  Infrastructure and  Services  Impacts multiple sectors or  disrupts community  services in a major way  Potential to impact sector at  a level beyond the  company  Little to no impact to  sectors beyond the  individual company; little to  no impact on community  Cost (% of Revenue) > 25% > 5% < 5%  Legal  Felony criminal offense or  compliance violation  affecting license to operate  Misdemeanor criminal  offense or compliance  violation resulting in fines  None  Public Confidence Loss of brand image Loss of customer  confidence None  People Onsite Fatality Loss of workday or major  injury First aid or recordable injury  People Offsite Fatality or major community  incident  Complaints or local  community impact No complaints  Environment  Citation by regional agency  or long-term significant  damage over large area  Citation by local agency Small, contained release  below reportable limits  1725  To support the risk assessment process, organizations should also define how the likelihood of 1726  occurrence for cybersecurity events will be determined to maintain consistency when assessing 1727  risks. NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 [SP800-30r1] provides guidance for organizations to develop 1728  likelihood weighted risk factors. Organizations should consider weighting risk factors based on 1729  an analysis of the probability that a given threat is capable of exploiting a given vulnerability (or 1730  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  47  set of vulnerabilities); the threat event will be initiated; and the threat event will result in adverse 1731  impacts.  1732  For adversarial threats, an assessment of likelihood of occurrence is typically based on adversary 1733  intent, capability, and targeting. For other than adversarial threat events, the likelihood of 1734  occurrence is estimated using historical evidence, empirical data, or other factors. In some 1735  situations, organizations may find that there is minimal organizational historical data. In these 1736  cases, organizations may want to consider extending their analysis to consider industry-specific 1737  data that may describe cybersecurity events reported for similar organizations.  1738  The likelihood of threat occurrence can also be based on the state of the organization (including 1739  for example, its core mission/business processes, enterprise architecture, information security 1740  architecture, information systems, and environments in which those systems operate)—taking 1741  into consideration predisposing conditions and the presence and effectiveness of deployed 1742  security controls to protect against unauthorized/undesirable behavior, detect and limit damage, 1743  and/or other resiliency factors for the OT capabilities. 1744  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Organizations establishing definitions for event likelihood may want to review Appendix G of  SP 800-30 Rev. 1 for more detailed guidance and suggestions. Based on this guidance,  organizations should consider defining five levels of likelihood (from Very Low to Very High)  based on both adversarial (intentional threat actors) and non-adversarial (errors, accidents, acts  of nature, etc.) events. Additionally, organizations will want to establish definitions for the  likelihood an event will result in an adverse impact. Using these two factors, organizations can  establish a heat map like the one depicted in Table 4 to determine the likelihood factor for  supporting the risk analysis.  1745  Table 4: Event Likelihood Evaluation 1746  Likelihood of  Threat Event  Initiation or  Occurrence  Likelihood Threat Events Result in Adverse Impacts  Very Low Low Moderate High Very High  Very High Low Moderate High Very High Very High  High Low Moderate Moderate High Very High  Moderate Low Low Moderate Moderate High  Low Very Low Low Low Moderate Moderate  Very Low Very Low Very Low Low Low Low  1747  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  48  4.1.2 Assessing Risk in the OT Environment  1748  Leveraging the outputs of framing risk, such as acceptable risk assessment methodologies, risk 1749  management strategy, and risk tolerance, risk assessments are conducted to facilitate efforts to 1750  identify, estimate, and prioritize risks to operations, assets, individuals, and other organizations. 1751  Risk assessments occur at all risk management levels (i.e., organization, mission/business 1752  function, and system) and can be used to inform risk assessments at other levels. Regardless of 1753  which risk management level the risk assessment is conducted at, assessing risk requires 1754  identifying threats and vulnerabilities, the harm that such threats and vulnerabilities may cause, 1755  and the likelihood that adverse events arising from those threats and vulnerabilities may occur.  1756  When the organization conducts a risk assessment that includes OT systems, there may be 1757  additional considerations that do not exist when doing a risk assessment of traditional IT 1758  systems. Because the impact of a cyber incident in an OT may include both physical and digital 1759  effects, risk assessments need to incorporate those potential effects.  1760  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Organizations need to consider that risk assessments are typically point-in-time reports. As a  result, organizations should ensure that they are updated to remain current and that the security  level remains adequate.  Organizations may want to review the information provided by CISA’s Alerts and Advisories,  NIST NVD, and MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework to identify common vulnerability areas  for OT environments, such as:   Poor coding practices, network designs, or device configurations   Vulnerable network services and protocols   Weak authentication   Excessive privileges   Information disclosure  1761  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  The physical operating environment is another aspect that organizations should consider when  working with an OT system. OT systems often have specific environmental requirements (e.g.,  a manufacturing process may require a precise temperature), or they may be tied to their  physical environment for operations. Organizations may want to consider incorporating these  requirements and constraints in the framing component so that the risks arising from these  constraints are identified and considered. Additionally, organizations may want to consider:   Identifying the physical assets and security controls that directly relate to safety, human  life, and maintaining continuity of operations of the OT system  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  49   Identifying the cybersecurity risks associated with physical assets that could threaten OT  system functionality   Ensure that physical security personnel understand the relative risks and physical security  countermeasures associated with the OT system environments they protect   Ensure that physical security personnel are aware of which areas of an OT system  production environment house data acquisition and operate in sensitive spaces   Mitigate business continuity risk by specifying immediate response plans if physical safety  is jeopardized  Risk assessments also require reviewing digital and non-digital mechanisms implemented to 1762  minimize adverse event impacts. OT systems often incorporate non-digital mechanisms to 1763  provide fault tolerance and prevent the OT from acting outside of acceptable parameters. 1764  Therefore, these non-digital mechanisms may help reduce any negative impact that a digital 1765  incident on the OT might have and are incorporated into the risk assessment process. For 1766  example, OT often have non-digital control mechanisms that can prevent the OT from operating 1767  outside of a safe boundary, and thereby limit the impact of an attack (e.g., a mechanical relief 1768  pressure valve). In addition, analog mechanisms (e.g., meters, alarms) can be used to observe the 1769  physical system state to provide operators with reliable data if digital readings are unavailable or 1770  corrupted. Table 5 categorizes non-digital control mechanisms that could reduce the impact of an 1771  OT incident.  1772  Table 5: Categories of Non-Digital OT Control Components 1773  Control Type Description  Analog Displays  or Alarms  Non-digital mechanisms that measure and display the state of the physical system (e.g.,  temperature, pressure, voltage, current) and can provide the operator with accurate  information in situations when digital displays are unavailable or corrupted. The information  may be provided to the operator on some non-digital display (e.g., thermometers, pressure  gauges) and through audible alarms.  Manual Control  Mechanisms  Manual control mechanisms (e.g., manual valve controls, physical breaker switches) provide  operators with the ability to manually control an actuator without relying on the digital OT  system. This ensures that an actuator can be controlled even if the OT system is unavailable  or compromised.  Analog Control  Systems  Analog control systems use non-digital sensors and actuators to monitor and control a  physical process. These may be able to prevent the physical process from entering an  undesired state in situations when the digital OT system is unavailable or corrupted. Analog  controls include devices such as regulators, governors, and electromechanical relays.  An example is a device that is designed to open during emergency or abnormal conditions to  prevent rise of internal fluid pressure in excess of a specified value, thus bringing the process  to a safer state. The device also may be designed to prevent excessive internal vacuum. The  device may be a pressure relief valve, a non-reclosing pressure relief device (e.g., rupture  disc), or a vacuum relief valve.  1774  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  50  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Organizations should consider the potential impact that a cyber incident may have on OT by  analyzing all digital and non-digital control mechanisms and the extent to which they can  mitigate potential negative impacts to the OT. There are multiple considerations when  considering the possible mitigation effects of digital and non-digital control mechanisms, such  as how non-digital control mechanisms may require additional time and human involvement to  perform necessary monitoring or control functions. For example, such mechanisms may  require operators to travel to a remote site to perform certain control functions. Such  mechanisms may also depend on human response times, which may be slower than automated  controls.  1775  Additionally, organizations may need to consider privacy with their risk assessment. Privacy risk 1776  assessments sometime require a different approach, so organizations may want to consider 1777  utilizing the NIST Privacy Risk Assessment Methodology (PRAM)—a tool that applies the risk 1778  model from NISTIR 8062 [IR8062] and helps organizations analyze, assess, and prioritize 1779  privacy risks to determine how to respond and select appropriate solutions. 1780  4.1.3 Responding to Risk in an OT Environment 1781  The risk response component provides an organization-wide response to risk in accordance with 1782  the risk framing component (e.g., identify possible courses of actions to address risk, evaluate 1783  those possibilities considering the organization’s risk tolerance and other considerations 1784  determined during framing, and choose the best alternative for the organization). The response 1785  component includes the implementation of the chosen course of action to address the identified 1786  risk: acceptance, avoidance, mitigation, sharing, transfer, or any combination of those options.8  1787  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  For an OT system, available risk responses may be constrained by system requirements,  potential adverse impact on operations, or even regulatory compliance regimes. An example of  risk sharing is when utilities enter into agreements to “loan” line workers in an emergency,  which reduces the duration of the effect of an incident to acceptable levels.  1788  4.1.4 Monitoring Risk in an OT Environment 1789  Monitoring risk is the fourth component of the risk management activities. Organizations 1790  monitor risk on an ongoing basis, including the implementation of chosen risk management 1791  strategies; changes in the environment that may affect the risk calculation; and the effectiveness 1792  and efficiency of risk reduction activities. The activities in the monitoring component impact all 1793  the other components. 1794  8  For additional information on these options, refer to NIST SP 800-39 [SP800-39].  https://www.nist.gov/privacy-framework/nist-pram  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  51  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Many OT system monitoring capabilities leverage passive monitoring techniques to detect  system changes; however, this may not always capture all modifications to the system.  Modern monitoring platforms that leverage native protocol communications to access more  system information may improve awareness, but the limitations of these OT systems must be  understood. Often OT systems are implemented with an undefined frequency for monitoring  cyber activities. Users should set a frequency in accordance with the respective risk profile.  Threat information as it relates to the OT environment is evolving, and the availability and  accuracy of this threat information is early in its development. By their nature, threats may be  difficult to accurately predict even with historical data. Organizations should categorize threats  based on the likelihood of occurrence and their potential consequences. For example, the  threat of an internet-connected system being scanned would have a high likelihood and a low- severity consequence. Another example might be the threat of a nation-state actor disrupting a  supply chain. This threat may have low likelihood and high-severity consequences to the  organization.  Since security countermeasures are typically developed for IT environments, organizations  should consider how deploying security technologies into OT environments might negatively  impact operations or safety.  4.2 Special Areas for Consideration  1795  4.2.1 Supply Chain Risk Management 1796  Cybersecurity risks can arise from products or services acquired to support OT needs. These 1797  risks can be introduced anywhere in the supply chain and at any stage across the life cycle. These 1798  risks—whether malicious, natural, or unintentional—have the potential to compromise the 1799  availability and integrity of critical OT systems and components, and the availability, integrity, 1800  and confidentiality of the data utilized by the OT, causing harms ranging from minor disruption 1801  to life-safety impacts.  1802  With few exceptions, organizations with responsibility for OT rely upon suppliers and other 1803  third-party providers and their extended supply chains for a range of needs. These supply-side 1804  organizations perform critical roles and functions, to include manufacturing and provisioning 1805  technology products, providing software upgrades and patches, performing integration services, 1806  or otherwise supporting day-to-day operations and maintenance of OT systems, components, and 1807  operational environments. For this reason, it is necessary and important that OT organizations 1808  should seek to understand and mitigate the supply chain-related risk that can be inherited from 1809  these supply-side organizations and the products and services they provide.  1810  Identifying, assessing, and effectively responding to cybersecurity risks in supply chains is best 1811  accomplished by incorporating cybersecurity supply chain risk management (C-SCRM) 1812  considerations into organizational policies, plans, and practices. This includes extending 1813  cybersecurity expectations and requirements to vendors and gaining better understanding, 1814  visibility, and control over the supply chains that are associated with acquired products and 1815  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  52  services. Vetting suppliers and service providers should be done to ascertain their capabilities, 1816  trustworthiness, the adequacy of their internal security practices, and the effectiveness of 1817  safeguards, and to understand their supply chain relationships and any risks that may be 1818  associated with those relationships and dependencies. Requirements for and evaluation of 1819  products and discrete components should go beyond an assessment of whether functional and 1820  technical requirements are satisfied and address applicable C-SCRM factors such as, but not 1821  limited to, a product’s provenance, pedigree, and composition, and whether the product is taint-1822  free and authentic. Additionally, special consideration should be given to how difficult it may be 1823  to attain original replacement parts or updates over the life of the product and how diverse the 1824  sources of supply are and may be in the future. 1825  OT organizations should familiarize themselves with NIST SP 800-161, Supply Chain Risk 1826  Management Practices for Federal Information Systems and Organizations [SP800-161] and 1827  begin, or continue, implementing the key practices, C-SCRM security controls, and C-SCRM 1828  risk management process activities described in the publication. For organizations at the early 1829  stage of establishing a C-SCRM program, there is extensive guidance about how to go about 1830  doing this in a phased approach that begins with putting the foundational elements in place, then 1831  matures and expands upon this foundation over time to ensure sustained effectiveness and the 1832  ability to enhance program capabilities. There is also guidance about conducting supply chain 1833  risk assessments, incorporating C-SCRM into procurement requirements, the importance of an 1834  integrated and inter-disciplinary risk management approach, and supplemental C-SCRM security 1835  control guidance, as well as templates that organizations can leverage. 1836  4.2.2 Safety Systems  1837  The culture of safety and safety assessments is well established within much of the OT user 1838  community. Information security risk assessments should be complementary to such 1839  assessments, though they may use different approaches and cover different areas. Safety 1840  assessments are concerned primarily with the physical world. Information security risk 1841  assessments primarily look at the digital world. However, in an OT environment, the physical 1842  and the digital are intertwined, and significant overlap may occur. 1843  It is important that organizations consider all aspects of risk management for safety (e.g., risk 1844  framing, risk tolerances), as well as the safety assessment results, when carrying out risk 1845  assessments for information security. The personnel responsible for the information security risk 1846  assessment must be able to identify and communicate identified risks that could have safety 1847  implications. Conversely, the personnel charged with safety assessments must be familiar with 1848  the potential physical impacts and their likelihood developed by the information security risk 1849  assessment process. 1850  Safety systems may also reduce the impact of a cyber incident to the OT. Safety systems are 1851  often deployed to perform specific monitoring and control functions to ensure the safety of 1852  people, the environment, process, and assets. While these systems are traditionally implemented 1853  to be fully redundant and independent from the primary OT, some architectures combine control 1854  and safety functions, components, or networks. Combining control and safety could allow a 1855  sophisticated attacker access to both control and safety systems if the OT were compromised. 1856  Ensure adequate separation of components consistent with the risk of compromise. Evaluate the 1857  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  53  impact of the implemented security controls on the safety system to determine if they negatively 1858  impact the system. 1859  4.3 Applying the Risk Management Framework for OT Systems  1860  The NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) applies the risk management process and 1861  concepts (framing risk, assessing risk, responding to risk, and monitoring risk) to systems and 1862  organizations. The following subsections describe the process of applying the RMF to OT and 1863  include a brief description of each step and task, the intended outcome of each task, task 1864  mappings to other standards and guidelines applicable to OT (e.g., the Cybersecurity Framework 1865  and IEC 62443), and OT-specific implementation guidance. Some tasks are optional, and not all 1866  tasks include OT-specific considerations or guidance.  1867  The RMF steps in Figure 15, while shown sequentially, can be implemented in a different order 1868  to be consistent with established management and system development life cycle processes. 1869  1870  Figure 15: Risk Management Framework Steps 1871  4.3.1 Prepare  1872  The purpose of the Prepare step is to carry out essential activities at the organization, mission 1873  and business process, and system levels of the organization to help prepare the organization to 1874  manage its security and privacy risks using the RMF.

TASK P-18  SYSTEM REGISTRATION  The system is registered for purposes of  management, accountability, coordination, and  oversight.  [Cybersecurity Framework: ID.GV]  1880  4.3.2 Categorize 1881  In the Categorize step, the potential adverse impact of the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and 1882  availability of the information and system is determined. For each information type and system 1883  under consideration, the three security objectives—confidentiality, integrity, and availability—1884  are associated with one of three levels of potential impact should there be a breach of security. It 1885  is important to remember that for an OT, availability is generally the greatest concern. The 1886  standards and guidance for this categorization process can be found in FIPS 199 [FIPS199] and 1887  NIST SP 800-60 [SP800-60v1r1][SP800-60v2r1], respectively.  1888  The following OT example is taken from FIPS 199: 1889  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  A power plant contains a SCADA system controlling the distribution of electric power for a large military  installation. The SCADA system contains both real-time sensor data and routine administrative information. The  management at the power plant determines that: (i) for the sensor data being acquired by the SCADA system,  there is no potential impact from a loss of confidentiality, a high potential impact from a loss of integrity, and a  high potential impact from a loss of availability; and (ii) for the administrative information being processed by  the system, there is a low potential impact from a loss of confidentiality, a low potential impact from a loss of  integrity, and a low potential impact from a loss of availability. The resulting security categories, SC, of these  information types are expressed as:  SC sensor data = {(confidentiality, NA), (integrity, HIGH), (availability, HIGH)}, and  SC administrative information = {(confidentiality, LOW), (integrity, LOW), (availability, LOW)}.  The resulting security category of the system is initially expressed as:  SC SCADA system = {(confidentiality, LOW), (integrity, HIGH), (availability, HIGH)}  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  57  representing the high-water mark or maximum potential impact values for each security objective from the  information types resident on the SCADA system.

The final security category of the system is expressed as:  SC SCADA system = {(confidentiality, MODERATE), (integrity, HIGH), (availability, HIGH)}  1890  Table 7 provides details on applying the RMF Categorize step to OT. 1891  Table 7: Applying the RMF Categorize step to OT 1892  Tasks Outcomes OT-Specific Guidance  TASK C-1  SYSTEM DESCRIPTION  The characteristics of the system are described and  documented.  [Cybersecurity Framework: Profile]  TASK C-2  SECURITY CATEGORIZATION  A security categorization of the system, including  the information processed by the system  represented by the organization-identified  information types, is completed.  [Cybersecurity Framework: ID.AM-1; ID.AM-2;  ID.AM-3; ID.AM-4; ID.AM-5]  Security categorization results are documented in  the security, privacy, and SCRM plans.  [Cybersecurity Framework: Profile]  Security categorization results are consistent with  the enterprise architecture and commitment to  protecting organizational missions, business  functions, and mission/business processes.  [Cybersecurity Framework: Profile]  Security categorization results reflect the  organization’s risk management strategy.  OT and IT systems may have  different categorization criteria.  TASK C-3  SECURITY CATEGORIZATION  REVIEW AND APPROVAL  The security categorization results are reviewed,  and the categorization decision is approved by  senior leaders in the organization.  1893  4.3.3 Select  1894  The purpose of the Select step is to determine the initial selection of controls to protect the 1895  system commensurate with risk. The control baselines are the starting point for the control 1896  selection process and are chosen based on the security category and associated impact level of 1897  systems determined in the Categorize step. NIST SP 800-53B [SP800-53B] identifies the 1898  recommended control baselines for federal systems and information. To address the need for 1899  developing community-wide and specialized sets of controls for systems and organizations, the 1900  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  58  concept of overlays is introduced. An overlay is a fully specified set of controls, control 1901  enhancements, and supplemental guidance derived from the application of tailoring guidance to 1902  security control baselines described in NIST SP 800-53B, Appendix C. 1903  In general, overlays are intended to reduce the need for ad hoc tailoring of baselines by 1904  organizations through the selection of a set of controls and control enhancements that more 1905  closely correspond to common circumstances, situations, and/or conditions. Appendix F of this 1906  publication includes an OT-specific overlay of applicable NIST SP 800-53 controls that provides 1907  tailored baselines for low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact OT. These tailored 1908  baselines can be utilized as starting specifications and recommendations that can be applied to 1909  specific OT by responsible personnel.  1910  OT owners can tailor the overlay from Appendix F when it is not possible or feasible to 1911  implement specific controls. The use of overlays does not in any way preclude organizations 1912  from performing further tailoring (i.e., overlays can also be subject to tailoring) to reflect 1913  organization-specific needs, assumptions, or constraints. However, all tailoring activity should, 1914  as its primary goal, focus on meeting the intent of the original controls whenever possible or 1915  feasible. For example, in situations where the OT cannot support, or the organization determines 1916  it is not advisable to implement particular controls or control enhancements in an OT (e.g., 1917  performance, safety, or reliability are adversely impacted), the organization should provide a 1918  complete and convincing rationale for how the selected compensating controls provide an 1919  equivalent security capability or level of protection for the OT and why the related baseline 1920  controls could not be employed. If the OT cannot support the use of automated mechanisms, the 1921  organization employs non-automated mechanisms or procedures as compensating controls in 1922  accordance with the general tailoring guidance in Section 3.3 of NIST SP 800-53. Compensating 1923  controls are not exceptions or waivers to the baseline controls; rather, they are alternative 1924  safeguards and countermeasures employed within the OT that accomplish the intent of the 1925  original controls that could not be effectively employed. Organizational decisions on the use of 1926  compensating controls are documented in the security plan for the OT. 1927  Table 8 provides additional details on applying the RMF Select step to OT. 1928  Table 8: Applying the RMF Select step to OT 1929  Tasks Outcomes OT-Specific Guidance  TASK S-1  CONTROL SELECTION  Control baselines necessary to protect the system  commensurate with risk are selected.  [Cybersecurity Framework: Profile]  OT systems can leverage the OT  control baselines identified in  Appendix F as a starting point or may  leverage an organization-defined  control selection approach.  TASK S-2  CONTROL TAILORING  Controls are tailored, producing tailored control  baselines.  [Cybersecurity Framework: Profile]  Due to operational or technical  constraints, it may not be feasible to  implement certain controls.

Review any potential impact to the OT  system’s operational effectiveness and  safety.  1930  4.3.4 Implement 1931  The Implement step involves the implementation of controls in new or legacy systems. The 1932  control selection process described in this section can be applied to OT from two perspectives: 1933  new development and legacy.  1934  For new development systems, the control selection process is applied from a requirements 1935  definition perspective since the systems do not yet exist and organizations are conducting initial 1936  security categorizations. The controls included in the security plans for the systems serve as a 1937  security specification and are expected to be incorporated into the systems during the 1938  development and implementation phases of the system development life cycle.  1939  In contrast, for legacy systems, the security control selection process is applied from a gap 1940  analysis perspective when organizations are anticipating significant changes to the systems (e.g., 1941  during major upgrades, modifications, or outsourcing). Since the systems already exist, 1942  organizations likely have completed the security categorization and security control selection 1943  processes, resulting in the establishment of previously agreed-upon controls in the respective 1944  security plans and the implementation of those controls within the systems. 1945  Table 9 provides additional details on applying the RMF Implement step to OT. 1946  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  60  Table 9: Applying the RMF Implement step to OT 1947  Tasks Outcomes OT-Specific Guidance  TASK I-1  CONTROL  IMPLEMENTATION  Controls specified in the security and privacy  plans are implemented.

The nature of network traffic on these 1974  two networks is different: Internet access, email, and remote access will typically be permitted 1975  on the corporate network and not allowed on the OT networks. There may also be differences in 1976  the degree of rigor associated with corporate and OT environment change control procedures. 1977  Additionally, using the corporate network for OT communication protocols could expose the OT 1978  components to cyber-attacks (e.g., DoS, man-in-the-middle or other network-based attacks). 1979  Utilizing separate networks allows greater flexibility to address security and performance 1980  requirements between the two environments 1981  Practical considerations, such as digital transformation, cost of OT installation, or maintaining a 1982  homogenous network infrastructure, often mean that a connection is required between OT and 1983  corporate or other IT networks. This connection represents additional risk, and organizations 1984  may want to minimize these connections and consider additional security controls for these 1985  connections. This section outlines security strategies for organizations to consider when 1986  architecting their OT environments to support cybersecurity objectives.  1987  5.1 Cybersecurity Strategy 1988  The adoption of a cybersecurity strategy can help organizations with cybersecurity decisions by 1989  providing context for decisions that would otherwise be more ad hoc. This can result in a more 1990  systematic implementation of risk decisions into the development and operations of systems 1991  supporting a comprehensive and sustainable cybersecurity program. A comprehensive and 1992  accepted cybersecurity strategy can assist an organization with consistently maintaining 1993  acceptable risk management throughout the life cycle of an OT system.  1994  System security is optimized by engineering design that is based on proactive loss prevention 1995  strategy. Such a strategy includes planned measures that are engineered to address what can 1996  happen rather than what is likely to happen—to proactively identify and rid the system of 1997  weaknesses and defects that lead to security vulnerabilities; to proactively understand the 1998  certainty and uncertainty of adversarial and non-adversarial threats; and to put in place the means 1999  and methods to protect against adverse consequences. Proactive systems security engineering 2000  also includes planning for failure regardless of whether the failure results from adversarial or 2001  non-adversarial events, and to ensure that the system is resilient to such events. 2002  OT-specific Guidance and Recommendations  When planning their security strategy, organizations may need to consider critical  infrastructure standards and regulatory requirements. Based on guidance from CISA,  organizations may find that both IT and OT environments fall within the critical infrastructure  sectors. Also, these standards and requirements are typically designed to protect critical cyber  assets to support reliability, and may carry additional legal obligations for the organization.  https://www.cisa.gov/critical-infrastructure-sectors  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  64  5.1.1 Impacts of Choosing a Cybersecurity Strategy 2003  By consciously choosing to develop and implement a cybersecurity strategy, an organization 2004  establishes a disciplined approach to cybersecurity in its systems. This approach allows an 2005  organization to consider all aspects of the system life cycle, from procurement to 2006  decommissioning, with cybersecurity in mind. As a result, the organization can track that 2007  cybersecurity goals are realized in its systems.  2008  Decisions on cybersecurity strategy should flow from a high-level understanding of the 2009  operations, objectives, and cybersecurity goals of the organization. The organization may, for 2010  example, want its systems to display certain characteristics such as resiliency or trustworthiness. 2011  A strategy provides a framework that can help incorporate those characteristics into the final 2012  systems. The strategy can also include considerations such the flexibility to adopt new 2013  technologies (e.g., crypto agility, artificial intelligence [AI]/machine learning [ML] technologies, 2014  digital twins). Finally, a strategy can state the need for sound cybersecurity practices such as 2015  patching or monitoring. 2016  The cybersecurity strategy should directly impact the architectural decisions made for systems. 2017  The existence of an architecture informed by a cybersecurity strategy increases the likelihood 2018  that high-level cybersecurity goals will be reflected in the cybersecurity of individual systems. 2019  The strategy provides a document and reminder of those goals when decisions are being made at 2020  the system level. 2021  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendations  OT assets are often very long-lived and reflect massive investments in operational, reliability,  and safety testing. It is sometimes neither economically nor technically feasible to replace  existing equipment and applications wholesale with newer alternatives in the short- or  medium-term. Such equipment is at greater risk of attacks than equipment with the latest  versions of security features and the latest security updates applied, deeply affecting security.  Adoption of a security strategy can assist an organization in understanding the life cycle of its  OT systems and adjusting approaches to maintain cybersecurity.  2022  5.1.2 Defense-in-Depth Strategy 2023  Defense-in-depth is a multifaceted strategy integrating people, technology, and operations 2024  capabilities to establish variable barriers across multiple layers and dimensions of the 2025  organization. It’s considered a best practice. Many cybersecurity architectures incorporate the 2026  principles of defense-in-depth, and the strategy has been integrated into numerous standards and 2027  regulatory frameworks.  2028  The basic concepts are to prevent single points of failure in the cybersecurity defenses and to 2029  assume no single origin of threats. From this position, cybersecurity controls are organized to 2030  provide layers of protection around the critical system and system components.  2031  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  65  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendations  A defense-in-depth strategy is particularly useful in OT environments because it can focus  attention and defensive mechanisms on critical functions. Additionally, the principles of  defense-in-depth are flexible, and organizations may find that they can be applied to a wide  range of OT environments including ICS, SCADA, IoT, IIoT, and Hybrid environments.  Organizations should also consider that defense-in-depth requires an integration of people,  processes, and technology to be effective. Additionally, cybersecurity defenses are not static  and require changes and updates as risks change for the environment. To help establish and  support an effective defense-in-depth architecture, organizations should consider:   Training people to support the security environment and reduce risky behaviors   Implementing appropriate and sustainable cybersecurity technology   Implementing procedures required to monitor, respond, and adapt cybersecurity defenses  to changing conditions  2032  5.1.3 Other Cybersecurity Strategy Considerations 2033  Traditional OT systems were designed to operate industrial processes safely and reliably without 2034  connections to external networks. However, due to the need for business agility and cost 2035  reduction for OT infrastructures, OT systems and networks are becoming more integrated with 2036  business networks and cloud infrastructures. Additionally, the introduction of IIoT systems into 2037  OT environments may have unintended cybersecurity consequences.  2038  Similarly, cloud computing capabilities such as infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, 2039  software as a service, and security as a service are increasingly being utilized by organizations. 2040  While the use of these capabilities to support IT services is relatively well understood, the ability 2041  to utilize these services to support OT environments may have additional availability challenges 2042  resulting from increased sensitivity to system performance levels or connection issues.  2043  As a result, adoption of a security architecture strategy may be impacted by the current state of 2044  existing OT environments. For example, based on the architectural strategy, procurement 2045  decisions might be adjusted to include migrating specific components to support the new 2046  strategy. Also, organizations may find existing systems already support some or most of the 2047  security architecture strategy, so building on these existing capabilities could accelerate the 2048  strategy implementation. Additionally, new OT environments provide an opportunity to evaluate 2049  cyber risk early on and build cybersecurity into the design. 2050  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendations  Organizations should ensure that their security architecture strategy provides the required  flexibility to evolve their environment while also carefully considering the impacts to  operations and cybersecurity.  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  66  2051  5.2 Defense-in-Depth Architecture Capabilities 2052  Many organizations are embracing digital transformation initiatives that require altering their OT 2053  environments and developing strategies that provide a multi-tiered information architecture, 2054  supporting organization objectives such as:  2055   Maintenance of field devices, telemetry collection, or industrial-level process systems 2056   Enhanced data collection and dissemination 2057   Remote access 2058  Overall, integration between IT and OT is increasing as organizations adapt to changing local 2059  and global needs and requirements. Utilizing the principles of a defense-in-depth architecture to 2060  systematically layer security controls, including people, processes, and technology, can assist 2061  organizations with strengthening their overall cybersecurity defenses. As a result, adversaries 2062  may find it increasingly difficult to penetrate the environment without detection. In the following 2063  sections, specific defense-in-depth layers are discussed, including topics and ideas for 2064  organizations to consider when developing and implementing their defense-in-depth 2065  cybersecurity architecture. The layers are: 2066   Layer 1 – Security Management 2067   Layer 2 – Physical Security 2068   Layer 3 – Network Security 2069   Layer 4 – Hardware Security 2070   Layer 5 – Software Security 2071  5.2.1 Layer 1 - Security Management 2072  Security management or governance is the overarching cybersecurity program supporting the OT 2073  environment. Sections 3 and 4 discuss the program and risk management considerations for 2074  organizations to establish their cybersecurity program. These programmatic and organizational 2075  decisions will guide and impact the decisions made for the other defense-in-depth layers. As a 2076  result, organizations should complete this layer before attempting to implement the other layers. 2077  5.2.2 Layer 2 - Physical Security 2078  Physical security measures are designed to reduce the risk of accidental or deliberate loss or 2079  damage to assets and the surrounding environment. The assets being safeguarded may include 2080  control systems, tools, equipment, the environment, the surrounding community, and intellectual 2081  property including proprietary data such as process settings and customer information. 2082  Organizations may also need to consider additional environmental, safety, regulatory, legal, and 2083  other requirements when implementing physical security to protect their environments.  2084  A defense-in-depth solution to physical security should consider the following attributes: 2085  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  67   Protection of Physical Locations. Classic physical security considerations typically include 2086  an architecture of layered security measures creating several physical barriers around 2087  buildings, facilities, rooms, equipment, or other informational assets. Physical security 2088  controls should be implemented to protect physical locations and may include fences, anti-2089  vehicle ditches, earthen mounds, walls, reinforced barricades, gates, door and cabinet locks, 2090  guards, or other measures. 2091   Physical Access Control. Equipment cabinets should be locked when not required for 2092  operation or safety, and wiring should be neat and within cabinets or under floors. 2093  Additionally, consider keeping all computing and networking equipment in secured areas. 2094  Keys of OT assets like PLCs and safety systems should be in the “Run” position at all times 2095  unless they are being actively programmed. 2096   Access Monitoring Systems. Access monitoring systems include electronic surveillance 2097  capabilities such as still and video cameras, sensors, and identification systems (e.g., badge 2098  readers, biometric scanners, electronic keypads). Such devices typically do not prevent 2099  access to a particular location; rather, they store and record either the physical presence or the 2100  lack of physical presence of individuals, vehicles, animals, or other physical entities. 2101  Adequate lighting should be provided based on the type of access monitoring device 2102  deployed. These systems can also sometimes alert or initiate action upon detection of 2103  unauthorized access. 2104   People and Asset Tracking. Locating people and vehicles in a facility can be important for 2105  safety reasons, and it is increasingly important for security reasons as well. Asset location 2106  technologies can be used to track the movements of people and vehicles to ensure that they 2107  stay in authorized areas, to identify personnel needing assistance, and to support emergency 2108  response. 2109  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendations  Organizations should consider if physical security of remote assets is implemented at differing  levels and whether these differences could create cyber risks. For example, one remote  location may utilize only a padlock with minimal electronic surveillance to secure access to  network equipment which, if bypassed, could allow a malicious actor to gain access to an OT  network segment from the remote location.  Organizations should also consider whether secondary services such as the communications  and power supporting physical security devices (cameras, sensors, etc.) require additional  redundancy, isolation, protection, and monitoring.  2110  5.2.3 Layer 3 - Network Security 2111  Building from physical security, organizations should investigate network communications and 2112  how to protect the data and devices used to support their OT environment. While network 2113  security can encompass numerous aspects, this section focuses on several foundational elements 2114  to assist organizations with planning and implementing their network security capabilities. These 2115  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  68  include applying network architecture principles of segmentation and isolation; centralizing 2116  logging; network monitoring; and malicious code protection. Additionally, this section will 2117  discuss zero-trust architecture (ZTA) and considerations for applying these architecture 2118  enhancements to an OT environment. 2119  5.2.3.1 Network Architecture 2120  A good practice for network architectures is to segment and isolate IT and OT devices. 2121  Organizations should begin this process by considering how to characterize devices. For 2122  example, devices might be segmented based on management authority, level of trust, functional 2123  criticality, data flow, location, or other logical combinations. Organizations might also consider 2124  using an industry-recognized model such as the Purdue Model [Williams], ISA-95 Levels 2125  [IEC62264], Three-Tier IIoT System Architecture [IIRA19], or a combination of these models to 2126  organize their OT network segmentation. An additional network segmentation option for 2127  organizations to consider is incorporating the concept of a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) as an 2128  enforcement boundary between network segments as depicted in Figure 16. Implementing 2129  network segmentation utilizing levels, tiers, or zones allows organizations to control access to 2130  sensitive information and components while also considering operational performance and 2131  safety. 2132  2133  Figure 16: High-level example of Purdue Model and IIoT Model for network segmentation with DMZ segments 2134  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendations  Whether using a risk-based approach, functional model, or other organizing principle,  grouping components into levels, tiers, or zones is a precursor activity before organizations  can consider applying isolation devices to protect and monitor communication between levels,  tiers, or zones. When organizing assets, organizations should consider how the zone and  isolation configuration impact day-to-day operations, safety, and response capabilities.  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  69  2135  When properly configured, network architectures are used to support segmentation and isolation 2136  through enforcing security policies and controlling network communications. Organizations 2137  typically utilize their mapped data flows to identify required communications. These 2138  requirements are then incorporated into the network architecture and configured in the policy 2139  engines of the network devices to support monitoring communication between segments and 2140  permitting only authorized communications. Network devices such as switches, routers, 2141  firewalls, and unidirectional gateways/data-diodes that support traffic enforcement capabilities 2142  can be used to implement network segmentation and isolation. 2143  Firewalls are commonly used to support network isolation and are typically employed as 2144  boundary protection devices to control connections and information flows between network 2145  segments. Firewalls may be deployed as network devices or directly run on some hosts. Firewalls 2146  are very flexible isolation devices and typically constitute the primary mechanism for protecting 2147  OT devices.  2148  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendation  Appropriate firewall configuration is essential to properly securing the network segments.  Firewall rulesets should be established to only permit connections between adjacent levels,  tiers, or zones. For example, organizations utilizing a Purdue model architecture should  implement firewall rules and connection paths that prevent Level 4 devices from directly  communicating with Level 2, 1, or 0 devices. A similar concept would be applied to ISA/IEC  62443 or the Industrial IoT Consortium (IIC) architectures as well.  One area of considerable variation in practice associated with firewall rules is the control of  outbound traffic from the control network. Allowing outbound connections from lower levels,  tiers, or zones could represent a significant risk if unmanaged. Organizations will want to  consider making outbound rules as stringent as inbound rules to reduce these risks.  An alternative to firewalls is a unidirectional gateway or data diode that permits authorized  communication in only one direction. The use of unidirectional gateways may provide  additional protections associated with system compromises at higher levels or tiers within the  environment. For example, a unidirectional gateway deployed between Layers 2 and 3 might  protect the Layer 0, 1, and 2 devices from a cybersecurity event that occurs at Layers 3, 4, or  5.  5.2.3.2 Centralized Logging 2149  Network devices such as routers, gateways, switches, firewalls, servers, and workstations should 2150  be configured to log events to support monitoring, alerting, and incident response analysis. 2151  Logging capabilities are typically available for recording events in applications, OSs, and 2152  network communications. A centralized log management platform can assist organizations with 2153  supporting log retention, monitoring, and analysis efforts. 2154  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  70  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendation  Organizations should review the available logging capabilities and configure logging  capabilities to record operational and cybersecurity events appropriate for their environment.  Organizations should establish how long event logs should be retained and ensure adequate  storage is available to support log retention requirements.  5.2.3.3 Network Monitoring 2155  Network monitoring involves organizations reviewing alerts and logs and analyzing them for 2156  signs of possible cybersecurity incidents. Tools and capabilities that support Behavior Anomaly 2157  Detection (BAD), Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), or Intrusion 2158  Detection/Prevention systems (IDS/IPS) can assist organizations with monitoring traffic 2159  throughout the network and generate alerts when they identify anomalous or suspicious traffic. 2160  Some other capabilities to consider for network monitoring include: 2161   Asset management, including discovering and inventorying devices connected to the network 2162   Baselining typical network traffic, data flows, and device-to-device communications 2163   Diagnosing network performance issues 2164   Identifying misconfigurations or malfunctions of networked devices 2165  Additionally, organizations may want to consider incorporating additional services and 2166  capabilities such as threat intelligence monitoring to assist with establishing and maintaining an 2167  effective network monitoring capability. 2168  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendation  OT system traffic is typically more deterministic – repeatable, predictable, and designed –  than IT network traffic. Organizations may leverage the deterministic nature of OT  environments to support network monitoring for anomaly and error detection.  Organizations may want to understand the normal state of the OT network as a prerequisite  for implementing network security monitoring to help distinguish attacks from transient  conditions or normal operations within the environment. Implementing network monitoring  in a passive (listen/learning) mode and analyzing the information to differentiate between  known and unknown communication may be a necessary first step in implementing network  security monitoring.  Organizations should consider the effects of encrypted network communications on their  network monitoring capabilities and deployment strategies. For example, a BAD system or  IDS may not be able to determine if encrypted network communication is malicious and  could either generate false positive or false negative alerts for the traffic. Changing the data  collection point to capture network traffic either before or after encryption (e.g., using host-  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  71  based network monitoring tools) could assist with improving monitoring capabilities when  encrypted communication is expected.  IDS and IPS products are effective in detecting and preventing well-known Internet attacks,  and some IDS and IPS vendors have incorporated attack signatures for various OT protocols  such as Modbus, DNP3, and ICCP. An effective IDS/IPS deployment typically involves both  host-based and network-based capabilities. Organizations should consider the impact  automated responses associated with IPS might have on the OT environment before  deploying. In some cases, organizations may consider placing IPS units at higher levels in the  environment (e.g., the DMZ interfaces) to minimize potential issues with automated  responses impacting OT.  In OT environments, network-based monitoring capabilities are typically deployed on  boundary protection devices using switched port analyzer (SPAN) ports instead of in-line  network taps that could create a communication point of failure. Organizations should also  consider deploying host-based monitoring capabilities on compatible OT devices such as  HMIs, SCADA servers, and engineering workstations to improve monitoring capabilities,  provided the addition of the tools does not adversely impact operational performance or  safety.  5.2.3.4 Zero-Trust Architecture (ZTA) 2169  ZTA is a cybersecurity paradigm focusing on protecting resources (e.g., information services, 2170  data) based on the premise that authorization decisions are made closer to the resource being 2171  requested and are continuously evaluated rather than implicitly granted [SP800-207]. 2172  Conventional network security focuses on segmentation and perimeter defenses. Once inside the 2173  network perimeter, users are typically considered “trusted” and often given broad access to 2174  accessible resources. As a result, boundary protection devices between zones do not mitigate 2175  lateral movement risks within a zone. Additionally, with the growing prevalence of distributed 2176  computing, wireless and cellular communications, along with cloud and hybrid-cloud 2177  environments, traditional network perimeters and boundaries are becoming less defined. For 2178  these situations, organizations might consider incorporating the principles of zero trust into their 2179  security architecture. 2180  Some challenges to implementing a ZTA include: 2181   Organizations may not find a suitable single solution for ZTA and, instead, may need to 2182  integrate several technologies with varying maturity levels to support their environment. 2183   Migrating an existing environment may require more investments in time, resources, and 2184  technical ability to implement zero-trust principles. 2185  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendations  Some OT components (e.g., PLCs, Controllers, HMI) may not support the technologies or  protocols required to fully integrate with a ZTA implementation. As a result, a ZTA  implementation might not be practical for some OT devices. Instead, organizations should  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  72  consider applying ZTA on compatible devices such as those typically found at the functionally  higher levels of the OT architecture (e.g., Purdue Model Levels 3, 4, 5, and the OT DMZ).  Organizations may also want to consider the impact on operations and safety function. For  example, would any adverse impacts occur if the ZTA solution increases the latency to respond  to resource requests or if one or more ZTA components become unavailable? Based on this  analysis, organizations should consider adjusting the ZTA implementations to minimize latency  and ensure adequate redundancy to minimize risks to OT and safety operations.  Another important aspect of ZTA implementations is identity of person and non-person entities  accessing resources. Within OT environments, shared credentials may be utilized which could  impact the ability to fully implement a ZTA solution.  2186  5.2.4 Layer 4 - Hardware Security 2187  Hardware security protection mechanisms provide the foundation for supporting security and 2188  trust for the devices within an environment. Once device trust is established, the state must be 2189  maintained and tracked in accordance with the system model and policy. To support these 2190  capabilities, some vendors provide embedded technology such as the Trusted Platform Module 2191  (TPM) or provide hardware implementation for Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and 2192  Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA). Overall, hardware security capabilities provide the capability to 2193  enhance endpoints to provide specific function and security requirements, including:  2194   Monitoring and analysis 2195   Secure configuration and management  2196   Endpoint hardening 2197   Integrity protection 2198   Access control 2199   Device identity 2200   Root of trust 2201   Physical security 2202  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendations  Organizations should review available hardware security and automated capabilities to  determine how they can support OT environments without impacting operational performance,  safety, or capabilities.  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  73  5.2.5 Layer 5 - Software Security 2203  Software security protection mechanisms provide organizations with capabilities to ensure 2204  applications and services supporting OT are used and maintained properly. Overall, software 2205  security capabilities can enhance endpoint security when organizations incorporate:  2206   Application allowlisting 2207   Patching 2208   Secure code development 2209   Configuration management, including application hardening 2210  5.2.5.1 Application Allowlisting 2211  Application allowlisting technologies provide an additional protection mechanism on hosts by 2212  restricting which applications are allowed to execute. When properly configured, non-authorized 2213  applications will not execute on the host environment. 2214  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendations  The relatively static nature of OT environments presents an opportunity for organizations to  include application allowlisting as part of their defense-in-depth strategy, and is a  recommended best practice by DHS. When considering application allowlisting within an OT  environment, organizations should coordinate with their vendors and review available  implementation guidance such as NIST SP 800-167, Guide to Application Whitelisting  [SP800-167]; Guidelines for Application Whitelisting in Industrial Control Systems; or  relevant guidance for their industry. The configurations and policies should be thoroughly  tested before being deployed to ensure the rules and settings properly support the  organizational security objectives.  5.2.5.2 Patching 2215  Patches have two main purposes: to fix vulnerabilities and to enhance functionality. While 2216  enhancing software functionality is important, in the context of defense-in-depth software 2217  security, the focus of patching is associated with reducing vulnerabilities. As a result, patch 2218  management is a defense-in-depth capability to support vulnerability management as part of an 2219  organizational risk management strategy. 2220  Deploying patches to OT environments requires additional considerations for organizations, 2221  including testing and validation to ensure the patches do not impact operational capabilities or 2222  safety. OT operational requirements can also impact the frequency patches are applied. For 2223  example, some OT environments must run nearly continuously for extended periods of time or 2224  have small maintenance windows when approved updates could be applied. Additionally, 2225  patching older OT components that run on unsupported OSs may not be an option. In these 2226  cases, organizations may want to consider updating their OSs or investigating additional controls 2227  that can protect the environment from attempts to exploit known vulnerabilities. Some tools, 2228  such as web application firewalls (WAF) and IPS, could be configured to provide additional 2229  https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/documents/Seven%20Steps%20to%20Effectively%20Defend%20Industrial%20Control%20Systems_S508C.pdf https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/documents/Guidelines%20for%20Application%20Whitelisting%20in%20Industrial%20Control%20Systems_S508C.pdf  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  74  protection to detect or prevent attacks against unpatched vulnerabilities while the organization 2230  waits for an opportunity to apply the updates. 2231  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendations  Whenever possible, patches should be tested on a sandbox system (test environment) to ensure  they do not cause problems before being deployed to a production system. Organizations  should plan patches and updates during scheduled maintenance windows for the environment  and have a recovery plan for the OT component or system being patched.  Organizations should also consider that different levels, tiers, or zones may have different  availability requirements and, as such, may have different abilities to support patching.  Whenever possible, organizations should prioritize patching components within DMZ  environments and when vulnerabilities exist that impact availability and integrity or would  allow unauthorized remote access to the OT environment.  2232  5.2.5.3 Secure Code Development 2233  For organizations developing in-house systems and components, policies and procedures to 2234  support and validate secure code development practices should be incorporated into the 2235  cybersecurity program. The software development life cycle (SDLC) should include security 2236  during each phase of software development. This should include security reviews and coding 2237  techniques for each of the following processes: 2238   Using or developing tools to audit and automate secure code techniques 2239   Testing and reviewing code to comply with secure coding practices 2240   Testing the software for security errors in programming 2241  For organizations that procure components or services from third parties, reviewing these same 2242  practices should be considered prior to executing contracts with vendors. Organizations can help 2243  industry move toward more secure products by requesting these practices in their service level 2244  agreements and procurement actions. 2245  5.2.5.4 Configuration Management 2246  Applying configuration management practices for cybersecurity settings supporting both secure 2247  configurations and application hardening is important to meet organization and regulatory 2248  security requirements. These settings may include setting access controls for restricting access or 2249  enabling encryption to protect data at rest or in transit. Application hardening procedures may 2250  include disabling or blocking specific network communication ports, application features, or 2251  unnecessary services running on the system. 2252  Encrypting data that flows over networks (in transit) or data stored in memory and hard drives (at 2253  rest) can also be used in defending OT. Encryption prevents an attacker from viewing or 2254  modifying cleartext data streams. Because encryption and the subsequent decryption process use 2255  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  75  algorithms to create ciphers, encryption adds latency and may not be suitable for all OT devices. 2256  Knowing the advantages and disadvantages of encryption can help organizations make an 2257  informed choice on where to include encryption in the defense-in-depth strategy. 2258  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendations  Organizations should consider using encryption to support secure connections or conduits for  OT environments when the connections must pass over non-OT network segments such as the  corporate network or the internet. Virtual private network (VPN) connections should also use  encryption protocols, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Internet Protocol Security  (IPsec), for securing the data.  Encryption can also be used on hard drives to protect information at rest. Full disk encryption  is recommended for portable laptops and devices. Organizations may also want to consider  encrypting folders containing sensitive files.  Organizations must also consider that encryption can negatively impact other defense tools  such as network monitoring. For example, an IDS might not be able to determine if an  encrypted packet is malicious, resulting in either false-positive or false-negative alerts.  2259  5.3 Additional Cybersecurity Architecture Considerations 2260  When establishing a security architecture for supporting OT and IIoT environments, 2261  organizations should include considerations for supporting cyber-related safety, availability, 2262  geographically distributed systems, environmental considerations, and regulatory requirements 2263  into the security architecture designs and implementations. The following subsections discuss 2264  these considerations in more detail. 2265  5.3.1 Cyber-Related Safety Considerations 2266  OT systems are generally designed with specific safety goals, depending on both the business 2267  environment and regulatory requirements. Organizations should consider whether the additional 2268  communication and cybersecurity requirements of safety systems, e.g., segmentation and 2269  isolation of safety systems from other OT systems, is required. Additionally, safety requirements 2270  can influence selection of security mechanisms. For example, safety considerations may require 2271  that an organization use physical separation as opposed to logical separation.  2272  OT systems typically employ fail-to-a-known-state design (e.g., fail-safe design) in the event of 2273  an unexpected situation or a component failure. Fail-safe design considers placing the equipment 2274  or process in a safe state that prevents injury to individuals or destruction to property and avoids 2275  cascading event or secondary hazards. Cyber-related events such as the loss of network 2276  communications could trigger these fail-safe events. To minimize false positives, define the 2277  thresholds that OT components can operate at with reduced or disrupted capabilities such as lost 2278  network communications.  2279  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  76  5.3.2 Availability Considerations 2280  Operational continuity management requires managing availability at multiple levels – data, 2281  applications, IT infrastructure, power, and other supporting utilities such as HVAC, water, steam, 2282  compressed air, etc. Failure of these systems can have a cascading effect on OT systems and can 2283  adversely impact the OT operation. Different availability considerations are presented below. 2284  Data, Applications, and Infrastructure 2285  Architecture requirements and design should support the redundancy needs of the OT systems. 2286  Availability can be enhanced using redundancy at the communication, system, or component 2287  level such that a single failure is less likely to result in a capability or information outage. 2288  Cybersecurity architecture should take into consideration any redundant communication and 2289  protect it to the same security level as the primary.  2290  Additionally, a data backup and restoration process will facilitate speedy recovery of systems in 2291  case of data lost due to cyber-attacks or other reasons. Examples of important data and files are 2292  operational data, program files, configuration files, system images, firewall rules and access 2293  control list (ACLs). A “backup-in-depth” approach, with multiple layers of backups (e.g., local, 2294  facility, disaster) that are time-sequenced such that rapid recent local backups are available for 2295  immediate use and secure backups are available to recover from a massive security incident (e.g., 2296  ransomware attack) can help improve OT system availability. Periodic testing of data backup and 2297  restore capabilities will ensure that they will be available when the need arises. 2298  Primary and Alternate Power Sources 2299  Architectural considerations should include the impact of power outage for OT systems. For 2300  example, if the OT systems need a graceful degradation or orderly shutdown, then an alternate 2301  backup power may be considered. In addition, if the organization’s business continuity plan 2302  requires that the OT systems need to continue operating in the event of an extended loss of the 2303  primary power source, a long-term alternate power supply for the OT systems that is self-2304  contained and not reliant on external power generation can be implemented. The monitoring and 2305  controls systems for the power system are vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Appropriate cybersecurity 2306  practices should be implemented to protect these systems from cyber-attacks. 2307  Other Utilities 2308  Industrial facilities typically have monitoring and controls systems that manage uninterruptable 2309  power supplies (UPSs), HVAC, fire alarm systems, boilers, cooling water plant, steam, 2310  compressed air, etc. These monitoring and controls systems are also vulnerable to cyber-attacks 2311  and can affect the OT systems. Appropriate cybersecurity practices should be implemented to 2312  protect these systems from cyber-attacks. 2313  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendations  Disaster recovery planning is another important activity for OT systems, especially where  there are safety concerns. Organizations should establish and maintain a disaster recovery plan  (DRP) detailing the actions to take before, during, and after a natural, environmental, or  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  77  human-caused (intentionally or unintentionally) disaster. The DRP should also include  instructions for restoring and restarting failed components and integrating them back into  operation. Organizations should also consider testing the DRP to ensure that the necessary  architecture capabilities can be operationalized in an actual disaster recovery scenario.  Tabletop exercises can also be used to simulate a disaster recovery event to support testing.  5.3.3 Geographically Distributed Systems 2314  Many of the critical infrastructure industries have sites that are geographically distributed. 2315  Organizations should consider if differences in physical security at remote locations create risks 2316  to the OT operational capabilities or safety. The necessary cybersecurity and communication 2317  infrastructure should be provided at the remote sites to protect them from cyber threats and to 2318  communicate cybersecurity monitoring information.  2319  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendations  The communication between sites should be encrypted and authenticated end-to-end whether  the connection is via point-to-point link, satellite, or Internet. Organizations should also ensure  adequate bandwidth is provisioned for collecting cyber monitoring data in addition to the  operational data from remote locations.  If the organization has several geographically dispersed sites, the organization should consider  whether security operation will be managed from a central security operations center (SOC) or  from regionally distributed SOCs. Availability of qualified personnel can impact these  decisions.  5.3.4 Regulatory Requirements 2320  Regulated industries must consider cyber-related regulatory requirements when designing their 2321  cybersecurity architecture. For example, NERC Standard CIP-005 (see Appendix D.1.9.1) 2322  provides cybersecurity architecture requirements for bulk electric systems. Similar requirements 2323  and guidance exist for other regulated industries.  2324  5.3.5 Environmental Considerations 2325  Organizations should consider whether any of their processes and equipment pose environmental 2326  hazards. The hazard analysis will typically provide this information. If an environmental hazard 2327  has been identified, organizations should consider architectural measures to prevent 2328  environmental hazard due to cybersecurity failure. 2329  5.3.6 Field I/O (Purdue Level 0) Security Considerations 2330  Many of the devices and the communication protocols at the Field I/O level (Purdue Level 0) 2331  (e.g., sensors, actuators) do not have the ability to be authenticated. Without authentication, there 2332  is the potential to replay, modify, or spoof data. Organizations should make a risk-based decision 2333  considering where within the OT system (e.g., the most critical process) the use of mitigating 2334  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  78  security controls (e.g., digital twins, separate Field I/O monitoring network) should be 2335  implemented to detect incorrect data. 2336  5.3.7 Additional Security Considerations for IIoT 2337  The introduction of IIoT to OT environments can increase connectivity and information 2338  exchanges with enterprise systems and cloud-based systems which may require additional 2339  considerations for the security architecture. For example, introduction of IIoT devices in OT 2340  environments may require altering boundaries or exposing more interfaces and services. 2341  Additionally, the security capabilities of IIoT devices may need to be considered when 2342  developing the security architecture. 2343  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendations  In addition to security architecture considerations, organizations may also need to consider the  impact to policy management, enforcement, and governance to support IIoT. Additionally,  integration of IIoT in OT environments may require a tighter collaboration between IT and OT  security teams for managing the security operations. For example, real-time situational  awareness should be shared between IT and OT security teams.  2344  Application and Infrastructure 2345  Organizations should consider the IIoT data flow use cases, including those that share data 2346  externally, to determine whether additional access control mechanisms are necessary. 2347  Organizations should also consider that the attack vectors for IIoT may be different from those 2348  managed for OT environments – for example, due to the increased communications requirements 2349  or the use of additional services such as cloud systems to support operational requirements. 2350  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendations  Organizations should consider the endpoint security capabilities of the IIoT devices being  deployed. For example, the IIC suggests that organizations consider the following security  capabilities:   Endpoint tamper resistance capabilities   Endpoint root of trust   Endpoint identity   Endpoint access control   Endpoint integrity protection   Endpoint data protection   Endpoint monitoring & analysis   Endpoint configuration and management  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  79   Cryptographic techniques   Capability to harden endpoints  2351  Cybersecurity Capability Considerations 2352  Compute resources including processing, memory, and storage vary among IIoT devices. Some 2353  IIoT devices may have constrained resources and others may have unused capabilities. Both 2354  cases have implications for cybersecurity. Organizations should consider how the resources and 2355  capabilities available in the IIoT devices will integrate into the security architecture to achieve 2356  their cybersecurity objectives. Additionally, organizations should consider if the operational and 2357  safety impacts for IIoT differ from the operational and safety impacts for other OT devices. For 2358  example, IIoT devices may support a separate data monitoring (read-only capability) for the 2359  environment and have minimal impact on operational controls or safety which may allow 2360  organizations to implement security operations differently than those established for OT devices. 2361  5.4 Cybersecurity Architecture Models 2362  Building on the concepts and guidance from Sections 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3, the following subsections 2363  will expand on the general OT and IIoT environments described in Section 2 to provide 2364  examples for how the general environments might be adapted to support defense-in-depth 2365  security architectures. 2366  5.4.1 Distributed Control System (DCS)-Based OT Systems 2367  As described in Section 2, a Distributed Control System (DCS) is used to control production 2368  systems within the same geographic location for industries. Figure 17 shows an example DCS 2369  system implementation. Figure 18 shows an example defense-in-depth architecture applied to the 2370  DCS system. 2371  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  80  2372  2373  Figure 17: DCS implementation example 2374  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  81  2375  Figure 18: Defense-in-depth security architecture example for DCS system 2376  For the Figure 18 example, the assumption is that the organization has already addressed Layer 1 2377  – Security Management and Layer 2 – Physical Security. For Layer 3 – Network Security, the 2378  organization should consider incorporating the following capabilities in the security architecture: 2379  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  82   Separate networks into different levels or zones. In this example, the devices are split into 2380  different levels based on function. The Field Level includes devices typically found in the 2381  Purdue model levels 0, 1, and 2. The Operations Management level includes devices for 2382  monitoring and managing the field level devices and includes the Purdue level 3 components. 2383  The DMZ includes devices that support bridging the operations management and enterprise 2384  tiers. Organizations should also consider if additional network segments are required for 2385  safety or security systems (e.g., physical monitoring and access controls, doors, gates, 2386  cameras, Voice over IP [VoIP], access card readers). Network segmentation is an important 2387  step in applying a defense-in-depth strategy.  2388   Boundary devices (e.g., firewalls) are added to control and monitor communications between 2389  different levels. Industrial-class firewalls are sometimes used between the field and 2390  operations management levels to provide additional support for OT-specific protocols or to 2391  allow devices to operate in harsh environments. Rules for both inbound and outbound 2392  communication should be defined so that only authorized communication passes between 2393  adjacent levels. 2394   Implement a DMZ to separate the OT environment from the enterprise network. Any 2395  communications between the Enterprise Level and the Operations Management level are 2396  required to go through services within the DMZ. Since the DMZ connects to outside 2397  environments, the services within the DMZ must be monitored and protected to avoid 2398  compromises within the DMZ that allow pivoting to the OT environment without detection. 2399   The security architecture diagram shows an IT authentication server in the Enterprise 2400  network to authenticate users in the Enterprise network, and a separate OT authentication 2401  server in the operations management network for OT users. Organizations may want to 2402  consider this approach if it supports their risk-based security objectives. 2403  For Layer 4 – Hardware Security, and Layer 5 – Software Security, organizations should 2404  consider applying the principle of least functionality on all field, operations management, and 2405  DMZ devices to support application and device hardening. Organizations should identify and 2406  disable any non-essential capability, software, or ports from the devices. For example, a web 2407  server or SSH server may be available in some newer-model PLCs or HMIs. If these services are 2408  not used, they should be disabled and the associated TCP/UDP ports should be disabled. Only 2409  enable the functionality when required. 2410  5.4.2 DCS/PLC-Based OT with IIoT 2411  Building on the guidance for DCS/PLC-based OT environments in Section 5.4.1, Figure 19 2412  shows a simplified example security architecture implementation for the DCS system with 2413  additional IIoT devices configured to utilize a local IIoT platform for providing computing 2414  capabilities. Due to different communication and architectural components supporting IIoT, the 2415  example shows separate network segments for supporting the additional IIoT components. 2416  Communication from the IIoT platform tier is routed through the DMZ border firewall, allowing 2417  organizations to consider data transmission to servers in the DMZ or to the Enterprise/Internet as 2418  required to support IIoT operational requirements. Additionally, this also permits the 2419  cybersecurity services located in the DMZ to monitor the IIoT platform tier. 2420  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  83  2421  Figure 19: Security architecture example for DCS system with IIoT devices 2422  Alternatively, some organizations may use cloud services for their IIoT platform. In this case, 2423  organizations should consider how to secure communications from the edge to the cloud IIoT 2424  platform. Organization should also consider routing the communication through the DMZ 2425  boundary firewall to manage and monitor them. 2426  5.4.3 SCADA-Based OT Environments 2427  An example implementation showing the components and general configuration of a SCADA 2428  system is depicted in Figure 20. Typically, primary and backup control centers support one or 2429  more remote stations based on geographic locations, and regional control centers are 2430  geographically located to support one or more primary or backup control centers. Due to the 2431  distributed nature of the remote stations and control centers, communication between locations 2432  typically passes over external or WAN connections using wireless or wired mediums. 2433  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  84  2434  Figure 20: An example SCADA system in an OT environment 2435  Figure 21 shows an example defense-in-depth implementation for the example SCADA system. 2436  For this example, the assumption is that the organization has already addressed Layer 1 – 2437  Security Management and Layer 2 – Physical Security. For Layer 3 – Network Security, the 2438  organization should consider incorporating the following capabilities in the security architecture: 2439   Separate networks into different zones or regions; it is an important step in applying a 2440  defense-in-depth strategy in the SCADA environment. Additional separation should be 2441  considered for security systems (e.g., physical monitoring and access controls, doors, gates, 2442  cameras, VoIP, access card readers). 2443   Boundary devices (e.g., firewalls) are added between the different regions to control and 2444  monitor communications between the network segments. Industrial-class stateful firewalls 2445  may offer more support for OT-specific protocols, enhancing protection for OT devices like 2446  the PLC and controllers. Rules for inbound and outbound communication should be defined 2447  so that only authorized communication passes between regions. 2448   Use secure connections (e.g., VPN tunnel. encrypted channel, point-to-point connection) 2449  between network segments, such as between a regional center and primary control centers, 2450  and between remote stations and control centers. For geographically distanced locations, 2451  secure connections can be connected over the Internet/WAN connection. Devices in the 2452  network segments should only connect to other segments through the secure connection and 2453  should be restricted in accessing the Internet.  2454  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  85   Implement a DMZ to separate the control centers from the enterprise network. Any 2455  communications between the enterprise network and the control centers must go through 2456  services within the DMZ. Since the DMZ connects to outside environments, the services 2457  within the DMZ must be monitored and protected to avoid compromises within the DMZ that 2458  might allow pivoting to the OT environment without detection. 2459  2460  Figure 21: Security architecture example for SCADA system 2461  For Layer 4 – Hardware Security, and Layer 5 – Software Security, organizations should 2462  consider applying the principle of least functionality to all remote station components, control 2463  center components, and DMZ devices to support application and device hardening. 2464  Organizations should identify and disable any non-essential capability, software, or ports from 2465  the devices. For example, a webserver or SSH server may be available in some newer-model 2466  PLCs or HMIs. If these services are not used, they should be disabled and the associated 2467  TCP/UDP ports should be disabled. Only enable the functionality when required. 2468  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  86  6 Applying the Cybersecurity Framework to OT 2469  Many public and private sector organizations have adopted the NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2470  (CSF) [CSF] as a means for guiding cybersecurity activities and considering cybersecurity risks. 2471  The Framework consists of five concurrent and continuous Functions—Identify, Protect, Detect, 2472  Respond, and Recover—for presenting industry standards, guidelines, and practices in a manner 2473  that allows for communication of cybersecurity activities and outcomes across the organization. 2474  When considered together, these functions provide a high-level, strategic view for cybersecurity 2475  risk management. The Framework further identifies underlying key Categories and 2476  Subcategories for each Function and matches them with example Informative References such as 2477  existing standards, guidelines, and practices for each Subcategory.  2478  The five Functions include 23 Categories of cybersecurity outcomes and Subcategories that 2479  further divide the Categories into more specific technical or management activities. For this 2480  section, each subsection references a CSF Function and Category and includes the CSF two-2481  letter abbreviations for reference.  2482  The CSF functions guide the following actions:  Identify (ID) – Develop an organizational  understanding to manage cybersecurity risk to  systems, people, assets, data, and capabilities.  Protect (PR) – Develop and implement appropriate  safeguards to ensure delivery of critical services.  Detect (DE) – Develop and implement appropriate  activities to identify the occurrence of the  cybersecurity event.  Respond (RS) – Develop and implement  appropriate activities to take action regarding a  detected cybersecurity incident.  Recover (RC) – Develop and implement  appropriate activities to maintain plans for  resilience and to restore any capabilities or services  that were impaired due to a cybersecurity incident.  2483  All CSF Functions and selected CSF Categories and Subcategories are covered in this section. 2484  Additionally, some Categories include additional OT-specific considerations that are not 2485  included in the CSF.  2486  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  87  6.1 Identify (ID) 2487  The Identify Function provides foundational activities to effectively use the CSF. The intended 2488  outcome of the Identify Function is to develop an organizational understanding to manage 2489  cybersecurity risk to systems, people, assets, data, and capabilities. 2490  6.1.1 Asset Management (ID.AM) 2491  The ability for organizations to properly and consistently identify and consistently manage data, 2492  personnel, devices, systems, and facilities based on their relative importance provides a 2493  foundational capability to support an organizational cybersecurity program. Additionally, 2494  updating inventory information when components are added, removed, or changed (e.g., patched, 2495  new firmware installed, component swapped during maintenance) helps organizations accurately 2496  manage their overall environment risks. Organizations should consider including the following to 2497  support their asset management capability:  2498   Unique identifiers to differentiate and track assets 2499   Hardware inventory management to track computing and network devices within the 2500  environment including device details and location. Device details might include vendor, 2501  model, serial number, purchase information, and manufacturing/build information (e.g., 2502  provenance information). 2503   Software and firmware inventory management to track software and firmware installed with 2504  the OT components, including version numbers and location information, Software Bill of 2505  Materials (SBOM), etc. 2506   Vendor information to establish a repository of vendor information, points of contact, 2507  warranty information, locations of recall and update information, etc. 2508   Documented roles and responsibilities to identify specific individuals, teams, or organization 2509  groups who represent the asset owner and those with operation & maintenance and 2510  cybersecurity roles and responsibilities 2511  Supplemental guidance for ID.AM can be found in the following documents: 2512   NIST SP 1800-5, IT Asset Management 2513   NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and 2514  Organizations  2515  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Organizations should consider the criticality of a complete and accurate asset inventory for  managing risk within the OT environment. Accurate inventory information supports multiple  risk management objectives including risk assessment, vulnerability management, and  obsolescence tracking.  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-5 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53r5 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53r5  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  88  While automated tools for supporting asset management are generally preferable,  organizations should consider how the tool collects information and if the collection method  (e.g., active scanning) may have a negative impact on their OT systems. Performing a test  using the automated asset management tools on offline systems or components is  recommended prior to deployment within the OT production environment. When automated  tools are not feasible due to network architectures or other OT environment issues, the  organization should consider manual processes for maintaining a current inventory.  2516  6.1.1.1 Mapping Data Flows (ID.AM-3) 2517  Data flow diagrams enable a manufacturer to understand the flow of data between networked 2518  components. Documenting data flows enables organizations to understand expected behavior of 2519  their networks. This understanding of how devices communicate assists with troubleshooting as 2520  well as response and recovery activities. This information can be leveraged during forensic 2521  activities or used for analysis to identify anomalies. 2522  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Organizations should consider the impact on OT systems from the use of automated data flow  mapping tools that use active scanning or require network monitoring tools (e.g., in-line  network probes). Impacts could be due to the nature of the information, the volume of network  traffic, or momentary disconnection of manufacturing system components from the network.  Consider using data flow mapping tools that utilize these methods during planned downtime.  2523  6.1.1.2 Network Architecture Documentation (supports the outcome of ID.AM)  2524  Network architecture documentation tools enable a manufacturer to identify, document, and 2525  diagram the interconnections between networked devices, corporate networks, and other external 2526  connections. A comprehensive understanding of the interconnections within the environment is 2527  critical for successful deployment of cybersecurity controls. This information is equally 2528  important for effective network monitoring. 2529  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Network architecture documentation tools that use automated topology discovery technologies  are only able to capture details from IP-based networked devices. Many OT environments  contain isolated systems, components, or systems connected on non-IP networks. The OT  environment may not be technically capable of using automated network architecture  documentation tools. Manual processes may be required to document these components.  Asset owners may also want to consider how automated scanning activity may potentially  impact the OT system by testing automation tools in a non-production environment. Based on  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  89  testing results, asset owners should consider utilizing automated OT network architecture  documentation tools during planned downtime.  Organizations may also want to consider utilizing physical inspections of OT network  connections or analysis of network logs to document the OT network architecture, especially if  the network is not large or complicated. Incorporating OT network activity monitoring may  help organizations identify the addition or removal of devices within the environment between  planned scanning activities.  2530  6.1.2 Governance (ID.GV) 2531  Effective governance involves organization leadership incorporating risk management objectives 2532  along with resiliency, privacy, and cybersecurity objectives into the strategic planning process 2533  and providing the required resources to effectively implement and sustain the cybersecurity 2534  program. From this process, organization leadership develops and disseminates policies 2535  establishing security requirements for their environments. These policies include, for example, 2536  the identification and assignment of roles, responsibilities, management commitment, and 2537  compliance. The policies may also reflect coordination among organizational entities responsible 2538  for the different aspects of security (i.e., technical, physical, personnel, cyber-physical, access 2539  control, media protection, vulnerability management, maintenance, monitoring). 2540  Sections 3 and 4 provide additional details for governance.

As a result, organizations may find that determining  a cost-to-benefit analysis for some types of risks is not possible. In these cases, organizations  should consider reviewing past cyber and non-cyber incidents that have resulted in loss of  power, loss of control, loss of upstream feed, loss of downstream capacity, and major  equipment failures. A PHA, FMEA, or analysis of past events can be used to understand the  potential impact of a cyber incident. ISA 62443-3-2 provides guidance on how to assess  cyber risk in an environment with these potential consequences.  Risk assessments also require the identification of both vulnerabilities and threats to the OT  environment. Maintaining an accurate inventory of the IT and OT assets within the  environment of operation to include product vendor, model numbers, firmware, OSs, and  software versions installed on the assets facilitates the identification, tracking, and  remediation of vulnerabilities. OT-specific vulnerability information is available through  multiple methods, including:   Monitoring security groups, associations, and vendors for security alerts and advisories   NVD for detailed information on known vulnerabilities for hardware and software assets  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-30r1 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-37r2 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-37r2 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-39 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-39  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  91  Threat information relevant to the environment can be obtained from both internal resources  as well as external threat intelligence information sharing forums. Organizations should  consider participating in cyber threat information sharing [SP800-150].  2562  6.1.4 Risk Management Strategy (ID.RM) 2563  The risk management strategy guides how risk is framed, assessed, responded to, and monitored, 2564  and provides a consistent approach to making risk-based decisions across the organization. Risk 2565  tolerance, assumptions, constraints, priorities, and trade-offs are identified for investment and 2566  operational decision making. Additionally, the risk management strategy identifies acceptable 2567  risk assessment methodologies, potential risk responses, and a process to continuously monitor 2568  the security posture (or implementation of security countermeasures/outcomes) of the 2569  organization.  2570  Section 3 describes the overall risk management process for supporting an effective 2571  cybersecurity program. The following NIST documents provide additional implementation 2572  guidance for developing a risk management strategy: 2573   NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2, Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and 2574  Organizations: A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy 2575   NIST SP 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and 2576  Information System View 2577   NISTIR 8179, Criticality Analysis Process Model: Prioritizing Systems and Components 2578  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  When establishing an OT risk management strategy, organizations should consider:   Ensuring that the risk tolerance of an OT environment is informed by the organization’s  role in critical infrastructure and sector-specific risk analysis   Documenting failure scenarios involving IT components within the OT environment and  their effect on operations and safety   Establishing processes to periodically update information to determine the current risk  posture for the environment and coordinate required adjustments to risk management and  management controls  Overall risk can also be reduced by addressing likelihood and consequence. For OT systems,  the risk management strategy should consider non-security and safety controls (e.g., pressure  relief valves, manual valves) that can also help reduce the consequence of a failure.  2579  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-37r2 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-37r2 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-39 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-39 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8179  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  92  6.1.5 Supply Chain Risk Management (ID.SC) 2580  Supply chains are multifaceted and are built on a variety of business, economic, and 2581  technological factors. Organizations choose their suppliers, and consumers choose their sources 2582  based on a range of factors that vary from corporate preferences and existing/ongoing business 2583  relationships to more discrete considerations such as the existence of limited sources of supply or 2584  other unique characteristics.  2585  The subcategories (outcomes) that fall within the CSF Supply Chain Risk Management category 2586  provide the basis for developing processes and procedures for managing supply chain risk. These 2587  risks include insertion of counterfeits, unauthorized production, malicious insiders, tampering, 2588  theft, and insertion of malicious software and hardware, as well as poor manufacturing and 2589  development practices in the cyber supply chain. These risks must be identified, assessed, and 2590  managed. The CSF category also addresses supplier and third-party partner contracts, 2591  assessments, evaluations, and response and recovery planning.  2592  Additionally, organizations should investigate SBOMs and distributed ledger (e.g., blockchain) 2593  technologies to support supply chain risk management. For example, SBOM information can 2594  identify software components and the relationships or dependencies on other components. 2595  Having this information available can help an organization determine if a device is affected by 2596  reported software vulnerabilities. 2597  Supplemental guidance for Supply Chain Risk Management can be found in the following 2598  documents: 2599   NIST SP 800-161, Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Federal Information 2600  Systems and Organizations 2601   NISTIR 8276, Key Practices in Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management: Observations from 2602  Industry 2603  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Organizations should consider documenting and tracking serial numbers, checksums, digital  certificates/signatures, or other identifying features that can allow determining the  authenticity of vendor-provided OT hardware, software, and firmware. Organizations should  also consider if OT is purchased directly from the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or  an authorized third-party distributor or reseller. Suppliers should be assessed or reviewed to  ensure that they continue to follow best practices.  Many OT components and devices utilize open-source libraries to support their functional  capabilities. Organizations should identify the open-source dependencies for their OT  components and establish monitoring for open-source information such as vendor websites or  cyber news sources to ensure no known vulnerabilities or counterfeits have been disclosed.  Additionally, organizations might consider utilizing an industry-recognized certification  process for OT products to support supply chain risk management.  2604  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-161 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-161 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8276 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8276  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  93  6.2 Protect (PR) 2605  6.2.1 Identity Management and Access Control (PR.AC) 2606  Identity Management and Access Control (PR.AC) identifies outcomes around establishing and 2607  managing the identification mechanisms and credentials for users, devices, and services. Identity 2608  management supports the cybersecurity principle to identify and authorize a person, process, or 2609  device before granting physical or logical access to resources such as the system, information, or 2610  location being protected positively and uniquely. Access controls represent the policies, 2611  processes, and technology for specifying the use of system resources by only authorized users, 2612  programs, processes, or other systems. PR.AC controls allow organizations to manage the logical 2613  and physical access to support system risk management requirements. 2614  Supplemental guidance for implementing identity management and access control outcomes can 2615  be found in the following documents: 2616   NIST SP 800-63-3, Digital Identity Guidelines 2617   NIST SP 800-73-4, Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification 2618   NIST SP 800-76-2, Biometric Specifications for Personal Identity Verification 2619   NIST SP 800-100, Information Security Handbook: A Guide for Managers 2620  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Organizations should consider the life cycle for managing OT credentials including issuance,  revocation, and updates across the OT environment.  Organizations should consider the centralization of identification and authentication for users,  devices, and processes within the OT environments to improve/reduce burden account  management and enhance monitoring capabilities. Common network technologies such as  Active Directory and, more generally, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) or  similar technologies can be utilized to support centralization of identity management across  environments. If authenticated accounts from the IT environment have access within the OT  environment, organizations should weigh the increased risk from permitting that versus the  benefits of using centralized accounts.  In situations where OT cannot support authentication, or the organization determines it is not  advisable due to adverse impacts on performance, safety, or reliability, the organization should  select compensating countermeasures, such as use of physical security (e.g., control center  keycard access for authorized users) to provide an equivalent security capability or level of  protection for the OT. This guidance also applies to the use of session lock and session  termination in an OT.  A unique challenge in OT is the need for immediate access to an HMI in emergency situations.  The time needed to enter a user’s credentials may impede response or intervention by the  operator, resulting in negative consequences to safety, health, or the environment.  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63-3 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-73-4 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-76-2 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-100  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  94  6.2.1.1 Logical Access Controls (PR.AC)  2621  Logical access controls restrict logical access to systems, data, and networks of the organization. 2622  ACLs are sometimes used to support logical access controls. An ACL is one or more rules for 2623  determining whether an access request should be granted or denied; they are used to support the 2624  principle of least functionality and control access to restricted areas. They are commonly used 2625  with isolation technologies such as firewalls where an ACL might specify the source, 2626  destination, and protocol allowed through the isolation device to or from the protected network 2627  segment. An ACL may also be used for physical or logical access to areas or information such as 2628  network file shares, databases, or other data repositories and applications. 2629  Another technology for supporting logical access controls is called Role-Based Access Control 2630  (RBAC). RBAC is a technology that has the potential to reduce the complexity and cost of 2631  security administration in networks with large numbers of intelligent devices. RBAC is built on 2632  the principle that employees change roles and responsibilities more frequently than the duties 2633  within roles and responsibilities. Under RBAC, security administration is simplified using roles, 2634  hierarchies, and constraints to organize user access levels. 2635  Additionally, Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) is an access control approach in which 2636  access is determined based on attributes associated with subjects (requesters) and the objects 2637  being accessed. Each object and subject have a set of associated attributes, such as location, time 2638  of creation, access rights, etc. Access to an object is authorized or denied depending upon 2639  whether the required (e.g., policy-defined) correlation can be made between the attributes of that 2640  object and of the requesting subject. 2641  For federal employees and contractors, Personal Identity Verification (PIV), used in accordance 2642  with FIPS 201, may be required to achieve access control. Organizations may also consider one 2643  or more of these techniques when determining how to support local access controls within their 2644  environments. Supplemental guidance for access controls can be found in the following 2645  documents: 2646   NIST SP 800-63-3, Digital Identity Guidelines 2647   NIST SP 800-73-4, Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification 2648   NIST SP 800-76-2, Biometric Specifications for Personal Identity Verification 2649   NIST SP 800-78-4, Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes for Personal Identity 2650  Verification 2651   NIST SP 800-96, PIV Card to Reader Interoperability Guidelines 2652   NIST SP 800-97, Establishing Wireless Robust Security Networks: A Guide to IEEE 802.11i 2653   NIST SP 800-162, Guide to Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) Definition and 2654  Considerations 2655  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63-3 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-73-4 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-76-2 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-78-4 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-78-4 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-96 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-97 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-162 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-162  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  95  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Organizations should consider the following:   Some logical access controls such as RBAC support the principle of least privilege and  separation of duties by providing a uniform means to manage access to OT devices while  reducing the cost of maintaining individual device access levels and minimizing errors.  These logical access controls can also restrict OT user privileges to only those required to  perform each person’s job (i.e., configuring each role based on the principle of least  privilege). The level of access can take several forms, including viewing, using, and  altering specific OT data or device functions.   Implement solutions that provide credential management, authentication and authorization,  and system use monitoring technical capabilities. These technologies may help manage  risks associated with OT devices and protocols by providing a secure platform to allow  authorized personnel to access the OT devices.   Access control systems that verify the identity of the individual, process, or device before  granting access should be designed to minimize latency or delays in processing OT system  access or commands.   Implementing highly reliable systems that do not interfere with the routine or emergency  duties of OT personnel. Solutions should be designed to reduce the impact of determining  identity and authorization on OT operations and safety.  2656  To support access controls, an organization is not limited to a single access control approach. In 2657  some cases, applying different access control techniques to different zones based on criticality, 2658  safety, and operational requirements is more efficient and effective. For example, ACLs on 2659  network zone firewalls combined with RBAC on engineering workstations and servers, plus 2660  ABAC integrated into physical security to sensitive areas may achieve the risk-based access 2661  control requirements for an organization. 2662  6.2.1.2 Physical Access Controls (PR.AC-2) 2663  Physical security controls are any physical measures that limit physical access to assets. These 2664  measures are employed to prevent many types of undesirable effects including unauthorized 2665  physical access to sensitive locations; unauthorized introduction of new systems, infrastructure, 2666  communications interfaces, or removable media; and unauthorized disruption of the physical 2667  process. Physical access controls include controls for managing and monitoring physical access, 2668  maintaining logs, and handling visitors.  2669  Deployment of physical security controls is often subject to environmental, safety, regulatory, 2670  legal, and other requirements that must be identified and addressed specific to a given 2671  environment. Physical security controls may be broadly applied or could be specific to certain 2672  assets. 2673  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  96  Initial layers of physical access control are often determined based on the risk of access to the 2674  overall facility, not just OT components. Some regulations, such as NERC CIP-006-5 (Physical 2675  Security of BES Cyber Systems) or from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), may also 2676  determine the strength and quantity of barriers used for the physical protection of a facility.  2677  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance   The physical protection of the cyber components and data associated with OT must be  addressed as part of the overall security for OT environments. Security at many OT  facilities is closely tied to operational safety. A primary goal is to keep personnel out of  hazardous situations without preventing them from doing their jobs or carrying out  emergency procedures.   Physical access controls are often applied to the OT environment as compensating controls  when legacy systems do not support modern IT logical access controls (e.g., an asset could  be locked in a cabinet when the USB port or power button cannot be logically disabled).  When implementing these mitigations, organizations should consider if the OT component  being protected can be compromised using a wireless or network connection that might  bypass the physical security controls.  A defense-in-depth solution to physical security should consider the following attributes:   Protection of Physical Locations. Classic physical security considerations typically  include an architecture of layered security measures creating several physical barriers  around buildings, facilities, rooms, equipment, or other informational assets. Physical  security controls should be implemented to protect physical locations and may include  fences, anti-vehicle ditches, earthen mounds, walls, reinforced barricades, gates, door and  cabinet locks, guards, or other measures.   Physical Access Control. Equipment cabinets should be locked when not required for  operation or safety, and wiring should be neat and within cabinets or under floors.  Additionally, consider keeping all computing and networking equipment in secured areas.  Keys of OT assets like PLCs and safety systems should be in the “Run” position at all  times unless they are being actively programmed.   Access Monitoring Systems. Access monitoring systems include electronic surveillance  capabilities such as still and video cameras, sensors, and identification systems (e.g., badge  readers, biometric scanners, electronic keypads). Such devices typically do not prevent  access to a particular location; rather, they store and record either the physical presence or  the lack of physical presence of individuals, vehicles, animals, or other physical entities.  Adequate lighting should be provided based on the type of access monitoring device  deployed. These systems can also sometimes alert or initiate action upon detection of  unauthorized access.   People and Asset Tracking. Locating people and vehicles in a facility can be important  for safety reasons, and it is increasingly important for security reasons as well. Asset  location technologies can be used to track the movements of people and vehicles to ensure  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  97  that they stay in authorized areas, to identify personnel needing assistance, and to support  emergency response.  The following are additional physical security considerations:   Portable Devices. Organizations should apply a verification process that includes, at a  minimum, scanning devices (e.g., laptops, USB storage, etc.) for malicious code prior to  allowing the device to be connected to OT devices or networks.   Cabling. Unshielded twisted pair communications cable, while acceptable for the office  environment, may not be suitable for some OT environment due to its susceptibility to  interference from magnetic fields, radio waves, temperature extremes, moisture, dust, and  vibration. Organizations should consider using alternative cabling or shielding that  provides suitable protection against environmental threats. Additionally, organizations  should consider color-coded cables, connectors, and conduits in addition to labeling to  clearly delineate OT and IT network segments and reduce the risk of potential cross- connections.   Control Centers / Control Rooms. Providing physical security for control centers/control  rooms is recommended to reduce the potential of many threats including unauthorized  access. The access to these areas should be limited to authorized personnel due to the  increased probability of finding sensitive servers, network components, control systems,  and consoles for supporting continuous monitoring and rapid response. Gaining physical  access to a control room or OT system components often implies gaining logical access to  the system or system components. In extreme cases, organizations may need to consider  designing control centers/control rooms to be blast-proof, or to provide an offsite  emergency control center/control room so that control can be maintained if the primary  control center/control room becomes uninhabitable.  2678  6.2.1.3 Network Segmentation and Isolation (PR.AC-5) 2679  As discussed in Section 5, a common architecture for supporting a defense-in-depth 2680  cybersecurity approach involves the use of network segmentation or zoning to organize devices 2681  by location or function. Network segmentation is typically implemented physically using 2682  different network switches or logically using Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) 2683  configurations. When properly configured, network segmentation supports enforcing security 2684  policies and segmented traffic at the Ethernet layer and facilitates network isolation. 2685  For network isolation, organizations typically utilize their mapped data flows to identify required 2686  communications between segments. Network isolation devices such as gateways (including 2687  unidirectional gateways or data-diodes) and firewalls are then configured to enforce these 2688  communication restrictions by monitoring all communication traffic and only permitting 2689  communication between segments that has been explicitly authorized. 2690  2691  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  98  Supplemental guidance for access controls can be found in the following documents: 2692   NIST SP 800-41 Rev. 1, Guidelines on Firewalls and Firewall Policy 2693   NIST SP 800-207, Zero Trust Architecture 2694   NIST SP 1800-15, Securing Small-Business and Home Internet of Things (IoT) Devices: 2695  Mitigating Network-Based Attacks Using Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) 2696  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  The use of network segmentation and isolation should support an organization’s OT  cybersecurity defense in depth architecture, as described in Section 5.  While VLANs can be a cost-effective solution for OT network segmentation, organizations  should consider utilizing physically separate switches for segmenting high-criticality devices  such as those supporting safety systems.  When configuring network isolation devices, organizations may find it difficult to determine  which network traffic is necessary for proper OT operations. In these situations, organizations  might consider temporarily allowing and recording all communication between the network  segments. This can provide reviewable logs to identify and document authorized  communication for implementing network isolation rules. Additionally, this activity might  also reveal previously unknown or undocumented communication that needs to be reviewed  by the organization.  Organizations should also consider whether regulatory requirements stipulate the type of  network isolation devices required for OT environments or specific network segments. If  organizations choose to utilize firewalls for supporting network isolation, modern firewalls  such as stateful and deep packet inspection devices and devices specifically designed to  support OT environments should be considered. Organizations should enforce a deny-all,  permit-by-exception policy where possible and also review the Centre for the Protection of  National Infrastructure’s (CPNI) Firewall Deployment for SCADA and Process Control  Networks: Good Practice Guide to assist with their firewall implementations.  Organizations should keep in mind that network isolation devices might not protect against  all network-based risks. For example, network isolation does not mitigate risks associated  with lateral movement within a network segment such as the propagation of a worm or other  malicious code. Additionally, some IT protocols and many industrial communications  protocols have known security vulnerabilities which might be exploitable through network  isolation devices. Organizations should consider limiting the flow of insecure protocols,  restricting information flow to be unidirectional, and utilizing secure and authenticated  protocols for supporting information exchange between the OT environment and other  network segments.  2697  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-41r1 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-207 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-15 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-15 https://www.energy.gov/oe/downloads/good-practice-guide-firewall-deployment-scada-and-process-control-networks https://www.energy.gov/oe/downloads/good-practice-guide-firewall-deployment-scada-and-process-control-networks  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  99  6.2.1.4 User, Device, and Asset Authentication (PR.AC-7) 2698  6.2.1.4.1 Physical Token Authentication 2699  The primary vulnerability that physical token authentication addresses is easily duplicating a 2700  secret code or sharing it with others. It eliminates the all-too-common scenario of a password to 2701  a “secure” system being on the wall next to a PC or operator station. The security token cannot 2702  be duplicated without special access to equipment and supplies.  2703  A second benefit is that the secret within a physical token can be very large, physically secure, 2704  and randomly generated. Because it is embedded in metal or silicon, it does not have the same 2705  risks that manually entered passwords do. If a security token is lost or stolen, the token owner is 2706  aware of the missing token and can notify security personnel to disable access. Traditional 2707  passwords can become lost or stolen without notice, leaving credentials more vulnerable to 2708  exploitation. 2709  Common forms of physical/token authentication include: 2710   Traditional physical lock and keys 2711   Security cards (e.g., magnetic, smart chip, optical coding) 2712   Radio frequency devices in the form of cards, key fobs, or mounted tags 2713   Dongles with secure encryption keys that attach to the USB, serial, or parallel ports of 2714  computers 2715   One-time authentication code generators (e.g., key fobs) 2716  For single-factor authentication with a physical token, the largest weakness is that physically 2717  holding the token means access is granted (e.g., anyone finding a set of lost keys now has access 2718  to whatever they open). Physical token authentication is more secure when combined with a 2719  second form of authentication, such as a memorized PIN used along with the token. 2720  When token-based access control employs cryptographic verification, the access control system 2721  should conform to the requirements of NIST SP 800-78 [SP800-78]. 2722  6.2.1.4.2 Biometric Authentication 2723  Biometric authentication enhances software-only solutions, such as password authentication, by 2724  offering an additional authentication factor and removing the need for people to memorize 2725  complex secrets. In addition, because biometric characteristics are unique to a given individual, 2726  biometric authentication addresses the issues of lost or stolen physical tokens and smart cards. 2727  Biometric devices make a useful secondary check versus other forms of authentication that can 2728  become lost or borrowed. Using biometric authentication in combination with token-based 2729  access control or badge-operated employee time clocks increases the security level.  2730  2731  2732  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  100  Noted issues with biometric authentication include: 2733   Distinguishing a real object from a fake (e.g., how to distinguish a real human finger from a 2734  silicon-rubber cast of one or a real human voice from a recorded one). 2735   Generating type-I and type-II errors (the probability of rejecting a valid biometric image, and 2736  the probability of accepting an invalid biometric image, respectively). Biometric 2737  authentication devices should be configured to the lowest crossover between these two 2738  probabilities, also known as the crossover error rate. 2739   Handling environmental factors such as temperature and humidity to which some biometric 2740  devices are sensitive.  2741   Addressing industrial applications where employees may have on safety glasses and/or 2742  gloves and industrial chemicals may impact biometric scanners. 2743   Retraining biometric scanners that occasionally “drift” over time. Human biometric traits 2744  may also shift over time, necessitating periodic scanner retraining. 2745   Requiring face-to-face technical support and verification for device training, unlike a 2746  password that can be given over a phone or an access card that can be handed out by a 2747  receptionist. 2748   Denying needed access to the OT system because of a temporary inability of the sensing 2749  device to acknowledge a legitimate user. 2750   Being socially acceptable. Users consider some biometric authentication devices more 2751  acceptable than others. For example, retinal scans may be considered very low on the scale of 2752  acceptability, while thumbprint scanners may be considered high on the scale of 2753  acceptability. Users of biometric authentication devices will need to take social acceptability 2754  for their target group into consideration when selecting among biometric authentication 2755  technologies. 2756  When token-based access control employs biometric verification, the access control system 2757  should conform to the requirements of NIST SP 800-76 [SP800-76]. 2758  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  While biometrics can provide a valuable authentication mechanism, organizations may need  to carefully assess this technology for use with industrial applications. Physical and  environmental issues within OT environments may decrease the reliability of biometric  authorized authentication. Organizations may need to coordinate with system vendors or  manufacturers regarding their specific physical and environmental properties and biometric  authentication requirements.  2759  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  101  6.2.1.4.3 Smart Card Authentication 2760  Smart cards come in a variety of form factors, from USB devices to embedded chips on cards 2761  about the size of credit cards that can be printed and embossed. Smart cards can be customized, 2762  individualized, and issued in-house or outsourced to service providers who could issue hundreds 2763  of thousands per day. Smart cards enhance software-only solutions, such as password 2764  authentication, by offering an additional authentication factor and removing the human element 2765  in memorizing complex secrets by: 2766   Isolating security-critical computations involving authentication, digital signatures, and key 2767  exchange from other parts of the system that do not have a need to know 2768   Enabling portability of credentials and other private information between computer systems 2769   Providing tamper-resistant storage for protecting private keys and other forms of personal 2770  information 2771  Most issues regarding the use of smart cards are logistical and focus on issuing cards, 2772  particularly to replace lost or stolen cards. 2773  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Although smart cards offer useful functionality, in an OT context their implementation must  consider the overall security context of the OT environment. The necessary identification of  individuals, issuance of cards, revocation if compromise is suspected, and the assignment of  authorizations to authenticated identities represents a significant initial and ongoing  challenge. In some cases, corporate IT or other resources may be available to assist in the  deployment of smart cards and the required public key infrastructures. Organizations should  also consider the impact on OT operational capability if dependency on IT systems and  services are required to support the smart card technology.  Additionally, if smart cards are implemented in an OT setting, organizations should consider  provisions for management of lost or damaged cards, the costs to incorporate and sustain a  respective access control system, and a management process for card distribution and  retrieval. These procedures should take into consideration the ability to grant temporary  access to OT personnel to prevent operational or safety disruptions.  A common approach in the Federal Government is based on the standardization on Federal  PIV smart cards allowing organizations to use the same credential mechanism in multiple  applications with one to three factors for authentication (Card-Only, Card+PIN,  Card+PIN+Biometric) depending on the risk-level of the resource being protected. If the  Federal PIV is used as an identification token, the access control system should conform to  the requirements of FIPS 201 [FIPS201] and NIST SP 800-73 [SP800-73] and employ either  cryptographic verification or biometric verification.  2774  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  102  6.2.1.4.4 Multi-Factor Authentication  2775  Organizations should consider that there are several possible factors for determining the 2776  authenticity of a person, device, or system, including something you know, something you have 2777  or something you are. When two or more factors are used, the process is known generically as 2778  multi-factor authentication (MFA). In general, the more factors that are used in the 2779  authentication process, the more robust the process. For example, authentication could be based 2780  on something known (e.g., PIN number or password), something possessed (e.g., key, dongle, 2781  smart card), or something you are such as a biological characteristic (e.g., fingerprint, retinal 2782  signature). 2783  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Organizations need to consider whether MFA is required for protecting OT environments in  whole or in part. MFA is an accepted best practice for remote access to OT applications. When  determining the placement and usage of MFA within an OT environment, organizations may  need to consider different authentication scenarios since some OT components support only a  single factor or no authentication. Organizations may consider adjusting credential  requirements based on the type of access or other mitigating factors for the environment. For  example, remote access to the OT environment may require MFA, while local access may only  require user ID and password due to other mitigating factors, such as physical access controls  before gaining physical access to the area where the user ID and password may be used.  2784  6.2.1.4.5 Password Authentication  2785  While password authentication schemes are arguably the most common and simplest form of 2786  authentication, numerous vulnerabilities are associated with the use and reliance on password-2787  only authentication. For example, systems are often delivered with default passwords that can be 2788  easily guessed, discovered, or researched. Another weakness is the ease of third-party 2789  eavesdropping. Passwords typed at a keyboard can be visually observed by others or recorded 2790  using keystroke loggers.  2791  Some network services and protocols transmit passwords as plaintext (unencrypted), allowing 2792  any network capture tool to expose the passwords. Additionally, passwords may be shared and 2793  not changed frequently. The use of shared credentials, including shared passwords, limits the 2794  ability to positively identify the individual person, process, or device that accessed a protected 2795  resource. Defense-in-depth is often utilized to prevent password authentication from being the 2796  only control in place to prevent unauthorized modification. 2797  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Many OT systems do not offer password recovery mechanisms, so the secure and reliable  handling of passwords is critical to maintaining continuous operation. Organizations are  encouraged to change the default password on OT equipment to make it more difficult for an  adversary to guess the password. Once changed, the password needs to be made available to  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  103  those that need to know. Organizations may want to consider using a password management  tool that is secure and accessible by those that need to know.  Some OT OSs make setting secure passwords difficult, as the password size is smaller than  current password standards and the system allows only group passwords at each level of  access, not individual passwords. Some industrial (and Internet) protocols transmit passwords  in plaintext, making them susceptible to interception. In cases where this practice cannot be  avoided, it is important that users have different (and unrelated) passwords for use with  encrypted and non-encrypted protocols.  Additionally, special considerations may be required when applying policies based on login  password authentication within the OT environment. Without an exclusion list based on  machine identification (ID), non-operator logon can result in policies such as auto-logoff  timeout and administrator password replacement being pushed down, and that can be  detrimental to the operation of the OT system.  The following are general recommendations and considerations with regards to the use of  passwords.   Change all default passwords in OT components.   Passwords should have appropriate length, strength, and complexity balanced between  security and operational ease of access within the capabilities of the software and  underlying OS.   Passwords should not be able to be found in a dictionary or contain predictable sequences  of numbers or letters.   Passwords should be used with care on specialized OT devices such as control consoles on  critical processes. Using passwords on these consoles could introduce potential safety  issues if operators are locked out or delayed access during critical events. Organizations  should consider physical or network isolation for devices where password protection is not  recommended.   Copies of shared or master passwords must be stored in a secure location with limited  access that can also be accessed in an emergency. Organizations may also need to consider  procedures to periodically change passwords when a password is compromised or an  individual with access leaves the organization.   Privileged (administrative) account passwords require additional protection such as  stronger password requirements, more frequent changing, and additional physical  safeguards.   Passwords should not be sent across any network unless protected by some form of FIPS- approved encryption or salted cryptographic hash specifically designed to prevent replay  attacks.  2798  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  104  6.2.2 Awareness and Training (PR.AT) 2799  The Awareness and Training category provides policy and procedures for ensuring that all users 2800  are provided basic cybersecurity awareness and training. 2801  Supplemental guidance can be found in the following documents: 2802   NIST SP 800-50, Building an Information Technology Security Awareness and Training 2803  Program 2804   NIST SP 800-100, Information Security Handbook: A Guide for Managers 2805   NIST SP 800-181 Rev. 1, Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity (NICE Framework) 2806  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance 2807  Personnel should receive OT-specific security awareness and training for the environment and 2808  specific applications. In addition, organizations identify, document, and train all personnel 2809  having significant OT roles and responsibilities. Awareness and training should cover the 2810  physical process being controlled as well as the OT system. 2811  Security awareness is a critical part of OT incident prevention, particularly when it comes to 2812  social engineering threats. Social engineering is a technique used to manipulate individuals into 2813  giving away private information, such as passwords. This information can then be used to 2814  compromise otherwise secure systems. 2815  OT security-specific awareness and training programs could include: a basic understanding of 2816  social engineering techniques and identifying anomalous behavior in the OT environment, 2817  guidance on when and how to connect and disconnect the OT environment from external security 2818  domains, password complexity and management requirements, and reporting practices. All 2819  personnel with OT responsibility should be provided training, but the training may be tailored 2820  based on roles and responsibilities. Roles to consider in the training program could include 2821  senior executives, privileged account users, third-party providers, physical security personnel, 2822  control engineers, operators, and maintainers. 2823  6.2.3 Data Security (PR.DS) 2824  Providing data security includes protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data-2825  at-rest and data-in-transit, protecting assets after removal, and preventing data leaks. 2826  Use of cryptography can support data security requirements. Encryption, digital signatures, 2827  hashing, and other cryptographic functions are available to prevent unauthorized access or 2828  modification of data at rest and in transit [RFC4949]. When cryptography is selected, 2829  organizations should use a certified cryptographic system. Federal organizations are required to 2830  comply with FIPS 140-3 [FIPS140] and the Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP). 2831  Additionally, cryptographic hardware should be protected from physical tampering and 2832  uncontrolled electronic connections. 2833  Supplemental guidance for data security can be found in the following documents: 2834  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-50 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-50 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-100 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-181r1 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  105   NIST SP 800-47 Rev. 1, Managing the Security of Information Exchanges 2835   NIST SP 800-111, Guide to Storage Encryption Technologies for End User Devices 2836   NIST SP 800-209, Security Guidelines for Storage Infrastructure 2837  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Identify critical file types and data to protect (both physical and electronic) while at rest. This  may include personally identifiable information and sensitive, proprietary, or trade secret  information (e.g., PLC program code, robot programs, computer aided drafting/computer  aided manufacturing files, operating manuals and documentation, electrical diagrams,  network diagrams, historical production data [NISTIR 8183]). Organizations should consider  centralizing critical data within secure storage locations.  When OT data is stored in the cloud or vendor servers, organizations should consider  performing a risk analysis to determine how the data is protected by the service provider and  if additional countermeasures should be implemented to manage risk to an acceptable level.  Information flows from the OT security domain to other security domains, and connections  between security domains are monitored. Technologies such as data diodes, firewalls, and  ACLs can be used to restrict the information flow. Examples of critical interfaces and  interconnections may include interfaces between IT and OT, OT and external industry  partners, or OT and third-party support vendors.  To protect data on system components at end-of-life, an asset disposal program should be  implemented, including consideration for wiping, sanitizing, or otherwise destroying critical  data and media prior to disposal. The asset disposal program should include any removeable  media and mobile devices as well as traditional OT hardware.  Cryptography  Critical OT data should be protected while in transit, especially over third-party network  segments and other untrusted or vulnerable network paths (e.g., cellular, wireless, Internet,  WAN). First identify which data is critical, then implement cryptographic mechanisms (e.g.,  encryption) to prevent unauthorized access or modification of system data and audit records.  Encryption provides a mechanism for ensuring confidentiality and integrity for data in transit.  OT applications often focus on availability of data. Before deploying encryption in OT,  ensure that confidentiality or integrity is the goal of applying the security control. The use of  encryption within an OT environment could introduce communications latency due to the  additional time and computing resources required to encrypt, decrypt, and authenticate each  message. Degradation of performance of the end device or system caused by encryption, or  any other security technique, should be considered. Before deploying encryption within an  OT environment, solutions should be tested to determine if latency is acceptable for the  application. Encryption at OSI Layer 2 rather than Layer 3 may be implemented to help  reduce encryption latency.  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-47r1 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-111 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-209  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  106  Additionally, while encryption provides confidentiality between encryption/decryption  devices, anomaly detection tools supporting OT environments may not be able to read  encrypted data. Encryption should therefore be carefully planned and implemented to manage  operational risks.  Organizations should also consider that cryptography may introduce key management issues.  Sound security policies require key management processes, which can become more difficult  as the geographic size of the OT increases. Because site visits to change or manage keys can  be costly and slow, organizations should consider if cryptographic protection with remote key  management may be beneficial, such as when the units being protected are so numerous or  geographically dispersed that managing keys is difficult or expensive.  For OT, encryption can be deployed as part of a comprehensive, enforced security policy. A  cryptographic key should be long enough so that guessing it or determining it through  analysis takes more effort, time, and cost than the value of the protected asset.  2838  6.2.4 Information Protection Processes and Procedures (PR.IP) 2839  Policies, processes, and procedures should be maintained and used to manage protection of 2840  information systems and assets. Countermeasures and outcomes should be in place to manage 2841  configuration changes throughout the life cycle of the component and system. Backups should be 2842  maintained, and response and recovery plans should be prepared and tested. A plan should be 2843  developed and implemented for vulnerability management throughout the life cycle of the 2844  components.  2845  6.2.4.1 Least Functionality (PR.IP-1) 2846  The principle of least functionality entails configuring systems to only provide essential 2847  functions and services. Some of the functions and services routinely provided by default may not 2848  be necessary to support essential organizational missions, functions, or operations. These 2849  functions include network ports and protocols, software, and services. 2850  Supplemental guidance can be found in the following document: 2851   NIST SP 800-167, Guide to Application Whitelisting 2852  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Systems and devices in the OT environment include many functions and services that may  not be necessary for their proper operation, some of which may be enabled by default and  without knowledge of the organization. Any functions or services that are not required for  proper operation should be disabled to reduce exposure.  Care should be taken when disabling these functions and services, as unintended impacts may  result if a critical function or service is unknowingly disabled (e.g., disabling all external  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-167  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  107  communications to a PLC may also disable the ability to communicate with associated  HMIs). Devices should be subjected to extensive testing before being deployed to the OT  network.  2853  6.2.4.2 Configuration Change Control (Configuration Management) (PR.IP-3) 2854  Configuration management helps ensure that systems are deployed and maintained in a secure 2855  and consistent state, allowing organizations to reduce risks from outages due to configuration 2856  issues and security breaches through improved visibility and tracking of changes to the system. 2857  In addition, configuration management can detect improper configurations before they 2858  negatively impact performance, safety, or security. Configuration management tools enable an 2859  asset owner to establish and maintain the integrity of system hardware and software components 2860  by controlling processes for initializing, changing, monitoring, and auditing the configurations of 2861  the components throughout the system life cycle. 2862  Supplemental guidance for configuration management can be found in the following documents: 2863   NIST SP 800-128, Guide for Security-Focused Configuration Management of Information 2864  Systems 2865   NIST SP 1800-5, IT Asset Management 2866  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Organizations should document the approved baseline configuration for their OT devices.  Additionally, organizations should establish the system development life cycle (SDLC)  approach to document, test, and approve changes before deploying to the OT environment.  Some organizations may maintain logbooks or other similar methods to document changes to  OT components. Organizations should consider centralizing the tracking and documentation of  changes to the OT environment to improve visibility and ensure proper testing and approvals  for system changes. Such a process may allow organizations to prevent accidental  reconfiguration or identify intentional reconfiguration of components to unapproved or  untested versions.  In some cases, the use of automated configuration management tools might be appropriate.  Processes should be in place to validate configurations prior to deployment. Many changes to  OT can be made only during scheduled maintenance downtimes to minimize impacts. When  considering automated configuration management tools, organizations should consider  potential impact to the OT system. In some cases, these tools transfer numerous types of data  over the manufacturing system network, and potentially large amounts of data. Additionally,  some tools may also have the potential to impact OT system operations by attempting to  change device configurations or manipulating active files.  2867  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-128 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-128 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-5  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  108  6.2.4.3 Backups (PR.IP-4) 2868  Conducting, maintaining, and testing backups is a critical outcome for the recovery process if a 2869  cyber or reliability incident occurs.  2870  Supplemental guidance for determining priority and strategy for backups can be found in the 2871  following documents: 2872   NIST SP 800-34 Rev. 1, Contingency Planning Guide for Federal Information Systems 2873   NIST SP 800-209, Security Guidelines for Storage Infrastructure 2874  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  A list should be developed of all backups maintained, including installation media, license  keys, and configuration information. Additional measures should be taken to ensure that  backups are readily available when needed:   Verify the backups for reliability and integrity (if technically possible).   Establish an onsite location for backups that is accessible to all personnel who may need  access during a recovery event.   Establish an alternative secondary storage location for additional copies of backups to  ensure that the same incident that disrupts primary data cannot modify or destroy the  backup (e.g., store PLC logic and configuration files at an offsite, geographically diverse  location that cannot be destroyed by the same [hurricane, wildfire, tornado] that may  destroy the PLC).   Include testing of restoration process from backup data as part of contingency plan  testing.   Ensure backup procedures are included in configuration or change management  processes.   Secure backups according to access control requirements.   Monitor environmental conditions where backup media is stored.  2875  6.2.4.4 Physical Operating Environment (PR.IP-5) 2876  Managing the physical operating environment includes emergency protection controls such as 2877  emergency shutdown of the system, backup for power and lighting, controls for temperature and 2878  humidity, and protection against fire and water damage. Organizations should develop policies 2879  and procedures to ensure that environmental operating requirements for assets are achieved.  2880  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-34r1 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-209  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  109  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Organizations should consider the following factors when identifying potential  countermeasures to implement to protect the physical operating environment:   Environmental Factors. Environmental factors can be important. For example, if a site  is dusty, systems should be placed in a filtered environment. This is particularly important  if the dust is likely to be conductive or magnetic, as in the case of sites that process coal  or iron. If vibration is likely to be a problem, systems should be mounted on rubber  bushings to prevent disk crashes and wiring connection problems. In addition, the  environments containing systems and media (e.g., backup tapes, floppy disks) should  have stable temperature and humidity. An alarm to the OT system should be generated  when environmental specifications such as temperature or humidity are exceeded.   Environmental Control Systems. HVAC systems for control rooms must support OT  personnel during normal operation and emergency situations, which could include the  release of toxic substances. Risk assessments should consider the risk of operating an  HVAC system (e.g., air intakes) in an occupied shelter during a toxic release, as well as  continued operation during a power outage (e.g., using an uninterruptible power supply in  critical environments).  Fire systems must be carefully designed to avoid causing more harm than good (e.g., to  avoid mixing water with incompatible products). HVAC and fire systems have  significantly increased roles in security that arise from the interdependence of process  control and security. For example, fire prevention and HVAC systems that support  industrial control computers need to be protected against cyber incidents.   Power. Reliable power for OT is essential, so a UPS should be provided for critical  systems. If the site has an emergency generator, the UPS battery life may only need to be  a few seconds; however, if the site relies on external power, the UPS battery life may  need to be hours. It should be sized, at a minimum, so that the system can be shut down  safely.  2881  6.2.4.5 Response and Recovery Plans (PR.IP-9) and Response and Recovery Plan 2882  Testing (PR.IP-10) 2883  Organizations should develop and maintain response plans, including incident response and 2884  business continuity. Response plans should be measured against the service being provided, not 2885  just the system that was compromised. Organizations should consider a systematic approach to 2886  response planning, such as the process described in CISA’s Cybersecurity Incident and 2887  Vulnerability Response Playbooks [CISA-CIVR]. Common planning steps include preparation, 2888  detection and analysis, containment, recovery, post-incident activity, communication, and 2889  coordination. Organizations should also establish a regular review and update for their response 2890  plans. 2891  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  110  The response plans should be documented in paper form or on an offline system (i.e., air gapped) 2892  that cannot be compromised during a cyber-attack. Individuals should be trained on where to 2893  find the response plan, along with the actions to take as part of an incident response. 2894  Additionally, during the preparation of the incident response plan, input should be obtained from 2895  the various stakeholders including operations, engineering, IT, system support vendors, 2896  management, organized labor, legal, and safety. These stakeholders should also review and 2897  approve the plan.  2898  Business continuity planning addresses the overall issue of maintaining or reestablishing 2899  production in the case of an interruption. An outage may involve typical time spans of days, 2900  weeks, or months to recover from a natural disaster, or minutes or hours to recover from a 2901  malware infection or a mechanical/electrical failure. Business continuity plans (BCP) are often 2902  written to cover many types of incidents involving several different disciplines. The BCP for 2903  cybersecurity incidents should broadly cover long-term outages, including disaster recovery, and 2904  short-term outages requiring operational recovery. It is important to work with physical security 2905  on developing the BCP related to cybersecurity incidents. This collaboration with physical 2906  security should include the identification of critical equipment and the associated 2907  countermeasures in place to prevent an incident. 2908  Before creating a BCP to deal with potential outages, it is important to specify the recovery 2909  objectives for the various systems and subsystems involved based on typical business needs. 2910  There are two distinct types of objectives: system recovery and data recovery. System recovery 2911  involves the recovery of communication links and processing capabilities, and it is usually 2912  specified in terms of a Recovery Time Objective (RTO). Management should define the 2913  acceptable RTO, and technical personnel should work to achieve that target. Data recovery 2914  involves the recovery of data describing production or product conditions in the past and is 2915  usually specified in terms of a Recovery Point Objective (RPO). This is defined as the time for 2916  which an absence of data can be tolerated. The RTO and RPO may justify investment in spare 2917  inventory if recovery objectives cannot be met by other means. 2918  Once the recovery objectives are defined, a list of potential interruptions should be created and 2919  the recovery procedure developed and described. A contingency plan is then created for the 2920  variety of potential interruptions. The contingency plan should be reviewed with managers to 2921  ensure that the cost to meet the contingency plan is approved. For many smaller-scale 2922  interruptions, a critical spares inventory will prove adequate to meet the recovery objectives. For 2923  larger-scale recovery, vendor relationships will likely be leveraged. For all types of recovery, 2924  backups are critical.  2925  A disaster recovery plan (DRP) is a documented process or set of procedures comprising a 2926  comprehensive statement of recovery actions to be taken before, during, and after a disaster. The 2927  DRP is ordinarily documented in both electronic and paper form to ensure it is readily available 2928  during any type of disaster. The disaster could be natural, environmental, or caused by humans, 2929  either intentionally or unintentionally. Organizations should develop, maintain, and validate 2930  disaster recovery plans for their environments to help minimize an event impact by reducing the 2931  time required to restore capabilities. 2932  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  111  Organizations may already have some emergency response plans and should consider leveraging 2933  existing plans when developing a response plan for cybersecurity events. 2934  Supplemental guidance for the response planning can be found in the following documents: 2935   NIST SP 800-34 Rev. 1, Contingency Planning Guide for Federal Information Systems 2936   NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide 2937   NIST SP 800-83 Rev. 1, Guide to Malware Incident Prevention and Handling for Desktops 2938  and Laptops 2939   NIST SP 800-100, Information Security Handbook: A Guide for Managers 2940   CISA Security Tip (ST13-003), Handling Destructive Malware 2941   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) National Incident Management System 2942  (NIMS) 2943   FEMA National Preparedness Goal 2944  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Incident response planning may include the following items:   Identification and Classification of Incidents. The various types of OT incidents should  be identified and classified based on potential impact so that a proper response can be  formulated for each potential incident.   Response Actions. There are several responses that can be taken in the event of an  incident. These range from doing nothing to performing a full system shutdown, which  could result in a shutdown of the physical process. The response taken will depend on the  type of incident and its effect on the OT system and the physical process being controlled.  A written plan documenting the response to each type of incident should be prepared.  This will provide guidance during times when there might be confusion or stress due to  the incident. This plan should include step-by-step actions to be taken by the various  organizations. If there are reporting requirements, these should be documented along with  contact information and reporting format to reduce confusion.  Response actions should include steps for Detection and Analysis; Containment,  Eradication, and Recovery; and Post-Incident Activity. Some considerations for OT may  include:  o Determining a priority: either returning to normal operations as quickly as possible,  or performing an investigation and preserving forensic data  o Communicating to the incident response team  o Disconnecting infected systems from the network  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-34r1 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-61r2 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-83r1 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-83r1 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-100 https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST13-003 https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/nims https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/nims https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/national-preparedness/goal  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  112  o Physically isolating operationally independent networks (e.g., enterprise from control  or control from safety)  o Transitioning to manual operations  o Resourcing for additional operations support to manually validate data  o Notifying management, public relations, and/or outside companies and agencies as  required  If an incident is discovered, organizations should conduct a focused risk assessment on the  OT environment to evaluate the effect of both the attack and the options to respond. For  example, one possible response option is to physically isolate the system under attack.  However, this may have a negative impact on the OT and may not be possible without  impacting operational performance or safety. A focused risk assessment should be used to  determine the response action.  The plan should also indicate requirements for the timely replacement of components in the  case of an emergency. If possible, replacements for hard-to-obtain critical components should  be kept in inventory.  The organization should have a means for prioritizing recovery activities. This prioritization  may leverage existing documentation such as risk assessments or startup procedures. As an  example, the focus may be to recover the systems supporting critical utilities prior to the  systems supporting manufacturing based on the order of start-up activities.  Testing recovery plan procedures for OT components could be difficult due to operational  and safety requirements. Organizations may need to determine if “bench tests” or other  offline testing is possible to confirm the recovery procedures for OT components.  Organizations at a minimum should verify the integrity of the backups if a full recovery test  cannot be performed.  2945  6.2.5 Maintenance (PR.MA) 2946  The outcomes that fall within the CSF Maintenance Category provide guidance for performing 2947  routine and preventative maintenance on the components of an information system. This includes 2948  the usage of maintenance tools (both local and remote) and management of maintenance 2949  personnel.  2950  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Maintenance tracking solutions enable an organization to schedule, track, authorize, monitor,  and audit maintenance and repair activities to OT, ensuring maintenance logs or changes  performed are properly documented. Documenting these events provides an audit trail that  can aid in cybersecurity-related troubleshooting, response, and recovery activities.  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  113  Maintenance tracking can also provide visibility into scheduled maintenance for OT devices  and help inform end-of-life decisions.  Software used for OT maintenance activities should be approved and controlled by the  organization. Approved software should be obtained directly from vendors and its  authenticity verified (e.g., by validating certificates or comparing hashes of installers).  Any maintenance performed on an OT device can inadvertently modify its configuration,  resulting in an increased attack surface. The hardened state of the OT device should be  maintained regardless of the maintenance performed. Device configuration should be verified  after maintenance and software patching, as some features may have inadvertently been  reenabled or new features installed. Best practices and other supporting documents should be  obtained from the device vendor to guide and inform maintenance activities.  Limiting the use of certain devices only for maintenance activities can help reduce the  chances of device compromise by exposure to external networks, unauthorized users, or theft.  Maintenance devices that remain secure within the OT environment reduce their exposure.  Using maintenance devices outside the OT environment or connecting the devices to non-OT  networks should be restricted or minimized.  Any device connected to the OT system should be disconnected after the maintenance  activities are completed, and any temporary connections should be removed.  The operation, capabilities, and features of devices used for maintenance activities should be  well understood. Devices may contain wireless radios and other communications devices that  may be vulnerable to side-channel attacks or may allow simultaneous connections between  networks (i.e., dual-homed). Vendor documentation should be thoroughly reviewed to  understand these capabilities.  2951  6.2.6 Protective Technology (PR.PT) 2952  Technical mechanisms assist organizations with protecting the devices and information within 2953  their environments. These technologies alone may not be sufficient to sustain the security 2954  capabilities as threats evolve and change; as such, organizations should manage the technical 2955  solutions securing the organizational assets in a manner consistent with policies, procedures, and 2956  agreements. 2957  6.2.6.1 Logging (PR.PT-1) 2958  Logging enables an organization to capture events occurring within its systems and networks. 2959  Events can be generated by many different systems including OSs, workstations, servers, 2960  networking devices, cybersecurity software, and applications.  2961  Supplemental guidance can be found in the following document: 2962   NIST SP 800-92, Guide to Computer Security Log Management 2963  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-92  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  114  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Capturing log events is critical to maintaining situational awareness of the OT system. The  typical types of events include maintenance functions (e.g., access control, configuration  changes, backup and restore), OS functions, and application (i.e., process) events. The  specific types of events available for logging will vary between OT devices and should be  chosen based on the capabilities of the device and the desired events to be captured.  To support log correlation, each log entry should include identification of the device that  generated the event, the timestamp of the event, and identification of the user or system  account that generated the event. In general, each log entry should include where the event  occurred, the type of event, when the event occurred, the source of the event, the identity of  any users or system accounts related to the event, and the outcome of the event.  Correlating events across multiple OT devices can be difficult if the event timestamps  generated by the devices were not informed by a shared time source. The internal clocks of  each device should be synchronized with a primary clock to support event correlation  between devices. Log entries should also produce a consistent timestamp format (e.g., time  zone format, string format, daylight saving).  The collection and event forwarding functions may impact the performance of the OT device.  Log size may grow quickly depending on the frequency of events being logged, resulting in  increasing space utilization. Disk space and memory is limited on most OT devices, so  adequate storage should be provided either locally or remotely to reduce the likelihood of  exceeding the device capacity, which could ultimately result in the loss of logging capability.  Transferring logs from the OT devices to alternate storage should be considered.  2964  6.2.7 Media Protection (PR.PT-2) 2965  Removable media is protected, and use is restricted in accordance with policy. This includes 2966  labeling media for distribution and handling requirements, as well as storage, transport, 2967  sanitization, destruction, and disposal of the media. 2968  Supplemental guidance can be found in the following documents: 2969   NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1, Guidelines for Media Sanitation 2970   NIST SP 800-100, Information Security Handbook: A Guide for Managers 2971   NIST SP 800-209, Security Guidelines for Storage Infrastructure 2972  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Processes and procedures for the handling of media assets should be developed and followed.  Media assets include removable media and devices such as floppy disks, CDs, DVDs, SD  cards, and USB memory sticks, as well as printed reports and documents. Physical security  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-88r1 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-100 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-209  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  115  controls should address specific requirements for the safe and secure maintenance of these  assets and provide specific guidance for transporting, handling, and erasing or destroying  these assets. Security requirements could include safe storage from loss, fire, theft,  unintentional distribution, or environmental damage.  OT devices should be protected against the misuse of media. The use of any unauthorized  removable media or device on any node that is part of or connected to the OT should not be  permitted. Solutions could be either procedural or technical to prevent the introduction of  malware or the inadvertent loss or theft of data.  Physically protecting media or encrypting the data on media is critical to protecting the OT  environment. For example, if an adversary gains access to media containing OT data, it could  provide valuable information for launching an attack.  2973  6.2.8 Personnel Security 2974  Cybersecurity should be included in human resources practices to reduce the risk of human error, 2975  theft, fraud, or other intentional or unintentional misuse of information systems.  2976  Supplemental guidance for the Personnel Security controls can be found in the following 2977  documents: 2978   NIST SP 800-35, Guide to Information Technology Security Services 2979   NIST SP 800-73-4, Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification 2980   NIST SP 800-76-2, Biometric Specifications for Personal Identity Verification 2981   NIST SP 800-100, Information Security Handbook: A Guide for Managers 2982  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  A general organization personnel security program should be developed to include policy,  position risk designations, personnel screening, terminations and transfers, access  agreements, and third-party roles and responsibilities. OT personnel should be in  communication with Human Resources, IT, and Physical Security as necessary to ensure  personnel security requirements are being met.  An organization should consider establishing an access agreement and request form for  managing access (physical and/or logical) to OT equipment. Organizations should also screen  personnel assigned to critical positions controlling and maintaining the OT.  Additionally, training programs should be developed to ensure that each employee has  received training relevant and necessary to their job functions. Employees should  demonstrate competence in their job functions to retain physical and logical access to OT.  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-35 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-73-4 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-76-2 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-100  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  116  Organizations should consider adopting a framework, such as the National Initiative for  Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Framework, for training their OT personnel.  2983  6.2.9 Wireless Communications 2984  Wireless communications utilize radio frequency (RF) to support data transmission. This can 2985  include Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) local area network communication based on IEEE 802.11 2986  protocols and may also include cellular or other radio-based communications. RF-based 2987  communications provide enhanced flexibility over traditional physical (wired) communication 2988  capabilities. However, RF communications are also more susceptible to interference and may 2989  also allow eavesdropping by unauthorized personnel.  2990  Supplemental guidance for wireless communications can be found in the following documents: 2991   NIST SP 800-97, Establishing Wireless Robust Security Networks: A Guide to IEEE 802.11i 2992   NIST SP 800-121 Rev. 2, Guide to Bluetooth Security 2993   NIST SP 800-153, Guidelines for Securing Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) 2994   NIST SP 800-187, Guide to LTE Security 2995  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  The use of temporary or permanent wireless communication within an OT is a risk-based  decision determined by the organization. Generally, devices utilizing wireless communication  should be placed in a separate network segment and only be deployed where the residual  risks to health, safety, environmental, and financial implications are low.  Prior to installation, a wireless survey should be performed to determine antenna locations  and signal strength to ensure adequate coverage and to minimize exposure of the wireless  network to interference from OT environmental factors and eavesdropping. Organizations  should consider that attackers typically use directional antennas to extend the effective range  of a wireless network beyond the standard range.  Organizations may choose to implement a wireless mesh network to improve resiliency or to  eliminate areas with poor signal strength. Mesh networks can provide fault tolerance through  alternate route selection and preemptive fail-over of the network. Organizations should also  consider the performance and security impacts associated with the use of mesh networks. For  example, when roaming between access points, devices may experience temporary  communication loss. Roaming may also require different security controls to reduce the  transition time. Organizations will need to find the appropriate balance between functional  capabilities and cybersecurity to achieve the risk tolerance.  https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-97 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-121r2-upd1 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-153 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-187  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  117  Wireless LANs   Wireless device communications should be encrypted. The encryption must not degrade  the operational performance of the end devices. Encryption at OSI Layer 2 should be  considered, rather than at Layer 3, to reduce encryption latency. The use of hardware  accelerators to perform cryptographic functions should also be considered.   Wireless access points should establish independent network segments (not extend an  existing segment) and be used in combination with a boundary protection device to  restrict and control communication.   Wireless access points should be configured to have a unique service set identifier (SSID)  and enable Media Access Control (MAC) address filtering at a minimum.   Wireless devices may require different security controls and should be zoned accordingly.   An adaptive routing protocol should be considered if the devices are to be used for  wireless mobility. The convergence time of the network should be as fast as possible  supporting rapid network recovery in the event of a failure or power loss.  Wireless Field Networks  When implementing a wireless field network, the following security features should be  considered:   Selecting a standard, non-proprietary protocol (e.g., IEEE 802.15.x)   Ensuring encryption is used between field instruments and wireless access points   Allowlisting devices into the wireless device manager so rogue devices cannot connect   Implementing appropriately complex passwords and join keys  Most wireless field networks are inherently less reliable than their wired counterparts due to  their susceptibility to signal jamming, distance limitations, and line-of-sight requirements.  Work with the system vendor to design a wireless network appropriate for the application.  2996  6.2.10 Remote Access 2997  When accessing systems or data remotely, security controls should be implemented to prevent 2998  unauthorized access to the organization’s networks, systems, and data. A virtual private network 2999  (VPN) is a set of technologies and protocols designed to support secure remote access to network 3000  environments. A VPN can provide both strong authentication and encryption to secure 3001  communication data by establishing a private network that operates as an overlay on a public 3002  infrastructure. The most common types of VPN technologies implemented today are: 3003   Internet Protocol Security (IPsec). IPsec supports two encryption modes: transport and 3004  tunnel. Transport mode encrypts only the data portion (payload) of each packet while leaving 3005  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  118  the packet header untouched. The more secure tunnel mode adds a new header to each packet 3006  and encrypts both the original header and the payload. On the receiving side, an IPsec-3007  compliant device decrypts each packet. 3008   Transport Layer Security (TLS). Sometimes referred to by the legacy terminology of 3009  Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), TLS provides a secure channel between two machines that 3010  encrypts the contents of each packet. TLS is most often recognized for securing HTTP 3011  traffic; this protocol implementation is known as HTTP Secure (HTTPS). However, TLS is 3012  not limited to HTTP traffic; it can be used to secure many application-layer programs. 3013   Secure Shell (SSH). SSH is a command interface and protocol for securely gaining access to 3014  a remote computer. It is widely used by network administrators to remotely control Linux-3015  based servers. SSH is a secure alternative to a telnet application. SSH is included in most 3016  UNIX distributions and is typically added to other platforms through a third-party package. 3017  Supplemental guidance for access controls can be found in the following documents: 3018   NIST SP 800-52 Rev. 2, Guidelines for the Selection, Configuration, and Use of Transport 3019  Layer Security (TLS) Implementations 3020   NIST SP 800-63B, Digital Identity Guidelines: Authentication and Lifecycle Management 3021   NIST SP 800-77 Rev. 1, Guide to IPsec VPNs 3022   NIST SP 800-113, Guide to SSL VPNs 3023  OT-Specific Guidance and Recommendations  Many OT security architectures are designed with multiple levels, such as in the Purdue  Architecture. This can significantly limit access which can minimize accidental or  unauthorized disruptions to operations. A process should be developed and communicated to  the organization for requesting and enabling remote access. Remote access should be provided  only if justified and limited to only what is required to meet the business need. Remote access  should not circumvent or negate safety or security controls.  In critical situations or when vendor support is needed, temporary remote access may be  requested to perform maintenance. In such cases, procedures should still be followed to ensure  secure connections are being utilized.  There are several different techniques for implementing temporary remote access, including  the following:   Users/protocols (e.g., RDP, SSH) temporarily permitted through the OT/enterprise firewall   Screen-sharing technologies   Modems   VPNs  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-52r2 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-52r2 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63b https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-77r1 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-113  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  119  Regardless of the technology, organizations should consider the following:   Implementing unique usernames and complex passwords   Removing, disabling, or modifying any default credentials   Updating any software/firmware to the latest versions   Removing access when no longer required. Consider implementing automatic timers for  removing access, or the management of change processes to manually confirm removal of  access.   Monitoring remote activities   Ensuring operations personnel are aware of planned remote activity in the OT environment   Initiating the connection from the OT environment   Labeling remote connection devices so that operations may disconnect quickly in the case  of unauthorized use  Dial-Up Modems  If dial-up modems are used in OT environments, consider using callback systems. This  ensures that a dialer is an authorized user by having the modem establish the working  connection based on the dialer’s information and a callback number stored in the OT approved  authorized user list.  If feasible, disconnect modems when not in use, or consider automating this disconnection  process by having modems disconnect after being on for a given amount of time. It should be  noted that sometimes modem connections are part of the legal support service agreement with  the vendor (e.g., 24x7 support with 15-minute response time). Personnel should be aware that  disconnecting/removing the modems may require that contracts be renegotiated.  VPNs  VPN devices used to protect OT systems should be thoroughly tested to verify that the VPN  technology is compatible with the application and that implementation of the VPN devices  does not negatively impact network traffic characteristics.  VPN technology can also be applied between network segments. For example, a remote site  might have a boundary protection device onsite that uses a VPN to establish a secure tunnel  over an untrusted network (e.g., the internet) to a VPN-enabled device in the main control  center at a different location.  6.2.11 Flaw Remediation and Patch Management 3024  Patches are additional pieces of code that have been developed to address specific problems or 3025  flaws in existing software. Vulnerabilities are flaws that can be exploited, enabling unauthorized 3026  access to systems or enabling users to have access to greater privileges than authorized. 3027  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  120  A systematic approach to managing and using software patches can help organizations to 3028  improve the overall security of their systems in a cost-effective way. Organizations that actively 3029  manage and use software patches can reduce the chances that the vulnerabilities in their systems 3030  can be exploited; in addition, they can save time and money that might be spent in responding to 3031  vulnerability-related incidents.  3032  NIST SP 800-40 Revision 4 [SP800-40] provides guidance for CIOs, CISOs, and others who are 3033  responsible for managing organizational risk related to the use of software. This publication 3034  frames patching as a critical component of preventive maintenance for computing technologies – 3035  a cost of doing business, and a necessary part of what organizations need to do in order to 3036  achieve their missions. This publication also discusses common factors that affect enterprise 3037  patch management and recommends creating an enterprise strategy to simplify and 3038  operationalize patching while also improving reduction of risk. The guidance may also be useful 3039  to business and mission owners, security engineers and architects, system administrators, and 3040  security operations personnel. 3041  Supplemental guidance for flaw remediation and patch management can be found in the 3042  following document: 3043   NIST SP 800-40 Rev. 4, Guide to Enterprise Patch Management Planning: Preventive 3044  Maintenance for Technology 3045  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Significant care should be exercised when applying patches to OS components. Patches  should be adequately tested (e.g., offline system testing) to determine the acceptability of any  performance impacts. Regression testing is advised. It is not uncommon for patches to have  an adverse impact on other software. A patch may remove a vulnerability, but it can also  introduce a greater risk from a production or safety perspective. Patching the vulnerability  may also change the way the OS or application works with control applications, causing the  control application to lose some of its functionality. Many OT systems utilize older versions  of OSs that are no longer supported by the vendor; consequently, patches may not be  available.  Organizations should implement a systematic, accountable, and documented OT patch  management process for managing exposure to vulnerabilities. The patch management  process should include guidance on how to monitor for patches, when to apply patches, how  to test the patches (e.g., with vendors or on offline systems), and how to select compensating  controls to limit exposure of the vulnerable system when patching is delayed.  Many OT vulnerabilities are published to CISA as advisories; however, not all vendors report  known vulnerabilities to CISA. Organizations can often stay informed of vulnerabilities by  subscribing to vendor-specific notifications in addition to CISA alerts and advisories. Private  cybersecurity companies also offer services to assist organizations with staying informed of  known vulnerabilities within their OT environment. An organization is responsible for  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-40r4 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-40r4  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  121  staying informed of its OT vulnerabilities and determining when patches should be applied as  part of their documented patch management process.  When and how to deploy patches should be determined by knowledgeable OT personnel.  Consider separating the automated process for OT patch management from the automated  process for non-OT applications. Patching should be deployed during planned OT outages.  Organizations may be required to follow industry-specific guidance on patch management.  Otherwise, they may develop patch management procedures based on existing standards such  as NIST SP 800-40 Rev. 4 [SP800-40r4]; NERC CIP-007, Cyber Security - System Security  Management System Security Management; or ISA 62443-2-3, Patch Management in the  IACS Environment.  3046  6.2.12 Time Synchronization 3047  Time synchronization solutions enable an organization to synchronize time across many devices. 3048  This is important for many functions including event and log correlation, authentication 3049  mechanisms, access control, and quality of service. 3050  Supplemental guidance can be found in the following documents: 3051   NIST SP 800-92, Guide to Computer Security Log Management 3052   NISTIR 8323, Foundational PNT Profile: Applying the Cybersecurity Framework for the 3053  Responsible Use of Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) Services 3054  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Synchronizing the internal clocks of OT systems and devices is critical for cyber event  correlation and other OT functions (e.g., motion control). If a device or system clock is  inaccurate, timestamps generated by the clock for event and log entries will also be  inaccurate, as well as any other functions that utilize the clock.  A common time should be used across all OT devices. Utilizing multiple time sources can  benefit OT devices by reducing clock error and providing backup time sources if the primary  time source is lost or time quality of a primary time source has degraded.  Authenticated Network Time Protocol (NTP) and secure Precision Time Protocol (PTP) (i.e.,  PTP with an authentication TLV [type, length, value]) can be used where there is a risk of  malicious modification to the network time (e.g., RF jamming, packet spoofing, denial of  service). Non-authenticated NTP is susceptible to spoofing and should be located behind the  firewall.  Time sources located in the OT environment should be included in the system and network  monitoring programs. If available, logs from each time source (e.g., syslog) should be  forwarded to a log collection system.  https://www.nerc.com/pa/Stand/Pages/CIPStandards.aspx https://www.nerc.com/pa/Stand/Pages/CIPStandards.aspx https://www.isa.org/standards-and-publications/isa-standards/isa-standards-committees/isa99 https://www.isa.org/standards-and-publications/isa-standards/isa-standards-committees/isa99 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-92 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8323 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8323  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  122  3055  6.3 Detect (DE) 3056  The Detect function enables the timely discovery of cybersecurity events by ensuring appropriate 3057  activities are developed and implemented.  3058  6.3.1 Anomalies and Events (DE.AE) 3059  Organizations should understand the different events and anomalies and their potential impact to 3060  the systems, organization, and environment to establish an effective detection capability. Within 3061  any environment, numerous non-malicious and potentially malicious events and anomalies occur 3062  almost continuously. Some examples of common events include: 3063  Information Events 3064   Multiple failed logon attempts 3065   Locked-out accounts 3066   Unauthorized creation of new accounts 3067   Unexpected remote logons (e.g., logons of individuals that are on vacation, remote logon 3068  when the individual is expected to be local, remote logon for maintenance support when no 3069  support was requested) 3070   Cleared event logs 3071   Unexpectedly full event logs 3072   Antivirus or IDS alerts 3073   Disabled antivirus or other disabled security controls 3074   Requests for information about the system or architecture (social engineering or phishing 3075  attempts) 3076  Operational Events 3077   Unauthorized configuration changes 3078   Unauthorized patching of systems 3079   Unplanned shutdowns 3080  Physical Access Events 3081   Physical intrusions 3082  Networking Events 3083   Unexpected communication, including new ports or protocols being used without appropriate 3084  change management 3085  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  123   Unusually heavy network traffic 3086   Unauthorized devices connecting to the network 3087   Unauthorized communication to external IPs 3088  Organizations should consider that not all events and anomalies are malicious or require follow-3089  up investigation. Organizations should define incident alerting thresholds and response 3090  requirements for the events and anomalies affecting their systems and environment to establish 3091  an efficient incident detection capability.  3092  Organizations should consider collecting and correlating event data from multiple sources and 3093  sensors using automated mechanisms where possible to improve detecting and alerting 3094  capabilities. For example, a centralized intrusion detection system could accept data feeds and 3095  logs from multiple devices and network segments to identify and alarm on organization- or 3096  environment-specific events. Detection tools should also be integrated with asset management 3097  tools. This integration can provide additional context to an event (e.g., where the system is 3098  located, which firmware version it runs, what the criticality of the system is) to help an 3099  organization determine the event impact. 3100  Supplemental guidance can be found in the following documents: 3101   NIST SP 800-92, Guide to Computer Security Log Management 3102   NIST SP 800-94, Guide to Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems 3103   NIST SP 1800-7, Situational Awareness for Electric Utilities 3104  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Organizations should consider OT-specific events and anomalies for their processes and  environments. Also, organizations should note that some tools and alerts for behaviors or  events that could indicate an intrusion may be normal behaviors and events within the OT  environment. To reduce false positive and nuisance alarms, organizations should establish  their OT alerting thresholds based on baselines of normal network traffic and data flows in  addition to normal human and OT process behavior. Additionally, OT components are often  physically remote and not continually staffed. Alerting thresholds may also need to take into  consideration the response time associated with the alert. For example, a temperature alert  threshold may have to be set to alert earlier based on the expected response time to correct  the situation in order to avoid an incident.  Shared credentials are often used on OT systems. Anomalous behavior on shared accounts  may be more difficult to determine, so organizations should consider if additional controls,  such as identifying the use of shared credentials using physical access monitoring, are  required.  3105  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-92 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-94 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-7  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  124  6.3.2 Security Continuous Monitoring (DE.CM) 3106  Organizations should implement continuous monitoring as part of the organizational risk 3107  management strategy to monitor the effectiveness of protective measures. This includes 3108  establishing the frequency for evaluating the implementation of the desired outcomes.  3109  Continuous monitoring can be performed by internal or external resources to identify security 3110  gaps within the environment. Peer reviews (i.e., cold eyes reviews) between sites of the same 3111  organization are highly encouraged. When leveraging third-party services for security continuous 3112  monitoring, it is important to understand and evaluate how the organization’s continuous 3113  monitoring data is protected by the third party. A third party that aggregates continuous 3114  monitoring information from multiple organizations may be a desirable target for adversaries.  3115  Supplemental guidance can be found in the following documents: 3116   NIST SP 800-53A Rev. 5, Assessing Security and Privacy Controls in Information Systems 3117  and Organizations 3118   NIST SP 800-55 Rev. 1, Performance Measurement Guide for Information Security 3119   NIST SP 800-115, Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment 3120   NIST SP 800-137, Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) for Federal 3121  Information Systems and Organizations 3122   NIST SP 800-137A, Assessing Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) 3123  Programs: Developing an ISCM Program Assessment 3124  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Organizations may find that automation within OT environments may not be possible due to  the sensitivity of the systems or the resources required to support the automation. For  example, some automated systems may utilize active scanning for supporting vulnerability or  patch management or for validating device configurations. Solutions that perform active  scanning or use local resources to support automation should be subjected to testing before  deployment to the OT system.  Continuous monitoring can be achieved using automated tools, through passive scanning, or  with manual monitoring performed at a frequency deemed commensurate with the risk. As an  example, a risk assessment may determine that the logs from isolated (i.e., non-networked),  non-critical devices should be reviewed monthly by OT personnel to determine if anomalous  behavior is occurring. Alternatively, a passive network monitor might be able to detect  vulnerable network services without having to scan the devices.  When organizations implement a sampling methodology, the criticality of the components  should be considered. For example, the sampling methodology should not inadvertently  exclude higher risk devices such as layer 3/layer 4 firewalls.  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53Ar5 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53Ar5 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-55r1 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-115 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-137 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-137 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-137A https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-137A  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  125  When using third parties for continuous monitoring of security controls, ensure that the  personnel involved have the appropriate skillset to analyze OT environments.  3125  6.3.2.1 Network Monitoring (DE.CM-1) 3126  Network monitoring involves organizations reviewing alerts and logs and analyzing them for 3127  signs of possible cybersecurity incidents. Organizations should consider automation, including 3128  in-house developed, commercially available solutions, or some combination of tools, to assist 3129  with monitoring efforts. Tools and capabilities that support Behavior Anomaly Detection (BAD), 3130  Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), or Intrusion Detection/Prevention systems 3131  (IDS/IPS) can assist organizations with monitoring traffic throughout the network and generate 3132  alarms when they identify anomalous or suspicious traffic. Some other capabilities to consider 3133  for network monitoring include: 3134   Asset management, including discovering and inventorying devices connected to the network 3135   Baselining typical network traffic, data flows, and device-to-device communications 3136   Diagnosing network performance issues 3137   Identifying misconfigurations or malfunctions of networked devices 3138  Supplemental guidance can be found in the following documents: 3139   NIST SP 800-94, Guide to Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS)  3140   NISTIR 8219, Securing Manufacturing Industrial Control Systems: Behavioral Anomaly 3141  Detection 3142  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Network monitoring can greatly enhance the ability to detect attacks entering or leaving the  OT networks, thereby improving security. It can also improve network efficiency by  detecting non-essential traffic. OT cybersecurity personnel must be part of the diagnostic  process of interpreting the alerts provided by network monitoring tools. Careful monitoring  and an understanding of the normal state of the OT network can help distinguish transient  conditions from legitimate attacks and provide insight into events that are outside the normal  state.  Gaining access to network traffic is typically performed with switched port analyzer (SPAN)  ports and network taps. SPAN ports are a feature in network devices that can logically  duplicate and forward select network traffic to a network monitoring solution. Taps are  bump-in-the-wire network devices that duplicate traffic from a single physical link. For both  types of sensors, care should be taken as performance impacts to the OT system may result  from their use.  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-94 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8219 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8219  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  126  Network sensors should be placed to effectively monitor the OT network. Typical  installations locate the network sensors between the control network and corporate network,  but other locations can include network perimeters, key network segments (e.g., DMZ), and  critical OT devices.  Regardless of the type of network sensor, all sensors should be subjected to extensive testing  and be implemented in a test environment before being deployed to the OT network.  Configuring the sensor into a test or learning mode after it is installed on the network  provides an opportunity to tune the device with real OT network traffic. Tuning can help  reduce false positive alerts, reduce the alert “noise” from typical network traffic, and help  identify implementation and configuration problems.  Failure modes of network sensors in the event of a sensor failure should be considered (e.g.,  does the sensor fail-safe or fail-open if the device fails).  3143  6.3.2.2 System Use Monitoring (DE.CM-1 and DE-CM-3) 3144  System use monitoring solutions enable an organization to monitor, store, and audit system 3145  events (e.g., system logs, running processes, file access and modification, system and application 3146  configuration changes) occurring within a system. Monitoring users and systems helps to ensure 3147  they are behaving as expected and can aid in troubleshooting when events occur by providing 3148  information about which users were working within the system during the event. System and 3149  device misconfigurations can also be identified.  3150  Compared to network monitoring, system use monitoring solutions can analyze activity that does 3151  not traverse the network. In host-based solutions, this can be achieved with real-time monitoring 3152  of inter-process communications and other internal OS data, while active-scanning solutions 3153  gather information by querying the OS or application programming interfaces (APIs).  3154  Supplemental guidance can be found in the following documents: 3155   NIST SP 800-94, Guide to Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) 3156   NIST SP 800-137, Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) for Federal 3157  Information Systems and Organizations 3158  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-94 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-137 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-137  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  127  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Situational awareness of the OT system is imperative to understanding the current state of the  system, validating that it is operating as intended and that no policy violations or cyber  incidents have hindered its operation. Strong device monitoring, logging, and auditing is  necessary to collect, correlate, and analyze security-related information, resulting in  actionable communication of security status across the complete OT system. In the event of a  cybersecurity incident, the information gathered by system-use monitoring solutions can be  used to perform forensic analysis of the OT system.  System-use monitoring solutions can generate significant amounts of events. It is generally  suggested these solutions be used in combination with a control log management system,  such as a SIEM, to help filter the types of events and reduce alert fatigue. The amount of  tuning and customization of events and alerts is dependent on the type of OT system and the  number of devices in the system.  System-use monitoring solutions should be subjected to extensive testing and be  implemented in a test environment before being deployed to devices in the OT system.  Concerns include performance impacts of host-based agents on devices, impact of active  scanning on devices, and capability of the network infrastructure bandwidth. Separate  appliances can offload the processing. Host-based agents can impact the performance of the  OT device because of the resources they consume from the host.  3159  6.3.2.3 Malicious Code Detection (DE.CM-4) 3160  When stored, processed, and transmitted, files and data streams should be scanned using 3161  specialized tools with a combination of heuristic algorithms and known malware signatures to 3162  detect and block potentially malicious code. Malicious code protection tools only function 3163  effectively when installed, configured, run full-time, and maintained properly against the state of 3164  known attack methods and payloads.  3165  Supplemental guidance for anti-malware practices can be found in the following documents: 3166   NIST SP 800-83 Rev. 1, Guide to Malware Incident Prevention and Handling for Desktops 3167  and Laptops 3168   NIST SP 1058, Using Host-Based Anti-Virus Software on Industrial Control Systems: 3169  Integration Guidance and a Test Methodology for Assessing Performance Impacts 3170  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  While antivirus tools are common security practice in IT computer systems, the use of  antivirus with OT may require adopting special practices including compatibility checks,  change management, and performance impact metrics. These practices should be utilized for  testing new signatures and new versions of antivirus software.  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-83r1 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-83r1 https://doi.org/10.6028/nist.sp.1058 https://doi.org/10.6028/nist.sp.1058  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  128  Some OT vendors recommend and even support the use of vendor-specific antivirus tools. In  some cases, OT system vendors may have performed regression testing across their product  line for supported versions of a particular antivirus tool and provide associated installation  and configuration documentation.  Generally:   General-purpose Windows, Unix, Linux systems, etc., used as engineering workstations,  data historians, maintenance laptops, and backup servers can be secured like commercial  IT equipment: install push- or auto-updated antivirus software with updates distributed  via an antivirus server located inside the process control network. Follow organization- developed procedures for transferring the latest updates from known-good vendor sites to  the OT antivirus servers to other OT computers and servers.   Follow vendor recommendations on all other servers and computers (e.g., DCS, PLC,  instruments) that have time-dependent code, modified or extended OSs, or any other  change that makes it different from a standard PC. Perform testing of the antivirus  software and updates on an offline system if possible (e.g., install on a backup HMI and  validate that performance is not degraded before applying to the primary HMI).  According to NIST SP 1058 [SP1058], antivirus software may negatively impact the time- critical control processes of an ICS. The SP also identified significant CPU usage when  running manual scans and signature updates, which could have negative impacts on OT  computers and servers. As a result:   Configuration of the antivirus software should be tested on an offline system, if possible.   Manual scanning and signature updates should be performed while the system is not  critical for operations.   Redundancy should be considered for critical systems requiring ongoing antivirus  updates, such that signature updates can be performed without impact to operations (e.g.,  consoles and HMIs).   When configuring file exclusion lists, determine which control application files should  not be scanned during production time because of possible OT system malfunction or  performance degradation.  CISA provides a recommended practice for updating antivirus in OT environments.  3171  6.3.2.4 Vulnerability Scanning (DE.CM-8) 3172  Vulnerabilities can be identified through a combination of automated and manual techniques. 3173  These vulnerability scans should be performed on an ongoing basis to capture new 3174  vulnerabilities as they are discovered. 3175  https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/Recommended-Practices  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  129  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Some common ways to achieve vulnerability identification in the OT environment are:   Continuous monitoring using passive or active scanning capabilities. Organizations  should consider how vulnerability scanning tools may impact OT components and  communications by testing in an offline environment prior to implementing in production.  o Passive scanning tools typically utilize network traffic analyzers to detect assets and  determine possible vulnerabilities affecting the assets.  o Active scanning tools typically utilize an agent to connect to networked assets and  perform detailed queries and analysis of the components to determine possible  vulnerabilities affecting the assets.   Performance testing, load testing, and penetration testing if the test will not adversely  impact the production environment.   Regular audits, assessments, and peer reviews to identify gaps in security.  3176  6.3.3 Detection Process (DE.DP) 3177  Detection process includes maintaining and testing processes, procedures, and tools to ensure 3178  anomalous events are identified in a prompt manner and responsible parties (individuals) are 3179  alerted and help accountable for adequate response. To ensure ongoing awareness of anomalous 3180  events: define roles and responsibilities to ensure accountability; periodically review that 3181  detection activities comply with the requirements; test the detection processes regularly; 3182  communicate detected events to appropriate personnel to act; and continuously improve 3183  detection capabilities. 3184  6.4 Respond (RS) 3185  The Response function supports the ability to take the appropriate course of action and activities 3186  to contain a cybersecurity incident when it occurs.  3187  6.4.1 Response Planning (RS.RP) 3188  When responding to events, organizations should attempt to capture details associated with 3189  executing the documented response plans. This may help organizations during the post-incident 3190  review process to identify gaps or potential opportunities for improvement in the response plan. 3191  Due to time sensitivity of response efforts, if capturing execution details impacts safety or 3192  increases the time to complete the response plan, organizations may want to consider other 3193  techniques such as reviewing logs, reviewing video footage captured during the response 3194  activities, or interviewing response personnel. 3195  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  130  6.4.2 Response Communications (RS.CO) 3196  Response to a cybersecurity incident includes coordination with internal and external 3197  stakeholders. An incident response team should be assembled. Depending on the complexity and 3198  impact of the incident, the incident response team could consist of one or many individuals that 3199  have been trained on incident response. The FEMA National Incident Management System 3200  (NIMS) can be used to standardize on common terminology and roles for incident response. 3201  Prior to an incident, organizations should consider how to communicate with response personnel 3202  and external entities, including: 3203   developing an email distribution list for incident response 3204   leveraging an emergency notification system 3205   establishing backup communication plans for radio / phone / email if primary communication 3206  systems fail 3207   designating a spokesperson for external communications 3208   designating a scribe for internal incident communications 3209  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  Organizations should consider FEMA’s guidance on crisis communications when  establishing their communication plans and strategies.  Personnel responsible for responding to an incident should be informed of and trained on  their responsibilities.  The response plan should include a detailed list of organizations and personnel that should be  contacted for incident response and reporting under various circumstances. Each individual  should be assigned a role or roles required for incident response, which could include  incident commander; operations, planning, logistics, or finance/administration section chief  or member; and public information, safety, or liaison officer.  To support a response in an OT environment, an organization should consider including the  following personnel in the response plan:  Internal Resources   Designated Incident Commander   Operations leadership   Safety personnel   On-call OT systems personnel  https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/nims https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/nims https://www.ready.gov/crisis-communications-plan  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  131   On-call IT personnel   Physical security personnel   Administrative personnel   Procurement   Public relations and legal personnel  External Industry Partners   OT technical support (vendors, integrators)   Operational supply chain (e.g., suppliers, customers, distributors, business partners)   Incident response team   Surge support   Impacted community (e.g., facility neighbors)  Organizations are required to report incidents to federal agencies in accordance with PPD-21  [PPD-21] and PPD-41 [PPD-41]. CISA maintains the list of sector-specific contacts.  Legal departments can often assist with developing nondisclosure agreements or other  contracts if an organization plans to utilize external resources for incident response. It may be  beneficial to develop these contracts prior to an incident occurring so that incident response  can be immediate. Private companies are available to be held on retainer in case of an OT  incident.  3210  6.4.3 Response Analysis (RS.AN) 3211  Analyses of cybersecurity incidents are conducted to ensure effective response and recovery 3212  activities, consistent with the detection process and the response plan. Analysis includes 3213  reviewing notifications and determining if further investigation is required, understanding the 3214  potential impact, performing forensics, categorizing the incident consistent with the response 3215  plan, and analyzing disclosed vulnerabilities. 3216  Supplemental guidance for the response analysis controls can be found in the following 3217  document: 3218   NIST SP 800-86, Guide to Integrating Forensic Techniques into Incident Response 3219  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  When determining the overall impact of a cybersecurity incident, consider the dependencies  of OT and its resulting impact on operations. For example, an OT system may be dependent  https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/ncirp/National_Cyber_Incident_Response_Plan.pdf https://www.cisa.gov/sector-risk-management-agencies https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-86  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  132  on IT for business applications, such that an incident on the IT network results in an OT  disconnect or shutdown.  If an organization does not have adequate resources or capabilities to conduct OT forensics,  consider engaging external organizations to perform forensic analysis.  Organizations should identify and classify cyber and non-cyber incidents affecting the OT  environment according to the incident response plan. When developing the OT incident  response plan, potential classes of incidents could include accidental actions taken by  authorized personnel, targeted malicious attacks, and untargeted malicious attacks.  3220  6.4.4 Response Mitigation (RS.MI) 3221  Activities are performed to prevent expansion of the incident, mitigate its effects, and resolve the 3222  incident. Mitigation activity should be consistent with the response plan. 3223  OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance  OT components are often physically remote and not continually staffed. For these cases,  consider how the organization would respond during an incident and the additional time  required to coordinate the response. The system may need to be designed with the capability  to minimize impacts until personnel can arrive onsite (e.g., remote shutdown or disconnects).  Cyber incident mitigation may involve process shutdowns or communication disconnects that  have impact to operations. These impacts should be understood and communicated during  incident mitigation.  3224  6.4.5 Response Improvements (RS.IM) 3225  Organizational response activities are improved by incorporating lessons learned from current 3226  and previous detection and response activities. It is recommended to designate an individual(s) 3227  responsible for documenting and communicating response actions to the incident response team 3228  which can later be reviewed for lessons learned. 3229  6.5 Recover (RC) 3230  Timely recovery to normal operations after a cybersecurity incident is critical. The recover 3231  function addresses developing and implementing activities to maintain resilience of systems and 3232  ensure timely restoration of capabilities and services affected by a cybersecurity incident.  3233  6.5.1 Recovery Planning (RC.RP) 3234  When recovering from events, organizations should attempt to capture details associated with the 3235  execution of the documented recovery plans. Capturing execution details may help organizations 3236  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  133  during the post-incident review process to determine if any gaps or potential opportunities for 3237  improvement in the recovery plan should be considered. Due to time sensitivity of recovery 3238  efforts, if capturing execution details impacts safety or increases the time to complete the 3239  recovery plan, organizations may want to consider other techniques such as reviewing logs, 3240  reviewing video footage captured during the recovery activities, or interviewing recovery 3241  personnel. 3242  Supplemental guidance for recovery planning can be found in the following documents: 3243   NIST SP 800-184, Guide for Cybersecurity Event Recovery 3244   NIST SP 800-209, Security Guidelines for Storage Infrastructure 3245  6.5.2 Recovery Improvements (RC.IM) 3246  As a recovery effort is ongoing, the recovery steps taken should be documented to develop 3247  lessons learned. These lessons can be used to improve recovery plans and processes. 3248  Supplemental guidance for recovery improvements can be found in the following document: 3249   NIST SP 800-184, Guide for Cybersecurity Event Recovery 3250  6.5.3 Recovery Communications (RC.CO) 3251  Restoration activities are coordinated with internal and external parties.

A threat is any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact 3552  organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational 3553  assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation through an information system via 3554  unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information, and/or denial of 3555  service. Threats have some intent or method that may exploit a vulnerability through either 3556  intentional or unintentional means. This intent or method is referred to as the threat source. A 3557  vulnerability is a weakness in an information system (including an OT), system security 3558  procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat 3559  source. A threat event is an event or situation that has the potential for causing undesirable 3560  consequences or impact. When a threat event occurs it becomes an incident that actually or 3561  potentially jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information system or 3562  the information the system processes, stores, or transmits or that constitutes a violation or 3563  imminent threat of violation of security policies, security procedures, or acceptable use policies. 3564  This appendix explores OT-specific threat sources, vulnerabilities, and incidents. It also cites 3565  examples of OT-specific incidents to illustrate their potential impact. Each organization 3566  calculates risk based on the specific threats, vulnerabilities, and impact and likelihood of 3567  incidents within their environment. 3568  C.1 Threat Sources 3569  Threats to OT can come from numerous sources, which can be classified as adversarial, 3570  accidental, structural, or environmental. Table 13 lists and defines known threat sources to OT. 3571  These threat sources should be considered part of the risk management strategy. The threat 3572  source must be well understood in order to define and implement adequate protection. For 3573  example, environmental events (e.g., floods, earthquakes) are well understood, but may vary in 3574  their magnitude, frequency, and their ability to compound other interconnected events. However, 3575  adversarial threats depend on the resources available to the adversary and the emergence of 3576  previously unknown vulnerabilities or attacks.  3577  Table 13: Threats to OT 3578  Type of Threat Source Description Characteristics  ADVERSARIAL  - Bot-network operators  - Criminal groups  - Hackers/hacktivists  - Insiders  - Nations  - Terrorists  Individuals, groups, organizations, or nation-states that seek  to exploit the organization’s dependence on cyber resources  (e.g., information in electronic form, information and  communications technologies, and the communications and  information-handling capabilities provided by those  technologies)  Capability, Intent,  Targeting  ACCIDENTAL  - User  - Privileged User/Administrator  Erroneous actions taken by individuals in the course of  executing their everyday responsibilities (e.g., operator  accidentally typing 100 instead of 10 as a set point; engineer  making a change in the production environment while  thinking that they are in the development environment)  Range of effects  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  164  Type of Threat Source Description Characteristics  STRUCTURAL  - Hardware failure  • Processors, input/output cards,  communications cards  • Networking equipment  • Power supply  • Sensor, final element  • HMI, displays  - Software failure  • OS  • General-purpose applications  • Mission-specific applications  - Environmental controls failure  • Temperature control  • Humidity control  - Communications degradation  • Wireless  • Wired  Failures of equipment, environmental controls, or software  due to aging, resource depletion, or other circumstances  which exceed expected operating parameters. Includes  failures of critical infrastructures within the control of the  organization.  Range of effects  ENVIRONMENTAL  - Natural or human-caused disaster  • Fire  • Flood/tsunami  • Windstorm/tornado  • Hurricane  • Earthquake  • Bombing  • Animal interference  • Solar flares, meteorites  - Critical Infrastructure failure  • Telecommunications  • Electrical power  • Transportation  • Water/wastewater  Natural disasters and failures of critical infrastructures on  which the organization depends, but which are outside the  control of the organization.  Note: Natural and human-caused disasters can also be  characterized in terms of their severity and/or duration.  However, because the threat source and the threat event are  strongly identified, severity and duration can be included in  the description of the threat event (e.g., Category 5 hurricane  causes extensive damage to the facilities housing mission- critical systems, making those systems unavailable for three  weeks).  Range of effects  3579  C.2 Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions 3580  Vulnerabilities are weaknesses in information systems, system procedures, controls, or 3581  implementations that can be exploited by a threat source. Predisposing conditions are properties 3582  of the organization, mission/business process, architecture, or information systems that 3583  contribute to the likelihood of a threat event. The order of these vulnerabilities and predisposing 3584  conditions does not reflect priority in terms of likelihood of occurrence or severity of impact. 3585  Additionally, the vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions identified in this section should not 3586  be considered a complete list; it should also not be assumed that these issues are found within 3587  every OT environment.  3588  The vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions are grouped according to where they exist, such 3589  as in the organization’s policy and procedures or the inadequacy of security mechanisms 3590  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  165  implemented in hardware, firmware, and software. The former is referred to as being in the 3591  organization and the latter as being in the system. Understanding the source of vulnerabilities 3592  and predisposing conditions can assist in determining optimal mitigation strategies. Deeper 3593  analysis may uncover that causes and observations may not be one-to-one—that is, some 3594  underlying causes may exhibit multiple symptoms and some symptoms may come from more 3595  than one cause.  3596  Any given OT will usually exhibit a subset of the identified vulnerabilities in this appendix but 3597  may also contain additional vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions unique to the particular 3598  technology or implementation that do not appear in this appendix. Specific current information 3599  on OT vulnerabilities can be researched at the CISA website. Many vendors publish notifications 3600  and patches to improve both reliability and security which are not always found on the CISA 3601  website. It is beneficial to maintain relationships with the vendors in order to stay up-to-date with 3602  known vulnerabilities. 3603  Some vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions can be mitigated; others can only be accepted 3604  and controlled by appropriate countermeasures but will result in some residual risk to the OT 3605  environment. For example, some existing policies and procedures may be changed with a level 3606  of effort that the organization considers acceptable; others are more expeditiously dealt with by 3607  instituting additional policies and procedures.  3608  Vulnerabilities in products and services acquired from outside the organization are rarely under 3609  the direct control of the organization. Changes may be influenced by market forces, but this is a 3610  slow and indirect approach. Instead, the organization may change predisposing conditions to 3611  reduce the likelihood that a systemic vulnerability will be exploited.  3612  C.2.1 Policy and Procedure Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions 3613  Vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions are often introduced into the OT environment 3614  because of incomplete, inappropriate, or nonexistent security policy, including its 3615  documentation, implementation guides (e.g., procedures), and enforcement. Management support 3616  of security policy and procedures is the cornerstone of any security program. Organization 3617  security policy can reduce vulnerabilities by mandating and enforcing proper conduct. Written 3618  policy and procedures are mechanisms for informing staff and stakeholders of decisions about 3619  behavior that is beneficial to the organization. From this perspective, policy is an educational and 3620  instructive way to reduce vulnerabilities. Enforcement is partner to policy, encouraging people to 3621  do the proper thing. Various forms of corrective action are the usual consequences to personnel 3622  not following policy and procedures. Policies should be explicit about the consequences to 3623  individuals or organizations that do not conform. 3624  There is usually a complex policy and procedure environment that includes laws and regulations, 3625  overlapping jurisdictions and spheres of influence, economics, custom, and history. The larger 3626  enterprise is often subdivided into organizational units that should work together to reduce 3627  vulnerabilities. The scope and hierarchical relationship among policies and procedures needs to 3628  be managed for maximum effectiveness.  3629  https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  166  Table 14 presents examples of observed policy and procedure vulnerabilities and predisposing 3630  conditions for OT. 3631  Table 14: Policy and Procedure Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions 3632  Vulnerability Description  Inadequate organizational  ownership of risk assessments  Risk assessments should be performed with acknowledgement from  appropriate levels within the organization. Lack of understanding of risk  could lead to under-mitigated scenarios or inadequate funding and  selection of controls.  Inadequate security policy for OT Vulnerabilities are often introduced into the OT environment due to  inadequate policies or the lack of policies specifically for OT system  security. Controls and countermeasures should be derived from a risk  assessment or policy. This ensures uniformity and accountability.  Inadequate OT security training  and awareness program  A documented formal OT security training and awareness program is  designed to keep staff up to date on organizational security policies and  procedures as well as threats, industry cybersecurity standards, and  recommended practices. Without adequate ongoing training on specific OT  policies and procedures, staff cannot be expected to maintain a secure OT  environment.  Lack of inventory management  policy  Inventory policy and procedures should include installation, removal, and  changes made to hardware, firmware, and software. An incomplete  inventory could lead to unmanaged and unprotected devices within the OT  environment.  Lack of configuration management  policy  Lack of policy and procedures for OT configuration management can lead  to an unmanageable and highly vulnerable inventory of hardware,  firmware, and software.  Inadequate OT equipment  implementation guidelines  Equipment implementation guidelines should be kept up to date and readily  available. These guidelines are an integral part of security procedures in  the event of an OT malfunction.  Lack of administrative mechanisms  for security policy enforcement  Without accountability for enforcing policy, there’s limited ability to ensure  security policies are followed adequately. Administrative mechanisms  should be in place to ensure accountability.  Inadequate review of the  effectiveness of the OT security  controls  Procedures and schedules should exist to determine the extent to which  the security program and its constituent controls are implemented correctly,  operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to  meeting the security requirements for the OT. The examination is  sometimes called an “audit,” “evaluation,” or “assessment.” Policy should  address the stage of the life cycle, purpose, technical expertise,  methodology, and level of independence.  No OT-specific contingency plan  A contingency plan (e.g., business continuity plan, disaster recovery plan)  should be prepared, tested, and available in the event of a major hardware  or software failure or destruction of facilities. Lack of a specific plan for the  OT could lead to extended downtimes and production loss.  Lack of adequate access control  policy  Access control enforcement depends on policy that correctly models roles,  responsibilities, and authorizations. The policy model must enable the way  the organization functions.  Lack of adequate authentication  policy  Authentication policies are needed to define when authentication  mechanisms (e.g., passwords, smart cards) must be used, how strong they  must be, and how they must be maintained. Without policy, systems might  not have appropriate authentication controls, making unauthorized access  to systems more likely. Authentication policies should be developed as part  of an overall OT security program, taking into account the capabilities of  the OT and its personnel to handle more complex passwords and other  mechanisms.  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  167  Vulnerability Description  Inadequate incident detection &  response plan and procedures  Incident detection and response plans, procedures, and methods are  necessary for rapidly detecting incidents, minimizing loss and destruction,  preserving evidence for later forensic examination, mitigating the  weaknesses that were exploited, and restoring services. Establishing a  successful incident response capability includes continually monitoring for  anomalies, prioritizing the handling of incidents, and implementing effective  methods of collecting, analyzing, and reporting data.  Lack of redundancy for critical  components  Lack of redundancy in critical components could provide single point of  failure possibilities.  3633  C.2.2 System Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions 3634  Security controls must clearly identify the systems to which they apply. Systems range widely in 3635  size, scope, and capability. At the small end of the spectrum, a system may be an individual 3636  hardware or software product or service. At the other end of the spectrum, we find large complex 3637  systems, systems-of-systems, and networks, all of which incorporate hardware architecture and 3638  software framework (including application frameworks), where the combination supports 3639  operations. An organization may choose to identify security zones such that security controls 3640  may be applied to all systems within the security zone. 3641  System vulnerabilities can occur in the hardware, firmware, and software used to build the OT. 3642  Sources of vulnerabilities include design flaws, development flaws, misconfigurations, poor 3643  maintenance, poor administration, and connections with other systems and networks. Many of 3644  the controls in the SP 800-53 and the OT overlay in Appendix F specify what the system must do 3645  to mitigate these vulnerabilities. 3646  Vulnerabilities can also exist in the auxiliary components that support the OT systems. A subset 3647  of those vulnerabilities with the potential to impact the physical process are described in this 3648  section. 3649  The potential vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions commonly found within OT systems 3650  are categorized into the following tables: 3651   Table 15: Architecture and Design Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions 3652   Table 16: Configuration and Maintenance Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions 3653   Table 17: Physical Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions 3654   Table 18: Software Development Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions 3655   Table 19: Communication and Network Configuration Vulnerabilities and Predisposing 3656  Conditions 3657   Table 20: Sensor, Final Element, and Asset Management Vulnerabilities and Predisposing 3658  Conditions 3659  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  168  Table 15: Architecture and Design Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions 3660  Vulnerability Description  Inadequate incorporation of  security into architecture and  design  Incorporating security into the OT architecture and design must start with  budget and schedule designated for OT. The architectures must address  the identification and authorization of users, access control mechanism,  network topologies, and system configuration and integrity mechanisms.  Inadequate management of  change allowing insecure  architecture to evolve  The network infrastructure within the OT environment has often been  developed and modified based on business and operational requirements,  with little consideration for the potential security impacts of the changes.  Over time, security gaps may have been inadvertently introduced within the  infrastructure. Without remediation, these gaps may represent backdoors  into the OT.  Sensors and controllers that were historically simple devices are now often  manufactured as intelligent devices. In some cases, sensors and  controllers may be replaced with IIoT devices which allow direct internet  connections. Security should be incorporated into change management for  all OT devices, not just traditional IT components.  No security perimeter defined If the OT does not have a security perimeter clearly defined, it is not  possible to ensure that the necessary security controls are deployed and  configured properly. This can lead to unauthorized access to systems and  data, as well as other problems.  Control networks used for non- control traffic  Control and non-control traffic have different requirements, such as  determinism and reliability. Having both types of traffic on a single network  creates challenges for meeting the requirements of control traffic. For  example, non-control traffic could inadvertently consume resources that  control traffic needs, causing disruptions in OT functions.  Control network services  dependent on a non-control  network  When IT services such as Domain Name System (DNS) and Dynamic Host  Configuration Protocol (DHCP) are used by control networks, they are  often implemented in the IT network. This causes the OT network to  become dependent on the IT network, which may not have the reliability  and availability requirements needed by OT.  Inadequate collection of event data  history  Forensic analysis depends on collection and retention of sufficient data.  Without proper and accurate data collection, it might be impossible to  determine what caused a security incident to occur. Incidents might go  unnoticed, leading to additional damage and/or disruption. Regular security  monitoring is also needed to identify problems with security controls, such  as misconfigurations and failures.  Event data for an OT environment could include physical process data,  system use data, and network data.  3661  Table 16: Configuration and Maintenance Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions 3662  Vulnerability Description  Hardware, firmware, and software  not under asset management  The organization doesn’t know what it has (e.g., make, model), where they  are, or what version it has, resulting in an inconsistent and ineffective  defense posture. To properly secure an OT, there should be an accurate  inventory of the assets in the environment. Procedures should be in place  to manage additions, deletions, and modifications of assets which include  asset inventory management. These procedures are critical to executing  business continuity and disaster recovery plans.  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  169  Vulnerability Description  Hardware, firmware, and software  not under configuration  management  The organization doesn’t know the patch management status, security  settings, or configuration versions that it has, resulting in inconsistent and  ineffective defense posture. A lack of configuration change management  procedures can lead to security oversights, exposures, and risks. A  process for controlling modifications to hardware, firmware, software, and  documentation should be implemented to ensure an OT is protected  against inadequate or improper modifications before, during, and after  system implementation. To properly secure an OT, there should be an  accurate listing or repository of the current configurations.  OS and vendor software patches  may not be developed until  significantly after security  vulnerabilities are found  Because of the tight coupling between OT software and the underlying OT,  changes must undergo expensive and time-consuming comprehensive  regression testing. The elapsed time for such testing and subsequent  distribution of updated software provides a long window of vulnerability.  Vulnerability management procedures should include flexibility for interim  alternative mitigations.  Vendor declines to develop  patches for vulnerability  Out-of-date OSs and applications may contain newly discovered  vulnerabilities that could be exploited. Security patch support may not be  available for legacy OT, so vulnerability management procedures should  include contingency plans for mitigating vulnerabilities where patches may  never be available or replacement plans.  Lack of a vulnerability  management program  Vulnerabilities not considered by the organization could result in  exploitation. Vulnerability management procedures should be in place to  determine a plan of action or inaction upon discovery of a vulnerability.  Some OT considerations are: availability concerns may push patching until  the next planned operational downtime; security patch support may not be  available for OT systems that use outdated OSs; isolated systems may not  require immediate patching; and OT exposed to the internet may need  prioritized for patching.  Inadequate testing of security  changes  Modifications to hardware, firmware, and software deployed without testing  could compromise normal operation of the OT. Documented procedures  should be developed for testing all changes for security impact. The live  operational systems should never be used for testing. The testing of  system modifications may need to be coordinated with system vendors and  integrators.  Poor remote access controls There are many reasons why an OT may need to be remotely accessed,  including vendors and system integrators performing system maintenance  functions, and also OT engineers accessing geographically remote system  components. The concept of least privilege should be applied to remote  access controls. Remote access capabilities must be adequately controlled  to prevent unauthorized individuals from gaining access, or authorized  individuals from gaining excessive access, to the OT.  Poor configurations are used Improperly configured systems may leave unnecessary ports and protocols  open. These unnecessary functions may contain vulnerabilities that  increase the overall risk to the system. Using default configurations often  exposes vulnerabilities and exploitable services. All settings should be  examined.  Critical configurations are not  stored or backed up  Procedures should be available for restoring OT configuration settings in  the event of accidental or adversary-initiated configuration changes to  maintain system availability and prevent loss of data. Documented  procedures should be developed for maintaining configuration settings.  Data unprotected on portable  device  If sensitive data (e.g., passwords, dial-up numbers) is stored in cleartext on  portable devices such as laptops and mobile devices and these devices  are lost or stolen, system security could be compromised. Policy,  procedures, and mechanisms are required for protection.  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  170  Vulnerability Description  Vendor default passwords are  used  Most vendor default passwords are easy to discover within vendor product  manuals, which are also available to adversaries. Using the default  password can drastically increase OT vulnerability.  Passwords generation, use, and  protection not in accord with policy  Password policy and procedures must be followed to be effective.  Violations of password policy and procedures can increase OT  vulnerability.  Inadequate access controls applied Access controls must be matched to the way the organization allocates  responsibilities and privilege to its personnel. Poorly specified access  controls can result in giving an OT user too many or too few privileges. The  following exemplify each case:  • System configured with default access control settings gives an  operator administrative privileges  • System configured improperly results in an operator being  unable to take corrective actions in an emergency situation  Improper data linking OT data storage systems may be linked with non-OT data sources. An  example of this is database links, which allow data from one database  (e.g., data historian) to be automatically replicated to others. Data linkage  may create a vulnerability if it is not properly configured and may allow  unauthorized data access or manipulation.  Malware protection not installed or  up to date  Installation of malicious software, or malware, is a common attack.  Malware protection software, such as antivirus software, should be kept  current in a dynamic environment. Outdated malware protection software  and definitions leave the system open to malware threats.  Malware protection implemented  without sufficient testing  Malware protection software deployed without sufficient testing could  impact normal operation of the OT and block the system from performing  necessary control actions.  Denial of service (DoS)  OT software could be vulnerable to DoS attacks, resulting in the prevention  of authorized access to a system resource or delaying system operations  and functions.  Intrusion detection/prevention  software not installed  Incidents can result in loss of system availability and integrity; the capture,  modification, and deletion of data; and incorrect execution of control  commands. IDS/IPS software may stop or prevent various types of attacks,  including DoS attacks, and also identify attacked internal hosts, such as  those infected with worms. IDS/IPS software must be tested prior to  deployment to determine that it does not compromise normal operation of  the OT.  Logs not maintained Without proper and accurate logs, it might be impossible to determine what  caused a security event to occur and perform adequate forensics.  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  171  3663  Table 17: Physical Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions 3664  Vulnerability Description  Unauthorized personnel have  physical access to equipment  Physical access to OT equipment should be restricted to only the  necessary personnel, taking into account safety requirements such as  emergency shutdown or restarts. Improper access to OT equipment can  lead to any of the following:  • Physical theft of data and hardware  • Physical damage or destruction of data and hardware  • Modification of the operational process  • Unauthorized changes to the functional environment (e.g., data  connections, unauthorized use of removable media,  adding/removing resources)  • Disconnection of physical data links  • Undetectable interception of data (keystroke and other input  logging)  Radio frequency, electromagnetic  pulse (EMP), static discharge,  brownouts, and voltage spikes  Some hardware used for OT systems is vulnerable to radio frequency and  electromagnetic pulses (EMP), static discharge, brownouts, and voltage  spikes. The impact can range from temporary disruption of command and  control to permanent damage to circuit boards. Proper shielding,  grounding, power conditioning, and/or surge suppression is recommended.  Lack of backup power Without backup power to critical assets, a general loss of power will shut  down the OT and could create an unsafe situation. Loss of power could  also lead to insecure default settings. If the program file or data is stored in  volatile memory, the process may not be able to restart after a power  outage without appropriate backup power.  Loss of environmental control Loss of environmental control (e.g., temperatures, humidity) could lead to  equipment damage, such as processors overheating. Some processors will  shut down to protect themselves; some may continue to operate but in a  minimal capacity and may produce intermittent errors, continually reboot,  or become permanently inoperable.  Unsecured physical ports  Unsecured universal serial bus (USB) and PS/2 ports could allow  unauthorized connection of thumb drives, keystroke loggers, etc.  3665  Table 18: Software Development Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions 3666  Vulnerability Description  Improper data validation OT software may not properly validate user inputs or received data to  ensure validity. Invalid data may result in numerous vulnerabilities including  buffer overflows, command injections, cross-site scripting, and path  traversals.  Installed security capabilities not  enabled by default  Security capabilities that were installed with the product are useless if they  are not enabled or at least identified as being disabled.  Inadequate authentication,  privileges, and access control in  software  Unauthorized access to configuration and programming software could  provide the ability to corrupt a device.  3667  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  172  Table 19: Communication and Network Configuration Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions 3668  Vulnerability Description  Data flow controls not employed Data flow controls, based on data characteristics, are needed to restrict  which information is permitted between systems. These controls can  prevent exfiltration of information and illegal operations.  Firewalls nonexistent or improperly  configured  A lack of properly configured firewalls could permit unnecessary data to  pass between networks, such as control and corporate networks, allowing  attacks and malware to spread between networks, making sensitive data  susceptible to monitoring/eavesdropping, and providing individuals with  unauthorized access to systems.  Inadequate firewall and router logs Without proper and accurate logs, it might be impossible to determine what  caused a security incident to occur.  Standard, well-documented  communication protocols are used  in plaintext  Adversaries that can monitor the OT network activity can use a protocol  analyzer or other utilities to decode the data transferred by protocols such  as telnet, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Hypertext Transfer Protocol  (HTTP), and Network File System (NFS). The use of such protocols also  makes it easier for adversaries to perform attacks against OT and  manipulate OT network activity.  Authentication of users, data or  devices is substandard or  nonexistent  Many OT protocols have no authentication at any level. Without  authentication, there is the potential to replay, modify, or spoof data or to  spoof devices such as sensors and user identities.  Use of unsecure OT protocols OT protocols often have few or no security capabilities, such as  authentication and encryption, to protect data from unauthorized access or  tampering. Also, incorrect implementation of the protocols can lead to  additional vulnerabilities.  Lack of integrity checking for  communications  Integrity checks are not built into most OT protocols; adversaries could  manipulate communications undetected. To ensure integrity, the OT can  use lower-layer protocols (e.g., IPsec) that offer data integrity protection  when traversing untrusted physical media.  Inadequate authentication between  wireless clients and access points  Strong mutual authentication between wireless clients and access points is  needed to ensure that legitimate OT clients do not connect to a rogue  access point deployed by an adversary, and also to ensure that adversary  clients do not connect to any of the OT wireless networks.  Inadequate data protection  between wireless clients and  access points  Sensitive data between wireless clients and access points should be  protected using strong encryption to ensure that adversaries cannot gain  unauthorized access to the unencrypted data.  3669  Table 20: Sensor, Final Element, and Asset Management Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions 3670  Vulnerability Description  Unauthorized physical access to  sensors or final elements  Physical access to sensors and final elements allows for direct  manipulation of the physical process. Many devices are configured on a  fieldbus such that physical access to the sensor network allows for  manipulation of controlling parameters. Physical access to the whole of the  loop should be managed to prevent incidents.  Unauthorized wireless access to  sensors or final elements  Wireless access to sensors and final elements allows for direct  manipulation of the physical process. Many smart devices allow for  wireless configuration (e.g., Bluetooth, WiFi, WirelessHART). Wireless  access should be securely configured or disabled using hardware write- protect where possible to protect unauthorized modification of the sensors  and final elements which are connected both to the physical process and to  the OT environment.  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  173  Vulnerability Description  Inappropriate segmentation of  asset management system  Most architectures are designed for PLCs, RTUs, DCS, and SCADA  controllers to manipulate the process, and for asset management systems  to monitor the assets connected to the controllers. Many asset  management systems also have the technical ability to modify the  configuration of sensors and final elements, although modification may not  be their primary function. The asset management system should be  controlled appropriately based on its ability (or lack of ability) to manipulate  the process.  3671  C.3 Threat Events and Incidents 3672  A threat event is an event or situation that could potentially cause an undesirable consequence or 3673  impact to operations resulting from some threat source. In NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 [SP800-30r1], 3674  Appendix E identifies a broad set of threat events that could potentially impact information 3675  systems. The properties of OT may also present unique threat events, specifically addressing 3676  how the threat events can manipulate OT processes to cause physical damage. Table 21 provides 3677  an overview of potential OT threat events, leveraging MITRE’s ATT&CK® for Industrial 3678  Control Systems [ATTACK-ICS]. 3679  Table 21: Examples of Potential Threat Events 3680  Threat Event Description  Denial of Control Temporarily prevents operators and engineers from interfacing with  process controls. An affected process may still be operating during the  period of control loss, but not necessarily in a desired state.  Manipulation of Control Unauthorized changes made to programmed instructions in PLCs, RTUs,  DCS, or SCADA controllers, alarm thresholds changed, or unauthorized  commands issued to control equipment, which could potentially result in  damage to equipment (if tolerances are exceeded), premature shutdown of  processes (such as prematurely shutting down transmission lines), causing  an environmental incident, or even disabling control equipment.  Spoofed Reporting Message False information sent to an OT system operator either for evasion or to  impair process control. The adversary could make the defenders and  operators think that other errors are occurring in order to distract them from  the actual source of the problem (i.e., alarm floods).  Theft of Operational Information Adversaries may steal operational information for personal gain or to  inform future operations.  Loss of Safety Adversaries may target and disable safety system functions as a  prerequisite to subsequent attack execution or to allow for future unsafe  conditionals to go unchecked.  Loss of Availability Adversaries may leverage malware to delete or encrypt critical data on  HMIs, workstations, or databases.  3681  Numerous OT incidents have been reported and documented. Descriptions of these events help 3682  demonstrate the severity of the threat sources, vulnerabilities, and impacts within the OT domain. 3683  As mentioned in Section C.2, the four broad categories of threat sources are adversarial, 3684  accidental, structural, and environmental. Often the incident can be the result of multiple threat 3685  sources (e.g., an environmental event causes a system failure, which is responded to incorrectly 3686  by an operator resulting in an accidental event). Provided below is a limited selection of reported 3687  incidents covering each of the four categories. 3688  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  174  The incidents have been additionally categorized into malicious or non-malicious, and direct or 3689  indirect to further distinguish the possible causes of OT incidents. 3690  M = Malicious. The event was initiated by someone for a harmful purpose. The initiator 3691  may or may not have been targeting the OT or known the potential consequences. 3692  N = Non-malicious. There does not appear to be evidence that the initiating event was 3693  intended to cause an incident. 3694  D = Direct. The event was designed to discover, inhibit, impair, or otherwise impact the 3695  OT system.  3696  I = Indirect. The event was not believed to be designed to discover, inhibit, impair, or 3697  otherwise impact the OT system. The OT system shut down or caused disruption as a 3698  result of impact to the supporting infrastructure. 3699  C.3.1 Adversarial Events 3700   [M][D] Marconi Wireless Hack.9 In 1903, Italian radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi was 3701  preparing for his first public demonstration of long-distance secure wireless communications 3702  from Cornwall to Professor Fleming at the Royal Institution of London. Inventor and 3703  magician, Nevil Maskelyne, hacked the system, sending a comical message in morse code 3704  referencing “rats.” Maskelyne then published an explanation of his hack to the trade journal 3705  The Electrician. 3706   [M][I] Worcester Air Traffic Communications.10 In March 1997, a teenager in Worcester, 3707  Massachusetts disabled part of the public switched telephone network using a dial-up modem 3708  connected to the system. This knocked out phone service at the control tower, airport 3709  security, the airport fire department, the weather service, and carriers that use the airport. 3710  Also, the tower’s main radio transmitter and another transmitter that activates runway lights 3711  were shut down, as well as a printer that controllers use to monitor flight progress. The attack 3712  also knocked out phone service to 600 homes and businesses in the nearby town of Rutland.  3713   [M][D] Maroochy Shire Sewage Spill.11 In the spring of 2000, a former employee of an 3714  Australian organization that develops manufacturing software applied for a job with the local 3715  government but was rejected. Over a two-month period, the disgruntled rejected employee 3716  reportedly used a radio transmitter on as many as 46 occasions to remotely break into the 3717  controls of a sewage treatment system. He altered electronic data for particular sewerage 3718  pumping stations and caused malfunctions in their operations, ultimately releasing about 3719  264,000 gallons of raw sewage into nearby rivers and parks. 3720  9  Additional information on the Marconi Wireless Hack incident can be found at: https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1505628.  10  Additional information on the Worcester Air Traffic Communications incident can be found at:  http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9803/18/juvenile.hacker/index.html  11  Additional information on the Maroochy Shire Sewage Spill incident can be found at  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/10/31/hacker_jailed_for_revenge_sewage/.  https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1505628 http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9803/18/juvenile.hacker/index.html http://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/10/31/hacker_jailed_for_revenge_sewage/  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  175   [M][I] Night Dragon.12 McAfee reported a series of attacks designed to steal sensitive data 3721  from the global oil, energy, and petrochemical industries. Adversaries exfiltrated proprietary 3722  operations data and project financing information with regard to oil and gas field bids and 3723  operations. 3724   [M][D] Iranian Centrifuge, Stuxnet.13 Stuxnet was a Microsoft Windows computer worm 3725  discovered in July 2010 that specifically targeted industrial software and equipment. The 3726  worm initially spread indiscriminately, but included a highly specialized malware payload 3727  that was designed to only target particular SCADA systems that were configured to control 3728  and monitor specific industrial processes. 3729   [M][D] German Steel Mill Attack.14 In 2014, hackers manipulated and disrupted control 3730  systems to such a degree that a blast furnace could not be properly shut down, resulting in 3731  “massive”—though unspecified—damage. 3732   [M][I] Shamoon.15 In 2012 Saudi Aramco experienced a malware attack that targeted their 3733  refineries and overwrote the attacked systems’ Master Boot Records (MBRs), partition 3734  tables, and other data files. This caused the systems to become unusable. 3735   [M][D] New York Dam.16 In 2013, an Iranian computer security company obtained remote 3736  access to a computer which controlled the SCADA system for the Bowman Dam located in 3737  Rye, New York. The adversary was able to view water levels, temperature, and status of the 3738  sluice gate. The sluice gate control was disconnected for maintenance at the time of 3739  adversarial remote access, so the dam could not be remotely controlled. 3740   [M][D] Dragonfly Campaign, Havex.17 The energy sector was targeted during a multi-year 3741  cyber-espionage campaign using primarily Havex malware. Havex is a remote access trojan 3742  that uses the Open Platform Communications (OPC) standard to gather information about 3743  connected ICS devices on a network. The campaigns were exploratory. 3744   [M][D] Ukrainian Power Grid, BlackEnergy3.18 On December 23, 2015, Ukrainian power 3745  companies experienced a cyberattack causing power outages which impacted over 225,000 3746  customers in Ukraine. Over 50 regional substations experienced malicious remote operation 3747  of their breakers. KillDisk malware was used to erase files on target systems, including at 3748  least one Windows-based HMI. The actors also corrupted the firmware of Serial-to-Ethernet 3749  devices at the substations. This was the first-known cyber attack on a power grid. 3750  12  Additional information on Night Dragon was published as a McAfee white paper at: https://www.heartland.org/_template-  assets/documents/publications/29423.pdf.  13  Additional information on the Stuxnet worm can be found at: https://www.wired.com/2014/11/countdown-to-zero-day-  stuxnet/.  14  Additional information on the German steel mill incident can be found at: http://www.wired.com/2015/01/german-steel-  mill-hack-destruction/.  15  Additional information on Shamoon can be found at https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/monitors/ICS-MM201209.  16  The US Department of Justice indictment for the New York Dam attacks can be found at:  https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/834996/download.  17  Additional information on the Dragonfly / Energetic Bear Campaign can be found at:  https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1505628.  18  Additional information about the first Ukrainian Power Grid attack can be found at:  https://info.publicintelligence.net/NCCIC-UkrainianPowerAttack.pdf.  https://www.heartland.org/_template-assets/documents/publications/29423.pdf https://www.heartland.org/_template-assets/documents/publications/29423.pdf https://www.wired.com/2014/11/countdown-to-zero-day-stuxnet/ https://www.wired.com/2014/11/countdown-to-zero-day-stuxnet/ http://www.wired.com/2015/01/german-steel-mill-hack-destruction/ http://www.wired.com/2015/01/german-steel-mill-hack-destruction/ https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/monitors/ICS-MM201209 https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/834996/download https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1505628 https://info.publicintelligence.net/NCCIC-UkrainianPowerAttack.pdf  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  176   [M][D] Ukrainian Power Grid, Industroyer.19 On December 17, 2016, a cyber attack 3751  occurred at a substation outside of Kiev. The impact was an outage for customers of one 3752  substation for approximately one hour. This attack is the first-known malware specifically 3753  designed to attack the power grid. 3754   [M][I] Maersk, NotPetya. In 2017, the NotPetya malware encrypted computers globally 3755  with no method for decryption. Although the malware initially targeted Ukrainian 3756  companies, it spread throughout the world with significant impact to Maersk, FedEx, Merck, 3757  and Saint-Gobain. Malware destroyed data and disrupted shipping operations for Maersk, 3758  costing the company over $300 million on repair and recovery. 3759   [M][D] Saudi Petrochem, TRITON.20 A petrochemical facility in Saudi Arabia was 3760  attacked using malicious software targeted at the industrial SIS. The SIS initiated a safe 3761  shutdown of the petrochemical process in 2017 when the triple-redundant processors 3762  identified mismatched code amongst the processors. 3763   [M][I] Norsk Hydro, LockerGoga.21 In March 2019, Norsk Hydro experienced a 3764  cyberattack which used LockerGoga ransomware to encrypt its computer files. The 3765  aluminum and renewable energy company transitioned to manual operations and was 3766  transparent with the public on its progress to recovery. Norsk Hydro’s transparency 3767  throughout the discovery and recovery process is well regarded by the security industry. 3768   [M][D] Honda, EKANS. EKANS is ransomware that impacted operations at Honda 3769  automotive US production facilities in June 2020. EKANS has a hard-coded kill-list of 3770  processes, including some associated with common ICS software platforms (e.g., GE Proficy 3771  historian, Honeywell HMIWeb).  3772   [M][D] Oldsmar Water Treatment Facility.22 In February 2021, hackers gained access to 3773  the City of Oldsmar’s water treatment control system using TeamViewer, which was 3774  accessible via the internet. Dosing set points were modified, which temporarily increased the 3775  amount of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) being added to the water. The water treatment operator 3776  observed the hacker moving the mouse on the operating screen and was able to restore 3777  normal operations. 3778   [M][I] Colonial Pipeline.23 In May 2021, over 5500 miles of pipeline transporting more than 3779  100 million gallons per day of refined products to the east coast of the U.S. shutdown 3780  operations because of a ransomware attack. Colonial Pipeline was a victim of a ransomware 3781  cyber attack which encrypted their IT systems by exploiting a legacy VPN profile.

Colonial Pipeline also 3785  decided to pay the ransom to cybercriminal group Darkside in order to have all possible 3786  tools, including the decryption tools, available to bring the pipeline system back online. The 3787  U.S. government was able to recover some of the ransom payment.24 3788   [M][I] Ransomware Targeting Healthcare.25 A string of malware delivered via phishing 3789  attacks targeted the healthcare and public health sectors. The malware was used by 3790  adversaries to conduct ransomware attacks, disrupt services, and steal data. In fall 2020, 3791  CISA Alert (AA20-302A) was issued to warn healthcare and public health sector companies 3792  of the prevalence of these attacks. 3793  C.3.2 Structural Events 3794   [N][D] Bellingham, Washington Gasoline Pipeline Failure.26 In June 1999, 900,000 liters 3795  (237,000 gallons) of gasoline leaked from a 40.64 cm (16 inch) pipeline and ignited 1.5 hours 3796  later, causing three deaths, eight injuries, and extensive property damage. The pipeline failure 3797  was exacerbated by control systems not able to perform control and monitoring functions. 3798  “Immediately prior to and during the incident, the SCADA system exhibited poor 3799  performance that inhibited the pipeline controllers from seeing and reacting to the 3800  development of an abnormal pipeline operation.” A key recommendation from the NTSB 3801  report issued October 2002 was to utilize an off-line development and testing system for 3802  implementing and testing changes to the SCADA database. 3803   [M][I] CSX Train Signaling System.27 In August 2003, the Sobig computer virus was 3804  blamed for shutting down train signaling systems throughout the east coast of the U.S. The 3805  virus infected the computer system at CSX Corp.’s Jacksonville, Florida headquarters, 3806  shutting down signaling, dispatching, and other systems. According to Amtrak spokesman 3807  Dan Stessel, ten Amtrak trains were affected in the morning. Trains between Pittsburgh and 3808  Florence, South Carolina were halted because of dark signals, and one regional Amtrak train 3809  from Richmond, Virginia to Washington and New York was delayed for more than two 3810  hours. Long-distance trains were also delayed between four and six hours. 3811   [N][D] Browns Ferry-3 PLC Failure.28 In August 2006, TVA was forced to manually shut 3812  down one of their plant’s two reactors after unresponsive PLCs problems caused two water 3813  pumps to fail and threatened the stability of the plant itself. Although there were dual 3814  redundant PLCs, they were connected to the same Ethernet network.

The tsunami compromised the plant’s seawall, flooding much of the plant, including 3821  the location housing the emergency generators. This emergency power was critical for 3822  operating the control rooms and providing coolant water for the reactors. The loss of coolant 3823  caused the reactor cores to overheat to the point where the fuel’s zirconium cladding reacted 3824  with water, releasing hydrogen gas and fueling large explosions in three of the four reactor 3825  buildings. This resulted in large-scale radiation leakage that has impacted plant employees, 3826  nearby citizens, and the local environment. Post-event analysis found that the plant’s 3827  emergency response center had insufficient secure communication lines to provide other 3828  areas of the plant with information on key safety-related instrumentation.  3829  C.3.4 Accidental Events 3830   [N][D] Vulnerability Scanner Incidents.30 While a ping sweep was being performed on an 3831  active SCADA network that controlled 3-meter (9-foot) robotic arms, one arm became active 3832  and swung around 180 degrees. The controller for the arm was in standby mode before the 3833  ping sweep was initiated. In a separate incident, a ping sweep was being performed on an 3834  ICS network to identify all hosts that were attached to the network, for inventory purposes, 3835  and it caused a system controlling the creation of integrated circuits in the fabrication plant to 3836  hang. This test resulted in the destruction of $50,000 worth of wafers. 3837   [N][D] Penetration Testing Incident.31 A natural gas utility hired an IT security consulting 3838  organization to conduct penetration testing on its corporate IT network. The consulting 3839  organization carelessly ventured into a part of the network that was directly connected to the 3840  SCADA system.

The conference initially was founded for 4490  a need to showcase advanced and highly technical content to the ICS audience. S4 has since 4491  grown to also accommodate other ICS security content but remains a premier venue to present 4492  technical findings within OT security.  4493  https://s4xevents.com/ 4494  D.5.2 Industrial Control Systems Joint Working Group (ICSJWG) 4495  CISA hosts a bi-annual working group which provides a vehicle for communicating and 4496  partnering across all Critical Infrastructure (CI) Sectors between federal agencies and 4497  departments, as well as private asset owners/operators of industrial control systems. The goal of 4498  the ICSJWG is to continue and enhance the collaborative efforts of the industrial control systems 4499  stakeholder community in securing CI by accelerating the design, development, and deployment 4500  of secure industrial control systems. 4501  https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/Industrial-Control-Systems-Joint-Working-Group-ICSJWG  4502  D.5.3 IFIP Working Group 11.10 on Critical Infrastructure Protection 4503  An active international community of scientists, engineers and practitioners dedicated to 4504  advancing the state-of-the-art of research and practice in the emerging field of critical 4505  infrastructure protection. 4506  http://ifip1110.org/Conferences/ 4507  https://www.tsa.gov/for-industry https://www.aar.org/ https://www.epa.gov/ https://www.awwa.org/ https://www.amwa.net/ https://www.nawc.org/ https://s4xevents.com/ https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/Industrial-Control-Systems-Joint-Working-Group-ICSJWG http://ifip1110.org/Conferences/  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  200  D.5.4 SecurityWeek’s ICS Cyber Security Conference 4508  Since 2002, SecurityWeek has held an annual conference focused on cybersecurity for the 4509  industrial control systems sector. An event where ICS users, ICS vendors, system security 4510  providers and government representatives meet to discuss the latest cyber-incidents, analyze their 4511  causes, and cooperate on solutions. 4512  https://www.icscybersecurityconference.com/ 4513  D.5.5 Stockholm International Summit on Cyber Security in SCADA and ICS 4514  (CS3STHLM) 4515  Organized beginning in 2014, CS3STHLM has quickly become the premier ICS Security 4516  Summit in Northern Europe. CS3STHLM is a summit that offers generous time for lectures, 4517  networking, and knowledge sharing in regard to today’s ICS security challenges. 4518  https://cs3sthlm.se/ 4519  https://www.icscybersecurityconference.com/ https://cs3sthlm.se/  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  201  Appendix E—OT Security Capabilities and Tools 4520  This appendix provides an overview of key security technologies that are available to or being 4521  developed to support the OT community. There are several security products that are marketed 4522  specifically for OT, while others are general IT security products that are also applicable to OT. 4523  Many cybersecurity products are marketed today as a single platform that combines many of the 4524  capabilities and tools listed here. Each organization should make a risk-based determination on 4525  whether to employ the security technologies and tools mentioned in this appendix. 4526  E.1 Network Segmentation and Isolation 4527  Network segmentation and separation technologies allow OT network owners to implement 4528  cybersecurity strategies that isolate devices and network traffic by both physical and logical 4529  means. Popular tooling for this capability area is described below. 4530  E.1.1 Firewalls 4531  Firewalls can be used to logically enforce user-defined rule sets on network traffic. Commonly 4532  placed at network boundaries, firewalls can limit both incoming and outgoing traffic based on a 4533  variety of data characteristics.  4534  There are several types of general IT firewalls. Basic packet filtering firewalls directly inspect 4535  current network traffic at OSI layers 3 and 4 to inform decisions on whether to drop or forward 4536  packets to their destination. Conversely, stateful inspection firewalls draw upon memory of both 4537  past and present network connections when making filtering decisions, thereby offering more 4538  capability at an increased computational cost. Next generation firewalls (NGFWs) expand upon 4539  stateful inspection firewalls by adding features such as application filtering, deep packet 4540  inspection, VPN traffic awareness, adaptive rules, and threat detection.  4541  Several vendors also offer OT-specific firewalls. The OT-specific implementations are often 4542  preferred over their generic IT counterparts due to their unique feature sets specific to OT 4543  networks. For example, they often provide built-in parsers for common OT protocols such as 4544  DNP3, CIP, and Modbus, allowing for deep packet inspection of OT traffic. 4545  E.1.2 Unidirectional Gateways 4546  Unidirectional gateways, also referred to as data diodes, are designed to only allow data 4547  transmission in a single direction. Unlike a firewall, data diodes cannot be programmed to allow 4548  data to flow in both directions; the hardware is incapable. A common use case is placing a data 4549  diode at the boundary between the operational network and the enterprise network. The data 4550  diode would allow network traffic to leave the operational network, but not enter, preventing a 4551  potential avenue of cyber attack. 4552  E.1.3 Virtual Local Area Networks (VLAN)  4553  A VLAN can be used to logically separate areas within a network when physical separation may 4554  not be feasible due to cost or other prohibitive measures. VLANs are implemented on modern 4555  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  202  network switching equipment that logically separates network traffic based on switch port. For 4556  example, an 8-port switch can be configured to separate traffic into two VLANs. One VLAN 4557  would be provided for ports 1-4, while another would be provided for ports 5-8. While all 8 ports 4558  are physically connected to a single device, each port is only logically connected to the other 4559  ports within its VLAN. 4560  E.1.4 Software-Defined Networking (SDN) 4561  Traditional networking switches are responsible for both forwarding packets (data plane) and 4562  running the distributed algorithms that determine routing (control plane). SDN is a technology 4563  that evolves this concept by keeping the data plane at the switch and moving the control plane to 4564  a centralized controller. The centralized controller acts as an abstraction layer for network 4565  programmability, eliminating the need to individually manage each switch within the network. 4566  SDN allows for easy dynamic reconfiguration of the data plane, which can allow for quick 4567  isolation of devices or redirection and duplication of traffic for monitoring and data capture. 4568  Utilizing SDN technology within an OT environment allows asset owners greater flexibility 4569  when initially designing their network architectures and when updating them in the future.  4570  E.2 Network Monitoring/Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) 4571  Network monitoring technologies allow OT network owners to maintain situational awareness of 4572  their controlled processes and support cybersecurity objectives such as event or anomaly 4573  detection. OT vendors often market their network monitoring technology as capable of 4574  integration with SIEM technologies. These systems collect data through log aggregation and 4575  network scanning tools, detect threats through analytics, and can provide automated incident 4576  response. Capabilities continue to be added, including use of machine learning and artificial 4577  intelligence to improve detection and reduce unnecessary alerts. OT owners must exercise 4578  caution when implementing these technologies as they can directly impact the availability of the 4579  controlled process. 4580  E.2.1 Centralized Logging 4581  System and network logs from all sources in an environment are the foundation of SIEM. Logs 4582  act as the primary historical artifact for incident response. When aggregated at a central location, 4583  logs can be analyzed together to provide a holistic view of the network state. A SIEM will utilize 4584  a variety of sensors strategically placed within a target network to collect logs from endpoints, as 4585  well as network traffic information, which is then stored in a database for real-time analysis. 4586  Specific to OT networks, data historians can serve as a supplemental source of event data 4587  providing greater context surrounding a cyber incident. 4588  E.2.2 Passive Scanning 4589  Passive network scans are a form of network discovery that inspects existing network traffic by 4590  watching traffic passing through network switches or other dedicated network capture devices. 4591  Systems that implement passive network scans do not introduce any additional traffic to the 4592  network, which is ideal for sensitive devices found on OT networks that may exhibit unexpected 4593  behavior when directly probed. Passive scanning can identify all devices actively communicating 4594  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  203  on network segments being monitored. Through inspection of network data, passive scanning 4595  can identify significant amounts of information about devices, potentially including, but not 4596  limited to, manufacturer, part number, and firmware version. Passive scanning cannot identify 4597  devices that are not actively communicating, nor can it inspect encrypted traffic (without special 4598  provisioning). Additionally, a passive scan will often take days to complete due to its 4599  dependence on existing network traffic. 4600  E.2.3 Active Scanning 4601  Active network scans are a form of network discovery that directly probe the network for 4602  attached devices. Systems employing active scanning introduce traffic to the network and will 4603  directly interact with the devices within the scan’s scope. OT network owners should exercise 4604  extreme caution when permitting active scanning on an operational network due to device 4605  sensitivity on the target network.  4606  Some OT-specific scanning devices combine passive and active scanning to enable a safer 4607  version of active scanning. Safe active scanning first learns about connected equipment through 4608  passive means and then uses device-specific communication to actively gain additional 4609  information about connected equipment without risks to OT operations.  4610  E.2.4 Malware Detection 4611  Endpoint malware detection can be bolstered with antivirus software. Antivirus software 4612  monitors activity on the host device and will alert the user to possible malicious activities. Older 4613  detection techniques rely on file signatures to detect known threats. Over time, malware 4614  developers have found ways to bypass this mechanism such as with polymorphic code. Modern 4615  antivirus software uses behavioral analysis of running processes and advanced file analysis to 4616  detect potentially malicious activity.  4617  Host-based malware detection with antivirus software may not be advisable for some OT 4618  endpoints due to OS incompatibility, software incompatibility, or runtime requirements. 4619  However, network-based malware detection can still be utilized. Unlike host-based antivirus 4620  software, network-based malware detection runs on an independent system that aggregates and 4621  inspects network traffic for anomalies. Network-based malware detection offers similar 4622  capabilities to host-based detection without the computational overhead being placed on the 4623  defended component. Network-based detection is a primary component of SIEM packages. 4624  E.2.5 Behavioral Anomaly Detection 4625  Behavioral anomaly detection (BAD) systems compare the current state of an environment with 4626  a baseline to detect abnormal activity. This baseline is used to detect anomalous events to be 4627  investigated further. This could be unusual network traffic such as large amounts of data 4628  transferred, new ports/protocols, or new connections between devices. Unusual activity on an 4629  endpoint may include excessive processor usage, logins outside of work hours, or new processes. 4630  The detectable events are dependent on the sensor capabilities of the specific implementation. 4631  Some BAD systems utilize artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to 4632  automatically update the baseline model. By automating the process of updating the baseline, the 4633  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  204  BAD system is able to maintain knowledge of normal activity even as the environment evolves 4634  over time. This ultimately reduces false positive detections, improving incident response 4635  capability. 4636  E.2.6 Data Loss Prevention (DLP) 4637  DLP is a collection of tools built to improve the confidentiality of sensitive data on a network. 4638  DLP is often marketed as a feature set within SIEM that actively monitors both data at rest to 4639  prevent unauthorized access and data in transit to prevent unauthorized extraction. In cases 4640  where DLP is unable to prevent the data loss, it can still alert the organization to a breach. 4641  E.2.7 Deception Technology 4642  A deception technology uses decoy data and/or devices placed across the network to lure 4643  attackers away from legitimate assets. Decoys can range from access credentials and files to 4644  complete endpoints. When a threat actor interacts with a decoy, it triggers an alarm to alert cyber 4645  defenders to its presence. Defenders can then choose to further monitor the adversary for 4646  intelligence or immediately mitigate the threat. Because decoys do not actively interact with 4647  other network components, deception technologies can support malicious activity monitoring 4648  and detection without jeopardizing the controlled process.  4649  E.2.8 Digital Twins 4650  A digital twin is a digital replica of a physical system or component. They can be deployed 4651  within OT environments as a tool for anomaly detection. The digital twin utilizes real-time 4652  sensor inputs and compares them using heuristics and algorithms (including machine learning) 4653  against a baseline model. Operational anomalies detected by digital twins most often indicate a 4654  maintenance or failure situation. However, a detected operational anomaly could indicate an 4655  advanced cyber attack which has bypassed other security mechanisms and otherwise would have 4656  gone undetected. 4657  E.3 Data Security 4658  Various data security technologies assist information owners in protecting the confidentiality, 4659  integrity, and availability of their data. OT network owners are encouraged to identify the critical 4660  files and data residing in their networks and implement data security technologies to mitigate 4661  risk.  4662  E.3.1 Backup Storage 4663  Backup storage is an alternative file storage location where copies of critical files are stored and 4664  protected to assist with recovery should the originals be lost, compromised, or unusable. Using 4665  backup tools and procedures is fundamental to ensuring the availability of critical data within an 4666  OT network environment. Based on risk, backup plans should specify which files require 4667  backup, how often they should be backed up, the number of copies to be made, the location of 4668  the backup (e.g., offline, offsite) and how long backup copies should be kept. Various solutions 4669  exist that automate backup storage of critical data on a regular basis. 4670  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  205  E.3.2 Immutable Storage 4671  Immutable storage is a special type of backup storage that provides additional data integrity 4672  through data storage in a read-only format. Immutable storage can be used to store backups of 4673  programs or device configurations. It can also be used as a read-only drive in a maintenance 4674  workstation for added protection against installation of new software. 4675  E.3.3 File Hashing 4676  Integrity of critical files such as program logic can be validated by using hashes. A hashing 4677  algorithm calculates a fixed-size string from a file’s contents. If a hash is calculated and stored 4678  for a critical file when it is first created, the integrity of the file can be checked later by 4679  calculating the hash again. For example, if an end user needs to restore functionality to a device 4680  by returning it to a baseline, the integrity of the baseline files can first be validated by 4681  recomputing the file hash. If a different hash is calculated for a target file, the data owner can 4682  assume the backup files have been compromised. Many data backup software systems include 4683  hashing within their feature set. NIST-approved hash algorithms are specified in FIPS 180-4, 4684  Secure Hash Standard [FIPS180] and FIPS 202, SHA-3 Standard [FIPS202]. 4685  E.3.4 Digital Signatures 4686  Digital signatures are an additional data integrity measure. They are the electronic analogue of a 4687  written signature providing assurance that the claimed signatory signed the information, and that 4688  the information was not modified following signature. FIPS 186-4, Digital Signature Standard 4689  (DSS) [FIPS186] specifies three NIST-approved digital signature algorithms: DSA, RSA, and 4690  ECDSA. 4691  E.3.5 Block Ciphers 4692  Asset owners can protect the confidentiality of data at rest using block ciphers. Block ciphers are 4693  algorithms that encrypt data in block-sized chunks rather than one bit at a time. This is beneficial 4694  when encrypting large amounts of data at once. NIST-approved block ciphers are Advanced 4695  Encryption Standard (AES) and Triple Data Encryption Standard (DES). AES is specified in 4696  FIPS 197, Advanced Encryption Standard [FIPS197]. Triple DES is specified in NIST SP 800-4697  67 Rev. 2, Recommendation for the Triple Data Encryption Algorithm Block Cipher [SP800-67]. 4698  E.3.6 Remote Access 4699  When accessing systems or data remotely, security controls should be implemented to prevent 4700  unauthorized access to the organization’s networks, systems, and data. A virtual private network 4701  (VPN) is a set of technologies and protocols designed to support secure remote access to network 4702  environments. A VPN can provide both strong authentication and encryption to secure 4703  communication data by establishing a private network that operates as an overlay on a public 4704  infrastructure. The most common types of VPN technologies implemented today are: 4705   Internet Protocol Security (IPsec). IPsec supports two encryption modes: transport and 4706  tunnel. Transport mode encrypts only the data portion (payload) of each packet while 4707  leaving the packet header untouched. The more secure tunnel mode adds a new header to 4708  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  206  each packet and encrypts both the original header and the payload. On the receiving side, 4709  an IPsec-compliant device decrypts each packet. See NIST SP 800-77 Rev. 1, Guide to 4710  IPsec VPNs for more information. 4711   Transport Layer Security (TLS). Sometimes referred to by the legacy terminology of 4712  Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), TLS provides a secure channel between two machines that 4713  encrypts the contents of each packet. TLS is most often recognized for securing HTTP 4714  traffic; this protocol implementation is known as HTTP Secure (HTTPS). However, TLS 4715  is not limited to HTTP traffic; it can be used to secure many application-layer programs. 4716  For more information, see NIST SP 800-52 Rev. 2, Guidelines for the Selection, 4717  Configuration, and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) Implementations. 4718   Secure Shell (SSH). SSH is a command interface and protocol for securely gaining 4719  access to a remote computer. It is widely used by network administrators to remotely 4720  control Linux-based servers. SSH is a secure alternative to a telnet application. SSH is 4721  included in most UNIX distributions and is typically added to other platforms through a 4722  third-party package. 4723  When implemented with diligence, remote access technologies can improve an organization’s 4724  capability. There are several options for remote access and desktop control including Remote 4725  Desktop Protocol (RDP), screens, and other standalone packages. If remote technologies are not 4726  managed properly using vulnerability and patch management, these connections serve as another 4727  channel for an adversary to exploit. 4728  4729  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-77r1 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-77r1 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-52r2 https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-52r2  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  207  Appendix F—OT Overlay 4730  Note to Readers 4731  The OT overlay is a partial tailoring of the controls and control baselines in SP 800-53 Rev. 5 4732  and adds supplementary guidance specific to OT. The concept of overlays is discussed in 4733  Appendix C of SP 800-53B. The OT overlay is intended to be applicable to all OT systems in all 4734  industrial sectors. Further tailoring can be performed to add specificity to a particular sector (e.g., 4735  pipeline, energy). Ultimately, an overlay may be produced for a specific system (e.g., the XYZ 4736  company).  4737  This OT overlay constitutes supplemental guidance and tailoring for SP 800-53 Revision 5. 4738  Please be sure you are looking at the correct version of SP 800-53. Duplicating Appendix F of 4739  SP 800-53 would increase the size of this publication significantly. Therefore, the drafting 4740  committee has decided to not duplicate Appendix F here. The reader should have SP 800-53 4741  Revision 5 available.  4742  The authoring team also considered that this OT overlay may serve as a model for other 4743  overlays. Feedback on this Appendix’s structure would be appreciated, especially on the level of 4744  abstraction and whether the examples provided in the supplemental guidance are 4745  sufficient/beneficial for implementation. 4746  Overlays provide a structured approach to help organizations tailor control baselines and develop 4747  specialized security plans that can be applied to specific mission/business functions, 4748  environments of operation, and/or technologies. This specialization approach is important as the 4749  number of threat-driven controls and control enhancements in the catalog increases and 4750  organizations develop risk management strategies to address their specific protection needs 4751  within defined risk tolerances. 4752  A repository of overlays may be found at https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/risk-management/sp800-4753  53-controls/overlay-repository. This overlay may be referenced as the NIST SP 800-82 Revision 4754  3 Operational Technology Overlay (“NIST SP 800-82 Rev 3 OT Overlay”). It is based on NIST 4755  SP 800-53 Revision 5 [SP800-53r5]. 4756  NIST developed this overlay in furtherance of its statutory responsibilities under the Federal 4757  Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014 (Public Law 113-283) [FISMA], 4758  Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD-21) [PPD-21], and Executive Order 13636 [EO13636]. 4759  NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, 4760  for providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets, but such 4761  standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems without the express 4762  approval of appropriate federal officials exercising policy authority over such systems. 4763  F.1 Overlay Characteristics 4764  OT encompasses a broad range of programmable systems and devices that interact with the 4765  physical environment (or manage devices that interact with the physical environment). These 4766  systems/devices detect or cause a direct change through the monitoring and/or control of devices, 4767  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/risk-management/sp800-53-controls/overlay-repository https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/risk-management/sp800-53-controls/overlay-repository  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  208  processes, and events. Examples include industrial control systems, building automation systems, 4768  transportation systems, physical access control systems, physical environment monitoring 4769  systems, and physical environment measurement systems. 4770  ICS consists of combinations of control components (e.g., electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, 4771  pneumatic) that act together to achieve an objective (e.g., manufacturing, transportation of matter 4772  or energy). The part of the system primarily concerned with producing an output is referred to as 4773  the process. The control part of the system includes the specification of the desired output or 4774  performance. Control can be fully automated or may include a human in the loop. 4775  Section 2 provides an overview of various OT systems such as Supervisory Control and Data 4776  Acquisition (SCADA), Distributed Control Systems (DCS), Programmable Logic Controllers 4777  (PLCs), Building Automation Systems (BAS), Physical Access Control Systems (PACS), and 4778  the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). 4779  F.2 Applicability 4780  The purpose of this overlay is to provide guidance for securing OT systems. This overlay has 4781  been prepared for use by federal agencies. It may be used by nongovernmental organizations on 4782  a voluntary basis. 4783  Privacy is a risk consideration for OT systems. For additional guidance, refer to the NIST 4784  Privacy Framework [PF]. The application of privacy in OT will depend on sector and 4785  organizational risks; therefore, controls exclusively related to privacy have not been included in 4786  this OT overlay. Each organization will need to independently determine applicability. All 4787  controls and control enhancements that only appear in the privacy baseline have been removed 4788  from this OT overlay according to this rationale. 4789  F.3 Overlay Summary 4790  Table 22 provides a summary of the controls and control enhancements from NIST SP 800-53 4791  Rev. 5, Appendix F [SP800-53r5] that have been allocated to the initial control baselines (i.e., 4792  Low, Moderate, and High) along with indications of OT Discussion and OT tailoring. The table 4793  uses the following conventions: 4794   Bold indicates controls and control enhancements with OT Discussions. 4795   Underline indicates that this overlay has added a control to the baseline, supplemental to 4796  the baselines provided in NIST SP 800-53B. 4797   Strikethrough indicates that a control or control enhancement has been removed from this 4798  baseline, compared to the baselines provided in NIST SP 800-53B. 4799  In the following example, OT Discussion was added to Control Enhancement 1 of AU-4 4800  (bolded). In addition, Control Enhancement 1 of AU-4 was added to the Low, Moderate (Mod), 4801  and High baselines (underlined), compared with the NIST 800-53B baseline which did not 4802  include AU-4 Control Enhancement 1. 4803  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  209  AU-4 Audit Storage Capacity AU-4 (1) AU-4 (1) AU-4 (1)  4804  Some controls and control enhancements are useful to many OT environments but are not 4805  applicable across all OT sectors or architectures.

Additionally, OT systems vary widely in 4814  their architecture and technology selection. The SP 800-53B control baselines were tailored for 4815  these general considerations, including addition of controls relevant for OT environments. 4816  Organizations can use this overlay as a starting point and further tailor controls to meet specific 4817  operational needs to address variability of OT systems.  4818  As organizations further tailor controls to meet their internal security requirements, limitations 4819  (e.g., technology, operational constraints, environmental considerations) may necessitate 4820  selecting compensating controls. Compensating controls in the OT environment may be required 4821  in situations where the OT cannot support certain controls or control enhancements, or the 4822  organization determines it is not advisable to implement controls or control enhancements due to 4823  potential adverse impacts to performance, safety, or reliability. Compensating controls are 4824  alternatives to a specific baseline control or enhancement that provide equivalent or comparable 4825  protection. For example, if controls or control enhancements require automated mechanisms 4826  which are not readily available, cost effective, or technically feasible in OT environments, 4827  compensating controls implemented through nonautomated mechanisms or procedures may be 4828  acceptable to meet the intent of the control. 4829  Compensating controls implemented in accordance with PL-11 from SP 800-53 Rev. 5 are not 4830  considered exceptions or waivers to the baseline controls; rather, they are alternative safeguards 4831  and countermeasures employed within the OT environment that accomplish the intent of the 4832  original controls that could not be effectively employed. See “Control Tailoring” in Section 3.3 4833  of SP 800-37 Rev. 2 [SP800-37r2].  4834  Using compensating controls may also include control enhancements that supplement the 4835  baseline. Using compensating controls typically involves a trade-off between additional risk and 4836  reduced functionality. Every use of compensating controls should involve a risk-based 4837  determination of how much residual risk to accept and how much functionality to reduce. 4838  Additionally, when compensating controls are employed, organizations should document the 4839  rationale describing: 4840   why the baseline control could not be implemented;  4841   how the compensating control(s) provide equivalent security capabilities for OT systems; and 4842   the risk acceptance for any residual risk resulting from using the compensating control(s) 4843  instead of the baseline control. 4844  Organizational decisions on the use of compensating controls are documented in the security 4845  plan for the OT.  4846  Controls that contain assignments (e.g., Assignment: organization-defined conditions or trigger 4847  events) may be tailored out of the baseline. This is equivalent to assigning a value of “none.” The 4848  assignment may take on different values for different impact baselines. 4849  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  219  F.5 OT Communication Protocols 4850  The unique network properties within OT may warrant specific attention when applying certain 4851  controls. Many of the controls in NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 that pertain to communication, devices, 4852  and interfaces implicitly assume the applicability of network routing or communication between 4853  network segments or zones. Some devices, or subsystems, used in OT may be configured or 4854  architected in a way that may create an exception to this assumption. As a result, controls for 4855  devices that communicate using standards and protocols that do not include network addressing 4856  generally require tailoring. An RS-232 (serial) interface is an example of a non-network 4857  addressable or routable communication method that is commonly employed in OT equipment.  4858  F.6 Definitions 4859  Terms used in this overlay are defined in the CSRC glossary. 4860  F.7 Detailed Overlay Control Specifications 4861  This overlay is based on NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5, Security and Privacy Controls for Information 4862  Systems and Organizations [SP800-53r5], which provides a catalog of security and privacy 4863  controls, and NIST SP 800-53B, Control Baselines for Information Systems and Organizations 4864  [SP800-53B]. The controls are customizable and implemented as part of an organization-wide 4865  process that manages security and privacy risk. The controls address a diverse set of security and 4866  privacy requirements across the federal government and critical infrastructure, and are derived 4867  from legislation, Executive Orders, policies, directives, regulations, standards, and 4868  mission/business needs. The documents also describe how to develop specialized sets of 4869  controls, or overlays, tailored for specific types of missions/business functions, technologies, or 4870  environments of operation. Finally, the catalog controls address security from both a 4871  functionality perspective (the strength of security and privacy functions and mechanisms 4872  provided) and an assurance perspective (the measures of confidence in the implemented 4873  capability). Addressing both functionality and assurance helps to ensure that component products 4874  and the systems built from those products using sound system and security engineering 4875  principles are sufficiently trustworthy.  4876  In preparation for selecting and specifying the appropriate controls for organizational systems 4877  and their respective environments of operation, organizations first determine the criticality and 4878  sensitivity of the information to be processed, stored, or transmitted by those systems. This 4879  process is known as security categorization. FIPS 199 [FIPS199] enables federal agencies to 4880  establish security categories for both information and information systems. Other documents, 4881  such as those produced by ISA and CNSS, also provide guidance for defining low, moderate, and 4882  high levels of security based on impact. The security categories are based on the potential impact 4883  on an organization or on people (employees and/or the public) should certain events occur which 4884  jeopardize the information and systems needed by the organization to accomplish its assigned 4885  mission, such as protecting its assets, fulfilling its legal responsibilities, maintaining its day-to-4886  day functions, and protecting individuals’ safety, health, and life. Security categories are to be 4887  used in conjunction with vulnerability and threat information in assessing the risk to an 4888  organization.  4889  https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  220  This overlay provides OT Discussion for the controls and control enhancements prescribed for a 4890  system or an organization designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its 4891  data and to meet a set of defined security requirements. Discussions for all controls and control 4892  enhancements in SP 800-53 Rev. 5, Chapter 3 should be used in conjunction with the OT 4893  Discussions in this overlay. This overlay contains a tailoring of the control baselines; its 4894  specification may be more stringent or less stringent than the original control baseline 4895  specification. It can be applied to multiple systems. This overlay is high-level, applicable to all 4896  OT environments; it may be used as the basis for more specific overlays. Use cases for specific 4897  systems in specific environments may be separately published (e.g., as a NISTIR). 4898  Figure 22 uses the AU-4 control as an example of the format and content of the detailed overlay 4899  control specifications. 4900   Control number and title 4901   Column for control and control enhancement number 4902   Column for control and control enhancement name 4903   Columns for baselines.

Figure 22: Detailed Overlay Control Specifications Illustrated 4915  F.7.1 ACCESS CONTROL – AC 4916  Tailoring Considerations for the Access Control Family 4917  Before implementing controls in the AC family, consider the tradeoffs among security, privacy, 4918  latency, performance, throughput, and reliability. For example, the organization considers 4919  whether latency induced from the use of confidentiality and integrity mechanisms employing 4920  cryptographic mechanisms would adversely impact the operational performance of the OT. 4921  In situations where the OT cannot support the specific Access Control requirements of a control, 4922  the organization employs compensating controls in accordance with the general tailoring 4923  guidance. Examples of compensating controls are given with each control, as appropriate. 4924  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  222  AC-1 ACCESS CONTROL POLICY AND PROCEDURES 4925  CNTL  NO.

Inspection of message content may enforce information 4966  flow policy. For example, industrial OT protocols may be restricted using inbound and outbound 4967  traffic rules on a network control device between OT and IT networks. For non-routable 4968  communication such as serial connections, devices may be configured to limit commands to and 4969  from specific tags within the OT device. Information flow policy may be supported by labeling 4970  or coloring physical connectors to aid in connecting networks. Devices that do not have a 4971  business need to communicate should not be connected (i.e., air gapped). 4972  Control Enhancement: (4) No OT discussion for this control. 4973  AC-5 SEPARATION OF DUTIES 4974  CNTL  NO.

Compensating controls 5029  could include limiting remote access to a specified period of time or placing a call from the OT 5030  site to the authenticated remote entity. 5031  Control Enhancement: (2) OT Discussion: Encryption-based technologies should be used to 5032  support the confidentiality and integrity of remote access sessions. While OT devices often lack 5033  the ability to support modern encryption, additional devices (e.g., VPNs) can be added to support 5034  these features. This control should not be confused with SC-8 – Transmission Confidentiality 5035  and Integrity, which discusses confidentiality and integrity requirements for general 5036  communications, including between OT devices. 5037  Control Enhancement: (3) OT Discussion: Example compensating controls include connection-5038  specific manual authentication of the remote entity. 5039  Control Enhancement: (4) (10) No OT Discussion for this control. 5040  Control Enhancement: (9) OT Discussion: Implementation of the remote access disconnect 5041  should not impact OT operations. OT personnel should be trained on how to use the remote 5042  access disconnect. 5043  Rationale for adding AC-17 (9) to LOW, MOD and HIGH baselines: As more OT systems 5044  become accessible remotely, the capability to disconnect or disable remote access is critical to 5045  manage risk. Disconnect of remote access may be required to provide stable and safe operations. 5046  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  228  Rationale for adding AC-17 (10) to MOD and HIGH baselines: The ability to authenticate remote 5047  commands is important to prevent unauthorized commands that may have immediate or serious 5048  consequences such as injury, death, property damage, loss of high-value assets, failure of 5049  mission or business functions, or compromise of sensitive information. 5050  AC-18 WIRELESS ACCESS 5051  CNTL  NO.

There are some scenarios where devices and users cannot all be 5056  authenticated and encrypted due to operational or technology constraints. In such scenarios, 5057  compensating controls include providing increased auditing for wireless access, limiting wireless 5058  access privileges to key personnel, or using AC-18 (5) to reduce the boundary of wireless access. 5059  Control Enhancement: (3) (4) No OT Discussion for this control. 5060  Control Enhancement: (5) Availability and interference for wireless signals may be a concern 5061  within OT environments. Antennas and power levels should be designed to overcome and 5062  achieve availability goals. Where confidentiality is concerned, antennas and power levels can 5063  also be designed to minimize signal exposure outside of the facility. 5064  AC-19 ACCESS CONTROL FOR MOBILE DEVICES  5065  CNTL  NO.

An organization may 5069  consider a system to be external if that system performs different functions, implements different 5070  policies, falls under different management authorities, or does not provide sufficient visibility 5071  into the implementation of controls to allow the establishment of a satisfactory trust relationship. 5072  For example, an OT system and a business data processing system may be considered external to 5073  each other depending on the organization’s system boundaries.  5074  Access to an OT for support by a business partner, such as a vendor or support contractor, is 5075  another common example. The definition and trustworthiness of external systems is reexamined 5076  with respect to OT functions, purposes, technology, and limitations to establish a clearly 5077  documented technical or business case for use and an acceptance of the risk inherent in the use of 5078  an external system.  5079  Control Enhancement: (1) (2) No OT Discussion for this control.  5080  AC-21 INFORMATION SHARING 5081  CNTL  NO.

The organization ensures that the assessment 5178  does not affect system operation or result in unintentional system modification. If assessment 5179  activities must be performed on the production OT, it may need to be taken off-line before an 5180  assessment can be conducted, or the assessment should be scheduled to occur during planned OT 5181  outages whenever possible.  5182  Control Enhancement: (1) No OT Discussion on this control.  5183  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  236  Control Enhancement: (2) OT Discussion: The organization conducts risk analysis to support 5184  selection of an assessment target (e.g., the live system, an off-line replica or lab system). 5185  CA-3 INFORMATION EXCHANGE 5186  CNTL  NO.

CONTROL NAME  Control Enhancement Name  CONTROL BASELINES  LOW MOD HIGH  CA-7 Continuous Monitoring Select Select Select  CA-7 (1) CONTINUOUS MONITORING | INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT  Select Select  CA-7 (4) CONTINUOUS MONITORING | RISK MONITORING Select Select Select  OT Discussion: Continuous monitoring programs for OT are designed, documented, and 5205  implemented with input from OT personnel. The organization ensures that continuous 5206  monitoring does not interfere with OT functions. The individual/group designing and conducting 5207  the continuous monitoring for the OT systems implements monitoring consistent with the 5208  organizational information security policies and procedures, the OT security policies and 5209  procedures, and the specific health, safety, and environmental risks associated with a particular 5210  facility and/or process. Continuous monitoring can be automated or manual at a frequency 5211  sufficient to support risk-based decisions. For example, the organization may determine for 5212  lower-risk, isolated systems to monitor event logs manually on a specified frequency less often 5213  than for higher-risk, networked systems. 5214  Control Enhancement: (1) (4) No OT Discussion for this control. 5215  CA-8 PENETRATION TESTING  5216  CNTL  NO.  CONTROL NAME  Control Enhancement Name  CONTROL BASELINES  LOW MOD HIGH  CA-8 Penetration Testing  Select  CA-8 (1) PENETRATION TESTING | INDEPENDENT PENETRATION TESTING AGENT OR  TEAM  Remove  OT Discussion: Penetration testing is used with care on OT networks to ensure that OT functions 5217  are not adversely impacted by the testing process. In general, OT systems are highly sensitive to 5218  timing constraints and have limited resources. Example compensating controls include 5219  employing a replicated, virtualized, or simulated system to conduct penetration testing. 5220  Production OT may need to be taken off-line before testing can be conducted. If OT systems are 5221  taken off-line for testing, tests are scheduled to occur during planned OT outages whenever 5222  possible. If penetration testing is performed on non-OT networks, extra care is taken to ensure 5223  that tests do not propagate into the OT network. 5224  Rationale for removing CA-8 (1) from HIGH baseline: Specific expertise is necessary to conduct 5225  effective penetration testing on OT systems; it may not be feasible to identify independent 5226  personnel with the appropriate skillset/knowledge to perform penetration testing on an OT 5227  environment. While an independent penetration test agent/team is recommended, it may not be 5228  feasible for all high-impact OT systems. 5229  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  238  CA-9 INTERNAL SYSTEM CONNECTIONS 5230  CNTL  NO.

The 5232  AO fully understands the potential risks associated with approving individual connections or 5233  approving a class of components to be connected. As an example, the AO may broadly approve 5234  the connection of any sensors limited to 4 to 20 milliamp (mA) communication, while other 5235  connection types (e.g., serial or ethernet) require individual approval. Decisions to accept risk are 5236  documented. 5237  F.7.5 CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT – CM 5238  Tailoring Considerations for the Configuration Management Family  5239  In situations where the OT cannot be configured to restrict the use of unnecessary functions or 5240  cannot support the use of automated mechanisms to implement configuration management 5241  functions, the organization employs nonautomated mechanisms or procedures as compensating 5242  controls in accordance with the general tailoring guidance.

The ability to test backups is often dependent on resources, such as 5349  the availability of spare devices and testing equipment, needed to appropriately represent the 5350  environment. Testing backup and restoration on OT is often limited to systems with redundancy 5351  or spare equipment; in certain cases, sampling will be limited to those redundant systems. 5352  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  246  Compensating controls may include alternative methods for testing backups such as hash or 5353  checksum validations. 5354  Control Enhancement: (3) (5) (8) No OT Discussion for this control. 5355  CP-10 SYSTEM RECOVERY AND RECONSTITUTION 5356  CNTL  NO.

For certain OT, 5392  the capability for immediate operator interaction is critical. Local emergency actions for OT are 5393  not hampered by identification or authentication requirements. Access to these systems may be 5394  restricted by appropriate physical controls. 5395  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  248  Control Enhancement: (1) (2) OT Discussion: As a compensating control, physical access 5396  restrictions may sufficiently represent one authentication factor, provided the system is not 5397  remotely accessible. 5398  Control Enhancement: (5) OT Discussion: For local access, physical access controls and logging 5399  may be used as an alternative to individual authentication on an OT system. For remote access, 5400  the remote access authentication mechanism will be used to identify, permit, and log individual 5401  access before permitting use of shared accounts. 5402  Control Enhancement: (8) No OT Discussion for this control. 5403  Control Enhancement: (12) OT Discussion: The acceptance of PIV credentials is only required 5404  for federal organizations, as defined by OMB Memorandum M-19-17 [OMB-M1917]. Non-5405  federal organizations should refer to IA-2 (1) (2) for guidance on multi-factor authentication 5406  credentials.

It is encouraged to leverage existing organizational systems (i.e., HR or IT 5449  processes) to perform this control. 5450  Control Enhancement: (1) OT Discussion: Maintenance, Engineering, or third-party 5451  organizations may require OT access in order to support operations. The organization should 5452  determine the AO for proving identity prior to allowing access to the OT environment. Consider 5453  obtaining supervisor or sponsor authorization, where the sponsor may be someone within 5454  operations. 5455  Control Enhancement: (2) (3) (4) (5) OT Discussion: If the organization already performs these 5456  controls, it is recommended to leverage existing organizational processes. For example, Human 5457  Resources may provide a system for tracking identity evidence. OT does not need to develop an 5458  independent system for achieving this control. Rather, it is advised to leverage the existing 5459  processes developed by other departments within the organization. 5460  Rationale for adding IA-12 (1) to HIGH baseline: A supervisor or sponsor should be made aware 5461  of any access an employee has to the OT environment, since unauthorized or accidental access 5462  could create consequences to the physical process. 5463  F.7.8 INCIDENT RESPONSE - IR 5464  Tailoring Considerations for the Incident Response Family 5465  The automated mechanisms used to support the tracking of security incidents are typically not 5466  part of, or connected to, the OT. 5467  IR-1 POLICY AND PROCEDURES 5468  CNTL  NO.

This may include active scanning, passive monitoring, or 5786  compensating controls, depending on the system being scanned. For example, vulnerability 5787  examination may be performed using passive monitoring and manual visual inspection to 5788  maintain an up-to-date inventory of assets. That inventory can be cross-referenced against a list 5789  of known vulnerabilities (e.g., CISA advisories and NIST NVD). Production may need to be 5790  taken off-line before active scans can be conducted. Scans are scheduled to occur during planned 5791  OT outages whenever possible. If vulnerability scanning tools are used on adjacent non-OT 5792  networks, extra care is taken to ensure that they do not mistakenly scan the OT network. 5793  Automated network scanning is not applicable to non-routable communications such as serial 5794  networks. Compensating controls include providing a replicated or simulated system for 5795  conducting scans or host-based vulnerability applications.  5796  Control Enhancement: (2) (5) No OT Discussion for this control. 5797  Control Enhancement: (4) OT Discussion: Examples of discoverable information in OT could 5798  include information about key personnel or technical information relating to systems and 5799  configurations.

Organizations identify alternative methods to continue 5873  supported operation of such system components and consider additional compensating controls 5874  to mitigate against known threats and vulnerabilities to unsupported system components.  5875  F.7.17 SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION - SC 5876  Tailoring Considerations for the System and Communications Protection Family  5877  The use of cryptography is determined after careful consideration of the security needs and the 5878  potential ramifications on system performance. For example, the organization considers whether 5879  latency induced from the use of cryptography would adversely impact the operational 5880  performance of the OT. While the legacy devices commonly found within OT often lack direct 5881  support of cryptographic functions, compensating controls (e.g., encapsulations) may be used to 5882  meet the intent of the control. 5883  In situations where the OT cannot support the specific System and Communications Protection 5884  requirements of a control, the organization employs compensating controls in accordance with 5885  the general tailoring guidance. Examples of compensating controls are given with each control as 5886  appropriate. 5887  SC-1 POLICY AND PROCEDURES  5888  CNTL  NO.

Subnets should be considered along with other 5918  boundary protection technologies. 5919  Rationale for adding SC-7 (18) to MOD baseline: The ability to choose the failure mode for the 5920  physical part of the OT differentiates the OT from other IT systems. This choice may be a 5921  significant influence in mitigating the impact of a failure. 5922  Rationale for adding SC-7 (28) to LOW, MOD and HIGH baselines: Access to OT should be 5923  restricted to individuals required for operation. A connection made from the OT directly to a 5924  public network has limited applicability in OT environments, but significant potential risk. 5925  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  283  Rationale for adding SC-7 (29) to LOW, MOD and HIGH baselines: In OT environments, 5926  subnets and zoning is a common practice for isolating functions.  5927  SC-8 TRANSMISSION CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY 5928  CNTL  NO.

CONTROL NAME  Control Enhancement Name  SUPPLEMENTED  CONTROL BASELINES  LOW MOD HIGH  SC-24 Fail in Known State  Add Select  OT Discussion: The organization selects an appropriate failure state. Preserving OT state 5965  information includes consistency among OT state variables and the physical state which the OT 5966  represents (e.g., whether valves are open or closed, communication permitted or blocked, 5967  continue operations). 5968  Rationale for adding SC-24 to MOD baseline: As part of the architecture and design of the OT, 5969  the organization selects an appropriate failure state of an OT in accordance with the function 5970  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  286  performed by the OT and the operational environment. The ability to choose the failure mode for 5971  the physical part of OT differentiates OT systems from other IT systems. This choice may be a 5972  significant influence in mitigating the impact of a failure, since it may be disruptive to ongoing 5973  physical processes (e.g., valves failing in closed position may adversely affect system cooling). 5974  SC-28 PROTECTION OF INFORMATION AT REST 5975  CNTL  NO.  CONTROL NAME  Control Enhancement Name  CONTROL BASELINES  LOW MOD HIGH  SC-28 Protection of Information at Rest  Select Select  SC-28 (1) PROTECTION OF INFORMATION AT REST |CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION  Select Select  OT Discussion: The use of cryptographic mechanisms is implemented only after careful 5976  consideration and after verification that it does not adversely impact the operational performance 5977  of the OT. Cryptographic mechanisms may not be feasible on certain OT devices. In these cases, 5978  compensating controls may be relocating the data to a location that does support cryptographic 5979  mechanisms. 5980  Control Enhancement: (1) No OT Discussion for this control. 5981  SC-32 SYSTEM PARTITIONING 5982  CNTL  NO.

CONTROL NAME  Control Enhancement Name  SUPPLEMENTED  CONTROL BASELINES  LOW MOD HIGH  SC-45 System Time Synchronization Add Add Add  SC-45 (1) SYSTEM TIME SYNCHRONIZATION | SYNCHRONIZATION WITH AUTHORITATIVE  TIME SOURCE  OT Discussion: Organizations coordinate time synchronization on OT to allow for accurate 5994  troubleshooting and forensics.  5995  Control Enhancement: (1) OT Discussion: Syncing with an authoritative time source may be 5996  selected as a control when data is being correlated across organizational boundaries. OT employ 5997  suitable mechanisms (e.g., GPS, IEEE 1588) for time stamps. 5998  Rationale for adding SC-45 to LOW, MOD and HIGH baselines: Organizations may find relative 5999  system time beneficial for many OT systems to ensure safe, reliable delivery of essential 6000  functions. Time synchronization can also make root cause analysis more efficient by ensuring 6001  audit logs from different systems are aligned so that, when the logs are aggregated, organizations 6002  have an accurate view of events across multiple systems. 6003  SC-47 ALTERNATE COMMUNICATIONS PATHS  6004  CNTL  NO.  CONTROL NAME  Control Enhancement Name  SUPPLEMENTED  CONTROL BASELINES  LOW MOD HIGH  SC-47 Alternate Communications Paths  Add  OT Discussion: Organization considers which systems require alternate communications paths to 6005  ensure a loss of communication does not lead to an unacceptable loss of view, control, or safety 6006  event. 6007  Rationale for adding SC-47 to HIGH baseline: For continuity of operations during an incident, 6008  organizations should consider establishing alternate communications paths for command-and-6009  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  288  control purposes to continue to operate and take appropriate actions for high-impact systems 6010  where the loss of availability or integrity may result in severe or catastrophic adverse impact, 6011  which may include impacts on safety and critical service delivery. 6012  SC-51 HARDWARE-BASED PROTECTION  6013  CNTL  NO.  CONTROL NAME  Control Enhancement Name  SUPPLEMENTED  CONTROL BASELINES  LOW MOD HIGH  SC-51 Hardware-Based Protection  OT Discussion: Some OT systems support write-protection by implementing physical key 6014  switches or write-protect switches. Organizations define the systems for which write-protection 6015  will be enabled and develop a process for how to take the system out of write-protect mode. 6016  F.7.18 SYSTEM AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY - SI 6017  Tailoring Considerations for the System and Information Integrity Family  6018  In situations where the OT cannot support the specific System and Information Integrity 6019  requirements of a control, the organization employs compensating controls in accordance with 6020  the general tailoring guidance. Examples of compensating controls are given with each control, 6021  as appropriate. 6022  SI-1 POLICY AND PROCEDURES  6023  CNTL  NO.

CONTROL NAME  Control Enhancement Name  CONTROL BASELINES  LOW MOD HIGH  SI-2 Flaw Remediation Select Select Select  SI-2 (2) FLAW REMEDIATION | AUTOMATED FLAW REMEDIATION STATUS  Select Select  OT Discussion: Flaw remediation, or patching, is complicated since many OT employ OSs and 6027  other software no longer maintained by the vendors. OT operators may also not have the 6028  resources or capability to test patches and are dependent on vendors to validate the operability of 6029  a patch. Sometimes the organization has no choice but to accept additional risk if no vendor 6030  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  289  patch is available, patching requires additional time to complete validation/testing, or 6031  deployment requires an unacceptable operations shutdown. In these situations, compensating 6032  controls should be implemented (e.g., limiting the exposure of the vulnerable system, restricting 6033  vulnerable services, implementing virtual patching). Other compensating controls that do not 6034  decrease the residual risk but increase the ability to respond may be desirable (e.g., provide a 6035  timely response in case of an incident; devise a plan to ensure the OT can identify the 6036  exploitation of the flaw). Testing flaw remediation in an OT may exceed the organization’s 6037  available resources. 6038  Control Enhancement: (2) No OT discussion for this control. 6039  SI-3 MALICIOUS CODE PROTECTION 6040  CNTL  NO.  CONTROL NAME  Control Enhancement Name  CONTROL BASELINES  LOW MOD HIGH  SI-3 Malicious Code Protection Select Select Select  OT Discussion: The use and deployment of malicious code protection is determined after careful 6041  consideration and after verification that it does not adversely impact the operation of the OT. 6042  Malicious code protection tools should be configured to minimize their potential impact on the 6043  OT (e.g., employ notification rather than quarantine). Example compensating controls include 6044  increased traffic monitoring and auditing.  6045  SI-4 SYSTEM MONITORING 6046  CNTL  NO.

CONTROL NAME  Control Enhancement Name  SUPPLEMENTED  CONTROL BASELINES  LOW MOD HIGH  SI-13 Predictable Failure Prevention  Add  No OT Discussion for this control. 6101  NIST SP 800-82r3 ipd  GUIDE TO OT SECURITY  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  293  Rationale for adding SI-13 control to HIGH baseline: OT are designed and built with certain 6102  boundary conditions, design parameters, and assumptions about their environment and mode of 6103  operation. OT may run much longer than conventional systems, allowing latent flaws to become 6104  effective that are not manifest in other environments. For example, integer overflow might never 6105  occur in systems that are re-initialized more frequently than the occurrence of the overflow. 6106  Experience and forensic studies of anomalies and incidents in OT can lead to identification of 6107  emergent properties that were previously unknown, unexpected, or unanticipated. Preventative 6108  and restorative actions (e.g., restarting the system or application) are prudent but may not be 6109  acceptable for operational reasons in OT. 6110  SI-16 MEMORY PROTECTION 6111  CNTL  NO.

The importance of cyber security in Europe is evidenced by the recent proposals of President Juncker in his  State of the Union Address on the 13th September 2017, the publication of the new European cyber  security strategy 2017 and the Cybersecurity Act1, the Commission’s proposal for the new and  strengthened EU Cybersecurity Agency ENISA (the European Union Agency for Network and Information  Security) which includes a proposal for regulating certification. On this basis it is clear that our political  leaders are committed to building the future wealth of the EU by leveraging the opportunities of the  Digital Society.  However, in the last few years, there have been many new developments in the cyber world. We continue  to witness the digitalisation of our daily lives, the development of new technologies, new threats and new  stakeholders. The words cyber security, cyber warfare, cyber espionage, cyber terrorism and cyber defence  are becoming increasing referred to daily discourse by our citizens and politicians.2 Some new concepts  that have emerged in the last few years include fake news, cyber ethics, cyber diplomacy and digital  sovereignty.  From a technical perspective, we have new technologies changing the cyber landscape. The Internet of  Things/ Internet of people is now being deployed with an estimated 20 Billion devices expected to be  deployed before 2020. Robots, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain technologies are emerging as  disruptive technologies and are beginning to affect our daily lives. New technologies can produce benefits  as well as security challenges, as is the case with cryptocurrencies, on which ENISA published an opinion  paper earlier this year.3 Traditional approaches to security will have to be modified in order to cope with  issues of scalability and modified timelines.  In 2016, the EU Cyber Security Market was estimated at €20.1bn and compares favourably with the  cybersecurity market of other global regions. The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of the EU market  however is 6%, whereas the average growth rate is around 8%, and is growing slower than all other major  regions.4  Before we explore the way forward we need to reflect on some specific examples as to why cyber security  is becoming an increasing challenge for our society.  We see an increase in monetisation of cyber crime, crime as a service and of targeted attacks. Targeted  attacks, like ransomware, have entered the top ENISA 2016 cyber threats. According to ENISA Threat  1 European Commission, Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on ENISA, the \"EU  Cybersecurity Agency\", and repealing Regulation (EU) 526/2013, and on Information and Communication Technology  cybersecurity certification (''Cybersecurity Act''), COM(2017) 477, available at: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2017:477:FIN  2 ENISA, ENISA Overview of Cyber Security and Related Terminology, October 2017, available at:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/enisa-overview-of-cybersecurity-and- related-terminology  3 ENISA, ENISA Opinion Paper on Cryptocurrencies in the EU, September 2017, available at:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/enisa-opinion-paper-on- cryptocurrencies-in-the-eu  4 ENISA, Cybersecurity as an Economic Enabler, 2016, available at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa- position-papers-and-opinions/cybersecurity-as-an-economic-enabler  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2017:477:FIN http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2017:477:FIN https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/enisa-overview-of-cybersecurity-and-related-terminology https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/enisa-overview-of-cybersecurity-and-related-terminology https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/enisa-opinion-paper-on-cryptocurrencies-in-the-eu https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/enisa-opinion-paper-on-cryptocurrencies-in-the-eu https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/cybersecurity-as-an-economic-enabler https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/cybersecurity-as-an-economic-enabler  Security Challenges and best practices in the IoT Environment  European Parliament, Brussels  |  7th November 2017  03  landscape5, in 2016, ransomware was the primary element for the manifestation of monetization of the  activities of cyber-criminals, with an estimated loss of one billion US $ for the entire year 2016. More  recently, the ransomware campaign, which became known as the WannaCry Outburst, caused chaos due  to its massive distribution, affecting more than 150 countries and infecting over 230,000 systems6. Next to  ransomware, information theft are the main areas of ‘malware innovation’ in 2016. Targets affected  included political organisations and democratic institutions7.  We become more aware that our rights online, including our democracy, are at risk. The scandal of  hacked emails8 in the US election in 2016 and the measures taken in Europe to prevent interference to  elections9, 10, 11 cannot be ignored and are other examples that show us that there is more to be done to  address the continuously changing landscape of threats and challenges in cyber space.  Small devices that sometimes we even forget that they are connected to Internet serve and are used to  build very large cyber attacks affecting targeted businesses and infrastructures. In October 2016, the  Mirai botnet compromised IoT devices and household routers..12  An upgraded variant of the malware targeted13 Deutsche Telekom Voice over IP Routers14 and almost one  million landline subscribers lost service on Sunday 26 November 2016 in Germany. Cases are documented  and described where life was considered to be at risk because normal emergency telephone calls were not  accessible This raises the question of who is liable in such events.  Cyber space can be used for sabotage, espionage and warfare. Hybrid warfare (adding cyberwarfare to  conventional and unconventional warfare tools) is evolving without necessary using the words ‘war’ in  describing the attacks. Some countries are already taking steps to combat these threats15.

The message is clear – unless Europe substantially improves its approach to cyber security the risk of a  significant impact on our lives continues to increase. However, cybersecurity should not only be seen as  a negative obstacle but as an opportunity to promote a new generation of products and services that are  made and or delivered in Europe with security by design as a central component to the products and  services.  It is proposed that this goal will be achieved in a number of ways.  Firstly, by the strengthening of the European Union Agency for network and Information Security (ENISA).  The proposal from the Commission which is now being considered by the Council and the Parliament  proposes to increase the financial and human resources of the Agency in order to put the Agency in a  stronger position to support Member States, EU institutions, businesses and citizens in achieving a higher  level of cyber security. The Network and Information Security Directive (NISD) which comes into force next  year, places requirements on Operators of essential services and Digital Service Providers to have  minimum level of cyber security in their networks and to report on certain levels of incidents so that the  EU industry and service sectors can learn from the experiences and to avoid similar incidents.  It is proposed that ENISA with its greater resources will be better positioned to have a stronger role in  policy development and implementation including helping the Member States meet the requirements of  the NISD. It is also proposed that ENISA will act as a focal point for information and knowledge sharing and  play an important role in both operational and crisis management across the EU. In addition, the proposal  to organise annual cyber exercises should enhance the European preparedness to manage cyber incidents.  Secondly  As Europe strives towards a single cybersecurity market there is a need to build trust and confidence into  the digital products and devices that are being used. To achieve this ambition an EU cybersecurity  certification framework is being proposed where ENISA would be at the heart of the framework. It is  proposed that this policy will result in products and services being put on the market that will be certified  and provide the necessary assurance to their users that the products and services are fit for purpose. The  EU framework should bring a clear benefit for producers and service providers in that they will only need  to be certified in one Member State so as to be made available in the entire EU market. This approach  should increase speed to market, reduce the financial burdens of achieving national certification in each  Member State and facilitate standardisation across the EU market.  This approach draws on an analogy from the telecommunications market developed in the 1990’s where  once there were many different mobile phone standards operating across the EU, which did not allow for  interoperability when citizens crossed borders. Today, Europe has the GSM mobile phone standards  implemented in all member states and where users can cross borders seamlessly and obtain service in a  16 Council of the EU, Cyber attacks: EU ready to respond with a range of measures, including sanctions, 19/06/2017,  available at:  http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2017/06/19/cyber-diplomacy-toolbox/  17 Schmitt, Michael N., ed.

The success of the GSM standardised process put Europe in the lead globally for the  provision of cross border mobile telecommunications services.  Given the complexity of the market, it is proposed that this framework is voluntary and would build on  existing national certification schemes. It is also proposed to subdivide the market into a number of areas  to include  1. critical and high risk areas  2. widely deployed digital products and  3. low cost mass market products such as the Internet of Things (IoT).  While some concerns have been expressed by some Member States in relation to this proposal, that there  are existing schemes in place to meet the needs of the market, I believe that none of the few existing  international (like common criteria) or national schemes serve the full 28 member states and that Europe  needs to push forward for a European solution for all of Europe. I believe there is a compromise solution  where some very sensitive equipment that are designed for national use only could be managed by way of  an exception to this framework, while most products and services are manufactured or delivered with the  intention of reaching the 500 million EU citizens and the global export market. With this approach, I  believe that Europe should immediately address the widely used and mass-market goods and services that  need to be certified and realise the economic opportunity as well as the confidence and trust building that  this certification framework will bring.  Most importantly, there is a chance to build up a new European, globally standardised and accepted,  Ecosystem of Certification Labs which will for the benefit of the European Citizens increase significantly the  IT security of products and services.  In the long term, the question of regulating product liability will stay, as the Mirai or WannaCry cases have  shown. Certification is a start to build a trustworthy Cyberspace. My message is: take the Cybersecurity Act  as a chance to increase IT security based on a voluntary and marked driven approach.  Turning more specifically to the IoT environment, ENISA, the EU cyber security agency, has been working  for some time in identifying security threats and risks in the Internet of Things and on providing  recommendations to strengthen its security. ENISA has already provided recommendations on securing:   Smart homes;19   Smart cars and autonomous driving;20   Smart hospitals and eHealth;21   Smart cities and intelligent public transport;22   Smart airports;23  19 ENISA, Security and Resilience of Smart Home Environments, December 2015, available at:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-resilience-good-practices  20 ENISA, Cyber Security and Resilience of Smart Cars, January 2017, available at:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-security-and-resilience-of-smart-cars  21 ENISA, Cyber Security and Resilience for Smart Hospitals, November 2016, available at:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-security-and-resilience-for-smart-hospitals  22 ENISA, Architecture Model of the Transport Sector in Smart Cities, January 2016, available at:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/smart-cities-architecture-model  23 ENISA, Securing Smart Airports, December 2016, available at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/securing- smart-airports  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-resilience-good-practices https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-security-and-resilience-of-smart-cars https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-security-and-resilience-for-smart-hospitals https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/smart-cities-architecture-model https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/securing-smart-airports https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/securing-smart-airports  Security Challenges and best practices in the IoT Environment  European Parliament, Brussels  |  7th November 2017  06   Smart grids.24  The IoT world will result in everything being connected everywhere. And it needs to be secure.  There are numerous challenges and issues concerning the security of the Internet of Things. We are  witnesses to rapid technological developments in the area. We have not so far witnessed equally  responsive efforts in terms of regulation, certification or standardization. Consumer Internet of Things  devices are usually low-cost, with security being seen not as a necessity but as an added-value service by  many developers and manufacturers alike. It is thus a market-driven ecosystem, where security and safety  are not seen as the main drivers.  Standard security techniques and practices need to be reconsidered in the light of Internet of Things due  to its inherent particularities. Consider the case of security updates. We have recently witnessed an  enormous ransomware campaign targeting computing systems. The most significant recommendation  provided by ENISA was to update the software on their computers. But when talking about the Internet of  Things, how would such updates be enforced? Smart locks, light bulbs and home appliances, connected  and autonomous cars, smart medical devices. How can we be sure that all of these smart devices are  always up-to-date in terms of security?  The existing security issues and concerns over the Internet of Things should not be seen as a hindering  factor for its deployment and the grasping of the numerous associated benefits. From these challenges,  opportunities arise that will lead to secure, safe and prosperous deployments of Internet of Things across  Europe and the world.  The European Union has two fundamental pieces of legislation to assist in this direction. The Network and  Information Security Directive (NISD) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The special  intricacies of the Internet of Things need to be carefully examined in light of the legislation.  Clarifications and possible extensions and/or amendments might be necessary in order to achieve the goal  of security and privacy of the Internet of Things.  In order to identify solutions ENISA has set up an Internet of Things Security Expert Group that aims at  delivering initial advice to the Commission and the MS by the end of 2017 through its active engagement in  this year’s activities.  Along with select semiconductor industry representatives, ENISA has published a common position paper  on cybersecurity25 calling for minimum security requirements for connected devices and has been  encouraging the development of mandatory staged requirements for security and privacy in the IoT.  ENISA is also in the process of defining baseline security measures for the Internet of Things in critical  information infrastructures.  Despite these efforts, there are a number of outstanding issues that need to be addressed. These include:  24 ENISA, Communication Network Interdependencies in Smart Grids, January 2016, available at:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/communication-network-interdependencies-in-smart-grids  25 ENISA, Infineon – NXP – STMicroelectronics – ENISA Common Position on Cybersecurity, December 2016, available  at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/infineon-nxp-st-enisa-position-on- cybersecurity  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/communication-network-interdependencies-in-smart-grids https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/infineon-nxp-st-enisa-position-on-cybersecurity https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/infineon-nxp-st-enisa-position-on-cybersecurity  Security Challenges and best practices in the IoT Environment  European Parliament, Brussels  |  7th November 2017  07   Addressing he question of legal liability in the context of the Internet of Things   Addressing security in all stages of the life cycle of products and services. Accordingly, there is a  need to develop a harmonized scheme and define baseline security requirements to ensure and  promote security in the Internet of Things.   The NISD and GDPR have to be implemented and interpreted in light of the features of the  Internet of Things.   Standardization and certification of Internet of Things are lagging behind demand.   Holistic approaches are needed due to the diverse nature of the IoT.   Raising awareness in regard to Internet of Things security is a fundamental first step forward.   The delivery of ethics by design in the world of the IoT  The consideration of ethics by design is a more recent concept. As technology is deployed increasingly  closer to humans, Artificial Intelligence and Robotics will undoubtedly lead to societal changes of great  magnitude across the spectrum of human activities. The Treaty on European Union (aka Lisbon Treaty) sets  the legal framework for our core values and principles in Europe. There is a clear need to protect our  fundamental rights, which includes freedom of expression, personal data and privacy. Emerging /  disruptive technologies are now raising new challenges and there is a need to interpret existing legislation  in the context of these new technologies.  Imminent commercialization of autonomous systems (i.e. robots) and Artificial Intelligence are competing  to deliver many functions until now reserved for humans. Software now needs to address and needs to be  programmed to make the same decisions as humans have done for centuries.  Where humans are held responsible for their decisions and actions in a court of law the next generation of  robotics and autonomous machines, which will be executing the actions of tomorrow, will have to be  examined in a different way. An example of a possible difficult decision is how an autonomous driving  vehicle would be programmed to react to a potential head on collision with another vehicle.  Will the  vehicle maintain its path or will it swerve to avoid a collision but potentially putting other road users at  risk? These technology developments raise questions about software liability and how liability will be  addressed in this type of situation or when software is compromised by malware, which is subject to  exploiting a vulnerability or a deliberate sabotage of the software.  The European Parliament, together with the EU institutions, MS, civil society and industry need to work  together, to address these type of challenges and put in place policies to ensure that our economy is ready  to embrace these emerging technologies and benefit from the economic and social opportunities from the  deployment of IoT.  In summary, the world of interconnected objects brings with it many new opportunities but also new risks.  Our job is to maximise the opportunities whilst keeping the risks under control. In this speech, I have  outlined some actions that need to be undertaken in order to achieve this goal. As the EU cybersecurity  agency, ENISA will support this process and will work together with policy makers and industry to make  sure that cybersecurity is an enabler of, and not a barrier to economic progress.

In October 2016, the  Mirai botnet compromised IoT devices and household routers..12  An upgraded variant of the malware targeted13 Deutsche Telekom Voice over IP Routers14 and almost one  million landline subscribers lost service on Sunday 26 November 2016 in Germany. Cases are documented  and described where life was considered to be at risk because normal emergency telephone calls were not  accessible This raises the question of who is liable in such events.  Cyber space can be used for sabotage, espionage and warfare. Hybrid warfare (adding cyberwarfare to  conventional and unconventional warfare tools) is evolving without necessary using the words ‘war’ in  describing the attacks. Some countries are already taking steps to combat these threats15.

The message is clear – unless Europe substantially improves its approach to cyber security the risk of a  significant impact on our lives continues to increase. However, cybersecurity should not only be seen as  a negative obstacle but as an opportunity to promote a new generation of products and services that are  made and or delivered in Europe with security by design as a central component to the products and  services.  It is proposed that this goal will be achieved in a number of ways.  Firstly, by the strengthening of the European Union Agency for network and Information Security (ENISA).  The proposal from the Commission which is now being considered by the Council and the Parliament  proposes to increase the financial and human resources of the Agency in order to put the Agency in a  stronger position to support Member States, EU institutions, businesses and citizens in achieving a higher  level of cyber security. The Network and Information Security Directive (NISD) which comes into force next  year, places requirements on Operators of essential services and Digital Service Providers to have  minimum level of cyber security in their networks and to report on certain levels of incidents so that the  EU industry and service sectors can learn from the experiences and to avoid similar incidents.  It is proposed that ENISA with its greater resources will be better positioned to have a stronger role in  policy development and implementation including helping the Member States meet the requirements of  the NISD. It is also proposed that ENISA will act as a focal point for information and knowledge sharing and  play an important role in both operational and crisis management across the EU. In addition, the proposal  to organise annual cyber exercises should enhance the European preparedness to manage cyber incidents.  Secondly  As Europe strives towards a single cybersecurity market there is a need to build trust and confidence into  the digital products and devices that are being used. To achieve this ambition an EU cybersecurity  certification framework is being proposed where ENISA would be at the heart of the framework. It is  proposed that this policy will result in products and services being put on the market that will be certified  and provide the necessary assurance to their users that the products and services are fit for purpose. The  EU framework should bring a clear benefit for producers and service providers in that they will only need  to be certified in one Member State so as to be made available in the entire EU market. This approach  should increase speed to market, reduce the financial burdens of achieving national certification in each  Member State and facilitate standardisation across the EU market.  This approach draws on an analogy from the telecommunications market developed in the 1990’s where  once there were many different mobile phone standards operating across the EU, which did not allow for  interoperability when citizens crossed borders. Today, Europe has the GSM mobile phone standards  implemented in all member states and where users can cross borders seamlessly and obtain service in a  16 Council of the EU, Cyber attacks: EU ready to respond with a range of measures, including sanctions, 19/06/2017,  available at:  http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2017/06/19/cyber-diplomacy-toolbox/  17 Schmitt, Michael N., ed.

The success of the GSM standardised process put Europe in the lead globally for the  provision of cross border mobile telecommunications services.  Given the complexity of the market, it is proposed that this framework is voluntary and would build on  existing national certification schemes. It is also proposed to subdivide the market into a number of areas  to include  1. critical and high risk areas  2. widely deployed digital products and  3. low cost mass market products such as the Internet of Things (IoT).  While some concerns have been expressed by some Member States in relation to this proposal, that there  are existing schemes in place to meet the needs of the market, I believe that none of the few existing  international (like common criteria) or national schemes serve the full 28 member states and that Europe  needs to push forward for a European solution for all of Europe. I believe there is a compromise solution  where some very sensitive equipment that are designed for national use only could be managed by way of  an exception to this framework, while most products and services are manufactured or delivered with the  intention of reaching the 500 million EU citizens and the global export market. With this approach, I  believe that Europe should immediately address the widely used and mass-market goods and services that  need to be certified and realise the economic opportunity as well as the confidence and trust building that  this certification framework will bring.  Most importantly, there is a chance to build up a new European, globally standardised and accepted,  Ecosystem of Certification Labs which will for the benefit of the European Citizens increase significantly the  IT security of products and services.  In the long term, the question of regulating product liability will stay, as the Mirai or WannaCry cases have  shown. Certification is a start to build a trustworthy Cyberspace. My message is: take the Cybersecurity Act  as a chance to increase IT security based on a voluntary and marked driven approach.  Turning more specifically to the IoT environment, ENISA, the EU cyber security agency, has been working  for some time in identifying security threats and risks in the Internet of Things and on providing  recommendations to strengthen its security. ENISA has already provided recommendations on securing:   Smart homes;19   Smart cars and autonomous driving;20   Smart hospitals and eHealth;21   Smart cities and intelligent public transport;22   Smart airports;23  19 ENISA, Security and Resilience of Smart Home Environments, December 2015, available at:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-resilience-good-practices  20 ENISA, Cyber Security and Resilience of Smart Cars, January 2017, available at:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-security-and-resilience-of-smart-cars  21 ENISA, Cyber Security and Resilience for Smart Hospitals, November 2016, available at:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-security-and-resilience-for-smart-hospitals  22 ENISA, Architecture Model of the Transport Sector in Smart Cities, January 2016, available at:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/smart-cities-architecture-model  23 ENISA, Securing Smart Airports, December 2016, available at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/securing- smart-airports  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-resilience-good-practices https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-security-and-resilience-of-smart-cars https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-security-and-resilience-for-smart-hospitals https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/smart-cities-architecture-model https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/securing-smart-airports https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/securing-smart-airports  Security Challenges and best practices in the IoT Environment  European Parliament, Brussels  |  7th November 2017  06   Smart grids.24  The IoT world will result in everything being connected everywhere. And it needs to be secure.  There are numerous challenges and issues concerning the security of the Internet of Things. We are  witnesses to rapid technological developments in the area. We have not so far witnessed equally  responsive efforts in terms of regulation, certification or standardization. Consumer Internet of Things  devices are usually low-cost, with security being seen not as a necessity but as an added-value service by  many developers and manufacturers alike. It is thus a market-driven ecosystem, where security and safety  are not seen as the main drivers.  Standard security techniques and practices need to be reconsidered in the light of Internet of Things due  to its inherent particularities. Consider the case of security updates. We have recently witnessed an  enormous ransomware campaign targeting computing systems. The most significant recommendation  provided by ENISA was to update the software on their computers. But when talking about the Internet of  Things, how would such updates be enforced? Smart locks, light bulbs and home appliances, connected  and autonomous cars, smart medical devices. How can we be sure that all of these smart devices are  always up-to-date in terms of security?  The existing security issues and concerns over the Internet of Things should not be seen as a hindering  factor for its deployment and the grasping of the numerous associated benefits. From these challenges,  opportunities arise that will lead to secure, safe and prosperous deployments of Internet of Things across  Europe and the world.  The European Union has two fundamental pieces of legislation to assist in this direction. The Network and  Information Security Directive (NISD) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The special  intricacies of the Internet of Things need to be carefully examined in light of the legislation.  Clarifications and possible extensions and/or amendments might be necessary in order to achieve the goal  of security and privacy of the Internet of Things.  In order to identify solutions ENISA has set up an Internet of Things Security Expert Group that aims at  delivering initial advice to the Commission and the MS by the end of 2017 through its active engagement in  this year’s activities.  Along with select semiconductor industry representatives, ENISA has published a common position paper  on cybersecurity25 calling for minimum security requirements for connected devices and has been  encouraging the development of mandatory staged requirements for security and privacy in the IoT.  ENISA is also in the process of defining baseline security measures for the Internet of Things in critical  information infrastructures.  Despite these efforts, there are a number of outstanding issues that need to be addressed. These include:  24 ENISA, Communication Network Interdependencies in Smart Grids, January 2016, available at:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/communication-network-interdependencies-in-smart-grids  25 ENISA, Infineon – NXP – STMicroelectronics – ENISA Common Position on Cybersecurity, December 2016, available  at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/infineon-nxp-st-enisa-position-on- cybersecurity  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/communication-network-interdependencies-in-smart-grids https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/infineon-nxp-st-enisa-position-on-cybersecurity https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/infineon-nxp-st-enisa-position-on-cybersecurity  Security Challenges and best practices in the IoT Environment  European Parliament, Brussels  |  7th November 2017  07   Addressing he question of legal liability in the context of the Internet of Things   Addressing security in all stages of the life cycle of products and services. Accordingly, there is a  need to develop a harmonized scheme and define baseline security requirements to ensure and  promote security in the Internet of Things.   The NISD and GDPR have to be implemented and interpreted in light of the features of the  Internet of Things.   Standardization and certification of Internet of Things are lagging behind demand.   Holistic approaches are needed due to the diverse nature of the IoT.   Raising awareness in regard to Internet of Things security is a fundamental first step forward.   The delivery of ethics by design in the world of the IoT  The consideration of ethics by design is a more recent concept. As technology is deployed increasingly  closer to humans, Artificial Intelligence and Robotics will undoubtedly lead to societal changes of great  magnitude across the spectrum of human activities. The Treaty on European Union (aka Lisbon Treaty) sets  the legal framework for our core values and principles in Europe. There is a clear need to protect our  fundamental rights, which includes freedom of expression, personal data and privacy. Emerging /  disruptive technologies are now raising new challenges and there is a need to interpret existing legislation  in the context of these new technologies.  Imminent commercialization of autonomous systems (i.e. robots) and Artificial Intelligence are competing  to deliver many functions until now reserved for humans. Software now needs to address and needs to be  programmed to make the same decisions as humans have done for centuries.  Where humans are held responsible for their decisions and actions in a court of law the next generation of  robotics and autonomous machines, which will be executing the actions of tomorrow, will have to be  examined in a different way. An example of a possible difficult decision is how an autonomous driving  vehicle would be programmed to react to a potential head on collision with another vehicle.  Will the  vehicle maintain its path or will it swerve to avoid a collision but potentially putting other road users at  risk? These technology developments raise questions about software liability and how liability will be  addressed in this type of situation or when software is compromised by malware, which is subject to  exploiting a vulnerability or a deliberate sabotage of the software.  The European Parliament, together with the EU institutions, MS, civil society and industry need to work  together, to address these type of challenges and put in place policies to ensure that our economy is ready  to embrace these emerging technologies and benefit from the economic and social opportunities from the  deployment of IoT.  In summary, the world of interconnected objects brings with it many new opportunities but also new risks.  Our job is to maximise the opportunities whilst keeping the risks under control. In this speech, I have  outlined some actions that need to be undertaken in order to achieve this goal. As the EU cybersecurity  agency, ENISA will support this process and will work together with policy makers and industry to make  sure that cybersecurity is an enabler of, and not a barrier to economic progress.

This type of attack is usually launched  through e-mail messages, appearing to be sent from a reputable  source, with the intention of persuading the user to open a  malicious attachment or follow a fraudulent URL. A targeted form of  phishing called ‘spear phishing’ relies on upfront research on the victims  so that the scam appears more authentic, thereby, making it one of the  most successful types of attack on enterprises’ networks. 1  An emotional response justifies many people actions when they are  phished and is exactly what hackers are looking for. In a training context,  that is what a phishing simulation should try to achieve. Training e-mail  users is one of the often used measures for preventing phishing, but  results are not convincing since threat actors are constantly changing  their modus operandi. The domain-based message authentication,  reporting, and conformance (DMARC) standard ensures that e-mail from  fraudulent domains is blocked, diminishing the rate of success of  phishing, spoofing and spam   attacks.  In the future, e-mail continues to be the number one mechanism for  phishing but not for long. We are already seeing an increase in the use of  social media messaging, WhatsApp and others to conduct attacks. The  most relevant change will be in the methods used to send the messages,  which will become more sophisticated with the adoption of adversarial  Artificial Intelligence (AI) to prepare and send the messages. Phishing and  spear phishing are major attack vectors of other threats such as  unintentional insider threats   .  2  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/etl-review-folder/etl-2020-spam https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/etl-review-folder/etl-2020-insider-threat  3  __Findings  26.2_billion of losses in 2019 with Business  E-mail Compromise (BEC) attacks20  42,8%_of all malicious attachments were  Microsoft Office documents25  667%_increase in phishing scams in only 1  month during the COVID-19 pandemic6  30%_of phishing messages were delivered  on Mondays29  32,5%_of all the e-mails used the  keyword ‘payment’ in the e-mail subject28  4  Kill chain  Reconnaissance Weaponisation Delivery Exploitation  Step of Attack Workflow  Width of Purpose  Phishing  5  Installation Command &  Control  Actions on  Objectives  MORE INFORMATION  The Cyber Kill Chain® framework was developed by  Lockheed Martin, adapted from a military concept related  with the structure of an attack. To study a particular attack  vector, use this kill-chain diagram to map each step of the  process and reference the tools, techniques and  procedures used by the attacker.  https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html  6  Trends  According to some projections, phishing attacks targeting software-as-a-  service (SaaS) and webmail services surpassed those against payment  services for the first time in Q1 2019, making them the most targeted  sector at 36% of all phishing attacks. 2 This new record follows the trend in  2018 when SaaS and webmail services had just overtaken the financial  sector 3 . Although the figure had dropped to 30,8% by the end of 2019, the  services mentioned above still remained at the top of the list 2,3  , with  Microsoft 365 services being the phishers’ top target. 4  _Most targeted types of services are  webmail and software-as-a-service  _Business Email Compromise (BEC)  attacks continued to be a problem  A recent study identified that 88% of worldwide organisations  experienced spear phishing attacks and 86% of them faced BEC attacks. 16  In 2019, one of the most targeted service was Microsoft 365 and the main  focus was on harvesting credentials. 17  Once these credentials had been  acquired, the attacker was able to collect more organisational data, a  process that could last for weeks or months18 and could then lead to  spear-phishing attacks. The attacker would impersonate an employee,  chief executive officer (CEO) or even a trusted supplier to divert funds or  re-route payments to third-party accounts. 14  In Q1 2019, companies were  targeted by BEC attacks 120% more frequently than a year earlier 19 ,  resulting in losses as high as US $26,2 billion (ca. €22,2 billion). 20  7  34%  4%  4% 22%  22%  8% 6% SaaS/Web mail  Telecom  Cloud storage/File hosting  Payment  Financial institution  Social media  Ecommerce, retail  Phishing target attacks. Source: Proof Point 32  _More than two thirds of phishing sites  adopted HTTPS  There has been a steep increase 13  over the past few years in the number  of phishing sites that have adopted HTTPS. In the last quarter of 2019,  74% of phishing sites were using HTTPS 32 , a significant increase compared  with just 32% only 2 years earlier. Although technologies such as HTTPS  and SSL are designed to secure communications between a client and a  server, the presence of a lock in an icon at the browser’s address bar may  create the illusion that a website can be trusted.  Threat actors may also use legitimate sites they have hacked to host  phishing content, therefore making it challenging for the end-user to  identify a site as unsafe 14 . Other factors contributing to the steep rise in  HTTPS usage are the plethora of free certificate services such as Let’s  Encrypt 15  and the fact that modern browsers mark every HTTPS site as  secure, without any further checks.  These types of services are typically subscription-based or in the form of a  kit, available to download for a fee, and remove the technological barriers  to entry, as they allow a less technically skilled individual to carry out a  targeted attack. A report from a security researcher 21  identified 5.334  unique phishing kits available by June 2019. What was even more  concerning was the relatively low cost of these solutions, around US $50-  $80 for a monthly subscription. The same report declared that 87% of the  kits included evasion mechanisms such as HTML character encoding and  content encryption. Interestingly, some of these services were hosted on  legitimate cloud services with proper domain name system (DNS) names  and certificates. Statistics from just one of these dark-net marketplaces  show how successful these attacks are allowing the attacker or group to  steal around 65.000 accounts per month. 22  _Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS) on the rise  8  Trends   There was a change in the effectiveness of phishing attacks using cloud  storage, DocuSign, and Microsoft cloud services.   Impostor attacks include schemes like business e-mail compromise  (BEC) and identity deception techniques based on social engineering to  make phishing campaigns more effective.   Microsoft 365 services phishing was the top scheme, but the focus  remains on credential harvesting.   Over 99% of e-mails distributing malware required human intervention -  following links, opening documents, accepting security warnings, and  other behaviours - to be effective. 44  _Trends in incidents  9  __Top phishing themes in 2019   Generic Email Credential Harvesting   Office 365 Account Phishing   Financial Institution Phishing   Microsoft OWA Phishing   OneDrive Phishing   American Express Phishing   Chalbhai Generic Phishing   Adobe Account Phishing   Docusign Phishing   Netflix Phishing   Dropbox Account Phishing   LinkedIn Account Phishing   Apple Account Phishing   Postal/Shipping Company Phishing   Microsoft Online Document Phishing (Excel and Word)   Windows Settings Phishing   Google Drive Phishing   PayPal Phishing  Source: Proof Point 32  10  Trends  Cybercriminals are taking advantage of the public fear of the COVID-19  pandemic, which first appeared in late 2019. It has been reported that  phishing attacks involving the virus increased by 667% in a 1-month period  (between the end of February 2020 and the end of March 2020), and these  types of schemes alone represented a notable 2% of all phishing scams. 5  New scams involved phishing e-mails designed to look as if they originated  from the United States Centre of Disease Control (CDC) 6 , the World Health  Organisation 7 or even from university health teams  8 . They either falsely  claimed to showcases of infection in the victim’s area or shared medical  experts’ opinions to lure the victim to follow a malicious link. For this  reason, the FBI and WHO have issued warnings. 8,9  Because many people in  quarantine were working from home, often using outdated security  systems 11 , cybercriminals were seeking to exploit emerging opportunities  and vulnerabilities 12 .  _COVID-19 used as a phishing lure  Office 365 Phishing e-mail, credit Dropsuite 45  11  _ENISA’s response to the COVID-19  pandemic  The outbreak of COVID-19 has brought an immense change in the way we  conduct our lives. In this increasingly connected world, we can fortunately  continue our professional and private lives virtually. During this  unprecedented time, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) shared its  cybersecurity recommendations 46  on a variety of topics including working  remotely, shopping online, and e-health as well as providing updates on  key security advice tailored to the sectors affected. ENISA reviews the  threat landscape during the pandemic and produces advice on how to  mitigate the risks from the most critical threats. Special attention given to  phishing due to the escalation in the number of attacks.  ENISA YouTube video about COVID-19. Source ENISA  12  Incidents  The healthcare sector was heavily targeted by phishing (or spear-  phishing) attacks in 2019. A security researcher 42  considered phishing as  the main attack vector of the year, through the use of social engineering  tactics to deliver e-mails infected with malware   or with links pointing to  infected websites. Other sectors were also targeted by phishing attacks  such as governments and other public administration entities. For  example, in November and December 2019, several diplomats and  officials from the Ukrainian government received spear-phishing e-mails  directing then to compromised websites. 43  _Targeted sectors  _Attack vectors  Spear phishing remains an extremely prevalent initial access technique  used by malicious actors. These use a variety of social engineering tactics  to induce recipients to open attachments or navigate to a infected  website. Spear-phishing messages typically contain malicious macro-  enabled Microsoft Office documents, or a link to such documents. After a  user selects ‘Enable Content’, the embedded macro will typically begin  the execution of a chain of obfuscated scripts that ultimately results in  the download of stage one or dropper malware. JavaScript and  PowerShell appear to remain the most popular scripting languages for  this purpose.  etl-2020-malware  13  __Examples  _A phishing attack to Lancaster  University students’ resulted in the loss  of personal data37  _Hackers phished login credentials of  2500 Discord users38  _Online fitness service provider victim of  a phishing attack39  _Patients affected in UConn Health  phishing attack41  _A car manufacturer subsidiary lost US  $37 million (ca. €31 million) due to a BEC  scam33  _Proposed actions  14  Mitigation   Educate staff to identify fake and malicious e-mails and stay vigilant.  Launch simulated phishing campaigns to test organisation’s  infrastructure as well as the responsiveness of the staff.   Consider the use of a security e-mail gateway with regular (possibly  automated) maintenance of filters (anti-spam, anti-malware, policy-  based filtering).   Consider applying security solutions that use machine-learning  techniques to identify phishing sites in real-time.   Disable automatic execution of code, macros, rendering of graphics  and preloading mailed links at the mail clients and update them  frequently.   Implement one of the standards for reducing spam e-mails: SPF  (Sender Policy Framework) 34 , DMARC (Domain-based Message  Authentication, Reporting & Conformance) 35  and DKIM (Domain Keys  Identified Mail). 36   Ideally, use secure e-mail communication using digital signatures or  encryption, for critical financial transactions or when exchanging  sensitive information.   Implement fraud and anomaly detection at the network level for  both inbound and outbound e-mails.   Avoid clicking on random links, especially short links found in social  media.   Do not click on links or download attachments if you are not  absolutely confident about the source of an e-mail.  15   Avoid over-sharing personal information on social media, e.g.  duration of absence from office or home, flight information etc. as it  is actively used by threat actors to collect information about their  targets.   Check the domain name of the websites you visit for typos, especially  for sensitive websites, e.g. bank websites. Threat actors usually  register fake domains that look similar to legitimate ones and use  them to ‘phish’ their targets. Looking only for an HTTPS connection is  not enough.   Enable two-factor authentication whenever applicable to prevent  account takeovers.   Use a strong and unique password for every online service. Re-using  the same password for various services is a serious security issue and  should be avoided at all times. Using strong and unique credentials  for every online service limits the risk of a potential account takeover  to only the affected service. Using a password manager software will  make managing of the whole set of passwords easier.   When wiring money to an account, double-check the bank recipient’s  information through a different medium. Unencrypted and unsigned  e-mails should not be trusted, especially for sensitive use-cases such  as this.   Check how contact, registration, subscription and feedback forms  work on your website and add verification rules if necessary so that  they cannot be exploited by attackers.  16  References  1. “What Is Phishing?”.Cisco. https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/email-  security/what-is-phishing.html  2.  “Phishing Activity Trends Report Q1”. 2019.

    "original document": "ENISA ETL2020 - Phishing  From January 2019 to April 2020  Phishing ENISA Threat Landscape  Overview  Phishing is the fraudulent attempt to steal user data such as login  credentials, credit card information, or even money using social  engineering techniques. This type of attack is usually launched  through e-mail messages, appearing to be sent from a reputable  source, with the intention of persuading the user to open a  malicious attachment or follow a fraudulent URL. A targeted form of  phishing called ‘spear phishing’ relies on upfront research on the victims  so that the scam appears more authentic, thereby, making it one of the  most successful types of attack on enterprises’ networks. 1  An emotional response justifies many people actions when they are  phished and is exactly what hackers are looking for. In a training context,  that is what a phishing simulation should try to achieve. Training e-mail  users is one of the often used measures for preventing phishing, but  results are not convincing since threat actors are constantly changing  their modus operandi. The domain-based message authentication,  reporting, and conformance (DMARC) standard ensures that e-mail from  fraudulent domains is blocked, diminishing the rate of success of  phishing, spoofing and spam   attacks.  In the future, e-mail continues to be the number one mechanism for  phishing but not for long. We are already seeing an increase in the use of  social media messaging, WhatsApp and others to conduct attacks. The  most relevant change will be in the methods used to send the messages,  which will become more sophisticated with the adoption of adversarial  Artificial Intelligence (AI) to prepare and send the messages. Phishing and  spear phishing are major attack vectors of other threats such as  unintentional insider threats   .  2  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/etl-review-folder/etl-2020-spam https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/etl-review-folder/etl-2020-insider-threat  3  __Findings  26.2_billion of losses in 2019 with Business  E-mail Compromise (BEC) attacks20  42,8%_of all malicious attachments were  Microsoft Office documents25  667%_increase in phishing scams in only 1  month during the COVID-19 pandemic6  30%_of phishing messages were delivered  on Mondays29  32,5%_of all the e-mails used the  keyword ‘payment’ in the e-mail subject28  4  Kill chain  Reconnaissance Weaponisation Delivery Exploitation  Step of Attack Workflow  Width of Purpose  Phishing  5  Installation Command &  Control  Actions on  Objectives  MORE INFORMATION  The Cyber Kill Chain® framework was developed by  Lockheed Martin, adapted from a military concept related  with the structure of an attack. To study a particular attack  vector, use this kill-chain diagram to map each step of the  process and reference the tools, techniques and  procedures used by the attacker.  https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html  6  Trends  According to some projections, phishing attacks targeting software-as-a-  service (SaaS) and webmail services surpassed those against payment  services for the first time in Q1 2019, making them the most targeted  sector at 36% of all phishing attacks. 2 This new record follows the trend in  2018 when SaaS and webmail services had just overtaken the financial  sector 3 . Although the figure had dropped to 30,8% by the end of 2019, the  services mentioned above still remained at the top of the list 2,3  , with  Microsoft 365 services being the phishers’ top target. 4  _Most targeted types of services are  webmail and software-as-a-service  _Business Email Compromise (BEC)  attacks continued to be a problem  A recent study identified that 88% of worldwide organisations  experienced spear phishing attacks and 86% of them faced BEC attacks. 16  In 2019, one of the most targeted service was Microsoft 365 and the main  focus was on harvesting credentials. 17  Once these credentials had been  acquired, the attacker was able to collect more organisational data, a  process that could last for weeks or months18 and could then lead to  spear-phishing attacks. The attacker would impersonate an employee,  chief executive officer (CEO) or even a trusted supplier to divert funds or  re-route payments to third-party accounts. 14  In Q1 2019, companies were  targeted by BEC attacks 120% more frequently than a year earlier 19 ,  resulting in losses as high as US $26,2 billion (ca. €22,2 billion). 20  7  34%  4%  4% 22%  22%  8% 6% SaaS/Web mail  Telecom  Cloud storage/File hosting  Payment  Financial institution  Social media  Ecommerce, retail  Phishing target attacks. Source: Proof Point 32  _More than two thirds of phishing sites  adopted HTTPS  There has been a steep increase 13  over the past few years in the number  of phishing sites that have adopted HTTPS. In the last quarter of 2019,  74% of phishing sites were using HTTPS 32 , a significant increase compared  with just 32% only 2 years earlier. Although technologies such as HTTPS  and SSL are designed to secure communications between a client and a  server, the presence of a lock in an icon at the browser’s address bar may  create the illusion that a website can be trusted.  Threat actors may also use legitimate sites they have hacked to host  phishing content, therefore making it challenging for the end-user to  identify a site as unsafe 14 . Other factors contributing to the steep rise in  HTTPS usage are the plethora of free certificate services such as Let’s  Encrypt 15  and the fact that modern browsers mark every HTTPS site as  secure, without any further checks.  These types of services are typically subscription-based or in the form of a  kit, available to download for a fee, and remove the technological barriers  to entry, as they allow a less technically skilled individual to carry out a  targeted attack. A report from a security researcher 21  identified 5.334  unique phishing kits available by June 2019. What was even more  concerning was the relatively low cost of these solutions, around US $50-  $80 for a monthly subscription. The same report declared that 87% of the  kits included evasion mechanisms such as HTML character encoding and  content encryption. Interestingly, some of these services were hosted on  legitimate cloud services with proper domain name system (DNS) names  and certificates. Statistics from just one of these dark-net marketplaces  show how successful these attacks are allowing the attacker or group to  steal around 65.000 accounts per month. 22  _Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS) on the rise  8  Trends   There was a change in the effectiveness of phishing attacks using cloud  storage, DocuSign, and Microsoft cloud services.   Impostor attacks include schemes like business e-mail compromise  (BEC) and identity deception techniques based on social engineering to  make phishing campaigns more effective.   Microsoft 365 services phishing was the top scheme, but the focus  remains on credential harvesting.   Over 99% of e-mails distributing malware required human intervention -  following links, opening documents, accepting security warnings, and  other behaviours - to be effective. 44  _Trends in incidents  9  __Top phishing themes in 2019   Generic Email Credential Harvesting   Office 365 Account Phishing   Financial Institution Phishing   Microsoft OWA Phishing   OneDrive Phishing   American Express Phishing   Chalbhai Generic Phishing   Adobe Account Phishing   Docusign Phishing   Netflix Phishing   Dropbox Account Phishing   LinkedIn Account Phishing   Apple Account Phishing   Postal/Shipping Company Phishing   Microsoft Online Document Phishing (Excel and Word)   Windows Settings Phishing   Google Drive Phishing   PayPal Phishing  Source: Proof Point 32  10  Trends  Cybercriminals are taking advantage of the public fear of the COVID-19  pandemic, which first appeared in late 2019. It has been reported that  phishing attacks involving the virus increased by 667% in a 1-month period  (between the end of February 2020 and the end of March 2020), and these  types of schemes alone represented a notable 2% of all phishing scams. 5  New scams involved phishing e-mails designed to look as if they originated  from the United States Centre of Disease Control (CDC) 6 , the World Health  Organisation 7 or even from university health teams  8 . They either falsely  claimed to showcases of infection in the victim’s area or shared medical  experts’ opinions to lure the victim to follow a malicious link. For this  reason, the FBI and WHO have issued warnings. 8,9  Because many people in  quarantine were working from home, often using outdated security  systems 11 , cybercriminals were seeking to exploit emerging opportunities  and vulnerabilities 12 .  _COVID-19 used as a phishing lure  Office 365 Phishing e-mail, credit Dropsuite 45  11  _ENISA’s response to the COVID-19  pandemic  The outbreak of COVID-19 has brought an immense change in the way we  conduct our lives. In this increasingly connected world, we can fortunately  continue our professional and private lives virtually. During this  unprecedented time, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) shared its  cybersecurity recommendations 46  on a variety of topics including working  remotely, shopping online, and e-health as well as providing updates on  key security advice tailored to the sectors affected. ENISA reviews the  threat landscape during the pandemic and produces advice on how to  mitigate the risks from the most critical threats. Special attention given to  phishing due to the escalation in the number of attacks.  ENISA YouTube video about COVID-19. Source ENISA  12  Incidents  The healthcare sector was heavily targeted by phishing (or spear-  phishing) attacks in 2019. A security researcher 42  considered phishing as  the main attack vector of the year, through the use of social engineering  tactics to deliver e-mails infected with malware   or with links pointing to  infected websites. Other sectors were also targeted by phishing attacks  such as governments and other public administration entities. For  example, in November and December 2019, several diplomats and  officials from the Ukrainian government received spear-phishing e-mails  directing then to compromised websites. 43  _Targeted sectors  _Attack vectors  Spear phishing remains an extremely prevalent initial access technique  used by malicious actors. These use a variety of social engineering tactics  to induce recipients to open attachments or navigate to a infected  website. Spear-phishing messages typically contain malicious macro-  enabled Microsoft Office documents, or a link to such documents. After a  user selects ‘Enable Content’, the embedded macro will typically begin  the execution of a chain of obfuscated scripts that ultimately results in  the download of stage one or dropper malware. JavaScript and  PowerShell appear to remain the most popular scripting languages for  this purpose.  etl-2020-malware  13  __Examples  _A phishing attack to Lancaster  University students’ resulted in the loss  of personal data37  _Hackers phished login credentials of  2500 Discord users38  _Online fitness service provider victim of  a phishing attack39  _Patients affected in UConn Health  phishing attack41  _A car manufacturer subsidiary lost US  $37 million (ca. €31 million) due to a BEC  scam33  _Proposed actions  14  Mitigation   Educate staff to identify fake and malicious e-mails and stay vigilant.  Launch simulated phishing campaigns to test organisation’s  infrastructure as well as the responsiveness of the staff.   Consider the use of a security e-mail gateway with regular (possibly  automated) maintenance of filters (anti-spam, anti-malware, policy-  based filtering).   Consider applying security solutions that use machine-learning  techniques to identify phishing sites in real-time.   Disable automatic execution of code, macros, rendering of graphics  and preloading mailed links at the mail clients and update them  frequently.   Implement one of the standards for reducing spam e-mails: SPF  (Sender Policy Framework) 34 , DMARC (Domain-based Message  Authentication, Reporting & Conformance) 35  and DKIM (Domain Keys  Identified Mail). 36   Ideally, use secure e-mail communication using digital signatures or  encryption, for critical financial transactions or when exchanging  sensitive information.   Implement fraud and anomaly detection at the network level for  both inbound and outbound e-mails.   Avoid clicking on random links, especially short links found in social  media.   Do not click on links or download attachments if you are not  absolutely confident about the source of an e-mail.  15   Avoid over-sharing personal information on social media, e.g.  duration of absence from office or home, flight information etc. as it  is actively used by threat actors to collect information about their  targets.   Check the domain name of the websites you visit for typos, especially  for sensitive websites, e.g. bank websites. Threat actors usually  register fake domains that look similar to legitimate ones and use  them to ‘phish’ their targets. Looking only for an HTTPS connection is  not enough.   Enable two-factor authentication whenever applicable to prevent  account takeovers.   Use a strong and unique password for every online service. Re-using  the same password for various services is a serious security issue and  should be avoided at all times. Using strong and unique credentials  for every online service limits the risk of a potential account takeover  to only the affected service. Using a password manager software will  make managing of the whole set of passwords easier.   When wiring money to an account, double-check the bank recipient’s  information through a different medium. Unencrypted and unsigned  e-mails should not be trusted, especially for sensitive use-cases such  as this.   Check how contact, registration, subscription and feedback forms  work on your website and add verification rules if necessary so that  they cannot be exploited by attackers.  16  References  1. “What Is Phishing?”.Cisco. https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/email-  security/what-is-phishing.html  2.  “Phishing Activity Trends Report Q1”. 2019.
